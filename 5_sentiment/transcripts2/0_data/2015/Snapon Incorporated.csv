I'll start with the highlights of our fourth quarter and our year. I'll give you my perspective on the results, on the markets and on the progress we've made, then Aldo will move into a more detailed review of the financials. 
The results of our fourth quarter were encouraging with sales increase and profit gains across our businesses continuing our positive trend. We had opportunities and we had headwinds. We took advantage of those opportunities and we overcame the headwinds. The result was organic sales growth of 9.8%. If we include $5.7 million contribution from Pro-Cut and $21.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation, overall sales in the quarter were $857.4 million, a rise of 7.5%. Our EPS was $1.97, up 23.1% from the $1.60 in 2013, and that rise reflects an OpCo operating margin of 16.9%, an increase of 140 basis points. 
Financial service earnings of $42.2 million in the quarter were also up significantly, and the consolidated operating margin, including both Financial Services and opco reached 20.4%, an improvement of 190 basis points compared to the 18.5% of last year. 
Looking at our markets. The automotive repair-related segments continue to be favorable driven, of course, by expanding and aging car parts, and year-after-year technology changes, all driving demand for our product. The Tools Group and repair system and information or the RS&I group, took advantage with the volume growth by our van network and gains in OEM dealerships in independent repair shops confirming the progress. 
But we also had opportunities rooted in our expanding capabilities and product lineup for the critical industries and in growing physical strength in emerging markets, areas within this commercial and industrial or C&I group. Arenas that were challenged by a variety of headwinds, fluctuating currencies and macroeconomic turbulence in places like Eastern Europe, Japan, Indonesia and even the core of Western Europe.  Despite those challenges, C&I results were quite positive. Higher volumes and favorable trends continued in our industrialization division. Progress across a range of industries and range of specific operations, the quarter was a period of clear progress, adding to our growing strength in that region. 
Another feature of the quarter is that military activity was stronger. I think, if you've been listening to these calls, all of you know that, that critical segment has been quite turbulent. In fact, the way forward is still unclear, a significant level of budget uncertainty does remain, and it's difficult to predict the military environment for any extended period. However, in the last quarter, we did make the most of the available opportunities and registered considerable military growth. It added to C&I's positive trend. 
So to wrap up the broad discussion of the market, I'd summarize the situation as generally quite positive across our business. We'll always have headwinds. We do believe that no matter what the environment, we have the opportunity and the capability to advance our position. We'll continue to progress against challenges, along our runways for growth, enhancing the franchise channel, expanding Snap-on's presence in the garage, extending into critical industries and building on emerging markets. 
That strategic advancement, when coupled with the Snap-on value creation process of safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and rapid continuous improvement or RCI, drive a significant and ongoing positive trends and performance. And we believe that the results in the fourth -- first quarter and over the full year show just that. 
Speaking of full year, Snap-on's EPS in 2014 was $7.14, an increase of 20.4% from 2013. Driving those earnings was an opco operating margin of 16.3%, up 120 basis points. When we include the income from Financial Services of $149.1 million, which rolls the $23.4 million, the consolidated operating margin for the year was up [ph] 19.6%, was up 150 basis points. That performance came on sales of $3.3 billion, a 7.2% year-over-year increase that reflected primarily in our organic growth of 6.9%. 
In 2014, full year gains were achieved from every group, and the Tools Group, strength in van channel, with organic growth of 7.6% for the year. RS&I expanded reach with repair shop owners and manages, up 4.9% organically, and from the C&I group, growth in critical industries and progress in emerging markets, organic activity rising 25%.  All clear evidence of forward movement in the markets we serve. 
Now let's move to a discussion of the group in the quarter. In the C&I group, revenue in the quarter was up 5.3% from 2013 despite unfavorable foreign currency. For organic sales increased 9.9% from broad contributions across the businesses. The industrial division paced the progress, achieving double-digit gains in multiple critical industries. Encouragingly, SNA Europe posted a solid mid-single digit rise offsetting significant European headwinds, while the Asia/Pacific division recorded higher activity going in emerging markets overcoming the present difficulties surrounding Japan. 
From an earnings perspective, C&I income of $40.5 million increased $3.4 million compared to the prior year period and that represents an operating margin of 13.6%, a rise of 50 basis points versus 2013. 
C&I performance in the quarter is exemplified by SNA Europe. As I said, sales gains despite difficulties and profits up sharply again. RCI practiced over all those difficult days while the sales were falling. That effort's paying off, and we can see it in the SNA Europe numbers. 
C&I also advanced in penetrating critical industries. A particular note, I think, with -- or gains in power generation, railroads and the oil and gas sectors, and one product line has gained traction in these areas is our tools at high offering. Drop prevention systems, design for a variety of industries, and used to keep people safe and assets secure. The falling objects are the leading cause of accidents in the workplace, and a 3 pound tool falling from height can make quite an impact. In other words, don't get hit by a falling wrench. It sounds rudimentary, but it's a real workplace issue and a clear opportunity for Snap-on customer connection and innovation to provide unique solutions by ergonomically tethering our tools we provide our customers and engineer detachment systems, a productive and compliant solution, maintaining the functionalities that tools use at height but with safety. 
Like customer connection and solving these critical needs on oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico or in major power plants in the U.S. our industrial tools that height drop prevention system are making work safer and more productive for our customers perform critical tasks. 
The fourth quarter also brought -- saw growth in emerging markets of the C&I. China and India led the way for the double-digit growth in our Asia/Pacific division. And it's clear what's driving the progress. Growing physicals, more distributors, more field training, more Asianized products, product like our new GLS 2PF, the compact lift', or our new flexible -- our flexible the new aisle aligner system, both for the smaller footprint in Asia shops, and our expanding line of Blue-Point toolsets for the rising Asian vehicle repair market. Each quarter, each quarter, we believe we build more Snap-On Asia/Pacific strength, are better poised to continue our positive momentum and improve our position for the considerable repair wave really believe is coming in that emerging region. 
Finally, in C&I. Let me speak a moment about the evolution of our automated tool control system or ATC. You may remember that the ATC, we've spoken on often about on this call, is our total security and inventory management system that uses advanced digital imaging technology and proprietary software to automatically keep track of its critical tools. 
On the fourth quarter, the industrial vision reached the milestone. There are now over 1,000 ATC systems deployed and the number's growing. We started out aiming at aviation, at the aviation industry, but now through customer connection and innovation, we redesigned the product to accommodate the very tool configurations found in the natural resource and railroad industries. ATC systems are now solving problems for customers in both those segments and the momentum is building. ATC, an effective Snap-on concept, extended to our customers, helping drive C&I growth. 
Now on to the Tools Group, where we posted organic sales increase, an organic sales increase of 11.8%. The operating earnings of $63.9 million, representing a margin rate of 16.5%, up 200 basis point from last year. We often mention Snap-on runways for coherent growth, guiding principles for our long-term sales opportunities. What's always prominently included is enhancing the franchise channel while the results for the Tools Group in the quarter represent clear validation of the progress being made along that run way. 
But in addition to the financial performance, there's other evidence that authenticates the achievements. Snap-on continues to be recognized as a franchise of choice. Once again, Snap-on was ranked strength among the top 25 Entrepreneur Magazine -- Entrepreneur Magazine's list of top 500 franchises. And the Franchise Business Review, which measures franchisee satisfaction recognized Snap-on as a top 50 franchise in its latest tracking, marking the eighth consecutive year we received that award. 
And again, this quarter, like always, I had the opportunity to meet directly with franchisees. At the fall meetings of our U.S. and Canadian natural franchise advisory Council. And again on our recent kick off meetings across the country. Each of the sessions generated valuable insights, great feedback from an enthusiastic group of franchisees. 
Based on their optimism, I believe anyone interacting with these professionals would conclude our advanced network is stronger than ever before. 
The Tools Group success can also be traced to customer connection and innovation, essential parts of that Snap-on Value Creation. This is the Tools Group's fifth consecutive year for success of growth for successful product ideas derived from collaboration efforts with our franchisees, from discussions with the technicians or from the independent observations all of our associates. 
An example of that customer connection and innovation is our new introduced steering rack socket. The accepted technique for replacing a power steering overhangs required removal of the entire power steering rack assembly, followed by the use of a screwdriver and a hammer to change the old ring. The new Snap-on socket allows the tech to replace the old ring while the power steering assembly remains in place. It can save a full hour of labor, and it's a winning timesaver and I can tell you one advantage of the attention grabber. The steering rack socket is a clear example of Snap-on Value Creation. Customer connection and innovation, moving down from our run ways for improvement, providing the means for ongoing for an ongoing trajectory positive performance and the fourth quarter results for the Tools Group, our testimony, that is working. 
Sales in the fourth quarter were moving to RS&I, moving RS&I. Sales in the fourth quarter were $282.8 million, organic gains of 6.9%, primarily reflecting stronger software sales in independent dealerships, and essential tool activity with OEM dealerships. If you add $5.7 million from our profile acquisition and $5.5 million of unfavorable foreign exchange, overall reported sales were also up 6.9% in the quarter. Operating earnings of $65.2 million rose $4.4 million with OI margin improving 10 basis points to 23.1% as the benefits of RCI offset variation in the group's business mix. 
In the fourth quarter, RCI sales of vehicle OEMs grew strongly, driven by several essential diagnostic programs, tools for vehicle dealerships, so we grew with OEMs and we grew with independent shops. For the independent shops, Mitchell 1 also registered growth in the quarter assisted by several multi-site placements of its ProDemand automotive and information product. 
Mitchell One is advancing ProDemand with continuing integration of repair shop information, enhanced navigation and improved mobility. Strengthening the product line and driving volume gains, ProDemand is becoming essential for effective repairs. 
In the quarter, RCI also -- RS&I also continued the introduction of its newest handheld diagnostic unit, the SOLUS Edge. With an updated process or an easier viewing features, our new SOLUS edge offers a 50% increase in speed as well as a 15% larger screen size. And as you might expect, it's shaping up to be one of the most successful diagnostic rollouts. Along with our advancements, our handheld hardware, we also continued to enhance our software offering. Fewer navigations sets, better user experience, Snap-on diagnostics. Simply helping the technicians to fix cars easier and faster. 
For heavy trucks. Our PRO-LINK Ultra, the diagnostic tool continues to enable top-notch service from light diesel to Class A heavy duty trucks, the PRO-LINK delivers the broadest coverage ever available in a single handheld diagnostic tool. Including data for major systems like engines and transmissions and ABS brakes and instrument clusters and emissions and body controls, it's the ideal tools for heavy duty fleet and dealerships, on an operator repair shops, municipality and mobile truck services.  And as you would expect with those features, sales have been exceptional. 
Also in the period for RS&I, the equipment division performed quite well. High single digit organic sales increases bolstered by an improved the North American marketplace, gains in Western Europe and innovative new products. Once again, Snap-on Value Creation was on with the form of the new Snap-on motorized wheel balancer. Ideal for shops of all sizes. The new balancer comes equipped with a sonar sense that eliminates manual measurements of rim width, enabling faster balancing. It also features multiple placement mode allowing users to flexibly match weight locations to a variety of vehicle rims that are so much variety, common today in the car market. And it utilizes Snap-on some virtual play energy, providing unsurpassed accuracy to ensure an effective balance and a satisfied customer. The new Snap-on authorized balancer. Speed, flexibility and accuracy. It's received quite positive reviews, and we anticipate strong sales as the rollout continues. 
We're very excited about this product. In fact, we're excited about the entire breadth of the RS&I offering. And in November, RS&I presented its full product portfolio at the annual theme show in Las Vegas. The group's equipment business, including Challenger Lifts and Pro-Cut break leaves, new acquisition were featured along with our diagnostics, Mitchell One, business solutions and equipment solutions product offering all on display in one both under the banner Snap-on Total Solution. Customer reaction was enthusiastic and our sales for the event were strong. 
We believe the RS&I group, with state-of-the-art undercar equipment, a strong product line of repair information solution and award-winning diagnostics product, is captured in an increased presence with shop owners and managers, and the results confirm it. Well, that's our fourth quarter. Our organic sales rising 8.9%, EPS of $1.97 in the quarter, 23.1% higher than last year, progress registered along all our runways for coherent growth and advancements down each of our runways from improvement, but especially in customer connection and innovation and certainly rapid continuous improvement or RCI, all of that helping to drive a 16.9% operating margin, up 140 basis points. It clearly was an encouraging quarter. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Aldo."

Our fourth quarter consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales of $857.4 million in the quarter increased $59.9 million or 7.5% from 2013 levels reflecting broad-based gains across all of our operating segments. Organically, sales increased 9.8%, excluding $5.7 million of acquisition-related sales and $21.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. Consolidated gross profit of $411.3 million increased $32.8 million from 2013 levels. The gross profit margin of 48% in the quarter improved 50 basis points, primarily due to savings from RCI initiatives and benefits from higher sales partially offset by increased restructuring and other costs. 
Operating expenses of $266.1 million increased $11.2 million, primarily due to higher volume related and other expenses. The operating expense margin of 31.1% improved 90 basis points mostly due to sales volume leverage. We incurred $1.1 million of restructuring cost in the quarter. There were no restructuring cost in the fourth quarter of last year. 
As a result of these factors, operating earnings before Financial Services of $145.2 million in the quarter, increased $21.6 million or 17.5% compared to the prior year, and as a percentage of sales, improved 140 basis points to 16.9%. Operating earnings from Financial Services of $42.2 million on revenue of $59.4 million in the quarter, compared to operating earnings of $33 million on revenue of $47.4 million last year. The year-over-year increases in both operating earnings and revenue, primarily reflect the continued growth of the Financial Services portfolio as well as revenue and earnings from an additional week of operations in 2014. 
As you may know, Snap-on operates on a fiscal calendar, which results in an additional week to our fiscal full year and fourth quarter every 6 years. As a result, our 2014 fiscal year contained 53 weeks of operating results with the extra week relative to the prior year occurring in the fourth quarter. While the impact of this additional week was not material to Snap-on's consolidated fourth quarter net sales or net earnings, our Financial Services segment did earn an additional week of interest income on its financing portfolio. The consolidated level that net earnings benefit from the additional week of Financial Services interest income was largely offset by a corresponding additional week of fixed expenses primarily personnel-related cost and interest expense. 
Consolidated operating earnings of $187.4 million in the quarter increased $30.8 million or 19.7%, and the operating margin of 20.4% improved 190 basis points from 18.5% a year ago. Our fourth quarter effective income tax rate was 32.1% in both fourth quarters of 2014 and 2013. 
Finally, net earnings in the quarter of $116.2 million or $1.97 per diluted share increased $21.7 million or $0.37 per share from 2013 levels, representing a 33.1% increase in diluted earnings per share. The full year 2014 net earnings of $421.9 million or $7.14 per diluted share increased $71.6 million or $1.21 per share from 2013 levels, representing a 20.4% increase in diluted earnings per share. 
Now let's turn to our segment results. Starting with the commercial and industrial or C&I group on Slide 7. Sales of $298.2 million in the quarter were up 9.9% organically primarily reflecting double-digit gains in sales to customers in critical industries and in our Asia/Pacific operations as well as mid-single-digit sales increase in our European based hand tools business. Gross profit in the C&I group totaled $113.4 million in the quarter. Gross margin of 38% decreased 90 basis points from 2013 levels primarily due to a shift in sales activity that included higher volume sales for the military and increased sales in our Asia/Pacific operations as well as higher restructuring costs, partially offset by savings from RS&I initiatives. 
Operating expenses of $72.9 million in the quarter decreased $0.3 million from 2013 levels. The operating expense margin of 24.4% improved 140 basis points primarily due to the sales volume leverage, including benefits from the sale shift just mentioned. 
As a result of these factors, fourth quarter operating earnings for the C&I segment of $40.5 million increased $3.4 million or 9.2% from 2013 levels, and the operating margin of 13.6% improved 50 basis points from 13.1% last year. 
Turning now to Slide 8. Fourth quarter sales of the Snap-on Tools Group of $387.5 million increased 11.8% organically reflecting a double-digit increase in the United States and a high single digit gain internationally. Gross profit of $166.4 million increased $20.2 million from 2013 levels and the gross margin of 42.9% increased 130 basis points primarily due the benefits from higher sales and savings from RCI initiatives. Operating expenses of $102.5 million in the quarter increased $7.3 million from 2013 levels, primarily due to higher volume related expenses. The operating expense margin of 26.4% improved 70 basis points principally due to sales volume leverage.  As a result of these factors, operating earnings of $63.9 million for the Snap-on Tools Group increased $12.9 million or 25.3%, and the operating margin of 16.5% improved 200 basis points from 14.5% last year. 
Turning to the repair systems and information or RS&I group shown on Slide 9. Sales of $282.8 million increased 6.9% from 2013 levels. Excluding $5.7 million of acquisition-related sales and $5.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation, organic sales were also up 6.9%, reflecting high single digit gains in both sales of undercar equipment and sales to OEM dealerships as well as a mid-single digit increase in sales of diagnostic and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers. Gross profit of $131.5 million in the quarter increased $9.5 million from 2013 levels. Gross margin of 46.5% increased 40 basis points, as savings from RCI and other cost reduction initiatives were partially offset by a shift in sales and included higher volumes of lower gross margin products, including increased essential tool and the facilitation sales to OEM dealerships. The RS&I group also incurring higher restructuring group in the quarter. 
Operating expenses totaled $66.3 million in the quarter, and the operating expense margin of 23.4% increased 30 basis points, primarily reflecting operating expenses for the Pro-Cut acquisition. Fourth quarter operating earnings of $65.2 million for the RS&I group increased $4.4 million or 7.2% from prior year levels, and the operating margin of 23.1% increased 10 basis points from 23% last year. 
Now turning to Slide 10. In the fourth quarter, earnings from Financial Services of $42.2 million and revenues of $59.4 million, including contributions from the additional week of operations in fiscal 2014, compared with operating earnings of $33 million on revenue of $47.4 million last year. The average yield on finance receivables of 17.6% compared with 17.4% last year, and the average yield of contract receivables were 6-point -- it's 9.5% in both periods.  Originations of $232.2 million in the quarter increased 17.5% from 2013 levels. 
Moving to Slide 11. Our year-end balance sheet includes approximately $1.4 billion of gross financing receivables, including $1.2 billion from our U.S. Snap-On credit operation. Approximately 80% of our U.S. financing portfolio relates to extending credit loans to definition. In 2014, our worldwide finance this Financial Services portfolio grew $152.2 million. As for finance portfolio losses and delinquency trends, these continue to be in line with our expectations. 
Now turning to Slide 12. Cash provided by operations of $97.2 million in the quarter decreased $25.3 million from comparable 2013 levels, as higher net earnings in 2014 were more than offset by net increases in operating earnings and liabilities, including the timing of estimated tax and other payments and $10 million of a higher discretionary pension plan contributions. Net cash used in investing activities of $46 million included $30.7 million to fund a net increase in finance receivables. Capital expenditures of $17.3 million in the quarter compared with $19.9 million last year. Full year capital expenditures totaled $80.6 million. 
Turning to Slide 13. Days sales outstanding for trade receivables of 61 days compared with 62 days at 2013 year end. Inventories increased $41.1 million from 2013 year end levels, primarily to support continued to higher customer demand and new product introductions and from the addition of inventories related to Pro-Cut. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 3.7 compared with 3.8 turns at 2013 year end. Our year-end cash position of $132.9 million decreased $84.7 million from 2013 year-end levels, largely due to the March 2014 repayment of $100 million of debt at maturity. The net decrease in cash also reflects year-to-date impacts of funding $746.2 million of new finance receivables, dividend payments of $107.6 million, $80.6 million for capital expenditures, the repurchase of 680,000 shares for $79.3 million, and the acquisition of Pro-Cut for $41.3 million. These uses of cash were partially offset by $591.4 million of cash from collections of finance receivables and $397.9 million of cash from operations. Our net debt-to-capital ratio was 26.3% at both 2014 and 2013 year ends.
In addition to our $132.9 million of cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $700 million in available credit facilities, and our current short-term credit ratings allow us to access the commercial paper markets. At 2014 year-end, we had $37 million of commercial paper borrowings outstanding. 
This concludes my remarks on our fourth quarter performance. I'll now briefly review a few of items for 2015. We anticipate the capital expenditures in 2015 will be in the range of $80 million to $90 million. We also expect that our full year 2015 effective income tax rate will be at/or below our full year 2014 rate of 32.1%. 
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick?"

They're not growing anymore. But suffice it to say, that big-ticket items, which tool storage is one of them, was up ahead greater than the overall Tools Group of 11.8% of the quarter. So they were among the pacing elements, the pacing elements for our growth in the Tools Group. And it's clear that those 59 North American, I think it's 64 international -- in total because we have some in the U.K. now and Australia, have helped drive the way. And of course, that's together with our TechKnow vans, which have increased the same way, the TechKnow vans are now up I think to 31, which started at 14. So those are both helping grow this business, and it's moved faster than 11.8% [ph]."

And, therefore, those ideas are rolling backward greater frequency, but we are getting a good representation from the industrial business, from the critical industry. And I can offer to you that we've advanced our critical industry, not yet pet products, but we are expanding that business, for example, we added in the year 996 new aviation products. We added over 600 oil and gas products, over 800 power generation. So we're adding products. They are not all hip products. I'm not saying that. We had new products to the excitement in that business, the products are riveting those in industrial, were still today getting more out of the vehicle repair side of the business. Still, very good year for that, I'm very pleased, in fact, when you look at these numbers, it's hard for you to appreciate it, but I believe very strongly that is generated by the enthusiasm and intention getting that this great new products that when people in the vans or when our sales man call-on customers, wow, that's a new product I'd like to get it, and they add other products to it."

And I think the number, 18 of the last 19 quarters. They've shown some fairly strong performance. And all I can say about it, in general, David, what I can say first, in general, is what's happening here is the effects, the continually increasing effect of understanding how to the franchisees be more effective, which offered things like the vans, the Rock 'N Roll cab and the TechKnow vans. And we're just getting better at bringing out new products and finding those sweet spots in -- for the customer needs, that excite the customers and get that stuff moving up the van. That's what's happening here. Our ability to make the franchisees more word and effective, and the experience that the building in our team to be able to build this model, which is always been I said that word were effectively underworld raised those guys in the Tools Group are probably wielding up better than ever before. In this quarter, I think you might say, we had a particularly great customer connection and innovation season likely, I'd just add, that's one. And two, we had things like power tools and some great power tools products that came up. I was going to shop and other day, in fact, Tuesday, Monday, Tuesday, sorry, I was in the shop and the technician said, by, I got this word, my cordless impact. I used to use this pneumatic, I used to be proud of my word, now I turn my compressor up, because this things is so powerful, I won't let it out of my hand. So that was a terrific endorsement, really has gone completely for the new product, that's given some of or sales, so we see that, the other thing about a quarter we had a particularly great SFC. With SFC. And the tool, again the experience of the Tools Group guys that are very positive about this, they're very effective in doing this. This is one of the things I feel about this business, if I can just say this, I think we are on trend of continual operating improvement. I know there's a lot of discussion about currency. In fact, you can see the numbers of -- you can see it in our numbers in the fourth quarter, we got about $20 million worth of translation hit and when you see a couple of million of profitability hit associated with that, and you never know what the eventual numbers will be because you got a lot of variation in terms of what happens in the marketplace. But were exposed in places like -- big exposures are places like the euro, 9% of our sales in the euro and 8% in the pound and another 5 in Canada and so on and we have some dribs and drabs around Australia and Japan but -- and the actual numbers depends on where those -- what activities are each of those markets. So translation and transaction depends on the cocktail of that. But one thing we know is as we move forward, the rates from the end of the year are moving up more unbearable. So we see headwinds from currency, but we are confident. We know that our operating position will keep improving despite the first social to currency, so things like the Tools Group, the extension of critical, 4 straight quarters of high single digits or double digits. Those will continue to grow, and we'll exit, as I said in my comments, better in 2015 that when we entered."

He only mentioned how we could get better or how satisfied he was with certain of our new products. So I see this, and I see it across our product line. Our people are confident about our hand tools, our people are confident of our tool storage because they are beautiful pieces. Our people are confident about our diagnostics and our software because they provide a better insight to repairing the car than ever before. And know what's happened in the marketplace now, used to be garages wanted diagnostics, but with the extension of all the computers on cars, every technician needs to have a diagnostics to repair these things.  And  you can see this kind of confidence in our franchisees.

But you know actually, I don't think it's that surprising. This is a great business. It's a great business that has a lot of opportunity and run rate further, so we are not so surprised by such things because it is a business that has so much untapped opportunity for both growth and improvement. Let me come back to the idea of keeping it growing. Yes, it is a challenge, but you know that we've grown -- the Tools Group has grown 11.8%, 6%, 6.6%, 6.0%, 10.2%, 9.5% in the subsequent quarters, same-store sales. And then the other thing is we're getting better at bringing out new products. We just launched another tool storage tools storage unit at the kick west, David, and you know what it is, this is tool storage, these tool storage, big bucks, can envision them and they are gleaming in different colors, the thought great features, can plug in your power tools in all those stuff and other quick that with the downtown sound bar. Now I don't know if you've ever been in a garage, but a sound bar and a tool storage sounds like a cool thing to me. Everybody sees him and hears him, he's going crazy. So new products is a great advantage, so that helps it too. And then the other thing is, we just have to keep picking up new ways. The rock 'n roll cap was an innovation by the brilliant innovation by the Tools Group guys to figure out that they could help van virtually expand the space of the van, which is one of the limitations. They just have to keep coming up with ideas, that doesn't mean that the Rock 'n Roll cabs won't contribute more. I mean they've been pretty stable for a fairly long time. I want to say that the vans have done year-over-year, if you want to look at last year at this time, last year at this time, North America had 56 vans. Now we have 59. So it only moved up 3, and still it grew at 11.8% in total. And tool storage is a big tick up above that. So they figured out some way to do without too much increase in sales. Having said that, they also know because new ideas to help the situation. The final point is that when you look at originations versus the Tools Group, it's a little more complex. You have the question of originations, and it is driven by big-ticket items, but also a little bit driven by the variation between our sales and the franchisees sales, of course. The originations traffic sales with technicians, our sales traffic sales from awesome to the franchisee. So there is a little bit timing difference, and it can or diluted."

Remember first, I think first, that we start with a great product enabled by an extraordinary base of information with, I think, better insight on repair than anybody else. We have a product that we'll tell you okay, you have make and model and powertrain of a car and a certainly model what the typical repair is on that model based on the big data available. And we have an understanding, a lot of the competition comes at the lower end with code readers, and so on, a little bit less sophisticated. Technicians are looking for more levels of sophistication. They want to read what the car says. They want to be able to put the car through functional test through its paces. They want to be able to reprogram it. They want to be able to see what OEM says at the standard word and they want the whisper tips and tips that come out of the data we have all of that almost no one else does. So our product keeps evolving and getting stronger in that regard. And if anything, the requirements for this gets bigger because it used to be the computer content on cars will get more and more. This is one of the reasons why nobody can repair cars anymore because they're so complicated. And even in garages you need what used to be a situation where you need 1 big unit to handle everybody capacity around well you can't be working on a car today in many cases without those things every so every technician wants one. And so you have that, and then finally, finally, we have our franchisee, armed with a TechKnow van, up close and personal with a technician to help them through the product, tell him what he needs, how to use it, fine the cup particular problems are. We have customer connection and customer delivery like no one else has. And so that's why we don't feel so much heat from those guys, we think this is a robust market that's going to keep going. We think it's only going to get more demand in this area, and we think we have significant advantages in data, in hardware and in software. And our software business, our hardware business was strong, we just had a great launch, and our software business was up more than the hardware business in the quarter."

I'll give you my perspective on the results, on the markets and on the progress we've made. Then, Aldo will move into a more detailed review of the financials. 
The results of our fourth quarter were encouraging with sales increase and profit gains across our businesses, continuing our positive trend. We had opportunities, and we had headwinds. We took advantage of those opportunities, and we overcame the headwinds. The result was organic sales growth of 9.8%. If we include $5.7 million contribution from Pro-Cut and $21.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation, overall sales in the quarter were $857.4 million, a rise of 7.5%. Our EPS was $1.97, up 23.1% from the $1.60 in 2013. And that rise reflects an opco operating margin of 16.9%, an increase of 140 basis points. 
Financial service earnings of $42.2 million in the quarter were also up significantly. And the consolidated operating margin, including both Financial Services and opco, reached 20.4%, an improvement of 190 basis points compared to the 18.5% of last year. 
Looking at our markets. The automotive repair-related segments continue to be favorable, driven of course by expanding and aging car parts and year-after-year technology changes, all driving demand for our product. The Tools Group and the Repair Systems & and Information, or the RS&I, Group took advantage with volume growth by our van network and gains in OEM dealerships in independent repair shops confirming the progress. 
But we also had opportunities rooted in our expanding capabilities and product lineup for the critical industries and in growing physical strength in emerging markets, areas within the Commercial & Industrial, or C&I, Group. Arenas that were challenged by a variety of headwinds, fluctuating currencies and macroeconomic turbulence in places like Eastern Europe, Japan, Indonesia and even the core of Western Europe.  Despite those challenges, C&I results were quite positive. Higher volumes and favorable trends continued in our industrialization division. Progress across a range of critical industries. And in a range of specific operations, the quarter was a period of clear progress, adding to our growing strength in that region. 
Another feature of the quarter is that military activity was stronger. I think if you've been listening to these calls, all of you know that the critical -- that critical segment has been quite turbulent. In fact, the way forward is still unclear. A significant level of budget uncertainty does remain, and it's difficult to predict the military environment for any extended period. However, in the last quarter, we did make the most of the available opportunities and registered considerable military growth. It added to C&I's positive trend. 
So to wrap up the broad discussion of the market, I'd summarize the situation as generally positive across our businesses. And now we'll always have headwinds. We do believe that no matter what the environment, we have the opportunity and the capability to advance our position. We'll continue to progress against challenges, along our runways for growth, enhancing the franchise channel, expanding Snap-on's presence in the garage, extending to critical industries and building in emerging markets. 
That strategic advancement, when coupled with the Snap-on value creation process of safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and rapid continuous improvement, or RCI, drives a significant and ongoing positive trend or performance. And we believe that the results in the fourth -- first quarter and over the full year show just that. 
Speaking the full year. Snap-on's EPS in 2014 was $7.14, an increase of 20.4% from 2013. Driving those earnings was an opco operating margin of 16.3%, up 120 basis points. When we include the income from Financial Services of $149.1 million, which rolls the $23.4 million, the consolidated operating margin for the year was -- of 19.6%, was up 150 basis points. That performance came on sales of $3.3 billion, a 7.2% year-over-year increase that reflected primarily in organic growth of 6.9%. 
In 2014, full year gains were achieved from every group, and the Tools Group, strength in van channel, with organic growth of 7.6% for the year. RS&I expanded reach with repair shop owners and managers, up 4.9% organically. And from the C&I Group, growth in critical industries and progress in emerging markets, organic activity rising 9.5%.  All clear evidence of forward movement in the markets we serve. 
Now let's move to a discussion of the groups and their quarters. In the C&I Group, revenue in the quarter was up 5.3% from 2013 despite unfavorable foreign currency. The organic sales increased 9.9% from broad contributions across the businesses. The industrial division paced the progress, achieving double-digit gains in multiple critical industries. Encouragingly, SNA Europe posted a solid mid-single-digit rise offsetting significant European headwinds, while the Asia/Pacific division recorded higher activity growing in emerging markets overcoming the present difficulties surrounding Japan. 
From an earnings perspective, C&I income of $40.5 million, increased $3.4 million compared to the prior year period and that represents an operating margin of 13.6%, a rise of 50 basis points versus 2013. 
C&I performance in the quarter is exemplified by SNA Europe. As I said, sales gains despite difficulties and profits up sharply, again. RCI practiced over all those difficult days, while the sales were falling. That effort's paying off, and we can see it in the SNA Europe numbers. 
C&I also advanced in penetrating critical industries. A particular note, I think, was our gains in power generation, railroads and the oil and gas sectors. And one product line that's gained traction in these areas is our tools at high offering. Drop prevention systems, designed for a variety of industries and used to keep people safe and assets secure. Falling objects is a leading cause of accidents in the workplace. And a 3-pound tool falling from height can make quite an impact. In other words, don't get hit by a falling wrench. It sounds rudimentary. But it's a real workplace issue and a clear opportunity for Snap-on customer connection and innovation to provide unique solutions. By ergonomically tethering our tools, we provide our customers an engineer detachment system, a productive and compliant solution, maintaining the functionalities of tools used at height, but with safety. 
Guided by customer connection and solving these critical needs on oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico or major power plants in the U.S., our industrial divisions tools that height drop prevention system are making work safer and more productive for our customers performing critical tasks.
The fourth quarter also grow -- saw a growth in the emerging markets of C&I. China and India led the way for the double-digit growth in our Asia/Pacific division. And it's clear what's driving the progress. Growing physicals, more distributors, more field training, more Asianized products, products like our new [indiscernible], the compact lift; our new flexible -- our flexible new aisle aligner system, both ideal for the smaller footprints in Asian shops. And our expanding line of a Blue-Point toolsets for the rising Asian vehicle repair market. Each quarter, each quarter, we believe we build more Snap-on Asia/Pacific strength, are better poised to continue our positive momentum and improve our position for the considerable repair wave, we believe, is coming in that emerging region. 
Finally, in C&I. Let me speak a moment about the evolution of our automated tool control system or ATC. You may remember that the ATC, we've spoken on often about on this call, is our total security and inventory management system that uses advanced digital imaging technology and proprietary software to automatically keep track of its critical tools. 
On the fourth quarter, the industrial vision reached a milestone. There are now over 1,000 ATC systems deployed and the number's growing. We started out aiming at aviation -- at the aviation industry. But now through customer connection and innovation, we redesigned the product to accommodate the very tool configurations found in the natural resource and railroad industries. ATC systems are now solving problems for customers in both those segments and the momentum is building. ATC, an effective Snap-on concept, extended to more customers, helping drive C&I growth. 
Now on to the Tools Group, where we posted organic sales increase, an organic sales increase of 11.8%. The operating earnings of $63.9 million, representing a margin rate of 16.5%, up 200 basis points from last year. We also mentioned Snap-on runways for coherent growth, guiding principles for our long-term sales opportunities. And always prominently included is enhancing the franchise channel, while the results for the Tools Group in the quarter represent clear validation of the progress being made along that runway. 
But in addition to the financial performance, there's other evidence that authenticates the achievements. Snap-on continues to be recognized as a franchise of choice. Once again, Snap-on was ranked among the top 25 on Entrepreneur Magazine's list of top 500 franchises. And the Franchise Business Review, which measures franchisee satisfaction, recognized Snap-on as a top 50 franchise in its latest ranking, marking the eighth consecutive year we received that award. 
And again, this quarter, like always, I had the opportunity to meet directly with franchisees at the fall meetings of our U.S. and Canadian natural franchise advisory Council. And again on our recent kick-off meetings across the country, each of the sessions generated valuable insight, great feedback from an enthusiastic group of franchisees. 
Based on their optimism, I believe anyone interacting with these professionals would conclude our band network as stronger than ever before. 
The Tools Group success can also be traced to customer connection and innovation, essential parts of that Snap-on Value Creation. This is the Tools Group's fifth consecutive year for success of growth for successful product ideas derived from collaboration efforts with our franchisees, from discussions with technicians or from the independent observations of our associates. 
An example of that customer connection and innovation is our newly introduced steering rack socket. The accepted technique for replacing a power steering o-rings required  removal of the entire power steering rack assembly, followed by the use of a screwdriver and a hammer to change the o-ring. The new Snap-on socket allows the tech to replace the o-ring while the power steering assembly remains in place. It can save a full hour of labor. And it's a winning timesaver, and I can tell you on the van that is that a tension grabber. The steering rack socket is a clear example of Snap-on Value Creation. Customer connection and innovation, moving down our runways for improvement, providing the means for ongoing -- for an ongoing trajectory of positive performance and the fourth quarter results for the Tools Group, our testimony, that is working. 
Sales in the fourth quarter were moving to RS&I, moving to RS&I. Sales in the fourth quarter were $282.8 million; organic gains of 6.9%, primarily reflecting stronger software sales in independent dealerships; and essential tool activity with OEM dealerships. If you add $5.7 million from our profile acquisition and $5.5 million of unfavorable foreign exchange, overall reported sales were also up 6.9% in the quarter. Operating earnings of $65.2 million rose $4.4 million, with OI margin improving 10 basis points to 23.1%, as the benefits of RCI offset variation in the Group's business mix. 
In the fourth quarter, RCI sales of vehicle OEMs grew strongly, driven by several essential diagnostic programs, tools for vehicle dealerships. So we grew with OEMs and we grew with independent shops. For the independent shops, Mitchell 1 also registered growth in the quarter, assisted by several multi-site placements of its ProDemand Automotive & Information product. 
Mitchell 1 is advancing ProDemand with continuing integration of Repair Shop & Information, enhanced navigation and improved mobility. Strengthening the product line and driving volume gains, ProDemand is becoming essential for effective repairs. 
In the quarter, RCI also -- RS&I also continued the introduction of its newest handheld diagnostic unit, the SOLUS Edge. With an updated process or an easier viewing features, our new SOLUS edge offers a 50% increase in speed as well as a 15% larger screen size. And as you might expect, it's shaping up to be one of the most successful diagnostic rollouts. Along with our advancements -- handheld hardware, we also continued to enhance our software offering. Viewer navigations steps, better user experience, Snap-on diagnostics, simply helping the technicians to fix cars easier and faster. 
For heavy trucks. Our PRO-LINK Ultra, the diagnostic tool continues to enable top-notch service from light diesel to Class A heavy duty trucks. The PRO-LINK delivers the broadest coverage ever available in a single handheld diagnostic tool. Including data for major systems like engines and transmissions and ABS brakes and instrument clusters and emissions and body control, it's the ideal tool for heavy duty fleet and dealerships, owner operator repair shops, municipality and mobile truck services.  And as you would expect with those features, sales have been exceptional.  
Also in the period for RS&I, the equipment division performed quite well. High single-digit organic sales increases bolstered by an improved North American marketplace, gains in Western Europe and innovative new products. Once again, Snap-on Value Creation was on display in the form of the new Snap-on motorized wheel balancer, ideal for shops of all sizes. The new balancer comes equipped with a sonar sense that eliminates manual measurements of rim width, enabling faster balancing. It also features multiple placement mode, allowing users to flexibly match weight location to a variety of vehicle rims that are so much variety, common today in the car market. And it utilizes Snap-On's virtual play and imaging technology, providing unsurpassed accuracy to ensure an effective balance and a satisfied customer, the new Snap-on authorized balancer, speed, flexibility and accuracy. It's received quite positive reviews, and we anticipate strong sales as the rollout continues.  We're very excited about this product. 
In fact, we're excited about the entire breadth of the RS&I offering. And in November, RS&I presented its full product portfolio at the annual theme show in Las Vegas. The Group's equipment business, including Challenger Lifts and Pro-Cut brake lathes, new acquisition, were featured along with our diagnostics, Mitchell 1, business solutions and equipment solutions products offering, all on display, in one boot, under the banner Snap-on Total Solution. Customer reaction was enthusiastic. And our sales for the event were strong. 
We believe the RS&I group, with state-of-the-art undercar equipment, a strong product line of Repair & Information Solution and award-winning diagnostics product, is capturing an increased presence with shop owners and managers, and the results confirm it. Well, that's our fourth quarter. Opco 4 organic sales are rising 9.8%, EPS of $1.97 in the quarter, 23.1% higher than last year, progress registered along all our runways for coherent growth and advancements down each of our runways for improvement, but especially in customer connection and innovation, and certainly rapid continuous improvement of RCI, all of that helping to drive a 16.9% operating margin, up a 140 basis point. It clearly was an encouraging quarter. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Aldo."

Our fourth quarter consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales of $857.4 million in the quarter, increased $59.9 million or 7.5% from 2013 levels, reflecting broad-based gains across all of our operating segments. Org",1593,"Thanks, Nick. Our fourth quarter consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales of $857.4 million in the quarter, increased $59.9 million or 7.5% from 2013 levels, reflecting broad-based gains across all of our operating segments. Organically, sales increased 9.8%, excluding $5.7 million of acquisition-related sales and $21.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. Consolidated gross profit of $411.3 million, increased $32.8 million from 2013 levels. The gross profit margin of 48% in the quarter improved 50 basis points, primarily due to savings from RCI initiatives and benefits from higher sales, partially offset by increased restructuring and other costs. 
Operating expenses of $266.1 million, increased $11.2 million, primarily due to higher volume related and other expenses. The operating expense margin of 31.1%, improved 90 basis points, mostly due to sales volume leverage. We incurred $1.1 million of restructuring costs in the quarter. There were no restructuring costs in the fourth quarter of last year. 
As a result of these factors, operating earnings before Financial Services of $145.2 million in the quarter, increased $21.6 million, or 17.5%, compared to the prior year. And as a percentage of sales, improved 140 basis points to 16.9%. Operating earnings from Financial Services of $42.2 million on revenue of $59.4 million in the quarter compared to operating earnings of $33 million on revenue of $47.4 million last year. The year-over-year increases in both operating earnings and revenue, primarily reflect the continued growth of the Financial Services portfolio as well as revenue and earnings from an additional week of operations in 2014. 
As you may know, Snap-on operates on a fiscal calendar, which results in an additional week to our fiscal full year and fourth quarter every 6 years. As a result, our 2014 fiscal year contained 53 weeks of operating results, with the extra week relative to the prior year occurring in the fourth quarter. While the impact of this additional week was not material to Snap-on's consolidated fourth quarter net sales or net earnings, our Financial Services segment did earn an additional week of interest income on its financing portfolio. At the consolidated level, the net earnings benefit from the additional week of Financial Services' interest income was largely offset by a corresponding additional week of fixed expenses, primarily personnel-related costs and interest expense. 
Consolidated operating earnings of $187.4 million in the quarter, increased $30.8 million or 19.7%. And the operating margin of 20.4%, improved 190 basis points from 18.5% a year ago. Our fourth quarter effective income tax rate was 32.1% in both the fourth quarters of 2014 and 2013. 
Finally, net earnings in the quarter of $116.2 million, or $1.97 per diluted share, increased $21.7 million, or $0.37 per share, from 2013 levels, representing a 23.1% increase in diluted earnings per share. For the full year 2014 net earnings of $421.9 million, or $7.14 per diluted share, increased $71.6 million, or $1.21 per share, from 2013 levels, representing a 20.4% increase in diluted earnings per share. 
Now let's turn to our segment results. Starting with the commercial and industrial, or C&I Group, on Slide 7. Sales of $298.2 million in the quarter were up 9.9% organically, primarily reflecting double-digit gains in sales to customers in critical industries and in our Asia/Pacific operations, as well as mid-single-digit sales increase in our European based hand tools business. Gross profit in the C&I group totaled $113.4 million in the quarter. Gross margin of 38% decreased 90 basis points from 2013 levels, primarily due to a shift in sales activity that included higher volume sales to the military and increased sales in our Asia/Pacific operations as well as higher restructuring costs, partially offset by savings from RCI initiatives. 
Operating expenses of $72.9 million in the quarter, decreased $0.3 million from 2013 levels. The operating expense margin of 24.4%, improved 140 basis points, primarily due to the sales volume leverage, including benefits from the sales shift just mentioned. 
As a result of these factors, fourth quarter operating earnings for the C&I segment of $40.5 million, increased $3.4 million or 9.2% from 2013 levels. And the operating margin of 13.6%, improved 50 basis points from 13.1% last year. 
Turning now to Slide 8. Fourth quarter sales in the Snap-on Tools Group of $387.5 million, increased 11.8% organically, reflecting a double-digit increase in the United States and a high single-digit gain internationally. Gross profit of $166.4 million, increased $20.2 million from 2013 levels. And the gross margin of 42.9%, increased 130 basis points, primarily due to the benefits from higher sales and savings from RCI initiatives. Operating expenses of $102.5 million in the quarter, increased $7.3 million from 2013 levels, primarily due to higher volume-related and other expenses. The operating expense margin of 26.4%, improved 70 basis points, principally due to sales volume leverage.  As a result of these factors, operating earnings of $63.9 million for the Snap-on Tools Group, increased $12.9 million or 25.3%. And the operating margin of 16.5%, improved 200 basis points from 14.5% last year. 
Turning to the Repair Systems and Information, or RS&I Group, shown on Slide 9. Sales of $282.8 million, increased 6.9% from 2013 levels. Excluding $5.7 million of acquisition-related sales and $5.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation, organic sales were also up 6.9%, reflecting high single-digit gains in both sales of undercar equipment and sales to OEM dealerships as well as a mid-single-digit increase in sales of diagnostic and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers. Gross profit of $131.5 million in the quarter, increased $9.5 million from 2013 levels. Gross margin of 46.5%, increased 40 basis points, as savings from RCI and other cost reduction initiatives were partially offset by a shift in sales and included higher volumes of lower gross margin products, including increased essential tool and facilitation sales to OEM dealerships. The RS&I group also incurred higher restructuring costs in the quarter. 
Operating expenses totaled $66.3 million in the quarter. And the operating expense margin of 23.4%, increased 30 basis points, primarily reflecting operating expenses for the Pro-Cut acquisition. Fourth quarter operating earnings of $65.2 million for the RS&I Group, increased $4.4 million or 7.2% from prior year levels. And the operating margin of 23.1%, increased 10 basis points from 23% last year. 
Now turning to Slide 10. In the fourth quarter, earnings from Financial Services of $42.2 million and revenues of $59.4 million, including contributions from the additional week of operations in fiscal 2014 compared with operating earnings of $33 million on revenue of $47.4 million last year. The average yield on finance receivables of 17.6% compared with 17.4% last year. And the average yield on contract receivables were 6. -- I'm sorry, it's 9.5% in both periods.  Originations of $232.2 million in the quarter increased 17.5% from 2013 levels. 
Moving to Slide 11. Our year-end balance sheet includes approximately $1.4 billion of gross financing receivables, including $1.2 billion from our U.S. Snap-on credit operation. Approximately, 80% of our U.S. financing portfolio relates to extending credit loans to technicians. In 2014, our worldwide finance -- Financial Services portfolio grew $152.2 million. As for finance portfolio losses and delinquency trends, these continued to be in line with our expectations. 
Now turning to Slide 12. Cash provided by operations of $97.2 million in the quarter, decreased $25.3 million from comparable 2013 levels, as higher net earnings in 2014 were more than offset by net increases in operating assets and liabilities, including the timing of estimated tax and other payments, and $10 million of higher discretionary pension plan contributions. Net cash used by investing activities of $46 million, included $30.7 million to fund a net increase in finance receivables. Capital expenditures of $17.3 million in the quarter compared with $19.9 million last year. Full year capital expenditures totaled $80.6 million. 
Turning to Slide 13. Days sales outstanding for trade receivables of 61 days compared with 62 days at 2013 year-end. Inventories increased $41.1 million from 2013 year-end levels, primarily to support continued higher customer demand and new product introductions and from the addition of inventories related to Pro-Cut. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns at 3.7 compared with 3.8 turns at 2013 year-end. Our year-end cash position of $132.9 million, decreased $84.7 million from 2013 year-end levels, largely due to the March 2014 repayment of $100 million of debt at maturity. The net decrease in cash also reflects year-to-date impacts of funding $746.2 million of new finance receivables, dividend payments of $107.6 million, $80.6 million for capital expenditures, the repurchase of 680,000 shares for $79.3 million, and the acquisition of Pro-Cut for $41.3 million. These uses of cash were partially offset by $591.4 million of cash from collections of finance receivables and $397.9 million of cash from operations. Our net debt-to-capital ratio was 26.3% at both 2014 and 2013 year ends.
In addition to our $132.9 million of cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $700 million in available credit facilities. And our current short-term credit ratings allow us to access the commercial paper markets. At 2014 year-end, we had $37 million of commercial paper borrowings outstanding. 
This concludes my remarks on our fourth quarter performance. I'll now briefly review a few outlook items for 2015. We anticipate that capital expenditures in 2015 will be in the range of $80 million to $90 million. We also expect that our full year 2015 effective income tax rate will be at/or below our full year 2014 rate of 32.1%. 
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick?"

We believe our fourth quarter full year results are clear evidence of the abundant opportunities that lie along our strategic runways for growth and of our continuing progress of taking advantage of those possibilities and in achieving  amidst challenge and turbulence. The vehicle repair market is both favorable economically and familiar operationally, and we are advancing in that arena. The van channel is being enhanced. The Tools Group is continuing to rise, sales up 11.8%, operating margin increased by 200 basis points. And we believe the franchise -- that franchisee's confidence and capability are stronger than ever. 
We're expanding repair shop owners and managers, profitable growth in dealerships and independent shops, Pro-Cut and Challenger integrated smoothly, giving us more to sell, and OI margin of 23.1% and volume growth of 6.9%. We're reaching into new areas for new customers, growing coherently. The extension to critical industry is working. Double-digit growth with those customers in the quarter, 4 straight quarters of robust increases. And we're building firm physical capabilities in emerging markets. Activity in China and in India, up nicely in the quarter. Put that progress together, with our with commitment to Snap-on Value Creation, and you will see encouraging results. You see organic sales increases of 9.8% and a margin gain of 140 basis points to 16.9%. In fact, you see our fourth quarter. And as we move forward, we know there are headwinds. We know there are more challenges. But we also believe that our team has unique opportunity, rooted in growth and improvement, and has the intent and the capability to continue our positive trend of strategic and financial progress, ensuring that we will exit 2015 stronger than when we enter.

But suffice it to say, that big-ticket items, which tool storage is one of them, was up ahead greater than the overall Tools Group of 11.8% in the quarter. So they pace the -- they were among the pacing elements -- big-ticket items were among the pacing elements for our growth in the Tools Group. And it's clear that the -- that those 59 North America, and I think it's 64 international -- in total because we have some in the U.K. now and Australia, have helped drive the way. And of course, that's together with our TechKnow vans, which have increased the same way. Yes, the TechKnow vans are now up, I think, to 31, which started at 14.

Compared to just what  2006, they're several times, as I said many times, that number. And I would say that they are divided, kind of, not quite equally. I said the Tools Group gets a little more of those because we have more people really in the workplaces for the automotive repair business. And therefore, those ideas are rolling back with greater frequency. But we are getting a good representation from the industrial business, from the critical industries. And you know, I can offer to you that we've advanced our critical industries, not yet pet products, but we're expanding that business, for example, we added in the year 996 new aviation products. We added over 600 oil and gas products, military products over 800, power generation. So we're adding products. They are not all the hit products. I'm not saying that we added new products to create excitement in that business. The hit products are those that sell over 1 million and create the excitement. We're getting those in industrial. We're still today getting more out of the vehicle repair side of the business. Still, very good year for that, I'm very pleased. And in fact, when you look at these numbers, it's hard for you to appreciate it, but I believe very strongly that it's generated by the enthusiasm and the intention getting that these great new products get when people in the vans or when our sales man call-on and customers say, ""wow, that's a new product, I'd like to get it,"" and they add other products to it."

And I think the number 18 over the last 19 quarters. So they've shown some fairly strong performance. And all I can say about it, in general, David, what I can say first, in general, is that what's happening here is the effects -- the continually increasing effect of understanding how to help the franchisees be more effective, which offered things like the vans, the Rock 'N Roll cab and the TechKnow van. And we're just getting better at bringing out new products and finding those sweet spots in the -- for the customer needs that excite the customers and get that stuff moving off the van. That's what's happening here. Our ability to make the franchisees more productive and effective and the experience that's building in our team to be able to wield this model, which has always been, I said, the model that [indiscernible] more effectively. One of the world's great models for those guys in the Tools Group are probably wielding it better than ever before. In this quarter, I think you might say, we had a particularly great customer connection and innovation season, like Liam just had, that's one. And 2, we had things like power tools and some great power tool products that came up. I was just -- I was in a shop the other day, and in fact, Tuesday -- Monday -- Tuesday -- sorry, Tuesday, I was in a shop and the technician said, ""boy, I got this new CT8850, you know, my cordless impact. I used to use these pneumatics. I used to be proud of my pneumatic. Now I've turned my compressor off because this thing is so powerful, I won't let it out of my hand."" So that was a terrific endorsement. It really had gone completely to the new product, and that's driven some of our sales. So you see that. The other thing about the fourth quarter is, we had a particularly great SFC -- great SFC. And the tool -- again, this is the experience of the Tools Group guys that are very positive about this. They're very effective in doing this. This is one of the things that I feel about this business, if I can just say this. I think we are on a trend of continual operating improvement. I know there's a lot of discussion about currency. In fact, you can see the numbers of -- you can see it in our numbers. In the fourth quarter, we got about $20 million worth of translation hit and when you see the KLC, couple of million dollars of profitability is associated with it. And you never know what the eventual numbers will be because you got a lot of variation in terms of what happens in the marketplace. But we're exposed in places like -- big exposures are places like the euro, 9% of our sales in the euro and 8% in the pound and then another 5 in the Canada and so on. And we have some dribs and drabs around Australia and Japan. But when you -- and the actual number depends on where those -- what activities are each of those markets. So translation and transaction depends on the cocktail of that. But one thing we know is that as we move forward, the rates from the end of the year are moving up more unfavorable. So we'll see headwinds from currency, but we are confident. We know that our operating position will keep improving despite the arithmetic associated with the currency. So things like the Tools Group, the extension of critical industries, 4 straight quarters of high single digits or double digits, those will continue to grow. And we'll exit, as I said in my comments, better in 2015 that when we entered."

We have some great companies, Stanley and Danaher behind Matco and so on. But at the garage level in the vans, from each of our positions, we see that our franchisees don't often mention the competitors. They reference themselves versus where we have been or where we are going. I just did a van ride, like I said, on Tuesday. And my van driver never mentioned the competitors. He only mentioned how we could get better or how satisfied he was with certain of our new products. So I see this. And I see it across our product line. Our people are confident of our hand tools. Our people are confident of our tool storage because they are beautiful pieces. Our people are confident about our diagnostics and our software because they provide a better insight to repairing the car than ever before. And you know what's happened in a marketplace now used to be garages, wanted diagnostics. Well, with the extension of all the computers on cars, every technician needs to have a diagnostics to repair these things.  And  so you can see this kind of confidence in our franchisees. And yes, they say, ""well, I'd rather have this or I need something else."" But it's always with reference to themselves, it's not much compared to their -- it's not really compared to their competition as much. I hardly ever hear about that.

And you made the observations that you aren't adding any more vans, I guess, on the Rock ‘N Roll Cab Express. Just looking at the 17.5% origination growth in the finance portfolio, suggest that the storage is still a big part of the Tools growth story and the margin, 200 basis points probably is driven in part by that as well.

But you know -- actually, I don't think it's that surprising. This is a great business. It's a great business that has a lot of opportunity and runway further. So we are not so surprised by such things because it is a business that has so much untapped opportunity for both growth and improvement. Let me come back to the idea of keeping it growing. Yes, it is a challenge. But you know that we've grown -- the Tools Group has grown 11.8%, 6%, 6.6%, 6.0%, 10.2%, 9.5% in the subsequent quarters, same-store sales. And then the other thing is, we're getting better at bringing out new products. We just launched another tool storage unit at [indiscernible], David. And you know what it is, it's a tool storage. It's the tool storage, big box, you can envision. And they're gleaming in different colors. They've got great features. You know, you can plug in your power to almost up and now we equip them with a downtown sound bar, now. I don't know if you've ever been in a garage, but a sound bar and a tool storage box sounds like a cool thing to me. Everybody sees them and hears them as going crazy. So new products is a great -- are a great advantage, so that helps it, too. And then the other thing is, we just have to keep thinking of new ways. The Rock 'N Roll Cab was an innovation by the -- brilliant innovation by the Tools Group guys to figure out that they could help van -- virtually expand the space of the van, which is one of the limitations. They just have to keep coming up with ideas. That doesn't mean that the Rock 'N Roll cabs won't contribute more, I mean, they've been pretty stable for a fairly long time. I want to say that the vans have been year-over-year. If you wanted to look at last year at this time -- last year at this time, North America had 56 vans, now we have 59. So they only moved up 3 and still it grew at 11.8% in total. And tool storage of big ticket was above that. So they figured out some way to do without too much increase in sales. Having said that, they also [indiscernible] to come up with new ideas to try to help this situation. The final point is that when you look at the originations versus the Tools Group, it's a little more complex. You have the question of originations, and it does -- it is driven by big-ticket items, but it's also a little bit driven by the variation between our sales and the franchisees' sales, of course. The originations track of sales with technician, our sales track of sale from us to the franchisee. So there's a little bit of timing difference, and it can mud the water a little bit."

And we have an understanding. A lot of the competition comes at the lower end with code readers and so on, a little bit less sophisticated. Technicians are looking for more levels of sophistication. They want to read what the car says. They want to be able to put the car through functional test to its paces. They want to be able to reprogram it. They want to be able to see what the OEM says as a standard tech. And then they want the whisper tips and the tips that come out of the big data. We have all of that, almost no one else does. So our product keeps evolving and getting stronger in that regard. And if anything, the requirements for this gets bigger because it used to be -- the computer content on the cars will get more and more. This is one of the reasons why nobody can repair cars anymore because they're so complicated. And even in garages, you need what used to be a situation where you needed 1 big unit to handle everybody in your capacity around. Well, you can't be working on a car today in many cases without these things, so every technician wants one. And so you have that. And then finally, finally, we have our franchisee, armed with the TechKnow vans, up close in personnel with the technician to help him through the product, tell him what he needs, how to use it, and find out what his particular problems are. We have customer connection and customer delivery like no one else has. And so that's why we don't feel so much heat from those guys. We think this is a robust market that's going to keep growing. We think it's only going to get more demand in this area. And we think we have significant advantages in data, in hardware and in software -- and our software business.

I'll give you my perspective on the results, on the markets and on the progress we've made. Then, Aldo will move into a more detailed review of the financials. 
The results of our fourth quarter were encouraging with sales increases and profit gains across our businesses, continuing our positive trend. We had opportunities, and we had headwinds. We took advantage of those opportunities, and we overcame the headwinds. The result was organic sales growth of 9.8%. If we include a $5.7 million contribution from Pro-Cut and $21.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation, overall sales in the quarter were $857.4 million, a rise of 7.5%. Our EPS was $1.97, up 23.1% from the $1.60 in 2013. And that rise reflects an opco operating margin of 16.9%, an increase of 140 basis points. 
Financial service earnings of $42.2 million in the quarter were also up significantly. And the consolidated operating margin, including both Financial Services and opco, reached 20.4%, an improvement of 190 basis points compared to the 18.5% of last year. 
Looking at our markets. The automotive repair-related segments continue to be favorable, driven of course by expanding and aging car parts and year-after-year technology changes, all driving demand for our product. The Tools Group and the Repair Systems & and Information, or the RS&I, Group took advantage with volume growth by our van network and gains in OEM dealerships in independent repair shops confirming the progress. 
But we also had opportunities rooted in our expanding capabilities and product lineup for the critical industries and in growing physical strength in emerging markets, areas within the Commercial & Industrial, or C&I Group, arenas that were challenged by a variety of headwinds, fluctuating currencies and macroeconomic turbulence in places like Eastern Europe, Japan, Indonesia and even the core of Western Europe.  Despite those challenges, C&I results were quite positive. Higher volumes and favorable trends continued in our Industrial division, progress across a range of critical industries. And in a range of specific operations, the quarter was a period of clear progress, adding to our growing strength in that region. 
Another feature of the quarter is that military activity was stronger. I think if you've been listening to these calls, all of you know that the critical -- that critical segment has been quite turbulent. In fact, the way forward is still unclear. A significant level of budget uncertainty does remain, and it's difficult to predict the military environment for any extended period. However, in the last quarter, we did make the most of the available opportunities and registered considerable military growth. It added to C&I's positive trend. 
So to wrap up the broad discussion of the markets, I'd summarize the situation as generally positive across our businesses. And know, we'll always have headwinds. We do believe that no matter what the environment, we have the opportunity and the capability to advance our position. We'll continue to progress against challenges, along our runways for growth, enhancing the franchise channel, expanding Snap-on's presence in the garage, extending to critical industries and building in emerging markets. 
That strategic advancement, when coupled with the Snap-on Value Creation Processes of safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and rapid continuous improvement, or RCI, drives a significant and ongoing positive trend or performance. And we believe that the results in the fourth -- first quarter and over the full year show just that. 
Speaking of the full year, Snap-on's EPS in 2014 was $7.14, an increase of 20.4% from 2013. Driving those earnings was an opco operating margin of 16.3%, up 120 basis points. When we include the income from Financial Services of $149.1 million, which rose $23.4 million, the consolidated operating margin for the year was -- of 19.6%, was up 150 basis points. That performance came on sales of $3.3 billion, a 7.2% year-over-year increase that reflected primarily in organic growth of 6.9%. 
In 2014, full year gains were achieved from every group. In the Tools Group, a strengthened van channel with organic growth of 7.6% for the year. RS&I expanded reach with repair shop owners and managers, up 4.9% organically. And from the C&I Group, growth in critical industries and progress in emerging markets, organic activity rising 9.5%.  All clear evidence of forward movement in the markets we serve. 
Now let's move to a discussion of the groups and their quarters. In the C&I Group, revenue in the quarter was up 5.3% from 2013 despite unfavorable foreign currency. The organic sales increased 9.9% from broad contributions across the businesses. The Industrial division paced the progress, achieving double-digit gains in multiple critical industries. Encouragingly, SNA Europe posted a solid mid-single-digit rise, offsetting significant European headwinds, while the Asia/Pacific division recorded higher activity, growing in emerging markets overcoming the present difficulties surrounding Japan. 
From an earnings perspective, C&I income of $40.5 million, increased $3.4 million compared to the prior year period and that represents an operating margin of 13.6%, a rise of 50 basis points versus 2013. 
C&I performance in the quarter is exemplified by SNA Europe. As I said, sales gains despite difficulties and profits up sharply, again. RCI practiced over all those difficult days, while the sales were falling. That effort's paying off, and we can see it in the SNA Europe numbers. 
C&I also advanced in penetrating critical industries. Of particular note, I think, was our gains in power generation, railroads and the oil and gas sectors. And one product line that has gained traction in these areas is our Tools at Height offering, drop prevention systems designed for a variety of industries and used to keep people safe and assets secure. Falling objects is a leading cause of accidents in the workplace. And a 3-pound tool falling from height can make quite an impact. In other words, don't get hit by a falling wrench. It sounds rudimentary, but it's a real workplace issue and a clear opportunity for Snap-on customer connection and innovation to provide unique solutions. By ergonomically tethering our tools, we provide our customers an engineered attachment system, a productive and compliant solution, maintaining the functionalities of tools used at height, but with safety. 
Guided by customer connection and solving these critical needs on oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico or in major power plants in the U.S., our Industrial division's Tools at Height drop prevention system are making work safer and more productive for our customers performing critical tasks.
The fourth quarter also grow -- saw a growth in the emerging markets of C&I. China and India led the way for the double-digit growth in our Asia/Pacific division. And it's clear what's driving the progress. Growing physicals, more distributors, more field training, more Asian-ized products, products like our new GLS2P4 [ph] , the compact lift; or our new flexible -- our flexible new i-Aligner system, both ideal for the smaller footprints in Asian shops. And our expanding lineup of Blue-Point tool sets for the rising Asian vehicle repair market. Each quarter, each quarter, we believe we build more Snap-on Asia/Pacific strength, are better poised to continue our positive momentum and improve our position for the considerable repair wave, we believe, is coming in that emerging region. 
Finally, in C&I. Let me speak a moment about the evolution of our automated tool control system or ATC. You may remember that the ATC, we've spoken on it -- often about it on these calls, is our tool security and inventory management system that uses advanced digital imaging technology and proprietary software to automatically keep track of critical tools. 
Well in the fourth quarter, the Industrial division reached a milestone. There are now over 1,000 ATC systems deployed and the number's growing. We started out aiming at aviation -- at the aviation industry. But now through customer connection and innovation, we redesigned the product to accommodate the very tool configurations found in the natural resource and railroad industries. ATC systems are now solving problems for customers in both those segments and the momentum is building. ATC, an effective Snap-on concept, extended to more customers, helping drive C&I growth. 
Now on to the Tools Group, where we posted organic sales increase, an organic sales increase of 11.8%. The operating earnings of $63.9 million, representing a margin rate of 16.5%, up 200 basis points from last year. We often mention Snap-on runways for coherent growth, guiding principles or our long-term sales opportunities, and always prominently included is enhancing the franchise channel. Well the results for the Tools Group in the quarter represent clear validation of the progress being made along that runway. 
But in addition to the financial performance, there's other evidence that authenticates the achievements. Snap-on continues to be recognized as a franchise of choice. Once again, Snap-on was ranked among the top 25 in Entrepreneur Magazine's list of top-500 franchises. And the Franchise Business Review, which measures franchisee satisfaction, recognized Snap-on as a top-50 franchise in its latest ranking, marking the eighth consecutive year we received that award. 
And again, this quarter, like always, I had the opportunity to meet directly with franchisees at the fall meetings of our U.S. and Canadian National Franchise Advisory Council. And again on our recent kick-off meetings across the country, each of the sessions generated valuable insight, great feedback from an enthusiastic group of franchisees. 
Based on their optimism, I believe anyone interacting with these professionals would conclude our band network as stronger than ever before. 
The Tools Group success can also be traced to customer connection and innovation, essential parts of that Snap-on Value Creation. This is the Tools Group's fifth consecutive year for success -- of growth for successful product ideas derived from collaboration efforts with our franchisees, from discussions with technicians or from the independent observations of our associates. 
An example of that customer connection and innovation is our newly introduced steering rack socket. The accepted technique for replacing of power steering o-rings required removal of the entire power steering rack assembly, followed by the use of a screwdriver and a hammer to change the o-ring. The new Snap-on socket allows the tech to replace the o-ring while the power steering assembly remains in place. It can save a full hour of labor. And it's a winning timesaver, and I can tell you on the van, it's an attention grabber. The steering rack socket is a clear example of Snap-on Value Creation, customer connection and innovation, moving us down our runways for improvement, providing the means for an ongoing trajectory of positive performance. And the fourth quarter results for the Tools Group, our testimony that it's working. 
Sales in the fourth quarter were -- moving to RS&I. Moving to RS&I. Sales in the fourth quarter were $282.8 million, organic gains of 6.9%, primarily reflecting stronger software sales in independent dealerships and essential tool activity with OEM dealerships. If you add $5.7 million from our profile acquisition and $5.5 million of unfavorable foreign exchange, overall reported sales were also up 6.9% in the quarter. Operating earnings of $65.2 million rose $4.4 million, with OI margin improving 10 basis points to 23.1% as the benefits of RCI offset variation in the group's business mix. 
In the fourth quarter, RCI (sic) [RS&I] sales to vehicle OEMs grew strongly, driven by several essential diagnostic programs, tools for vehicle dealerships. So we grew with OEMs and we grew with independent shops. For the independent shops, Mitchell 1 also registered growth in the quarter, assisted by several multi-site placements of its ProDemand automotive and information product. 
Mitchell 1 is advancing ProDemand with continuing integration of repair shop information, enhanced navigation and improved mobility. Strengthening the product line and driving volume gains, ProDemand is becoming essential for effective repairs. 
In the quarter, RCI also -- RS&I also continued the introduction of its newest handheld diagnostic unit, the SOLUS Edge. With an updated processor and easier viewing features, our new SOLUS Edge offers a 50% increase in speed as well as a 15% larger screen size. And as you might expect, it's shaping up to be one of the most successful diagnostic rollouts. Along with our advancements to our handheld hardware, we also continue to enhance our software offering; fewer navigations steps, better user experience, Snap-on diagnostics, simply helping the technicians to fix cars easier and faster. 
For heavy trucks, our PRO-LINK Ultra, the diagnostic tool continues to enable top-notch service from light diesel to Class A heavy duty trucks. The PRO-LINK delivers the broadest coverage ever available in a single handheld diagnostic tool, including data for major systems like engines and transmissions and ABS brakes and instrument clusters and emissions and body control. It's the ideal tool for heavy duty fleets and dealerships, owner-operator repair shops, municipality and mobile truck services.  And as you would expect with those features, sales have been exceptional.  
Also in the period for RS&I, the equipment division performed quite well. High single-digit organic sales increases bolstered by an improved North American marketplace, gains in Western Europe and innovative new products. Once again, Snap-on Value Creation was on display in the form of the new Snap-on Motorized Wheel Balancer, ideal for shops of all sizes. The new balancer comes equipped with a sonar sensor that eliminates manual measurements of rim width, enabling faster balancing. It also features multiple placement mode, allowing users to flexibly match weight location to a variety of vehicle rims that are so much variety, common today in the car market. And it utilizes Snap-On's Virtual Plane Imaging technology, providing unsurpassed accuracy to ensure an effective balance and a satisfied customer. The new Snap-on authorized balancer: speed, flexibility and accuracy. It's received quite positive reviews, and we anticipate strong sales as the rollout continues.  We're very excited about this product. 
In fact, we're excited about the entire breadth of the RS&I offering. And in November, RS&I presented its full product portfolio at the annual SEAMS show in Las Vegas. The group's equipment business, including Challenger Lifts and Pro-Cut brake lathes, new acquisitions, were featured along with our diagnostics; Mitchell 1, business solutions and equipment solutions product offering, all on display in one booth under the banner ""Snap-on Total Solution."" Customer reaction was enthusiastic, and our sales for the event were strong. 
We believe the RS&I group, with state-of-the-art undercar equipment, a strong product line of repair information solutions and award-winning diagnostics products, is capturing an increased presence with shop owners and managers, and the results confirm it. Well, that's our fourth quarter. Opco organic sales rising 9.8%, EPS of $1.97 in the quarter, 23.1% higher than last year, progress registered along all our runways for coherent growth and advancements down each of our runways for improvement, but especially in customer connection and innovation and certainly rapid continuous improvement, or RCI, all of that helping to drive a 16.9% operating margin, up 140 basis points. It clearly was an encouraging quarter. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Aldo."

Our fourth quarter consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales of $857.4 million in the quarter increased $59.9 million or 7.5% from 2013 levels, reflecting broad-based gains across all of our operating segments. Orga",1593,"Thanks, Nick. Our fourth quarter consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales of $857.4 million in the quarter increased $59.9 million or 7.5% from 2013 levels, reflecting broad-based gains across all of our operating segments. Organically, sales increased 9.8%, excluding $5.7 million of acquisition-related sales and $21.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. Consolidated gross profit of $411.3 million, increased $32.8 million from 2013 levels. The gross profit margin of 48% in the quarter improved 50 basis points, primarily due to savings from RCI initiatives and benefits from higher sales, partially offset by increased restructuring and other costs. 
Operating expenses of $266.1 million increased $11.2 million, primarily due to higher volume related and other expenses. The operating expense margin of 31.1% improved 90 basis points, mostly due to sales volume leverage. We incurred $1.1 million of restructuring costs in the quarter. There were no restructuring costs in the fourth quarter of last year. 
As a result of these factors, operating earnings before Financial Services of $145.2 million in the quarter increased $21.6 million or 17.5% compared to the prior year; and as a percentage of sales, improved 140 basis points to 16.9%. Operating earnings from Financial Services of $42.2 million on revenue of $59.4 million in the quarter compared to operating earnings of $33 million on revenue of $47.4 million last year. The year-over-year increases in both operating earnings and revenue, primarily reflect the continued growth of the Financial Services portfolio as well as revenue and earnings from an additional week of operations in 2014. 
As you may know, Snap-on operates on a fiscal calendar, which results in an additional week to our fiscal full year and fourth quarter every 6 years. As a result, our 2014 fiscal year contained 53 weeks of operating results, with the extra week relative to the prior year occurring in the fourth quarter. While the impact of this additional week was not material to Snap-on's consolidated fourth quarter net sales or net earnings, our Financial Services segment did earn an additional week of interest income on its financing portfolio. At the consolidated level, the net earnings benefit from the additional week of Financial Services' interest income was largely offset by a corresponding additional week of fixed expenses, primarily personnel-related costs and interest expense. 
Consolidated operating earnings of $187.4 million in the quarter increased $30.8 million or 19.7%. And the operating margin of 20.4% improved 190 basis points from 18.5% a year ago. Our fourth quarter effective income tax rate was 32.1% in both the fourth quarters of 2014 and 2013. 
Finally, net earnings in the quarter of $116.2 million or $1.97 per diluted share increased $21.7 million or $0.37 per share from 2013 levels, representing a 23.1% increase in diluted earnings per share. For the full year 2014, net earnings of $421.9 million or $7.14 per diluted share increased $71.6 million or $1.21 per share from 2013 levels, representing a 20.4% increase in diluted earnings per share. 
Now let's turn to our segment results. Starting with the commercial and industrial, or C&I Group, on Slide 7. Sales of $298.2 million in the quarter were up 9.9% organically, primarily reflecting double-digit gains in sales to customers in critical industries and in our Asia/Pacific operations as well as mid-single-digit sales increase in our European-based hand tools business. Gross profit in the C&I group totaled $113.4 million in the quarter. Gross margin of 38% decreased 90 basis points from 2013 levels, primarily due to a shift in sales activity that included higher volume sales to the military and increased sales in our Asia/Pacific operations as well as higher restructuring costs, partially offset by savings from RCI initiatives. 
Operating expenses of $72.9 million in the quarter, decreased $0.3 million from 2013 levels. The operating expense margin of 24.4% improved 140 basis points, primarily due to the sales volume leverage including benefits from the sales shift just mentioned. 
As a result of these factors, fourth quarter operating earnings for the C&I segment of $40.5 million increased $3.4 million or 9.2% from 2013 levels. And the operating margin of 13.6% improved 50 basis points from 13.1% last year. 
Turning now to Slide 8. Fourth quarter sales in the Snap-on Tools Group of $387.5 million increased 11.8% organically, reflecting a double-digit increase in the United States and a high single-digit gain internationally. Gross profit of $166.4 million increased $20.2 million from 2013 levels. And the gross margin of 42.9% increased 130 basis points, primarily due to the benefits from higher sales and savings from RCI initiatives. Operating expenses of $102.5 million in the quarter increased $7.3 million from 2013 levels, primarily due to higher volume-related and other expenses. The operating expense margin of 26.4% improved 70 basis points, principally due to sales volume leverage.  As a result of these factors, operating earnings of $63.9 million for the Snap-on Tools Group increased $12.9 million or 25.3%. And the operating margin of 16.5% improved 200 basis points from 14.5% last year. 
Turning to the Repair Systems and Information, or RS&I Group, shown on Slide 9. Sales of $282.8 million increased 6.9% from 2013 levels. Excluding $5.7 million of acquisition-related sales and $5.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation, organic sales were also up 6.9%, reflecting high single-digit gains in both sales of undercar equipment and sales to OEM dealerships as well as a mid-single-digit increase in sales of diagnostic and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers. Gross profit of $131.5 million in the quarter increased $9.5 million from 2013 levels. Gross margin of 46.5% increased 40 basis points, as savings from RCI and other cost reduction initiatives were partially offset by a shift in sales that included higher volumes of lower gross margin products including increased essential tool and facilitation sales to OEM dealerships. The RS&I Group also incurred higher restructuring costs in the quarter. 
Operating expenses totaled $66.3 million in the quarter. And the operating expense margin of 23.4% increased 30 basis points, primarily reflecting operating expenses for the Pro-Cut acquisition. Fourth quarter operating earnings of $65.2 million for the RS&I Group increased $4.4 million or 7.2% from prior year levels. And the operating margin of 23.1% increased 10 basis points from 23% last year. 
Now turning to Slide 10. In the fourth quarter, earnings from Financial Services of $42.2 million and revenues of $59.4 million, including contributions from the additional week of operations in fiscal 2014, compared with operating earnings of $33 million on revenue of $47.4 million last year. The average yield on finance receivables of 17.6% compared with 17.4% last year. And the average yield on contract receivables was 6 -- I'm sorry, it's 9.5% in both periods.  Originations of $232.2 million in the quarter increased 17.5% from 2013 levels. 
Moving to Slide 11. Our year-end balance sheet includes approximately $1.4 billion of gross financing receivables, including $1.2 billion from our U.S. Snap-on credit operation. Approximately 80% of our U.S. financing portfolio relates to extended credit loans to technicians. In 2014, our worldwide finance -- Financial Services portfolio grew $152.2 million. As for finance portfolio losses and delinquency trends, these continued to be in line with our expectations. 
Now turning to Slide 12. Cash provided by operations of $97.2 million in the quarter decreased $25.3 million from comparable 2013 levels as higher net earnings in 2014 were more than offset by net increases in operating assets and liabilities, including the timing of estimated tax and other payments, and $10 million of higher discretionary pension plan contributions. Net cash used by investing activities of $46 million included $30.7 million to fund a net increase in finance receivables. Capital expenditures of $17.3 million in the quarter compared with $19.9 million last year. Full year capital expenditures totaled $80.6 million. 
Turning to Slide 13. Days sales outstanding for trade receivables of 61 days compared with 62 days at 2013 year-end. Inventories increased $41.1 million from 2013 year-end levels, primarily to support continued higher customer demand and new product introductions and from the addition of inventories related to Pro-Cut. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 3.7 compared with 3.8 turns at 2013 year-end. Our year-end cash position of $132.9 million decreased $84.7 million from 2013 year-end levels, largely due to the March 2014 repayment of $100 million of debt at maturity. The net decrease in cash also reflects year-to-date impacts of funding $746.2 million of new finance receivables, dividend payments of $107.6 million, $80.6 million for capital expenditures, the repurchase of 680,000 shares for $79.3 million and the acquisition of Pro-Cut for $41.3 million. These uses of cash were partially offset by $591.4 million of cash from collections of finance receivables and $397.9 million of cash from operations. Our net debt-to-capital ratio was 26.3% at both 2014 and 2013 year ends.
In addition to our $132.9 million of cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $700 million in available credit facilities. And our current short-term credit ratings allow us to access the commercial paper markets. At 2014 year-end, we had $37 million of commercial paper borrowings outstanding. 
This concludes my remarks on our fourth quarter performance. I'll now briefly review a few outlook items for 2015. We anticipate that capital expenditures in 2015 will be in the range of $80 million to $90 million. We also expect that our full year 2015 effective income tax rate will be at or below our full year 2014 rate of 32.1%. 
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick?"

We believe our fourth quarter and full year results are clear evidence of the abundant opportunities that lie along our strategic runways for growth and of our continuing progress of taking advantage of those possibilities and in achieving amidst challenge and turbulence. The vehicle repair market is both favorable economically and familiar operationally, and we are advancing in that arena. The van channel is being enhanced. The Tools Group is continuing to rise, sales up 11.8%, operating margin increased by 200 basis points. And we believe the franchise -- that franchisee confidence and capability are stronger than ever. 
We're expanding repair shop owners and managers, profitable growth in dealerships and independent shops, Pro-Cut and Challenger integrated smoothly giving us more to sell, an OI margin of 23.1% and volume growth of 6.9%. We're reaching into new areas for new customers, growing coherently. The extension to critical industry is working. Double-digit growth with those customers in the quarter, 4 straight quarters of robust increases. And we're building firm physical capabilities in emerging markets. Activity in China and in India, up nicely in the quarter. Put that progress together with our with commitment to Snap-on Value Creation, and you will see encouraging results. You see organic sales increases of 9.8% and a margin gain of 140 basis points to 16.9%. In fact, you see our fourth quarter. And as we move forward, we know there are headwinds. We know there are more challenges. But we also believe that our team has unique opportunity rooted in growth and improvement, and has the intent and the capability to continue our positive trend of strategic and financial progress, ensuring that we will exit 2015 stronger than when we entered. 
Before I turn the call over to the operator, it's appropriate that I recognize our franchisees and associates, an extraordinary group. Once again, I know many of you are listening. Please know that this encouraging quarter is the result of your effort, for your contributions to our performance, for your support of our team and for your commitment to our future. You have my congratulations, and you have my thanks.

Each of the -- each technician, they go around and they visit various technicians for 2 to 3 days. We've grown them from, I think, 18 in the first quarter of 2012, up to around 59 in North America last year. They're not growing anymore. But suffice it to say, that big-ticket items, which tool storage is one of them, was up ahead, greater than the overall Tools Group of 11.8% in the quarter. So they pace the -- they were among the pacing elements -- big-ticket items were among the pacing elements for our growth in the Tools Group. And it's clear that the -- that those 59 in North America, and I think it's 64 international -- in total because we have some in the U.K. now and Australia, have helped drive the way. And of course, that's together with our TechKnow vans, which have increased the same way. The TechKnow vans are now up, I think, to 31, which it started at 14. So those are both helping grow this business. And it has moved faster than at 11.8%."

We had some really fine new products and the numbers were the like last year. Compared to just, what, 2006, they're several times, as I said many times, that number. And I would say that they are divided, kind of, not quite equally. I'd say the Tools Group gets a little more of those because we have more people really in the workplaces for the automotive repair business, and therefore, those ideas are rolling back with greater frequency. But we are getting a good representation from the industrial business, from the critical industries. And you know, I can offer to you that we've advanced our critical industries, not hit products, but we're expanding that business. For example, we added in the year, 996 new aviation products. We added over 600 oil and gas products, military products over 800, power generation. So we're adding products. They are not all the hit products. I'm not saying that, but we added new products to create excitement in that business. The hit products are those that sell over 1 million and create the excitement. We're getting those in industrial. We're still today getting more out of the vehicle repair side of the business. Still, a very good year for that, I'm very pleased. And in fact, when you look at these numbers, it's hard for you to appreciate it, but I believe very strongly that it's generated by the enthusiasm and the attention-getting that these great new products get when people in the vans or when our salesmen call on customers and say, ""Wow, that's a new product. I'd like to get it,"" and they add other products to it."

In fact, the Tools Group now -- the Tools Group has now grown greater -- 5% or greater in, I think, the number 18 of the last 19 quarters. So they've shown some fairly strong performance. And all I can say about it, in general, David -- what I can say first, in general, is that what's happening here is the effect -- the continually increasing effect of understanding how to help the franchisees be more effective, which authored things like the vans, the Rock 'N Roll cab and the TechKnow van. And we're just getting better at bringing out new products and finding those sweet spots in the -- for the customer needs that excite the customers and get that stuff moving off the van. That's what's happening here. Our ability to make the franchisees more productive and effective and the experience that's building in our team to be able to wield this model, which has always been, I've said, the model that fell from Saturn, more effectively. One of the world's great models, those guys in the Tools Group are probably wielding it better than ever before. In this quarter, I think you might say, we had a particularly great customer connection and innovation season, like Liam just add, that's one. And two, we had things like power tools and some great power tool products that came up. I was in a shop the other day, and in fact, Monday -- Tuesday -- sorry, Tuesday, I was in a shop and the technician said, ""Boy, I got this new CT8850, you know, my cordless impact. I used to use these pneumatics. I used to be proud of my pneumatic. Now I've turned my compressor off because this thing is so powerful, I won't let it out of my hand."" So that was a terrific endorsement of that. He really had gone completely to that new product, and that has driven some of our sales. So you see that. The other thing about the fourth quarter is, we had a particularly great SFC, great SFC. And the tool -- again, this is the experience of the Tools Group guys that are very positive about this. They're very effective in doing this. This is one of the things that I feel about this business, if I can just say this. I think we are on a trend of continual operating improvement. I know there's a lot of discussion about currency. In fact, you can see the numbers there on -- you can see it in our numbers. In the fourth quarter, we got about $20 million worth of translation hit and when you see the K, you'll see a couple of million dollars of profitability hit associated with it. And you never know what the eventual numbers will be because you got a lot of variation in terms of what happens in the marketplace. But we're exposed in places like -- our big exposures are places like the euro, 9% of our sales in the euro and 8% in the pound and then another 5% in the Canada and so on. And we have some drips and drabs around Australia and Japan. But when you -- and the actual number depends on where those -- what activities are each of those markets. So translation and transaction depends on the cocktail of that. But one thing we know is that as we move forward, the rates from the end of the year are moving up more unfavorable. So we'll see headwinds from currency, but we are confident. We know that our operating position will keep improving despite the arithmetic associated with the currency. So things like the Tools Group, the extension of critical industries, 4 straight quarters of high single digits or double digits, those will continue to grow. And we'll exit, as I said in my comments, better in 2015 than when we entered."

He only mentioned how we could get better or how satisfied he was with certain of our new products. So I see this. And I see it across our product line. Our people are confident of our hand tools. Our people are confident of our tool storage because they are beautiful pieces. Our people are confident about our diagnostics and our software because they provide a better insight to repairing the car than ever before. And you know what's happening in the marketplace now, it used to be garages wanted diagnostics. Well with the extension of all the computers on cars, every technician needs to have a diagnostics to repair these days.  And so you can see this kind of confidence in our franchisees.

But actually, I don't think it's that surprising. This is a great business. It's a great business that has a lot of opportunity and runway further. So we are not so surprised by such things because it is a business that has so much untapped opportunity for both growth and improvement. Let me come back to the idea of keeping it growing. Yes, it is a challenge. But you know that we've grown -- the Tools Group has grown 11.8%, 6%, 6.6%, 6.0%, 10.2%, 9.5% in the subsequent quarters, same-store sales. And then the other thing is, we're getting better at bringing out new products. We just launched another tool storage unit at the kickoffs, David. And you know what it is? It's a tool storage. It's these tool storage, big boxes, you can envision them, and they're gleaming in different colors. They've got great features. You can plug in your power tools and all this stuff, and now we equip them with a downtown sound bar. Now I don't know if you've ever been in a garage, but a sound bar in a tool storage box sounds like a cool thing to me. Everybody who sees them and hears them is going crazy. So new product is a great -- are a great advantage, so that helps it, too. And then the other thing is, we just have to keep thinking of new ways. The Rock 'N Roll Cab was an innovation by the -- brilliant innovation by the Tools Group guys to figure out that they could help the van -- virtually expand the space of the van, which is one of the limitations. They just have to keep coming up with ideas. That doesn't mean that the Rock 'N Roll Cabs won't contribute more. I mean, they've been pretty stable for a fairly long time. I want to say that the vans have been, like, year-over-year -- if you wanted to look at last year at this time, North America had 56 vans, now we have 59. So they only moved up 3 and still it grew at 11.8% in total. And tool storage and big ticket was above that. So they figured out some way to do it without too much increase in sales. Having said that, they also -- we'll be tasking them to come up with new ideas to try to help this situation. The final point is that when you look at the originations versus the Tools Group, it's a little more complex. You have the question of originations and it does -- it is driven by big-ticket items, but it's also a little bit driven by the variation between our sales and the franchisees' sales, of course. The originations track a sale to a technician; our sales track a sale from us to the franchisee. So there's a little bit of timing difference, and it can muddy the water a little bit."

Remember first -- I think, first, that we start with a great product enabled by an extraordinary base of information with, I think, better insight on repair than anybody else. We have a product that will tell you, okay, if you have a make and model and powertrain of a car, and it's a certain model, what the typical repair is on that model based on big data. It's the only one available. And we have an understanding. A lot of the competition comes at the lower end with code readers and so on, a little bit less sophisticated. Technicians are looking for more levels of sophistication. They want to read what the car says. They want to be able to put the car through functional tests, through its paces. They want to be able to reprogram it. They want to be able to see what the OEM says as a standard fix. And then they want the whisper tips and the tips that come out of the big data. We have all of that. Almost no one else does. So our product keeps evolving and getting stronger in that regard. And if anything, the requirements for this gets bigger because it used to be -- the computer content on cars are getting more and more. This is one of the reasons why nobody can repair cars anymore because they're so complicated. And even in garages, you need -- what used to be a situation where you needed one big unit to handle everybody and you could pass it around, well, you can't be working on a car today, in many cases, without these things. So every technician wants one. And so you have that. And then finally, finally, we have our franchisee armed with the TechKnow vans, up close and personal with the technician to help him through the product, tell him what he needs to know, how to use it, and find out what his particular problems are. We have customer connection and customer delivery like no one else has. And so that's why we don't feel so much heat from those other guys. We think this is a robust market that's going to keep growing. We think it's only going to get more demand in this area. And we think we have significant advantages in data, in hardware and in software. And our software business -- our hardware business was strong. We just had a great launch. And our software business was up more than the hardware business in the quarter."

As usual, I'll start with the highlights of our first quarter and along the way, I'll give you perspective on our results, our markets and on the progress we've made. 
In Aldo, we'll move into a more detailed review of the financials. I believe that our first quarter once again provided strong evidence of Snap-on advancing along our runways for both growth and for improvement. Our EPS in the quarter was $1.87, up from $1.62 last year. That rise reflects an opco operating margin of 16.7%, an increase of 120 basis points. Combining those opco gains with earnings of $40.3 million from Financial Services brought Snap-on's consolidated operating margin to 20.1% compared to the 18.6% registered last year. 
Our operating improvement in the quarter came on organic sales growth of 9.9%. Overall sales in the quarter were $827.8 million, a rise of 5.1% from the prior year and those gains included significant unfavorable foreign currency translation of $38.5 million or 540 basis points. 
Currency is headwind towards last year is likely to continue throughout the year. And if the presence where whole, we'll rise somewhat going forward. But we are very encouraged by our organic growth in both volume and profitability, and we believe both represent a continuation of our strengthening position and capability and of the generally favorable business environment for each of our operating groups. 
For us, the quarter's results are testimony to the abundant opportunity along our runways for growth and have our ability to take advantage as conditions unfold. 
Like in past quarters, environment surrounding our automotive repair-related businesses, the Tools Group and the RS&I group, is generally positive. The changing technologies across the fleet continue to drive the need for new problem-solving products, making those markets robust. 
And now with regard to Tools Group, has enhanced our franchise network with advanced productivity and with innovative marketing, taking clear advantage of the favorability of itself more to existing customers and to reach new customers, all on its way to strong growth. 
At the same time, RS&I has also grown, capitalizing on those positives and utilizing its broader product line to expand and repair shops owners and managers. 
Now C&I serving customers in critical industries. And the most international of our groups does face more variations in the market. European operations are confronted with large differences across the business from the relatively calm U.K. to the turbulence of the Middle East, of the challenges of Russia, to the political uncertainties of newly elected governments in places like India and Indonesia. But as in past quarters, the opportunities outweigh those headwinds. And when combined with our growing range of customer-driven products and with our expanding capabilities aimed specifically at the needs of industries and customers, C&I again showed gains, extending in critical industries and building in emerging markets. 
Besides advances on our runways for growth, we also made progress on our runways for improvement with Snap-on Value Creation in safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and rapid continuous improvement, or RCI, as we call it. Now RCI has become a part of the fabric of daily activity at Snap-on. You can see it in the results. OI margins up. And you can see it in advance like our annual RCI conference have recently just down the road in Illinois. 
Nearly 400 people, almost 40 best practice teams came together to share ideas, vie for awards and celebrate their progress, bringing the learning and the enthusiasm back home to their local teams. 
You can't help but walk away from these events encouraged and convinced that there's great potential for further improvement. 
Last, the environment. Of course, as always, there are headwinds. Market-to-market variations in difficult macros. But despite the challenges, our operations moved significantly along each of our runways for both growth and improvement and you can see it throughout the numbers. 
Now let's move to the segments. In the C&I Group, organic sales were up 9.8%, with contributions coming from our European, U.S. and Asian operations. From an earnings perspective, C&I operating income of $44 million increased $4.9 million or 12.5%, and that represents a margin rate for C&I, up 14.8% and expansion of 130 basis points. 
SNA Europe again reported volume growth, this time similar to that achieved by C&I overall, broad gains in many of our markets led by selling strength and by products that generate real enthusiasm. But SNA Europe's improvement in the quarter goes beyond sales growth and farther than the gains made from past restructuring. Our initiatives to improve productivity with focus on both cost and product development are clearly evident in the operations achieved. You can see it again this quarter. Organic sales were up. Profits. Profits were up more, illustrating the power of RCI even in the European environment that remains challenged. 
Industrial division was also part of C&I rise. It grew in a number of critical industries communities like power generation, mining, railroads and the military. As everybody knows, the military sector remains uncertain. But having said that, we've made the most of the opportunities available. This time, the opening arose with the changing roles of various units as the troops were redeployed back to the United States. Actually, that's a major theme for our first quarter, making the most of the opportunities as they arise amid the turbulence. 
Another big factor in the games in critical industry were expanded product offerings targeted at practical workplace needs. One example introduced in the quarter was the PDX series of air drills, ideal for the aviation industry. Made in our North Carolina plant, these pneumatic drills used in applications ranging from assembly to metalworking, perfect for drilling ferrous and nonferrous metals, plastics and composite materials. The kind of versatility that's so helpful in aviation applications. And the federable trigger provides outstanding control and unparalleled runout performance, authoring great accuracy. 
Beside the utility of the Tool, the low-sound, low-vibration soft-grip and aluminum housing offers maximum comfort with reduced operator fatigue. 
Another attractive feature in the work place to ease the professionals' task and enable more consistency throughout the day. These drills are specialty usual when performing important repair work on damaged aircraft, an application that must be repeatable and certainly critical in nature. We believe we have another industry winner. The PDx drilling is superior aviation tool consistent with the Snap-on name. 
Our Industrial division also has driven growth by leveraging a Snap-on RCI experience, participating in several customer-sponsored lean events right on the customer side. Side By side with the customers' local team. Snap-on people sharing their experiences and their insights with rapid continues improving, helping customers solve their problem -- but all the problems, but all the while aiming deeper, practical understanding of crucial tasks in critical industries, creating opportunities, tailor our products to the work and to drive more sales. We say we help professionals in solving the critical. RCI's becoming the tool to do just that. 
Our Asia/Pacific division also poses higher activity, registering progress, building the physicals and limiting the impact of the economic difficulties in Japan. I was just there attending our Annual Resellers conference, this year was in Xeon in China. Bringing together enthusiastic Snap-on associate and resellers from all across the region. New Asianized products were introduced, training seminars were conducted and the group's enthusiasm confirmed our extended opportunities in Asia/Pacific at C&I. 
Now on the Tools Group. Organic sales up 12.9%, solid growth in all geographies. The group's operating earnings of $59.8 million represented a margin rate of 15.8%, up 150 basis points. The Tools Group. The results continue to speak for themselves. They clearly demonstrate ongoing progress along one of our runways for coherent growth, enhancing the franchise channel. And there's abundant evidence of the strength of positive trajectory of that channel. It displayed clearly in our franchisee metrics, financial and physical. Important indicators of network help like sales per van and franchisee turnover. We monitor them closely and they're favorable across the board. 
Our direct interactions with the franchisees, meetings like the 2015 kickoffs held all over the network earlier in the year. They were marked by an -- I can tell you, they were marked by enthusiasm and optimism, by commitment and energy. Gatherings of entrepreneurs and professionals, confident in reaching higher. 
Snap-on Value Creation process, the processes. They're also critical importance of the Tools Group process. Innovative new products. Many, many of these launched from the customer connections we observed on a daily basis. Those solutions, those products are significant players in driving the group's upward trajectory. An example is the KR 1163 stools storage cap with the power tool organizer system. Based on customer connections made on a Rock 'N Roll express bands. These model transforms the bottom drawer, the box into a customizes secure, easy to access storage system for frequently used power tools. It's a feature that can make a technician's work easier. Visitors to our Rock 'N Roll cabs highlighted the need. Our design teams made it a reality. Customer connection, to innovation to winning products. 
Speaking of tool storage. This summer mark's our 95th year in business. And we just launched a special set up tool storage boxes, highlighting our long tradition of excellence with unique anniversary panels and custom-rich trim, etched with the years 1920 and 2015. 
New units also offered the Snap-on Atco remote locking system, another customer connection-driven option that we're confident will be quite popular. The special anniversary boxes are already gathering or generating considerable excitement on the van and in the shops. Lots of excitement around these box. And we believe they'll be strong sellers, clear testimony on the strength of the Snap-on brand and of the bond between Snap-on and professionals. 
More innovation can be seen in products like the new Snap-on half inch drive 36-inch breaker bar, the SHN 36. Originally developed from customer sections of the heavy-duty mechanics, desiring more -- a longer handle for increased leverage. The addition of the soft grip provides added control on comfort and that's a premium when you're removing tires or adjusting tracks on construction and agricultural equipment, or loosening head bolts on large engines. A much improved product will make work easier. Innovation even on the most established of product lines. 
Finally, I want to mention the Tools Group with RCI. It's clearly evident in the financials, but to double down on a testimony. I spoke before on our Annual RCI Conference where a team from Tools was awarded the grand champion at this year's event. The Tools Group rework center won for their work on substantially reducing turnaround time, highlighting that Snap-on. Shop floor has no monopoly on RCI and illustrating that even in and experienced organization like the Tools Group, potential RCI opportunities abound, up and down throughout and across the business. 
And we can't talk about the Tools Group without speaking of that strategic partner, our Financial Services organization. With each quarter, Snap-on Credit becomes more attuned to just what programs can best aid our franchisees, and the first quarter demonstrated that progress clearly. Portfolio growth, profits up over 17%. And all the while, holding delinquencies to a relatively low level. Snap-on Credit, the greatest historic tools business, and you can see that relationship play out in the positive trend. 
Now let's move to RS&I. The first quarter organic sales for RS&I rose 6.3%, forward games with both OEM dealerships and with independent shops. Operating earnings of $63.9 million were up $5.8 million. The operating margin of 23.5% rose 140 basis points. 
I've spoken often in the past about our line of successful handheld diagnostic units. As they continue to drive growth and excitement in independent repair space, the first quarter was no exception with our various Pro and modest Ultra units in recognized by Undercard Digest in this year's list of top 10 tools, continuing our strength of award-winning products with that publication. The Undercard Digest bases its selections on the votes of actual users. The award confirms that our handheld diagnostics strongly with professionals and it demonstrates the power of customer connection and innovation in generating unique productivity solution. That's what these tools are about. 
Various Pro and the -- they are also key components of our next-generation advanced diagnostic workstations. Launched in February, these new workstations include a handheld diagnostic unit and docking station, a flat screen monitor and a custom Snap-on toolbox. They provide comprehensive diagnostic support, fix scars accurately and quickly. And they go along way in reinforcing the shops' images, having strong professional capability in the electronics arena. A feature, we believe, have significant value to many independent garages as they strive to build customer confidence in this environment of rising vehicle technology. With more than 800 workstations sold since the launch, this is another one of our hit products, with over $1 million in first-year sales. And it's another edge to our growing track record of innovation success and its driving sales progress. 
Our equipment division also registered grains in the quarter was several national accounts, in part exceeding by highlighting our expanding product bundle, including Challenger Lifts, Pro-Cut on-car brake lace, as well as the new under car equipment and broad diagnostic offerings. Snap-on Equipment, increased productivity for the automotive repair shop -- for automotive repair shop networks, an advantage rooted in our expanded and enhanced line of products. 
Finally, we continue to see further progress with our next heavy-duty and fleet information systems, as well as progress with the improved functionality and comprehensive content contained in ProDemand and Sure track products, all are differentiated -- differentiating offerings that lead to more business. Armed with those products, we achieved a number of multilocation customer wins in the quarter, displacing competitors and gaining traction across the marketplace. Snap-on information products, unique database solutions, effective navigation systems for speed to repair, all emphasizing our growing strength and vehicle information and they help drive RS&I sales again this quarter. 
But that's the highlights. Significant progress was made in the quarter. Organic sales rising 9.9% along all our runways for coherent growth. EPS of $1.87, up 15.4%. Gains achieved through our Snap-on Value Creation Processes. RCI and customer connection shining -- especially shining through, strengthening our businesses and driving to a 16.7% opco operating margin, up 120 basis points. It was an encouraging quarter. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Aldo."

Net sales of $827.8 million in the quarter were up 9.9% organically, reflecting broad-based growth across all of our operating segments. On reported basis, net sales, including $38.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation, increased $40.3 million or 5.1% from 2014 levels. As you know, Snap-on has significant international operations and is subject to foreign currency translation fluctuations, largely due to this recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar, foreign currency movements adversely impacted our year-over-year sales comparisons by approximately 540 basis points. 
Consolidated gross profit of $410.1 million increased $31.4 million from 2014 levels. Gross margin of 49.5% in the quarter improved 140 basis points, primarily due to benefits from higher sales, lower restructuring costs and savings from RCI initiatives. 
Operating expenses of $272.2 million increased $15.2 million, largely due to higher volume-related and other expenses, partially offset by savings from RCI initiatives. The operating expense margin of 32.8% increased 20 basis points from 2014 levels. No restructuring costs were incurred in the first 3 months of 2015. 
Last year, we incurred $2 million of restructuring costs. 
Pension expense in the quarter was approximately $2 million higher as compared to the prior year, reflecting updated pension plan assumptions for 2015, which include the effects of lower discount rates, as well as increased life expectancies. As a result of these factors, operating earnings before Financial Services of $137.9 million in the quarter, including $6.4 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased $16.2 million from prior-year levels as a percentage of sales improved 120 basis points to 16.7%. 
Financial Services revenue of $57.4 million in the quarter increased 14.3% from 2014 levels, while operating earnings of $40.3 million increased 17.2%. The increases in both revenue and operating earnings primarily reflect the continued growth of the Financial Services portfolio.

Finally, net earnings of $110.5 million or $1.87 per diluted share increased $14.6 million or $0.25 per share, representing a 15.4% increase in diluted earnings per share. 
Now let's turn to our segment results. Starting with the Commercial & Industrial, or C&I Group, on Slide 7. Sales of $297.5 million in the quarter were up 9.8% organically, primarily reflecting similar sales strength, both in critical industries and in our European-based hand tools business. 
Gross profit for C&I Group totaled $116.5 million in the quarter and the gross margin of 39.2% improved 40 basis points from 2014 levels, largely due to savings from RCI initiatives, primarily in Europe. 
Operating expenses of $72.5 million in the quarter decreased $1.1 million. The operating expense margin of 24.4% improved 90 basis points, largely due to the sales volume leverage. As a result of these factors, operating earnings for the C&I segment of $44 million, including $1.3 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased $4.9 million from 2014 levels. The operating margin of 14.8% improved 130 basis points. 
Turning now to Slide 8. First quarter sales on the Snap-on Tools Group of $378.2 million increased 12.9% organically, reflecting comparable sales gains in both the company's U.S. and international franchise operations. Gross profit of $166.3 million increased $18.3 million from 2014 levels and the gross margin of 44% improved 90 basis points, primarily due to benefits from higher sales. 
Operating expenses of $106.5 million increased $7.7 million from 2014 levels, mostly due to higher volume-related expenses.

Turning to the repair, systems and information, RS&I Group showed on Slide 9. Sales of $272.3 million in the quarter increased 6.3% organically from 2014 levels. The organic sales increase primarily reflects a high single-digit gain in sales of undercar equipment, as well as mid-single digit gains in both sales to OEM dealerships and the sales of diagnostic and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers.
Gross profit of $127.3 million increased $9.3 million over 2014 levels. And gross margin of 46.8% improved 190 basis points, principally due to savings from RCI and other cost reduction initiatives and $2 million of lower restructuring cost.  Operating expenses totaled $63.4 million in the quarter.

Now turning to Slide 10. In the first quarter, operating earnings from Financial Services of $40.3 million and revenue of $57.4 million, with operating earnings of $34.4 million and revenue of $50.2 million last year. The average yield on finance receivables of 17.7% in the quarter compared with 17.5% last year. The average yield on contract receivables was 9.5% in both periods. Originations of $230.7 million increased 14.2% from 2014 levels.
Moving to Slide 11. As of quarter-end, our balance sheet includes approximately $1.4 billion of gross financing receivables, including $1.2 billion from our U.S. Snap-on credit operation. Approximately 80% of our U.S. financing portfolio relates to extended credit loans to technicians. During the quarter, our worldwide finance portfolio grew approximately $23 million.  As for finance portfolio losses and delinquency trends, these continue to be in line with our expectations. 
Now turning to Slide 12. Cash provided by operations of $78.1 million in the quarter decreased $10.2 million from comparable 2014 levels as higher net earnings in 2015 were more than offset by net increases in operating assets and liabilities, largely as a result of a $15 million discretionary domestic pension plan contribution, as well as higher tax-related payments in the current year. 
Net cash used by investing activities of $59.5 million included $38.6 million to fund a net increase in finance receivables. 
Capital expenditures of $18.1 million in the quarter were comparable to the prior year.
Turning to Slide 13. Days sales outstanding for trade receivables of 60 days compared with 61 days at 2014 year end. Inventories increased 6.8 million from 2014 year end levels, primarily to support continued higher customer demand and new product introductions. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 3.6 compared with 3.7 turns at 2014 year end. At quarter end, cash position of $114.4 million decreased $18.5 million from 2014 year end levels. Net decrease includes the impact of funding $198.8 million of new finance receivables, the repurchase of 340,000 shares for $49.7 million, dividend payments of $30.9 million in capital expenditures of $18.1 million. These cash decreases were partially offset by $160.2 million of cash from collections of finance receivables, $78.1 million of cash generated from operations and $22.8 million of cash from a net increase in short-term borrowings. Our net debt-to-cap ratio of 27.6% compared with 26.3% at 2014 year-end. 
In addition to our $114 million of cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $700 million in available credit facilities, and our current short-term credit ratings allow us to access commercial paper markets. At first quarter end, we had $52.5 million of commercial paper borrowings outstanding. 
This concludes my remarks on our first quarter performance. Now I'll turn the call over to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick?"

Now as our first quarter similar to our other quarters, growth and improvement. EPS of $1.87, up 15.4%. Once again, there were headwinds, varying economies, fluctuating currencies and political unrest, but we overcame by finding and making the most other opportunities. We've made significant progress along our runways for growth, driven by new products and new customers. Enhanced the Van channel. Tools Group organic sales up 12.9%, and we believe the network has never been stronger. Expand with repair shop owners and managers. RS&I organic sales up 6.3%. OEM, dealerships and independent shops capturing new customers with a growing product bundle, extent critical industries and build and emerging market. 
C&I organic sales up 9.8%. Europe progressing against the equal tied. Our critical industry team building our understanding of those critical workplaces, launching new products aimed at those tasks and gaining position. Once again, again this quarter, we clearly saw the effects of Snap-on Value Creation, advancing down our runway for improvement. OI margin improvements are more than 100 basis points in every group. And an overall opco margin of 16.7%, an increase of 120 basis points. It was an encouraging quarter. We believe it serves as more testimony, great testimony. That our business models have the strength, our runways offer the opportunity and our teams have the capability to continue this trend positive progress as we move forward even amid headwind. 
Before I turn the call over to the operator, it's appropriate that I mention our franchisees and associates. I know many of you are listening today. Encouraging performance of the first quarter and the positive trends are continuing due to your contribution and commitments. For the results you've offered -- authored, for the results you've authored, you have my congratulations. And for your dedication and support to our team, you have my thanks.

I expect good news in every market every quarter, I think, because we're not -- the thing is we're in early days in penetrating critical industries. It's an aspect of coherent growth that what we are doing there is duplicating what we have done for automotive repair technicians all these years. We're doing them for other people in other industries, observing work and making it easier with just just the right tools, whether it's software or hardware. And so an element of that is learning about the industry. So it's early days. Now we have very industries in there, aviation, the military, oil and gas, power generation, mining. One of the advantages of this is we don't really have in the way of share in these businesses, so therefore, each quarter rise and fall is not so much on the effect of the industry, just on our own performance. So we have lumpiness from section to section or from industry to industry. In this particular quarter, we actually saw fine performance in places, like I said, in my power generation, mining, railroads, the military. The military was at this time, because we were able to see opportunities. Aviation is a big business in that area and oil and gas actually, actually was up even slightly in this quarter. So we saw the usual lumpiness from operation to operation but the critical industries business is really is the driver behind C&I. You see the C&I growth across those segments. So I didn't see any particular surprises. I guess if you are looking at our business, you might say gee, they grew in oil and gas even though the market was weak. My view was we don't have that big a share in oil and gas, therefore, we can grow against the markets."

And that's allowance itself more same customers and reach other customers, which they had on the routes, but they haven't been calling on. So the effects are these, I think. Maybe threefold. 1 effect is I think constructed many times. I think there. They're really breaking to the natural boundaries of that model by adding space with the Rock 'N Roll cabs, and you can see on the progression of the tool storage and breaking through the time by adding help with things like the TechKnow vans. Now I think we have 66, 67 Rock 'N Roll -- 66 Rock 'N Roll Van throughout the world now. And we have now up to 35 TechKnow Van, up about 4 since last quarter. And so you can see breaking that national boundary is helping. Secondly, boy, we're using as much as possible our customer connection. We spend a lot of time in the shops, and we are organizing that process in getting that information back into the innovation process and rolling out new products like that 36-inch breaker bar. People might look at that and say, what's that? It's just a long bar. But the idea was it wasn't really available in the marketplace and the ones that were available aren't as comfortable. Innovation doesn't have to be earth shattering, it just have to make work easier in the space in the tools [indiscernible] how to do that. And then thirdly, they're looking at the franchisees and saying, we know your time is valuable. We're going to make it better. We're going to drive our RCI into the van, and that's what's resulting these kinds of thing. The numbers were up 12.8% in the quarter -- 12.9% in the quarter. 11.8% the quarter before that, 6% the quarter before that, 6.6% the quarter before that and 6 before that. In fact, 19 of the last 20 quarters, they've been 6% or above. And that's -- what's driving at all is tuning that business. It's kind of -- if step back and you look at the auto repair business, you'll say it's going to go better than GDP. 4% to 6% is with we say. But if you have capability that resonates with those franchisees like they figured out, you see these kind of numbers."

But in my remarks, you might've heard the whole idea of the power tool drawer organizer at the bottom at the tool storage box. That came from the Rock 'N Roll cab. We have these -- and their company stores. They're not selling, but their company stores are rolling there. People Rock 'N Roll cabs and they started talking about boy, would be cool if we have the power to organizer in one of the stores. We got that idea, we give it to the engineers.

New car sales [indiscernible] help us that much except for the fact that -- except for the broader fact that new car sales are probably accompanying a more positive economy.

They were up this quarter and we continued with the Nordic countries, and we had some business in Turkey. Of course, Eastern Europe was weak. So -- and Spain was up off of a relatively slow pace.

Now they're at 17,000, or 18 -- between 17,000 and 18,000. So they shrunk. The independent have stayed about the same, the independence have taken more share. That started before the recession. That seems to maybe -- this date always trail, so that's kind of leveled off, a lot of people think now. But I think there hasn't been a big change in the characteristics, except independence are becoming more sophisticated because they have to deal with the changing technologies. 20 years ago, there were 50 engine codes on a car now despite 1,000 engine codes. It's hard to fix a car without a diagnostic unit now, and we have the best one. And so we're selling them to technicians now, not just the garages. That's helping drive our business. So the technology change in the independent space that's why I talked about the diagnostic workstations. Because the independent garages know that people know their cars are more like spaceships these days, and they want to bring them to people who can fix them. And therefore, this diagnostic unit makes it look like wow, this is the computer here that can fix the car, help fix the car and boasts confidence. And actually helps general in terms of accuracy. So if anything, we're seeing a greater demand by products in independent shops and other shops because of the changing technology. That's the big change."

As usual, I'll start with the highlights of our first quarter. And along the way, I'll give you perspective on our results, our markets and on the progress we've made, and Aldo will move into a more detailed review of the financials. 
I believe that our first quarter, once again, provided strong evidence of Snap-on advancing along our runways for both growth and for improvement. Our EPS in the quarter was $1.87, up from $1.62 last year. That rise reflects an opco operating margin of 16.7%, an increase of 120 basis points. Combining those opco gains with earnings of $40.3 million from Financial Services brought Snap-on's consolidated operating margin to 20.1% compared to the 18.6% registered last year. Our operating improvement in the quarter came on organic sales growth of 9.9%. Overall sales in the quarter were $827.8 million, a rise of 5.1% from the prior year, and those gains included significant unfavorable foreign currency translation of $38.5 million or 540 basis points. 
Now currency is a headwind. It was last year. It's likely to continue throughout the year. And if the present rates hold, it will rise somewhat going forward. But we are very encouraged by our organic growth in both volume and profitability, and we believe both represent a continuation of our strengthening position and capability and of the generally favorable business environment for each of our operating groups. For us, the quarter's results are testimony to the abundant opportunity along our runways for growth and our -- and of our ability to take advantage as conditions unfold. 
Like in past quarters, the environment surrounding our automotive repair-related businesses, the Tools Group and the RS&I group, is generally positive. The changing technologies across the fleet continue to drive the need for new problem-solving products, making those markets robust. In that regard, Tools Group have enhanced our franchise network with vans productivity and with innovative marketing, taking clear advantage of the favorability to sell more to existing customers and to reach new customers, all on its way to strong growth. At the same time, RS&I has also grown, capitalizing on those positives and utilizing its broader product line to expand with repair shop owners and managers. 
Now C&I, serving customers in critical industries and the most international of our groups, does face more variations in the market. European operations are confronted with large differences across the business, from the relatively calm U.K. to the turbulence of the Middle East, to the challenges of Russia, to the political uncertainties of newly elected governments in places like India and Indonesia. But as in past quarters, the opportunities outweigh those headwinds. And when combined with our growing range of customer-driven products and with our expanding capabilities aimed specifically at the needs of industries and customers, C&I again showed gains, extending in critical industries and building in emerging markets. 
Besides advancements on our runways for growth, we also made progress down our runways for improvement with Snap-on Value Creation in safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and rapid continuous improvement, or RCI as we call it. RCI has become a part of the fabric of daily activity at Snap-on. You can see it in the results, OI margins up. And you can see it in events like our annual RCI conference held recently just down the road in Illinois, nearly 400 people, almost 40 best practice teams came together to share ideas, vie for awards and celebrate their progress, bringing the learning and the enthusiasm back home to their local teams. You can't help but walk away from these events encouraged and convinced that there's great potential for further improvement. 
Last, the environment. Of course, as always, there are headwinds, market-to-market variations and difficult macros. But despite the challenges, our operations moved significantly along each of our runways for both growth and improvement and you can see it throughout the numbers. 
Now let's move to the segments. In C&I Group, organic sales were up 9.8%, with contributions coming from our European, U.S. and Asian operations. From an earnings perspective, C&I operating income of $44 million increased $4.9 million or 12.5%, and that represents a margin rate for C&I, up 14.8%, an expansion of 130 basis points. 
SNA Europe again recorded volume growth. This time, similar to that achieved by C&I overall, broad gains in many of our markets led by selling strength and by products that generate real enthusiasm. But SNA Europe's improvement in the quarter goes beyond sales growth and farther than the gains made from past restructuring. Our initiatives to improve productivity with focus on both cost and product development are clearly evident in the operations achieved. You can see it again this quarter. Organic sales were up. The profits, profits were up more, illustrating the power of RCI even in the European environment that remains challenged. 
Industrial division was also part of C&I rise. It grew in a number of critical industries, areas like power generation, mining, railroads and the military. As everybody knows, the military sector remains uncertain. But having said that, we've made the most of the opportunities available. This time, the opening arose with the changing roles of various units as the troops were redeployed back to the United States. Actually, that's a major theme for our first quarter, making the most of the opportunities as they arise amid the turbulence. 
Another big factor in the gains in critical industry were expanded product offerings targeted at practical workplace needs. One is -- one new example introduced in the quarter was the PDX (sic) [PDR] series of air drills, ideal for the aviation industry, made in our Murphy, North Carolina plant. And these pneumatic drills are used in application ranging from light assembly to metalworking, perfect for drilling ferrous and nonferrous metals, plastics and composite materials, the kind of versatility that's so helpful in aviation applications. And the featherable trigger provides outstanding control and unparalleled run-out performance, authoring great accuracy. Beside the utility of the tool, the low-sound, low-vibration, soft-grip and aluminum housing offers maximum comfort with reduced operator fatigue, another attractive feature in the work place to ease the professional's task and enable more consistency throughout the day. These drills are especially usual on performing important repair work on damaged aircraft steel, an application that must be repeatable and certainly critical in nature. We believe we have another industry winner. The PDX (sic) [PDR] drill is superior aviation tool consistent with the Snap-on name. 
Our Industrial division also has driven growth by leveraging the Snap-on RCI experience, participating in several customer-sponsored lean events right on the customer site, side by side with the customer's local team. Snap-on people sharing their experiences and their insight of rapid continues improving, helping customers solve their problem, but -- all the problems, but all the while aiming deeper, practical understanding of the -- of crucial tasks in critical industries, creating opportunities to tailor our products to the work and to drive more sales. We say we help professionals in solving the critical. RCI is becoming a tool to do just that. 
Our Asia Pacific division also poses a higher activity, registering progress, building the physicals and limiting the impact of the economic difficulties in Japan. I was just there attending our annual resellers conference this year within Xi'an in China, bringing together enthusiastic Snap-on associates and resellers from all across the region. New Asian-ized products were introduced, training seminars were conducted and the group's enthusiasm confirmed our extended opportunities in Asia Pacific at C&I. 
Now on to the Tools Group. Organic sales' up 12.9%, solid growth in all geographies. The group's operating earnings of $59.8 million represented a margin rate of 15.8%, up 150 basis points, the Tools Group. The results continue to speak for themselves. They clearly demonstrate ongoing progress along one of our runways for coherent growth, enhancing the franchise channel. And there's abundant evidence of the strength of positive trajectory of that channel. It displayed clearly in our franchisee metrics, financial and physical, important indicators of network help like sales per van and franchisee turnover. We monitor them closely, and they're favorable across-the-board. And our direct interactions with the franchisees, meetings like the 2015 kickoffs held all over the network earlier in the year, they were marked by -- I can tell you, they were marked by enthusiasm and optimism, by commitment and energy, gatherings of entrepreneurs and professionals confident in reaching higher. 
Snap-on Value Creation process, the processes, they're also critical components of the Tools Group progress. Innovative new products, many, many of these launched from the customer connections we observed on a daily basis. Those solutions, those products are significant players in driving the group's upward trajectory. An example is the KRL1163 tool storage cab with the power tool organizer system based on customer connections made on our Rock 'N Roll express vans. This model transforms the bottom drawer, the box, into a customized secure, easy-to-access storage system for frequently used power tools. It's a feature that can make a technician's work easier. Visitors to our Rock 'N Roll cabs highlighted the need, our design teams made it a reality, customer connection to innovation to winning products. 
Speaking of tool storage, this summer mark's our 95th year in business. And we just launched a special set of tool storage boxes, highlighting our long tradition of excellence with unique anniversary panel and custom-rich trim, etched with the years 1920 and 2015. The new units also offered the Snap-on echo remote locking system, another customer connection-driven option that we're confident will be quite popular. The specialty -- special anniversary boxes are already gathering -- generating considerable excitement on the vans and in the shops, lots of excitement around this box. And we believe they'll be strong sellers, clear testimony on the strength of the Snap-on brand and of the bond between Snap-on and professionals. 
More innovation can be seen in products like the new Snap-on 1/2-inch Drive 36-inch Breaker Bar, the SHN36 (sic) [SN36], originally developed from customer connections of the heavy-duty mechanics desiring more -- a longer handle for increased leverage. The addition of a soft grip provides added control on comfort and that's a premium when you're removing tires or adjusting tracks on construction and agricultural equipment or loosening head bolts on large engine. A much improved product will make work easier, innovation even on the most established of product lines. 
Finally, I want to mention the Tools Group efforts with RCI. Progress -- I think it's clearly evident in the financials. But to double down on a testimony -- I spoke before on our Annual RCI Conference. Well, a team from Tools was awarded the grand champion at this year's event. The Tools Group rework center won for their work on substantially reducing turnaround time, highlighting that Snap-on shop floor has no monopoly on RCI and illustrating that even in an -- even an experienced organization like the Tools Group, potential RCI opportunities abound, up and down throughout and across the business. 
And we can't talk about the Tools Group without speaking of its strategic partner, our Financial Services organization. With each quarter, Snap-on Credit becomes more attuned to just what programs can best aid our franchisees. And the first quarter demonstrated that progress clearly, portfolio growth, profits up over 17% and, all the while, holding delinquencies to a relatively low level. Snap-on Credit, a great assist to our Tools business, and you can see that relationship play out in the positive trends. 
Now let's move to RS&I. The first quarter organic sales for RS&I rose 6.3%, [indiscernible] gains with both OEM dealerships and with independent shops. Operating earnings of $63.9 million were up $5.8 million. The operating margin of 23.5% rose 140 basis points. 
I've spoken often in the past about our line of successful handheld diagnostic units. As they continue to drive growth and excitement in the independent repair space, the first quarter was no exception with our VERUS PRO and MODIS Ultra units being recognized by Undercar Digest in this year's list of top 10 tools, continuing our strength of award-winning products with that publication. The Undercar Digest bases its selections on the votes of actual users. The award confirms that our handheld diagnostics resonate strongly with professionals, and it demonstrates the power of customer connection and innovation in generating unique productivity solutions. That's what these tools are about. 
VERUS PRO and the MODIS Ultra, they're also key components of our next-generation advanced diagnostic workstations. Launched in February, these new workstations include a handheld diagnostic unit and docking station, a flat screen monitor and a custom Snap-on toolbox. They provide comprehensive diagnostic support, fix cars accurately and quickly, and they go a long way in reinforcing the shops' images, having strong professional capability in the electronics arena, a feature, we believe, is of significant value to many independent garages as they strive to build customer confidence in this environment of rising vehicle technology. With more than 800 workstations sold since the launch, this is another one of our hit products with over $1 million in the -- in first-year sales. And it's another add to our growing track record of innovation success and its driving sales progress. 
Our equipment division also registered gains in the quarter with several national accounts, in part exceeding by highlighting our expanding product bundle, including Challenger Lifts, Pro-Cut on-car brake lathes, as well as the new undercar equipment and broad diagnostic offerings. Snap-on equipment increased productivity for the automotive repair shop -- for automotive repair shop networks, an advantage rooted in our expanded and enhanced line of products. 
Finally, we continue to see further progress with our NEXIQ heavy-duty and fleet information systems as well as progress with the improved functionality and comprehensive content contained in Mitchell1's ProDemand and SureTrack products, all are differentiated -- differentiating offerings that lead to more business. Armed with those products, we achieved a number of multi-location customer wins in the quarter, displacing competitors and gaining traction across the marketplace. Snap-on information products, unique database solutions, effective navigation systems for speed to repair, all emphasizing our growing strength in vehicle information, and they help drive RS&I sales again this quarter. 
But that's the highlights. Significant progress was made in the quarter: organic sales rising 9.9% along all our runways for coherent growth; EPS of $1.87, up 15.4%; gains achieved through our Snap-on Value Creation Processes; RCI and customer connection shining -- especially shining through, strengthening our businesses and driving to a 16.7% opco operating margin, up 120 basis points. It was an encouraging quarter. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Aldo."

Our first quarter consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales of $827.8 million in the quarter were up 9.9% organically, reflecting broad-based growth across all of our operating segments. On reported basis, net sales",1296,"Thanks, Nick. Our first quarter consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales of $827.8 million in the quarter were up 9.9% organically, reflecting broad-based growth across all of our operating segments. On reported basis, net sales, including $38.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation, increased $40.3 million or 5.1% from 2014 levels. As you know, Snap-on has significant international operations and is subject to foreign currency translation fluctuations. Largely due to the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar, foreign currency movements adversely impacted our year-over-year sales comparisons by approximately 540 basis points. Consolidated gross profit of $410.1 million increased $31.4 million from 2014 levels. Gross margin of 49.5% in the quarter improved 140 basis points, primarily due to benefits from higher sales, lower restructuring cost and savings from RCI initiatives. 
Operating expenses of $272.2 million increased $15.2 million, largely due to higher volume-related and other expenses, partially offset by savings from RCI initiatives. The operating expense margin of 32.8% increased 20 basis points from 2014 levels. No restructuring costs were incurred in the first 3 months of 2015. Last year, we incurred $2 million of restructuring costs. Pension expense in the quarter was approximately $2 million higher as compared to the prior year, reflecting updated pension plan assumptions for 2015, which include the effects of lower discount rates, as well as increased life expectancies. As a result of these factors, operating earnings before Financial Services of $137.9 million in the quarter, including $6.4 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased $16.2 million from prior year levels as the percentage of sales improved 120 basis points to 16.7%. 
Financial Services revenue of $57.4 million in the quarter increased 14.3% from 2014 levels while operating earnings of $40.3 million increased 17.2%. The increases in both revenue and operating earnings primarily reflect the continued growth of the Financial Services portfolio. Consolidated operating earnings of $178.2 million in the quarter, including $6.9 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased $22.1 million or 14.2%, and the operating margin of 20.1% improved 150 basis points from 18.6% a year ago. Our first quarter effective income tax rate of 32% compared with 31.6% last year. Finally, net earnings of $110.5 million or $1.87 per diluted share increased $14.6 million or $0.25 per share, representing a 15.4% increase in diluted earnings per share. 
Now let's turn to our segment results. Starting with the Commercial & Industrial, or C&I Group, on Slide 7. Sales of $297.5 million in the quarter were up 9.8% organically, primarily reflecting similar sales strength, both in critical industries and in our European-based hand tools business. Gross profit in the C&I Group totaled $116.5 million in the quarter, and the gross margin of 39.2% improved 40 basis points from 2014 levels, largely due to savings from RCI initiatives, primarily in Europe. Operating expenses of $72.5 million in the quarter decreased $1.1 million. The operating expense margin of 24.4% improved 90 basis points, largely due to sales volume leverage. As a result of these factors, operating earnings for the C&I segment of $44 million, including $1.3 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased $4.9 million from 2014 levels. The operating margin of 14.8% improved 130 basis points. 
Turning now to Slide 8. First quarter sales in the Snap-on Tools Group of $378.2 million increased 12.9% organically, reflecting comparable sales gains in both the company's U.S. and international franchise operations. Gross profit of $166.3 million increased $18.3 million from 2014 levels, and the gross margin of 44% improved 90 basis points, primarily due to benefits from higher sales. Operating expenses of $106.5 million increased $7.7 million from 2014 levels, mostly due to higher volume-related expenses. The operating expense margin of 28.2% improved 60 basis points, principally due to sales volume leverage. As a result of these factors, operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $59.8 million, including $3 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased $10.6 million, and the operating margin of 15.8% improved 150 basis points. 
Turning to the Repair, Systems & Information, RS&I Group, showed on Slide 9. Sales of $272.3 million in the quarter increased 6.3% organically from 2014 levels. The organic sales increase primarily reflects a high single-digit gain in sales of undercar equipment as well as mid-single-digit gains in both sales to OEM dealerships and the sales of diagnostic and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers. Gross profit of $127.3 million increased $9.3 million over 2014 levels, and gross margin of 46.8% improved 190 basis points, principally due to savings from RCI and other cost-reduction initiatives and $2 million of lower restructuring costs. Operating expenses totaled $63.4 million in the quarter. The operating expense margin of 23.3% increased 50 basis points, largely due to operating expenses of Pro-Cut, which was acquired in May of last year. First quarter operating earnings for the RS&I Group of $63.9 million, including $2.1 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased $5.8 million or 10% from prior year levels, and the operating margin of 23.5% improved 140 basis points. 
Now turning to Slide 10. In the first quarter, operating earnings from Financial Services of $40.3 million on revenue of $57.4 million compared with operating earnings of $34.4 million on revenue of $50.2 million last year. The average yield on finance receivables of 17.7% in the quarter compared with 17.5% last year. The average yield on contract receivables was 9.5% in both periods. Originations of $230.7 million increased 14.2% from 2014 levels.
Moving to Slide 11. As of quarter-end, our balance sheet includes approximately $1.4 billion of gross financing receivables, including $1.2 billion of our U.S. Snap-on Credit operation. Approximately 80% of our U.S. financing portfolio relates to extended credit loans to technicians. During the quarter, our worldwide finance portfolio grew approximately $23 million. As for finance portfolio losses and delinquency trends, these continue to be in line with our expectations. 
Now turning to Slide 12. Cash provided by operations of $78.1 million in the quarter decreased $10.2 million from comparable 2014 levels, as higher net earnings in 2015 were more than offset by net increases in operating assets and liabilities, largely as a result of a $15 million discretionary domestic pension plan contribution as well as higher tax-related payments in the current year. Net cash used by investing activities of $59.5 million included $38.6 million to fund a net increase in finance receivables. Capital expenditures of $18.1 million in the quarter were comparable to the prior year.
Turning to Slide 13. Days sales outstanding for trade receivables of 60 days compared with 61 days at 2014 year-end. Inventories increased $6.8 million from 2014 year-end levels, primarily to support continued higher customer demand and new product introductions. On trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 3.6 compared with 3.7 turns at 2014 year-end. At quarter-end, cash position of $114.4 million decreased $18.5 million from 2014 year-end levels. Net decrease includes the impact of funding $198.8 million of new finance receivables, the repurchase of 340,000 shares for $49.7 million, dividend payments of $30.9 million and capital expenditures of $18.1 million. These cash decreases were partially offset by $160.2 million of cash from collections of finance receivables, $78.1 million of cash generated from operations and $22.8 million of cash from a net increase in short-term borrowings. Our net debt-to-cap ratio of 27.6% compared with 26.3% at 2014 year-end. In addition to our $114 million of cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $700 million in available credit facilities, and our current short-term credit ratings allow us to access commercial paper markets. At first quarter-end, we had $52.5 million of commercial paper borrowings outstanding. 
This concludes my remarks on our first quarter performance. Now I'll turn the call over to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick?"

Now as our first quarter, similar to our other quarters, growth and improvement: EPS of $1.87, up 15.4%. Once again, there were headwinds, varying economies, fluctuating currencies and political unrest, but we overcame by finding and making the most of the opportunities. We've made significant progress along our runways for growth, driven by new products and new customers, enhanced the van channel. Tools Group organic sales up 12.9%, and we believe the network has never been stronger; expand with repair shop owners and managers. RS&I organic sales up 6.3%; OEM, dealerships and independent shops capturing new customers with a growing product bundle; extended critical industries and build in emerging markets; C&I organic sales up 9.8%. SNA Europe progressing against the economic tie; our critical industry team, building our understanding of those critical workplaces, launching new products aimed at those tasks and gaining position. 
Once again, again this quarter, we clearly saw the effects of Snap-on Value Creation, advancing down our runway for improvement. OI margin improvements are more than 100 basis points in every group, and an overall opco margin of 16.7%, an increase of 120 basis points. It was an encouraging quarter. We believe it serves as more testimony, great testimony, that our business models have the strength, our runways offer the opportunity and our teams have the capability to continue the trend of positive progress as we move forward even amid headwinds.
Before I turn the call over to the operator, it's appropriate that I mention our franchisees and associates. I know many of you are listening today.

I expect good news in every market every quarter, I think, because we're not -- the thing is we're in early days in penetrating critical industries. It's an aspect of coherent growth that what we are doing there is duplicating what we have done for automotive repair technicians all these years. We're doing them for other people in other industries, observing work and making it easier with just the right tools, whether it's software or hardware. And so the -- an element of that is learning about the industry. So it's early days. Now we have varying industries in there, aviation, the military, oil and gas, power generation, mining. One of the advantages of this is we don't really have much [indiscernible] in the way of share in these businesses, so therefore, each quarter rise and fall is not so much on the effect of the industry. Just on our own performance. So we have lumpiness from section to section or from industry to industry. In this particular quarter, we actually saw fine performance in places, like I said in my -- power generation, mining, railroads, the military. The military was up this time, because we were able to see opportunities. Aviation is a big business in that area. And oil and gas actually, actually was up even slightly in this quarter. So we saw the usual lumpiness from operation to operation, but the critical industries business really isn't the driver behind C&I, and you see the C&I growth across those segments. So I didn't see any particular surprises. I guess if you were looking at our business, you might say, ""Gee, they grew in oil and gas even though the market was weak."" My view was we don't have that big a share in oil and gas, therefore, we can grow against weak markets."

We have 4,800 worldwide. We have 3,478, I think, in the United States are van. And they're learning quarter-by-quarter, how to do it better, and that's allowing to sell more same customers and reach other customers, which they had on their routes, but they hadn't been calling on. So the effects are these, I think -- maybe threefold. One effect is, I think we've talked about it many times, they're -- I think they're very cleverly breaking through the natural boundaries of that model by adding space with the Rock 'N Roll cabs, and you can see it in the progression of the tool storage, and breaking through the time by adding help with things like the TechKnow vans. And now we have -- I think we have 66, 67 Rock 'N Roll -- 66 Rock 'N Roll vans throughout the world now. And we have now up to 35 TechKnow vans, up about 4 since last quarter. And so you can see breaking that natural boundary is helping. Secondly, boy, we're using as much as possible our customer connection. We spend a lot of time in the shops, and  we're organizing that process in getting that information back into the innovation process and rolling out new products like that 36-inch Breaker Bar. People might look at that and say, ""What's that? It's just a long bar."" But the idea was it wasn't really available on the marketplace, and the ones that were available aren't as comfortable. Innovation doesn't have to be earth shattering. It just have to make work easier in this space. And the tools [indiscernible] how to do that. And then thirdly, they're looking at the franchisee and saying, ""We know your time is valuable. We're going to make it better. We're going to drive our RCI into the vans."" And that's all resulting in this kind of thing. Their numbers were up 12.8% in the quarter -- 12.9% in the quarter, 11.8% the quarter before that, 6% the quarter before that, 6.6% the quarter before that and 6% before that. In fact, 19 of the last 20 quarters, they've been 6% or above. And that's -- what's driving it all is tuning that business. You know what? It's kind of -- if you step back and you look at the auto repair, you would say it's going to go better than GDP. 4% to 6% is what we say. But if you have capability that resonates with those franchisees like they figured out, you see these kind of numbers."

We have these -- and their company stores. They're not selling, but their company stores are rolling around.

Because last year, we had a big restructuring dollop in there. So that's why you can kind of vaguely look at that, but still a pretty big dollop of RCI. Of course, you want to make no mistake about this. Even though the equipment, the lower-margin businesses are growing, so is the software."

And what we've said is that we believe that we have both runways for growth and improvement at accrued operating income. And from quarter to quarter, they accrue -- those 2 things accrue in different proportions between gross margin and operating expense. So I wouldn't call the gross margin necessarily breakthrough, but there's nothing special in there this quarter. There's nothing really -- there's no real -- I don't think there's any real onetime event or anything like that. Really, I mean, you saw our currency numbers in the quarter. I think our sales were, what was it, 38.5% in currency and about 6.9% in OI. And we're -- we are -- we have currency headwinds. And if the current rates stay the same, those will rise. But on the other hand, we believe that that's sort of arithmetic. We're so enthusiastic about our operating opportunities, and you can see it in this quarter how the operating opportunities worked out. Currencies are going to go up and down, but the operating gains are going to stay with us forever. And we view the 16.7% as being part of that."

I think what happened this quarter is basically some of our activities are paying off associated with new product development. We do have some new product that are exciting to customers. You can create enthusiasm even in what I consider to be a relatively dead market in Europe. New car sales usually doesn't help us that much except for the fact that -- except for the broader fact that new car sales is probably accompanying a more positive economy. It is true though that we made, I think, encouraging gains in selling in Europe. We -- France and Germany, which had been a drag in the last couple of quarters, in fact, they were down in the last couple of quarters, they were up this quarter. And we continued with the Nordic countries, and we had some business in Turkey. Of course, Eastern Europe was weak. So -- and Spain was up off of a relatively low base. So we kind of saw the same progress in Europe that we've seen in other quarters, except we started making progress in France and Germany. Eastern Europe is kind of dead right now. It's not just difficult and so on. So that -- it's kind of what we saw. So I guess you could be entitled to the idea Europe got somewhat better, but profits were even better, very strong performance because of the effects of RCI."

Now there's 5,000 engine codes. Every -- it's hard to fix a car without a diagnostic unit now, and we have the best one. And so we're selling them to technicians now, not just to garages, and so that's helping drive our business. So that technology change in the independent space, that's why I talked about the diagnostic workstation. Because the independent garages know that people know their cars are more like spaceships these days, and they want to bring them to people who can fix them. And therefore, this diagnostic unit makes it look like, ""Wow, this is big computer here that can fix the car, help fix the car."" And it grows confidence and actually helps in terms of accuracy. So if anything, we're seeing a greater demand of our products in the independent shops and other shops because of the changing technology. That's the big change."

As usual, I'll start with the highlights of our first quarter. And along the way, I'll give you perspective on our results, our markets and on the progress we've made, and Aldo will move into a more detailed review of the financials. 
I believe that our first quarter, once again, provided strong evidence of Snap-on advancing along our runways for both growth and for improvement. Our EPS in the quarter was $1.87, up from $1.62 last year. That rise reflects an opco operating margin of 16.7%, an increase of 120 basis points. Combining those opco gains with earnings of $40.3 million from Financial Services brought Snap-on's consolidated operating margin to 20.1% compared to the 18.6% registered last year. Our operating improvement in the quarter came on organic sales growth of 9.9%. Overall sales in the quarter were $827.8 million, a rise of 5.1% from the prior year, and those gains included significant unfavorable foreign currency translation of $38.5 million or 540 basis points. 
Now currency is a headwind. It was last year. It's likely to continue throughout the year. And if the present rates hold, it will rise somewhat going forward. But we are very encouraged by our organic growth in both volume and profitability, and we believe both represent a continuation of our strengthening position and capability and of the generally favorable business environment for each of our operating groups. For us, the quarter's results are testimony to the abundant opportunity along our runways for growth and our -- and of our ability to take advantage as conditions unfold. 
Like in past quarters, the environment surrounding our automotive repair-related businesses, the Tools Group and the RS&I group, is generally positive. The changing technologies across the fleet continue to drive the need for new problem-solving products, making those markets robust. In that regard, Tools Group have enhanced our franchise network with vans productivity and with innovative marketing, taking clear advantage of the favorability to sell more to existing customers and to reach new customers, all on its way to strong growth. At the same time, RS&I has also grown, capitalizing on those positives and utilizing its broader product line to expand with repair shop owners and managers. 
Now C&I, serving customers in critical industries and the most international of our groups, does face more variations in the market. European operations are confronted with large differences across the business, from the relatively calm U.K. to the turbulence of the Middle East, to the challenges of Russia, to the political uncertainties of newly elected governments in places like India and Indonesia. But as in past quarters, the opportunities outweigh those headwinds. And when combined with our growing range of customer-driven products and with our expanding capabilities aimed specifically at the needs of industries and customers, C&I again showed gains, extending in critical industries and building in emerging markets. 
Besides advancements on our runways for growth, we also made progress down our runways for improvement with Snap-on Value Creation in safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and rapid continuous improvement, or RCI as we call it. RCI has become a part of the fabric of daily activity at Snap-on. You can see it in the results, OI margins up. And you can see it in events like our annual RCI conference held recently just down the road in Illinois, nearly 400 people, almost 40 best practice teams came together to share ideas, vie for awards and celebrate their progress, bringing the learning and the enthusiasm back home to their local teams. You can't help but walk away from these events encouraged and convinced that there's great potential for further improvement. 
Last, the environment. Of course, as always, there are headwinds, market-to-market variations and difficult macros. But despite the challenges, our operations moved significantly along each of our runways for both growth and improvement and you can see it throughout the numbers. 
Now let's move to the segments. In C&I Group, organic sales were up 9.8%, with contributions coming from our European, U.S. and Asian operations. From an earnings perspective, C&I operating income of $44 million increased $4.9 million or 12.5%, and that represents a margin rate for C&I, up 14.8%, an expansion of 130 basis points. 
SNA Europe again recorded volume growth. This time, similar to that achieved by C&I overall, broad gains in many of our markets led by selling strength and by products that generate real enthusiasm. But SNA Europe's improvement in the quarter goes beyond sales growth and farther than the gains made from past restructuring. Our initiatives to improve productivity with focus on both cost and product development are clearly evident in the operations achievements. You can see it again this quarter. Organic sales were up. The profits, profits were up more, illustrating the power of RCI even in the European environment that remains challenged. 
Industrial division was also part of C&I rise. It grew in a number of critical industries, areas like power generation, mining, railroads and the military. As everybody knows, the military sector remains uncertain. But having said that, we've made the most of the opportunities available. This time, the opening arose with the changing roles of various units as the troops were redeployed back to the United States. Actually, that's a major theme for our first quarter, making the most of the opportunities as they arise amid the turbulence. 
Another big factor in the gains in critical industry were expanded product offerings targeted at practical workplace needs. One is -- one new example introduced in the quarter was the PDX (sic) [PDR] series of air drills, ideal for the aviation industry, made in our Murphy, North Carolina plant. And these pneumatic drills are used in application ranging from light assembly to metalworking, perfect for drilling ferrous and nonferrous metals, plastics and composite materials, the kind of versatility that's so helpful in aviation applications. And the featherable trigger provides outstanding control and unparalleled run-out performance, authoring great accuracy. Beside the utility of the tool, the low-sound, low-vibration, soft-grip and aluminum housing offers maximum comfort with reduced operator fatigue, another attractive feature in the work place to ease the professional's task and enable more consistency throughout the day. These drills are especially useful on performing important repair work on damaged aircraft steel, an application that must be repeatable and certainly critical in nature. We believe we have another industry winner. The PDX (sic) [PDR] drill, a superior aviation tool consistent with the Snap-on name. 
Our Industrial division also has driven growth by leveraging the Snap-on RCI experience, participating in several customer-sponsored lean events right on the customer site, side by side with the customer's local team. Snap-on people sharing their experiences and their insight of rapid continuous improving, helping customers solve their problem, but -- all the problems, but all the while aiming deeper, practical understanding of the -- of crucial tasks in critical industries, creating opportunities to tailor our products to the work and to drive more sales. We say we help professionals in solving the critical. RCI is becoming a tool to do just that. 
Our Asia Pacific division also posts a higher activity, registering progress, building the physicals and limiting the impact of the economic difficulties in Japan. I was just there attending our annual resellers conference this year within Xi'an in China, bringing together enthusiastic Snap-on associates and resellers from all across the region. New Asian-ized products were introduced, training seminars were conducted and the group's enthusiasm confirmed our extended opportunities in Asia Pacific at C&I. 
Now on to the Tools Group. Organic sales up 12.9%, solid growth in all geographies. The group's operating earnings of $59.8 million represented a margin rate of 15.8%, up 150 basis points, the Tools Group. The results continue to speak for themselves. They clearly demonstrate ongoing progress along one of our runways for coherent growth, enhancing the franchise channel. And there's abundant evidence of the strength of positive trajectory of that channel. It's displayed clearly in our franchisee metrics, financial and physical, important indicators of network help like sales per van and franchisee turnover. We monitor them closely, and they're favorable across-the-board. And our direct interactions with the franchisees, meetings like the 2015 kickoffs held all over the network earlier in the year, they were marked by -- I can tell you, they were marked by enthusiasm and optimism, by commitment and energy, gatherings of entrepreneurs and professionals confident in reaching higher. 
Snap-on Value Creation process, the processes, they're also critical components of the Tools Group progress. Innovative new products, many, many of these launched from the customer connections we observed on a daily basis. Those solutions, those products are significant players in driving the group's upward trajectory. An example is the KRL1163 tool storage cab with the power tool organizer system based on customer connections made on our Rock 'N Roll express vans. This model transforms the bottom drawer, the box, into a customized secure, easy-to-access storage system for frequently used power tools. It's a feature that can make a technician's work easier. Visitors to our Rock 'N Roll cabs highlighted the need, our design teams made it a reality, customer connection to innovation to winning products. 
Speaking of tool storage, this summer mark's our 95th year in business. And we just launched a special set of tool storage boxes, highlighting our long tradition of excellence with unique anniversary panel and custom-rich trim, etched with the years 1920 and 2015. The new units also offered the Snap-on echo remote locking system, another customer connection-driven option that we're confident will be quite popular. The specialty -- special anniversary boxes are already gathering -- generating considerable excitement on the vans and in the shops, lots of excitement around these boxes. And we believe they'll be strong sellers, clear testimony on the strength of the Snap-on brand and of the bond between Snap-on and professionals. 
More innovation can be seen in products like the new Snap-on 1/2-inch Drive 36-inch Breaker Bar, the SHN36 (sic) [SN36], originally developed from customer connections of the heavy-duty mechanics desiring more -- a longer handle for increased leverage. The addition of a soft grip provides added control on comfort and that's a premium when you're removing tires or adjusting tracks on construction and agricultural equipment or loosening head bolts on large engine. A much improved product will make work easier, innovation even on the most established of product lines. 
Finally, I want to mention the Tools Group efforts with RCI. Progress -- I think it's clearly evident in the financials. But to double down on a testimony -- I spoke before on our Annual RCI Conference. Well, a team from Tools was awarded the grand champion at this year's event. The Tools Group rework center won for their work on substantially reducing turnaround time, highlighting that Snap-on shop floor has no monopoly on RCI and illustrating that even in an -- even an experienced organization like the Tools Group, potential RCI opportunities abound, up and down throughout and across the business. 
And we can't talk about the Tools Group without speaking of its strategic partner, our Financial Services organization. With each quarter, Snap-on Credit becomes more attuned to just what programs can best aid our franchisees. And the first quarter demonstrated that progress clearly, portfolio growth, profits up over 17% and, all the while, holding delinquencies to a relatively low level. Snap-on Credit, a great assist to our Tools business, and you can see that relationship play out in the positive trends. 
Now let's move to RS&I. The first quarter organic sales for RS&I rose 6.3%, broad gains with both OEM dealerships and with independent shops. Operating earnings of $63.9 million were up $5.8 million. The operating margin of 23.5% rose 140 basis points. 
I've spoken often in the past about our line of successful handheld diagnostic units. As they continue to drive growth and excitement in the independent repair space, the first quarter was no exception with our VERUS PRO and MODIS Ultra units being recognized by Undercar Digest in this year's list of top 10 tools, continuing our strength of award-winning products with that publication. The Undercar Digest bases its selections on the votes of actual users. The award confirms that our handheld diagnostics resonate strongly with professionals, and it demonstrates the power of customer connection and innovation in generating unique productivity solutions. That's what these tools are about. 
VERUS PRO and the MODIS Ultra, they're also key components of our next-generation advanced diagnostic workstations. Launched in February, these new workstations include a handheld diagnostic unit and docking station, a flat screen monitor and a custom Snap-on toolbox. They provide comprehensive diagnostic support to fix cars accurately and quickly, and they go a long way in reinforcing the shops' images, having strong professional capability in the electronics arena, a feature, we believe, is of significant value to many independent garages as they strive to build customer confidence in this environment of rising vehicle technology. With more than 800 workstations sold since the launch, this is another one of our hit products with over $1 million in the -- in first-year sales. And it's another add to our growing track record of innovation success and its driving sales progress. 
Our equipment division also registered gains in the quarter with several national accounts, in part exceeding by highlighting our expanding product bundle, including Challenger Lifts, Pro-Cut on-car brake lathes, as well as the new undercar equipment and broad diagnostic offerings. Snap-on equipment increased productivity for the automotive repair shop -- for automotive repair shop networks, an advantage rooted in our expanded and enhanced line of products. 
Finally, we continue to see further progress with our NEXIQ heavy-duty and fleet information systems as well as progress with the improved functionality and comprehensive content contained in Mitchell1's ProDemand and SureTrack products, all are differentiated -- differentiating offerings that lead to more business. Armed with those products, we achieved a number of multi-location customer wins in the quarter, displacing competitors and gaining traction across the marketplace. Snap-on information products, unique database solutions, effective navigation systems for speed to repair, all emphasizing our growing strength in vehicle information, and they help drive RS&I sales again this quarter. 
But that's the highlights. Significant progress was made in the quarter: organic sales rising 9.9% along all our runways for coherent growth; EPS of $1.87, up 15.4%; gains achieved through our Snap-on Value Creation Processes; RCI and customer connection shining -- especially shining through, strengthening our businesses and driving to a 16.7% opco operating margin, up 120 basis points. It was an encouraging quarter. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Aldo."

Our first quarter consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales of $827.8 million in the quarter were up 9.9% organically, reflecting broad-based growth across all of our operating segments. On reported basis, net sales",1296,"Thanks, Nick. Our first quarter consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales of $827.8 million in the quarter were up 9.9% organically, reflecting broad-based growth across all of our operating segments. On reported basis, net sales, including $38.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation, increased $40.3 million or 5.1% from 2014 levels. As you know, Snap-on has significant international operations and is subject to foreign currency translation fluctuations. Largely due to the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar, foreign currency movements adversely impacted our year-over-year sales comparisons by approximately 540 basis points. Consolidated gross profit of $410.1 million increased $31.4 million from 2014 levels. Gross margin of 49.5% in the quarter improved 140 basis points, primarily due to benefits from higher sales, lower restructuring cost and savings from RCI initiatives. 
Operating expenses of $272.2 million increased $15.2 million, largely due to higher volume-related and other expenses, partially offset by savings from RCI initiatives. The operating expense margin of 32.8% increased 20 basis points from 2014 levels. No restructuring costs were incurred in the first 3 months of 2015. Last year, we incurred $2 million of restructuring costs. Pension expense in the quarter was approximately $2 million higher as compared to the prior year, reflecting updated pension plan assumptions for 2015, which include the effects of lower discount rates, as well as increased life expectancies. As a result of these factors, operating earnings before Financial Services of $137.9 million in the quarter, including $6.4 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased $16.2 million from prior year levels as the percentage of sales improved 120 basis points to 16.7%. 
Financial Services revenue of $57.4 million in the quarter increased 14.3% from 2014 levels while operating earnings of $40.3 million increased 17.2%. The increases in both revenue and operating earnings primarily reflect the continued growth of the Financial Services portfolio. Consolidated operating earnings of $178.2 million in the quarter, including $6.9 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased $22.1 million or 14.2%, and the operating margin of 20.1% improved 150 basis points from 18.6% a year ago. Our first quarter effective income tax rate of 32% compared with 31.6% last year. Finally, net earnings of $110.5 million or $1.87 per diluted share increased $14.6 million or $0.25 per share, representing a 15.4% increase in diluted earnings per share. 
Now let's turn to our segment results. Starting with the Commercial & Industrial, or C&I Group, on Slide 7. Sales of $297.5 million in the quarter were up 9.8% organically, primarily reflecting similar sales strength, both in critical industries and in our European-based hand tools business. Gross profit in the C&I Group totaled $116.5 million in the quarter, and the gross margin of 39.2% improved 40 basis points from 2014 levels, largely due to savings from RCI initiatives, primarily in Europe. Operating expenses of $72.5 million in the quarter decreased $1.1 million. The operating expense margin of 24.4% improved 90 basis points, largely due to sales volume leverage. As a result of these factors, operating earnings for the C&I segment of $44 million, including $1.3 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased $4.9 million from 2014 levels. The operating margin of 14.8% improved 130 basis points. 
Turning now to Slide 8. First quarter sales in the Snap-on Tools Group of $378.2 million increased 12.9% organically, reflecting comparable sales gains in both the company's U.S. and international franchise operations. Gross profit of $166.3 million increased $18.3 million from 2014 levels, and the gross margin of 44% improved 90 basis points, primarily due to benefits from higher sales. Operating expenses of $106.5 million increased $7.7 million from 2014 levels, mostly due to higher volume-related expenses. The operating expense margin of 28.2% improved 60 basis points, principally due to sales volume leverage. As a result of these factors, operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $59.8 million, including $3 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased $10.6 million, and the operating margin of 15.8% improved 150 basis points. 
Turning to the Repair, Systems & Information, RS&I Group, showed on Slide 9. Sales of $272.3 million in the quarter increased 6.3% organically from 2014 levels. The organic sales increase primarily reflects a high single-digit gain in sales of undercar equipment as well as mid-single-digit gains in both sales to OEM dealerships and the sales of diagnostic and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers. Gross profit of $127.3 million increased $9.3 million over 2014 levels, and gross margin of 46.8% improved 190 basis points, principally due to savings from RCI and other cost-reduction initiatives and $2 million of lower restructuring costs. Operating expenses totaled $63.4 million in the quarter. The operating expense margin of 23.3% increased 50 basis points, largely due to operating expenses of Pro-Cut, which was acquired in May of last year. First quarter operating earnings for the RS&I Group of $63.9 million, including $2.1 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased $5.8 million or 10% from prior year levels, and the operating margin of 23.5% improved 140 basis points. 
Now turning to Slide 10. In the first quarter, operating earnings from Financial Services of $40.3 million on revenue of $57.4 million compared with operating earnings of $34.4 million on revenue of $50.2 million last year. The average yield on finance receivables of 17.7% in the quarter compared with 17.5% last year. The average yield on contract receivables was 9.5% in both periods. Originations of $230.7 million increased 14.2% from 2014 levels.
Moving to Slide 11. As of quarter-end, our balance sheet includes approximately $1.4 billion of gross financing receivables, including $1.2 billion of our U.S. Snap-on Credit operation. Approximately 80% of our U.S. financing portfolio relates to extended credit loans to technicians. During the quarter, our worldwide finance portfolio grew approximately $23 million. As for finance portfolio losses and delinquency trends, these continue to be in line with our expectations. 
Now turning to Slide 12. Cash provided by operations of $78.1 million in the quarter decreased $10.2 million from comparable 2014 levels, as higher net earnings in 2015 were more than offset by net increases in operating assets and liabilities, largely as a result of a $15 million discretionary domestic pension plan contribution as well as higher tax-related payments in the current year. Net cash used by investing activities of $59.5 million included $38.6 million to fund a net increase in finance receivables. Capital expenditures of $18.1 million in the quarter were comparable to the prior year.
Turning to Slide 13. Days sales outstanding for trade receivables of 60 days compared with 61 days at 2014 year-end. Inventories increased $6.8 million from 2014 year-end levels, primarily to support continued higher customer demand and new product introductions. On trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 3.6 compared with 3.7 turns at 2014 year-end. At quarter-end, cash position of $114.4 million decreased $18.5 million from 2014 year-end levels. Net decrease includes the impact of funding $198.8 million of new finance receivables, the repurchase of 340,000 shares for $49.7 million, dividend payments of $30.9 million and capital expenditures of $18.1 million. These cash decreases were partially offset by $160.2 million of cash from collections of finance receivables, $78.1 million of cash generated from operations and $22.8 million of cash from a net increase in short-term borrowings. Our net debt-to-cap ratio of 27.6% compared with 26.3% at 2014 year-end. In addition to our $114 million of cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $700 million in available credit facilities, and our current short-term credit ratings allow us to access commercial paper markets. At first quarter-end, we had $52.5 million of commercial paper borrowings outstanding. 
This concludes my remarks on our first quarter performance. Now I'll turn the call over to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick?"

Now as our first quarter, similar to our other quarters, growth and improvement: EPS of $1.87, up 15.4%. Once again, there were headwinds, varying economies, fluctuating currencies and political unrest, but we overcame by finding and making the most of the opportunities. We've made significant progress along our runways for growth, driven by new products and new customers, enhanced the van channel. Tools Group organic sales up 12.9%, and we believe the network has never been stronger; expand with repair shop owners and managers. RS&I organic sales up 6.3%; OEM, dealerships and independent shops capturing new customers with a growing product bundle; extended critical industries and build in emerging markets; C&I organic sales up 9.8%. SNA Europe progressing against the economic tide; our critical industry team, building our understanding of those critical workplaces, launching new products aimed at those tasks and gaining position. 
Once again, again this quarter, we clearly saw the effects of Snap-on Value Creation, advancing down our runway for improvement. OI margin improvements are more than 100 basis points in every group, and an overall opco margin of 16.7%, an increase of 120 basis points. It was an encouraging quarter. We believe it serves as more testimony, great testimony, that our business models have the strength, our runways offer the opportunity and our teams have the capability to continue the trend of positive progress as we move forward even amid headwinds.

I expect good news in every market every quarter, I think, because we're not -- the thing is we're in early days in penetrating critical industries. It's an aspect of coherent growth that what we are doing there is duplicating what we have done for automotive repair technicians all these years. We're doing them for other people in other industries, observing work and making it easier with just the right tools, whether it's software or hardware. And so the -- an element of that is learning about the industry. So it's early days. Now we have varying industries in there, aviation, the military, oil and gas, power generation, mining. One of the advantages of this is we don't really have much [indiscernible] in the way of share in these businesses, so therefore, each quarter rise and fall is not so much on the effect of the industry. Just on our own performance. So we have lumpiness from section to section or from industry to industry. In this particular quarter, we actually saw fine performance in places, like I said in my -- power generation, mining, railroads, the military. The military was up this time, because we were able to see opportunities. Aviation is a big business in that area. And oil and gas actually, actually was up even slightly in this quarter. So we saw the usual lumpiness from operation to operation, but the critical industries business really isn't the driver behind C&I, and you see the C&I growth across those segments. So I didn't see any particular surprises. I guess if you were looking at our business, you might say, ""Gee, they grew in oil and gas even though the market was weak."" My view was we don't have that big a share in oil and gas, therefore, we can grow against weak markets."

We have 4,800 worldwide. We have 3,478, I think, in the United States are van. And they're learning quarter-by-quarter, how to do it better, and that's allowed them to sell more to same customers and reach other customers, which they had on their routes, but they hadn't been calling on. So the effects are these, I think -- maybe threefold. One effect is, I think we've talked about it many times, they're -- I think they're very cleverly breaking through the natural boundaries of that model by adding space with the Rock 'N Roll cabs, and you can see it in the progression of the tool storage, and breaking through the time by adding help with things like the TechKnow vans. And now we have -- I think we have 66, 67 Rock 'N Roll -- 66 Rock 'N Roll vans throughout the world now. And we have now up to 35 TechKnow vans, up about 4 since last quarter. And so you can see breaking that natural boundary is helping. Secondly, boy, we're using as much as possible our customer connection. We spend a lot of time in the shops, and  we're organizing that process in getting that information back into the innovation process and rolling out new products like that 36-inch Breaker Bar. People might look at that and say, ""What's that? It's just a long bar."" But the idea was it wasn't really available on the marketplace, and the ones that were available aren't as comfortable. Innovation doesn't have to be earth shattering. It just has to make work easier in this space. And the tools group is understanding how to do that. And then thirdly, they're looking at the franchisee and saying, ""We know your time is valuable. We're going to make it better. We're going to drive our RCI into the vans."" And that's all resulting in this kind of thing. Their numbers were up 12.8% in the quarter -- 12.9% in the quarter, 11.8% the quarter before that, 6% the quarter before that, 6.6% the quarter before that and 6% before that. In fact, 19 of the last 20 quarters, they've been 6% or above. And that's -- what's driving it all is tuning that business. You know what? It's kind of -- if you step back and you look at the auto repair, you would say it's going to go better than GDP. 4% to 6% is what we say. But if you have capability that resonates with those franchisees like they figured out, you see these kind of numbers."

So taking RCI, looking at the van, doing value stream mapping on the van and reducing the time, adding to their selling time as part of the process, which is allowing them to reach out to more customers.

But we don't really differentiate between a lead from a company-owned store and a franchisee. But in my remarks, you might've heard the whole idea of the power tool drawer organizer at the bottom -- at the tool storage box, that came from the Rock 'N Roll cab. We have these -- and their company stores. They're not selling, but their company stores are rolling around. People got on those Rock 'N Roll cabs, and they started talking about, ""Boy, wouldn't it be good if we have power tool organizer at the bottom -- in one of these drawers?"" We got that idea. We give it to the engineers. They put in place. And we're rolling out this new product, and it's looking to be a good seller. So that's an example. I guess the only thing is if you have the company-owned stores, they just add to the flow of ideas back from the field, the customer connection that comes back from the field."

Yes, we had good growth and things like equipment, which tends to be lower margin, but we had a good quarter in software that offset it, our software is rolling.

There's -- in many cases, they're solving problems 3x or 4x faster than anybody else, 3x or 4x faster than anybody else, and the software is up. So that's good stuff. Our Mitchell1 information business and our diagnostics and the independent garages are pretty robust. And yes, okay, equipment's growing, but those 2 things are relatively in balance. So I don't think we saw a lot of mix in those numbers except for maybe the acquisition might have dinged it a little bit. Now the story of 140 basis points in -- I think it's 140 basis points in RS&I is we had about 50 60 of -- or about 15 60 of RCI and we had -- I think we had 70 or 80 of restructuring. Because last year, we had a big restructuring dollop in there. So that's why you can kind of vaguely look at that, but still a pretty big dollop of RCI. Plus, you want to make no mistake about this.

There's nothing really -- there's no real -- I don't think there's any real onetime event or anything like that. Really, I mean, you saw our currency numbers in the quarter. I think our sales were, what was it, 38.5% in currency and about 6.9% in OI. And we're -- we are -- we have currency headwinds. And if the current rates stay the same, those will rise. But on the other hand, we believe that that's sort of arithmetic. We're so enthusiastic about our operating opportunities, and you can see it in this quarter how the operating opportunities worked out.

I think what happened this quarter is basically some of our activities are paying off associated with new product development. We do have some new product that are exciting to customers. You can create enthusiasm even in what I consider to be a relatively dead market in Europe. New car sales usually doesn't help us that much except for the fact that -- except for the broader fact that new car sales is probably accompanying a more positive economy. It is true though that we made, I think, encouraging gains in selling in Europe. We -- France and Germany, which had been a drag in the last couple of quarters, in fact, they were down in the last couple of quarters, they were up this quarter. And we continued with the Nordic countries, and we had some business in Turkey. Of course, Eastern Europe was weak. So -- and Spain was up off of a relatively low base.

It's not just difficult and so on. So that -- it's kind of what we saw.

That seems to maybe -- this date always trails, so that's kind of leveled off a lot of people think now. But I think there hasn't been a big change in the characteristics, except the independents are becoming more sophisticated because they have to deal with the changing technologies. 20 years ago, there were 50 engine codes on a car. Now there's 5,000 engine codes. Every -- it's hard to fix a car without a diagnostic unit now, and we have the best one. And so we're selling them to technicians now, not just to garages, and so that's helping drive our business. So that technology change in the independent space, that's why I talked about the diagnostic workstation. Because the independent garages know that people know their cars are more like spaceships these days, and they want to bring them to people who can fix them. And therefore, this diagnostic unit makes it look like, ""Wow, this is big computer here that can fix the car, help fix the car."" And it grows confidence and actually helps in terms of accuracy. So if anything, we're seeing a greater demand of our products in the independent shops and other shops because of the changing technology. That's the big change."

So I'm kind of curious. It makes sense that France and Germany, you're doing better. The industry is doing better in general in those 2 countries.

Our second quarter results were encouraging. We believe they once again offer strong evidence of clear Snap-on advancements along our runways for both growth and for improvement. Organic sales were up 8.4% from last year. The operating margin expanded by 100 basis points, and earnings per share, they reached $2.03, up 12.8% compared with the $1.80 we reported last year. 
Our reported sales increase was 3.1%. That total includes the continuing weight of unfavorable foreign currency translation this quarter, an impact of $43.4 million. Including the incremental $2.8 million from last year's Pro-Cut acquisition, our total reported sales for the period were $851.8 million. 
The opco operating margin reached 17.7%, up from 16.7% in 2014 and as I said, representing 100 basis point increase, more than offsetting the 40 basis point impact on profit from unfavorable currency. Financial service operating income grew to $41.4 million from last year's $34.8 million, driving our consolidated operating margin Financial Services plus opco to 21.1%, higher by 140 basis points. 
It was an encouraging quarter. From an overall macro perspective, we believe the conditions remain favorable for our businesses serving automotive repair customers, businesses like the Tools Group and the Repair Systems & Information, our RS&I group. 
In the second quarter, the Tools Group organic activity increased 11.2%. The tailwinds of changing vehicle technology and the aging of the fleet continue to provide opportunity and the rising strength of our van network and our robust continuing line of new products, they enable Snap-on to take greater advantage of those tailwinds, and it is clearly evidenced in the numbers. 
RS&I, net gains of 3.3% led by higher sales of diagnostics and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers, increased sales to OEM dealerships and higher sales of other car equipment, all serving to offset the particular challenges in Russia, Eastern Europe and the Middle East, where that group had made particular progress in prior periods. 
The Commercial & Industrial Group or C&I, there are also continued signs of advancement. Organic sales up 11.2% in the quarter, and for C&I, along our runways for growth, we saw important and clear headway, headway in our efforts to extend in the critical industries, in our European business and in several emerging markets. 
That progress was won against pockets of turbulence in geographies like Europe, where the uncertainty of Greece looms; in places like Japan, where recovery's sporadic; and in the U.S. military. U.S. military, it's been a somewhat unpredictable sector. Well, in the second quarter, U.S. military activity experienced for Snap-on another strong period, up double digits from last year. However, we do remain cautious on the military business. There -- this is a period of uncertainty. Changing deployments and budget pressure make it difficult to predict the future trajectory of that business with any confidence. 
But having said that, we believe we're well positioned in the military sector to make the most of any available opportunities, any available openings. 
Overall, the C&I results are quite positive, the opportunities definitely outweighing the challenges, and the results are confirming it. More broadly, the whole operation for all of Snap-on, the operating income gains across the corporation clearly demonstrate the leverage and the power of Snap-on -- of the Snap-on Value Creation processes: safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and Rapid Continuous Improvement. They all drive our improvement every day, and they help to offer our 100 basis point gain in the quarter, overcoming the significant challenges. 
Now let's highlight some of the advancements in growth and improvements demonstrated by the individual groups. Let's start with C&I. 
As I just said, an 11.2% organic sales gain, and that follows a 9.8% organic sales gain in the first quarter. C&I's operating income margin was 14.3%, up 100 basis points. Both the higher volume and the benefits of Snap-on Value Creation drove that rise, and there was some very positive volume gains. 
Europe registered its seventh straight quarter of year-over-year growth, a promising trend, outperforming the storm clouds that occupy the headlines of Europe. The industrial division, particularly strong activity in the aviation sector, a key area of our focus in extending the critical industries. 
Some of those aerospace gains can be attributed to our growing line of innovative new product, specifically aimed at industry, products like our new array of aircraft tire gauges and inflators that comes to aircraft tires and struts. Proper measurements and inflation are key for safe takeoff and landing as well as for braking predictability and effectiveness. 
We talk about critical industry, those sound kind of critical for people who travel. Facing the bar in that arena, our new line of 300 PSI analog and digital tire gauges offer improved accuracy, our approval for environment and incorporate a reflective glow dialer backed with display. It makes -- they make the technicians work more effective, safer and easier, meeting all type of challenges in all types of conditions. 
Also in the quarter aimed right at aviation, we introduced the new Snap-on electrostatic discharge safe precision pliers designed for use on static-sensitive components and circuitry, with a specifically designed handle to dissipate electricity, improves squeezing torque control and a low-profile design for greater accessibility than the standard pliers, all features that are valued by professionals performing those critical aviation tasks. 
300 PSI tire gauges, a static discharge safe pliers, innovative new products adding to our growing aerospace offering and clearly demonstrating our efforts to roll the Snap-on brand out of the garage to extend the critical industries like aviation, and the second quarter results, they confirm that it's working. 
Now let's speak about SNA Europe, our European hand tools, our European-based hand tool business. SNA Europe, broad organic growth with gains in the period, up mid-single digits, growth in Spain, the United Kingdom and the Nordic region. And beside that volume rise, SNA Europe continued its trajectory of operating margin improvement, leveraging the additional sales, but also realizing the benefits of RCI and Snap-on Value Creation against the backdrop of substantial euro land turbulence. 
SNA Europe, sales up for the seventh straight quarter, but once again, profits up more. And we're also continuing to build in emerging markets. Asia Pacific was another contributor to C&I growth, activity up in relatively uneven markets like Korea and Indonesia. C&I did have an encouraging quarter, but we know there's still more opportunity, opportunity to continue building on the momentum generated by our European operations. We strengthened our position within emerging markets and to proceed forward down our runways of critical industries, extending to even more customers. 
Now let's move to the Tools Group. Sales were up 11.2% organically with double-digit gains in the U.S. and international. Operating margin of 17.1%, up 70 basis points versus the 16.4% recorded last year and overcoming within the quarter 120 basis points of unfavorable currency impact. That 70 basis point improvement brings our Tools Group OI margins to new levels, and that margin performance clearly speaks to our improving position, and when combined with the growth this quarter, demonstrates the success we're having on this decisive runway, enhancing the franchise network. 
You can see it in the sales, and you can see it in the overall franchise health metrics, trending positively again this quarter. 
Snap-on franchisees are a committed and capable group. We're convinced of that every time we meet one of them, and we're working hard every day to support their effort through creative marketing, access to in-house customer financing with Snap-on credit, a growing array of innovative new products, products like our new ratcheting combination wrenches with an innovative design, higher strength and enhanced durability. Our new ratcheting gear design safely delivers 25% more torque and 95% longer fatigue life, innovative Snap-on technology, enabling the transfer of more power in a thinner, smaller diameter wrench head, helping access and remove the most stubborn enough fasteners in tight, tight spaces. 
Dual 80 design with an 82 ratcheting gear and dual minimizes the swing arc that's needed to move fasteners, a great enabler, a great enabler in the engine compartments of today's vehicles. And of course, the new wrench features our unique flank drive wrenching system that consistently minimizes fastener damage. 
Snap-on's new line of combination wrenches raises the bar for professionals and performing critical and difficult tasks. It's a winning tool line on an existing product platform, a direct result of Snap-on Value Creation, shaped by customer connection, direct observations in the shop and delivered by the Snap-on innovation process. It's already generating excitement in the repair shops all over this country, and there's more to come. 
Now the growing strength of our van network our rolling selling space, which is the van network is, is evident with increases in big-ticket sales, and its considerable boost comes from our hands-on demonstration vehicles like the Rock ‘N Roll cab express vans, 66 of them, bringing a much wider range of our tool storage lineups directly to the shop, more colors, more shapes, more options and more choices displayed across our customer base. And if you've been listening to these calls for anytime, you've heard the story of this innovative marketing initiative, the Rock ‘N Roll van expanding our van selling space, and they continue to be a significant contributor to the Tools Group. 
In the quarter, big-ticket sales were up strong double digits and our demonstration vans were a big driver, but those vans weren't the only factor. Big-ticket gains were also propelled by new 2 [ph] storage products, winning offerings like our special edition 95th anniversary box, another in a long line of our customized tool storage systems. We mentioned I think on the last quarters call, and they've been popular, technicians upgrading their workspace, celebrating our milestone year and providing clear testimony to the strength of the Snap-on brand, positioned in shops all around the world. 
Another key advantage for the Tools Group is our Financial Services on Snap-on credit. Strategic programs aimed at smoothing the way for those big-ticket purchases. Our credit company plays an essential role in enhancing the van network and again this quarter, it did just that. Well, that's the Tools Group, attractive new products guided by customer connection, innovative marketing and a unique credit facility, all increasing the power of the Snap-on van channel and driving sales to new levels. 
Now onto RS&I. Organic sales growth of $8.7 million or 3.3%. The second quarter operating margin, 24.4%, rising 120 basis points compared to last year's 23.2%. 
Margin expansion, another demonstration of RCI and Snap-on Value Creation. The organic sales gain was broad-based. The diagnostics and information businesses selling to independent repair shop owners and managers with a mid-single-digit gain in volume, helped by new products, products like the, our newest diagnostic handheld offering, aimed -- it's aimed an individual shop technicians and first-time diagnostic buyers. ETHOS Tech is a full function scan tool with a quick boot up, streamlined interface, a large color stream and full comprehensive coverage of car makes and vehicle systems, all the features that are so important even for the entry-level technician in today's environment, where vehicle diagnostics are becoming essential for everyday maintenance as well as complex repair. 
More technicians than ever before will be using diagnostics in almost every job, and the ETHOS Tech is a great way for them to get started. Also in the quarter, RS&I released its latest software update for our full-length Ultra, supplying truck shops with even broader diagnostic data, covering both diesel and larger gasoline engines. The full-length Ultra is capable of diagnosing commercial vehicles from light diesel to Class A heavy-duty trucks. It delivers the widest coverage ever available at a single handheld diagnostic tool, including data for major vehicle systems. It's a great enabler for the -- it's a great enabler that I guess, quite simply, provides heavy-duty technicians with the range of diagnostics information now necessary to perform their daily tasks, and it's becoming the choice across the heavy-duty sector. 
Equipment division registered a low single-digit organic sales rise, overcoming the turbulence in Eastern Europe. Some of those gains were authored by our new aligner, the v2400 launched just this period. The v2400 designed for premium wholly-owned dealerships and for high-end wheel service shops, places that require advanced alignment techniques. It offers increased accuracy and repeatability, high-resolution cameras that produce live alignment and diagnostic data, passive lightweight front and rear targets that improve durability and advanced dimensioning that identifies frame or structural damage or mismatched tire sizes, a regular cause of vehicle pulling or driver complain. All of those are features that aid greatly in technician productivity. 
We believe we have an exceptional product in this next-generation aligner, and early indicates that our customers are saying the same thing. 
Speaking about Equipment division, May marked the 1 year anniversary of our acquisition of the Pro-Cut on-car brake lathes. We're excited that Pro-Cut is part of the team. When we put Pro-Cut Advanced brake servicing product line, Pro-Cut advanced brake servicing product line together with our -- with another recent ad, Challenger Lifts, gives us -- it gives us more to sell the vehicle repair shop owners and managers, the customers and independent shops, National Service chain and OEM dealerships. When package along with our other established RS&I product, Snap-on now offers a wider range of shop solutions than ever before. 
So to wrap up RS&I, we see new diagnostics, unique truck repair information and a growing undercar equipment offering, driving positive trends, improving our position with repair shop owners and managers across the globe. 
That's the highlights of our quarter: growth and improvement; C&I strength at SNA Europe, emerging markets and in critical industries, expanding margins; the Tools Group, growing double digits again, robust sales and operating margin, continuing to enhance our franchise network; RS&I, advancing its position, making gains in both independent shops and OEMs, growing operating margins by 120 basis points; and Financial Services,  raising its contribution and helping provide strategic evidence of growth for our Tools Group. And overall for the corporation, sales increasing organically by 8.4%. Opco, operating income margin of 17.7%, up 100 basis points. EPS, $2.03 in the quarter, 12.8% higher than the $1.80 last year. It was another encouraging quarter. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Aldo, who will take you through the financials in detail. Aldo?"

Net sales of $851.8 million in the quarter were up 8.4% organically. 
On a reported basis, net sales, including $43.4 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation, increased $25.3 million or 3.1% from 2014 levels. As you know, Snap-on has significant international operations and is subject to foreign currency fluctuations. Largely due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, foreign currency movements adversely impacted our year-over-year Q2 sales comparisons by 570 basis points. 
Consolidated gross profit of $419 million increased $18.6 million from 2014 levels, primarily due to benefits from higher sales, savings from RCI initiatives and lower restructuring costs, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency effects. Gross margin of 49.2% in the quarter improved 80 basis points from 48.4% a year ago. 
Operating expenses of $268.2 million increased $5.9 million largely due to higher volume related and other expenses, including higher pension expense, partially offset by favorable foreign currency translation and savings from RCI initiatives. The operating expense margin of 31.5% improved 20 basis points from 31.7% last year. 
No restructuring costs were incurred in the second quarter of 2015. The second quarter of last year, we incurred $1.4 million of such costs. Pension expense in the quarter was approximately $2 million higher as compared to the prior year, mostly reflecting the impacts of lower discount rates as well as increased life expectancies. 
As a result of these factors, operating earnings before Financial Services of $150.8 million in the quarter, including $12 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects increased 9.2% and as a percentage of sales, improved 100 basis points to 17.7%. 
Financial Services revenue of $58.7 million in the quarter increased 13.5% from 2014 levels while operating earnings of $41.4 million increased 19%. The increases in both revenue and operating earnings primarily reflects the continued growth of the Financial Services portfolio. 
Consolidated operating earnings of $192.2 million in the quarter, including $12.6 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased 11.2%, and the operating margin of 21.1% improved 140 basis points from 19.7% a year ago. 
Our second quarter effective income tax rate of 32% compared with 32.9% in the second quarter and 32.1% for the 2014 full year. Finally, net earnings of $120 million or $2.03 per diluted share increased $13.9 million or $0.23 per share, representing a 12.8% increase in diluted earnings per share. 
Now let's turn to our segment results. Starting with commercial and industrial, our C&I group on Slide 7. Sales of $295.8 million in the quarter were up 11.2% organically, reflecting a high single-digit gain in sales to customers in critical industries, a mid-single-digit increase in the segments European-based hand tools business, the double-digit increases in both the segments power tools and Asia Pacific operations. 
Gross profit in the C&I Group of $112.9 million in the quarter increased $1.1 million from 2014 levels primarily due to the benefit of higher sales and savings from RCI initiatives, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency effects. The gross margin of 38.2% decreased 70 basis points largely due to shift to lower gross margin sales, including higher sales to the military and increased sales in our Asia Pacific operations. 
Operating expenses of $70.7 million in the quarter decreased $2.9 million from 2014 levels, primarily due to favorable foreign currency translation, partially offset by higher volume related and other expenses. The operating expenses margin of 23.9% improved 170 basis points, mostly due to sales volume leverage including benefits from the previously mentioned sales shift. 
As a result of these factors, operating earnings for the C&I segment of $42.2 million, including $2 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased $4 million from 2014 levels, and the operating margin of 14.3% improved 100 basis points. 
Turning now to Slide 8. Second quarter sales of the Snap-on Tools Group of $398.7 million increased 11.2% organically, reflecting double-digit sales gains in both the company's U.S. and international franchise operations. Gross profit of $176.5 million increased $15.4 million from 2014 levels. The gross margin of 44.3% in the quarter improved 70 basis points, primarily due to benefits from higher sales and savings from RCI initiatives, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency effects. 
Operating expenses of $108.5 million increased $7.9 million from 2014 levels, principally due to higher volume related and other expenses, partially offset by favorable foreign currency translation. The second quarter operating expense margin was 27.2% in both years. 
As a result of these factors, operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $68 million, including $6.7 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased $7.5 million, and the operating margin of 17.1% improved 70 basis points. 
Turning to the Repair Systems & Information or RS&I Group shown on Slide 9. Sales of $277.4 million in the quarter increased 3.3% organically from 2014 levels. Organic sales increased primarily reflects a mid-single-digit gain in sales of diagnostics and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers and low single-digit gains in both sales of undercar equipment and sales to OEM dealerships. 
Gross profit of $129.6 million increased $2.1 million over 2014 levels, principally due to benefit of higher sales, savings from RCI initiatives and lower restructuring costs, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency effects. Gross margin of 46.7% improved 90 basis points year-over-year. Operating expenses of $61.9 million in the quarter decreased $1 million from 2014 levels, primarily due to favorable foreign currency translation and savings from RCI initiatives, partially offset by higher volume related and other expenses. 
The operating expense margin of 22.3% improved 30 basis points from 2014. Second quarter operating earnings for the RS&I Group of $67.7 million, including $3.3 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased $3.1 million from prior year levels and operating margin of 24.4% improved 120 basis points. 
Now turning to Slide 10. In the second quarter, operating earnings from Financial Services of $41.4 million on revenue of $58.7 million compared with operating earnings of $34.8 million on revenue of $51.7 million last year. 
The average yield on finance receivables of 17.8% in the quarter compared with 17.5% last year, and the average yield on contract receivables of 9.4% compared with 9.5% last year. Originations of $253.4 million increased 8.9% from 2014 levels. 
Turning to Slide 11. As of quarter end, our balance sheet included approximately $1.47 billion of gross financing receivables, including $1.27 billion from our U.S. Snap-on credit operation. 
Approximately 80% of our U.S. financing portfolio relates to extended credit loans to technicians. During the quarter, our worldwide finance portfolio grew approximately $63 million as for finance portfolio losses and delinquency trends, which continue to be in line with our expectations. 
Now turning to Slide 12. Cash provided by operations of $160.3 million in the quarter increased $35.9 million from comparable 2014 levels, reflecting higher net earnings in 2015 and the changes in operating assets and liabilities. Net cash used by investing activities of $85.4 million included $58.1 million to fund a net increase in finance receivables. Second quarter capital expenditures of $27.7 million included $7.8 million to acquire a previously leased bandsaw manufacturing facility in the United Kingdom. Capital expenditures in the second quarter of last year were $22.7 million. 
Turning to Slide 13. Days sales outstanding for trade receivables of 60 days compared with 61 days at 2014 year-end. Inventories increased $23.7 million from 2014 year-end levels, primarily to support continued higher customer demand and new product introductions. 
The trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 3.5 compared with 3.7 turns at 2014 year-end. Our quarter end cash position of $124.6 million decreased $8.3 million from 2014 year-end levels. The net decrease includes the impact of funding $416 million of new finance receivables, the repurchase of 580,000 shares for $86.9 million, dividend payments of $61.7 million and capital expenditures of $45.8 million. 
These cash decreases were largely offset by $319.3 million of cash from collections of finance receivables, $238.4 million of cash from operations, net of $25 million of discretionary cash contributions to the company's divested pension plans and $36.5 million of cash proceeds from stock purchase and option plan exercise. 
Our net debt-to-capital ratio of 25.8% compared with 26.3% at 2014 year-end. In addition to our $124.6 million of cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $700 million in available credit facilities, and our current short-term credit ratings allow us to assess commercial paper markets. At quarter end, we had $35 million of commercial paper borrowings outstanding. 
This concludes my remarks on our second quarter performance. I'll turn the call over to Nick for his closing thought. Nick?"

Once again, we believe the period stands as clear testimony to the opportunities abundant along our runways for growth and for improvement. And it confirms our team's capability to keep taking full advantage despite the challenges by unfavorable currency, turbulent economies and the industry dynamics. 
We are progressing along our runways for growth. C&I organic sales rising 11.2%. OI margin, 14.3%, up 100 basis points, extended to critical industries, gains in aviation and the military, building in emerging markets. The Tools Group, enhancing the van channel, wielding the network more powerfully than ever, organic sales up 11.2%; OI margin, 17.1%, a 70 basis point increase. 
In RS&I, organic sales up 3.3%, OI margin, 24.4%, an increase of 120 basis points. And the overall corporation growing organically at 8.4%, overcoming the headwind. 
We demonstrated progress down our runways for improvement. The corporate OI margin was 17.7%, up 100 basis points, more than offsetting 40 basis points of unfavorable currency impact. Putting all together with Financial Services contributions, earnings per share reached $2.03, up 12.8% against the wind. 
Second quarter was encouraging, and we believe it demonstrates again that Snap-on has the inherent advantages, the opportunities and the capabilities to advance to resist the turbulence, to keep progressing and to extend our positive trends of performance as we go forward. 
Before I turn the call over to the operator for questions, I'll speak a moment to our franchisees and associates. As always, I know many of you are listening. Please note that encouraging results in the second quarter would not have been possible without your dedication and capability, for your demonstrated skill, clear commitment and extraordinary contribution to our team, you have my congratulations, and you have my thanks.

Fundamentally, there is questions of timing. There's a secondary market that comes into that.

I think they're, what were they? 8.9% this quarter originations and 11.2%? But last quarter, they were reverse. It was 14.2% versus 12.9%, and the quarter before that, it was, in other words, 14.2% is the origination and 12.9% was the Tools Group and 17.5% was the originations in the fourth quarter and 11.8% was the Tools Group.

I mean, first of all, it's 1 quarter. That's one thing, and that can be moved up and down, but the diagnostics and information business, the sale of diagnostics on our information products into independent repair shops, which is a space we're talking about, was up fairly strong in the quarter. I think we said high single digits. So -- mid-single digits at that was a little bit better than RS&I. And then the second thing is I would offer that I was just on these Rock ‘N Roll -- I was on one of these Techno-Vans recently, and the van driver told me said we're not associated, we're not worried about competition. Our biggest competition is the difficulty in getting to a technician and explaining to him the product, getting him to appreciate the value of our business. He didn't cite any competitors out all. And in fact, I never see -- I was just with 12 other customers over the weekend, and I'm not -- 10 days ago, and they were talking about this product, and basically they talk about the idea that was better than anything else we had brought out. Secondly, I mean, thirdly, I would suppose that when you when we survey independent commissions, and we asked them what's your preferred form of diagnostic they still overwhelmingly Snap-on. I think the numbers, the latest numbers we have are 60 for Snap-on, 11 for #2. So you see all those. Now if you come back to RS&I I suppose your question was RS&I, I personally we were encouraged by the RS&I growth because of the Equipment business, which tends to get dinged because of Eastern Europe. So ironically Equipment business was grew I think Aldo said low single digits. So it's somewhat of a drag from a volume point of view, but from a margin point of view because in my remarks I talked about that new aligners of v2400, hey, that's a great product, and it's selling very well, and it's a great margin generator for us. So what you saw from it would business actually was a little bit of drag on diagnostics on RS&I revenues but a boost on RS&I margins because of the aligner business if it helps you understand RS&I a little bit more, but we don't see actually we don't see at least in my interactions from the market. So logically or at least in talking to them we don't see much pressure and then empirically we don't see it in the numbers as pressure either."

The more -- the higher-level ones that a shop would buy might have 1 or 2 of them in the shop we still have a lot of runway that area. So, and it's a very bottom product line for us. And in fact, we feel very positive about the possibilities and the opportunity for that opportunity. But what you say is very true. We now know that more and more of the repair activities in a shop are going to require diagnostics. I think I said possibly the last call that roughly 40% of repairs require diagnostics today and the new cars, 80% of the repair. So you can see how that's going to go as new cars roll into the marketplace, and so maintenance techs as opposed to repair techs, guys who do oil changes in battery changes and just tune up the cars are going to have to use diagnostics to do these kind of things to reset some of the parameters that they start with, that they change when they make these changes, and so we'll be looking to sell diagnostics those things, thus the purpose of the ETHOS Tech. So you would expect that, that would add a boost to that, and I would still say let's not talk the 4% to 6%, I would still say that if you look at the long-term sort of over the horizon opportunities for our businesses I would rank C&I with a critical eye industries and the emerging markets as the highest growth opportunity it's got unbounded opportunity. You look at I would say this particular one fits in the middle, and in the Tools Group, we've been able to wheel that model better and better each more submissions. But at the end of the day, it is not so I put them in this pieces. Maybe you might cheat up between the 4% to 6% number, but for our overall business, but I still see RS&I in that middle, initiative middle."

Now you see what happened of the Tools Group. You've got to sell raters on top of that, breaking through the barriers of space and time. I was just on a TechKnow van. We talked about that, and we always thought about that well it saves time and what it does is what the Rock ‘N Roll cab and the Techno-Van save time for the franchisee because when the franchisee rides in parallel with these vans a couple of times a year, it's like a training seminar because the guys, who is running the event is an incredible salesman and it saves our franchisees from going to training centers seminar to learn how to sell tool storage or to learn how to sell diagnostics and that's one of the reasons why the sales are up. We not only added to the retail space, but we also boosted the capabilities of our franchisees that's why same-store sales have been up greater than 6% 20 of the last 21 quarters. That's the kind of effect. So I think if we keep discovering ways to do that, we'll beat that 4% to 6%."

Well, if you offer it to them a couple of hundred dollars, they're even more enthusiastic. So part of what we're seeing there is this kind of push. We put the our 0.5-inch pneumatic impact, which is a popular product, but we garbed it in a 95th anniversary or the ratchet or our air hammers, things like that or our cordless impact, and those are have become popular. I don't think it's a special demand thing. I think power tools our kind of people they wear out, people buy them periodically, and it's like a new car. You show up with a new color and especially 95th anniversary colors for Snap-on is a collector item, particularly compelling color, and so they like that. That's what's driving this."

We have variations because we have 6 or 7 critical industries in that area. This quarter, we happen to have a good -- we had good progress aviation, heavy-duty, the heavy-duty sector was strong for us, railroads were strong oil and gas was weak. I think -- but actually I'm not so sure it has -- last time it was up against the wind, and I think for us we're just starting to penetrate these areas. So they're not so driven by the economics as they are. When you're just starting to penetrate, you can get quite a variation from quarter-to-quarter, and that's the kind of thing we saw. We saw some flatness in things like mining like that, but generally, that's the lens. Military was up double digits. We kind of expect C&I to keep -- the idea of extending to critical industries to keep going keeps -- to keep moving. Now I don't say it happens every quarter. I mean, this is a great example. I mean, I say every third -- every second quarter that we feel very good from a C&I -- we feel very good right now about our commercial industrial trajectory. We feel very good about our tools trajectory. We feel very good about our software and diagnostics trajectory, but that's the trajectory, and without giving -- I'm not warning anything or saying anything about the third quarter is always. I mean, we have vacations in the third quarter and so on. So you can tell what sectors will be going in and out because we have our franchisees going on vacation sometimes in the third quarter, Europe's on vacation. So it's hard for me to predict it for every quarter, but I can tell you we feel very encouraged by the trajectory, and I'm not in any way trying to say that we're going to have a tepid third quarter or anything like that."

That's the things that are occurring and that when you married up with RCI that allows you to do these things more effectively allows you to drive profitability our ports as well as volume.

I'll speak about the general environment and about the trends we see, and I'll take you through some of the progress we've made. Then Aldo will move into a more detailed review of the financials.
Our second quarter results were encouraging. We believe they once again offer strong evidence of clear Snap-on advancements along our runways for both growth and for improvement. Organic sales were up 8.4% from last year. The operating margin expanded by 100 basis points. And earnings per share, they reached $2.03, up 12.8% compared with the $1.80 we reported last year.
Our reported sales increase was 3.1%. That total includes the continuing weight of unfavorable foreign currency translation this quarter, an impact of $43.4 million. Including the incremental $2.8 million from last year's Pro-Cut acquisition, our total reported sales for the period were $851.8 million.
The opco operating margin reached 17.7%, up from 16.7% in 2014, and as I said, representing 100 basis point increase, more than offsetting the 40 basis point impact on profit from unfavorable currency. Financial Services operating income grew to $41.4 million from last year's $34.8 million, driving our consolidating operating margin, Financial Services plus opco, to 21.1%, higher by 140 basis points.
It was an encouraging quarter. From an overall macro perspective, we believe the conditions remain favorable for our businesses serving automotive repair customers, the businesses like the Tools Group and the Repair Systems & Information or RS&I Group.
In the second quarter, the Tools Group organic activity increased 11.2%. The tailwinds of changing vehicle technology and the aging of the fleet continue to provide opportunity. And the rising strength of our van network and our robust continuing line of new products, they enable Snap-on to take greater advantage of those tailwinds, and clear -- and it's clearly evidenced in the numbers.
In RS&I, net organic gains of 3.3%, led by higher sales of diagnostics and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers, increased sales to OEM dealerships and higher sales of other car equipment, all serving to offset the particular challenges in Russia, Eastern Europe and the Middle East, where that group had made particular progress in prior periods.
For the Commercial & Industrial Group or C&I, there are also continued signs of advancement. Organic sales up 11.2% in the quarter. And for C&I, along our runways for growth, we saw important and clear headway, headway in our efforts to extend in the critical industries, in our European business and in several emerging markets. That progress was won against pockets of turbulence in geographies like Europe, where the uncertainty of Greece looms; in places like Japan, where recovery is sporadic; and in the U.S. military. U.S. military, it's been a somewhat unpredictable sector. Well, in the second quarter, U.S. military activity experienced for Snap-on another strong period, up double digits from last year.
However, we do remain cautious on the military business. There -- this is a period of uncertainty. Changing deployments and budget pressure make it difficult to predict the future trajectory of that business with any confidence. But having said that, we believe we're well positioned in the military sector to make the most of any available opportunities, any available openings.
Overall, the C&I results are quite positive, the opportunity is definitely outweighing the challenges, and the results, they confirm it.
More broadly, for the whole operation for all of Snap-on, the operating income gains across the corporation clearly demonstrate the leverage and the power of Snap-on -- of the Snap-on Value Creation Processes. Safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and rapid continuous improvement, they all drive our improvement every day, and they help to offer our 100 basis point gain in the quarter, overcoming the significant challenges.
Now let's highlight some of the advancements in growth and in improvements demonstrated by the individual groups. Let's start with C&I.
As I just said, an 11.2% organic sales gain, and that follows a 9.8% organic sales gain in the first quarter. C&I's operating income margin was 14.3%, up 100 basis points. Both the higher volume and the benefits of Snap-on Value Creation drove that rise. And there was some very positive volume gains.
SNA Europe registered its seventh straight quarter of year-over-year growth, a promising trend, outperforming the storm clouds that occupied the headlines of Europe. The industrial division saw particularly strong activity in the aviation sector, a key area of our focus in extending the critical industries.
Some of those aerospace gains can be attributed to our growing line of innovative new products specifically aimed at that industry, products like our new array of aircraft tire gauges and inflators. When it comes to aircraft tires and struts, proper measurement and inflation are key for safe takeoffs and landing as well as for braking predictability and effectiveness.
We talk about critical industry, those sound kind of critical for people who travel. Raising the bar in that arena, our new line of 300 psi analog and digital tire gauges offer improved accuracy. Our approval for hazardous environments and incorporate a reflective glow dialer backlit display, it makes -- they make the technicians work more effective, safer and easier, meeting all type of challenges in all types of conditions.
Also in the quarter aimed right at aviation, we introduced the new Snap-on electrostatic discharge safe precision pliers. They're designed for use on static-sensitive components and circuitry, with a specifically designed handle to dissipate electricity, improves squeezing torque control and a low-profile design for greater accessibility than the standard pliers, all features that are valued by professionals performing those critical aviation tasks.
The 300 psi tire gauges, the static discharge safe pliers, innovative new products adding to our growing aerospace offering and clearly demonstrating our efforts to roll the Snap-on brand out of the garage to extend to critical industries like aviation. And the second quarter results, they confirm that it's working.
Now let's speak about SNA Europe, our European hand tools -- our European-based hand tool business. SNA Europe, broad organic growth and the gains in the period up mid-single digits, growth in Spain, the United Kingdom and the Nordic region. And beside that volume rise, SNA Europe continued its trajectory of operating margin improvement, leveraging the additional sales, but also realizing the benefits of RCI and Snap-on Value Creation against the backdrop of substantial euroland turbulence. SNA Europe, sales up for the seventh straight quarter, but once again, profits up more.
And we're also continuing to build in emerging markets. Asia Pacific was another contributor to C&I growth, activity up in relatively uneven markets like Korea and Indonesia. C&I did have an encouraging quarter, but we know there's still more opportunity, opportunity to continue building on the momentum generated by our European operations to strengthen our position in -- within emerging markets and to proceed forward down our runways of critical industries, extending to even more customers.
Now let's move to the Tools Group. Sales were up 11.2% organically with double-digit gains in the U.S. and international. Operating margin of 17.1%, up 70 basis points versus the 16.4% recorded last year. And overcoming within the quarter, 120 basis points of unfavorable currency impact. That 70 basis point improvement brings our Tools Group OI margin to new levels. And that margin performance clearly speaks to our improving position, and when combined with the growth this quarter, demonstrates the success we're having on this decisive runway, enhancing the franchise network. You can see it in the sales, and you can see it in the overall franchise health metrics, trending positively again this quarter.
Snap-on franchisees are a committed and capable group. And you're convinced of that every time you meet one of them. And we're working hard every day to support their effort through creative marketing, access to in-house customer financing with Snap-on Credit and a growing array of innovative new products, products like our new ratcheting combination wrenches with an innovative design, higher strength and enhanced durability. Our new ratcheting gear design safely delivers 25% more torque and 95% longer fatigue life. Innovative Snap-on technology, enabling the transfer of more power in a thinner, smaller diameter wrench head, helping access and remove the most stubborn of fasteners in tight, tight spaces.
The Dual 80 design with an 82-tooth ratcheting gear and dual pawls minimize the swing arc that's needed to move fasteners, a great enabler, a great enabler in the engine compartments of today's vehicles. And of course, that new -- the new wrench features our unique Flank Drive wrenching system that consistently minimizes fastener damage. Snap-on's new line of combination wrenches raises the bar for professionals in performing critical and difficult tasks. It's a winning tool line on an existing product platform, a direct result of Snap-on Value Creation, shaped by customer connection, direct observations in the shop and delivered by the Snap-on innovation process. It's already generating excitement in the repair shops all over this country, and there's more to come.
Now the growing strength of our van network, our rolling selling space to the van network is, is evident when the increases in big ticket sales. And a considerable boost comes from our hands-on demonstration vehicles like the Rock ‘N Roll Cab Express vans, 66 of them, bringing a much wider range of our tool storage lineups directly to the shop, more colors, more shapes, more options and more choices displayed across our customer base. And if you've been listening to these calls for any time, you've heard the story of this innovative marketing initiative, the Rock ‘N Roll van, expanding our van selling space. And they continue to be a significant contributor to the Tools Group.
In the quarter, big ticket sales were up strong double digits, and our demonstration vans were a big driver. But those vans weren't the only factor. Big ticket gains were also propelled by new 2 storage products, winning offerings like our special edition 95th anniversary box, another in a long line of our customized tool storage systems. We mentioned, I think, on the last quarter's call, and they've been popular, technicians upgrading their workspace, celebrating our milestone year and providing clear testimony to the strength of the Snap-on brand positioned in shopped -- shops all around the world.
Another key advantage for the Tools Group is our Financial Services on, Snap-on Credit. Strategic program aimed at smoothing the way for those big ticket purchases. Our credit company plays an essential role in enhancing the van network, and again this quarter, it did just that. Well, that's the Tools Group, attractive new products guided by customer connection, innovative marketing and a unique credit facility, all increasing the power of the Snap-on van channel and driving sales to new levels.
Now on to RS&I. Organic sales growth of $8.7 million or 3.3%. The second quarter operating margin, 24.4%, rising 120 basis points compared to last year's 23.2%.
Margin expansion, another demonstration of RCI and Snap-on Value Creation. The organic sales gain was broad-based. The diagnostics and information businesses, selling to independent repair shop owners and managers with a mid-single-digit gain in volume, helped by new products, products like the ETHOS Tech, our newest diagnostic handheld offering, aimed -- it's aimed at individual shop technicians and first-time diagnostic buyers.
The ETHOS Tech is a full function scan tool with a quick boot-up, streamlined interface, a large color screen and full comprehensive coverage of car makes and vehicle systems, all the features that are so important even for the entry-level technician in today's environment, where vehicle diagnostics are becoming essential for everyday maintenance as well as complex repair. More technicians than ever before will be using diagnostics in almost every job, and the ETHOS Tech is a great way for them to get started.
Also in the quarter, RS&I released its latest software update for our PRO-LINK Ultra, supplying truck shops with even broader diagnostic data, covering both diesel and larger gasoline engines. The PRO-LINK Ultra is capable of diagnosing commercial vehicles from light diesel to Class A heavy-duty trucks. It delivers the widest coverage ever available on a -- at a single handheld diagnostic tool, including data for major vehicle systems. It's a great enabler for the -- it's a great enabler that, I guess quite simply, provides heavy-duty technicians with the range of diagnostics information now necessary to perform their daily tasks. And it's becoming the choice across the heavy-duty sector.
Equipment division registered a low single-digit organic sales rise, overcoming the turbulence in Eastern Europe. Some of those gains were authored by our new aligner, the V2400, launched just this period. The V2400 designed for premium OEM dealerships and for high-end wheel service shops, places that require advanced alignment techniques. It offers increased accuracy and repeatability, high-resolution cameras that produce live alignment and diagnostic data, passive lightweight front and rear targets that improve durability and advanced dimensioning that identifies frame or structural damage or mismatched tire sizes, a regular cause of vehicle pulling or driver complains. All of those are features that aid greatly in technician productivity. We believe we have an exceptional product in this next-generation aligner. And early returns [ph] indicate that our customers are saying the same thing.
Speaking about the Equipment division. May marked the 1 year anniversary of our acquisition of the Pro-Cut on-car brake lathes. We're excited that Pro-Cut is part of the team. When we put Pro-Cut advanced brake servicing product line together with our -- with another recent add, Challenger Lifts, it gives us more to sell the vehicle repair shop owners and managers, the customers and the independent shops, national service chains and OEM dealerships. And when package along with our other established RS&I products, Snap-on now offers a wider range of shop solutions than ever before.
So to wrap up RS&I, we see new diagnostics, unique truck repair information and a growing undercar equipment offering, driving positive trends, improving our position with repair shop owners and managers across the globe.
Well, that's the highlights of our quarter: growth and improvement; C&I strength at SNA Europe, in emerging markets and in critical industries; expanding margins. The Tools Group, growing double digits again, robust sales and operating margin, continuing to enhance our franchise network. RS&I, advancing its position, making gains in both independent shops and OEMs, growing operating margins by 120 basis points. And Financial Services, raising its contribution and helping provide strategic evidence of growth for our Tools Group and overall, overall for the corporation. Sales increasing organically by 8.4%. Opco, operating income margin of 17.7%, up 100 basis points. EPS, $2.03 in the quarter, 12.8% higher than the $1.80 last year. It was another encouraging quarter.
Now I'll turn the call over to Aldo, who will take you through the financials in detail. Aldo?"

Net sales of $851.8 million in the quarter were up 8.4% organically. On a reported basis, net sales, including $43.4 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation, increased $25.3 million or 3.1% from 2014 levels. As you know, Snap-on has significant international operations and is subject to foreign currency fluctuations. Largely due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, foreign currency movements adversely impacted our year-over-year Q2 sales comparisons by 570 basis points.
Consolidated gross profit of $419 million increased $18.6 million from 2014 levels, primarily due to benefits from higher sales, savings from RCI initiatives and lower restructuring costs, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency effects. The gross margin of 49.2% in the quarter improved 80 basis points from 48.4% a year ago.
Operating expenses of $268.2 million increased $5.9 million, largely due to the higher volume related and other expenses, including higher pension expense, partially offset by favorable foreign currency translation and savings from RCI initiatives. The operating expense margin of 31.5% improved 20 basis points from 31.7% last year.
No restructuring costs were incurred in the second quarter of 2015. In the second quarter of last year, we incurred $1.4 million of such costs. Pension expense in the quarter was approximately $2 million higher as compared to the prior year, mostly reflecting the impacts of lower discount rates as well as increased life expectancies.
As a result of these factors, operating earnings before Financial Services of $150.8 million in the quarter, including $12 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased 9.2%, and as a percentage of sales, improved 100 basis points to 17.7%.
Financial Services revenue of $58.7 million in the quarter increased 13.5% from 2014 levels, while operating earnings of $41.4 million increased 19%. The increases in both revenue and operating earnings primarily reflect the continued growth of the Financial Services portfolio.
Consolidated operating earnings of $192.2 million in the quarter, including $12.6 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased 11.2%. And the operating margin of 21.1% improved 140 basis points from 19.7% a year ago.
Our second quarter effective income tax rate of 32% compared with 32.9% in the second quarter and 32.1% for the 2014 full year. Finally, net earnings of $120 million or $2.03 per diluted share increased $13.9 million or $0.23 per share, representing a 12.8% increase in diluted earnings per share.
Now let's turn to our segment results. Starting with Commercial & Industrial, our C&I Group on Slide 7. Sales of $295.8 million in the quarter were up 11.2% organically, reflecting a high single-digit gain in sales to customers in critical industries, a mid-single-digit increase in the segment's European-based hand tools business and double-digit increases in both the segment's power tools and Asia Pacific operations.
Gross profit in the C&I Group of $112.9 million in the quarter increased $1.1 million from 2014 levels, primarily due to the benefit of higher sales and savings from RCI initiatives, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency effects. The gross margin of 38.2% decreased 70 basis points, largely due to shift to lower gross margin sales, including higher sales to the military and increased sales in our Asia Pacific operations.
Operating expenses of $70.7 million in the quarter decreased $2.9 million from 2014 levels, primarily due to favorable foreign currency translation, partially offset by higher volume related and other expenses. The operating expense margin of 23.9% improved 170 basis points, mostly due to sales volume leverage including benefits from the previously mentioned sales shift.
As a result of these factors, operating earnings for the C&I segment of $42.2 million, including $2 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased $4 million from 2014 levels, and the operating margin of 14.3% improved 100 basis points.
Turning now to Slide 8. Second quarter sales of the Snap-on Tools Group of $398.7 million increased 11.2% organically, reflecting double-digit sales gains in both the company's U.S. and international franchise operations. Gross profit of $176.5 million increased $15.4 million from 2014 levels. And the gross margin of 44.3% in the quarter improved 70 basis points, primarily due to benefits from higher sales and savings from RCI initiatives, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency effects.
Operating expenses of $108.5 million increased $7.9 million from 2014 levels, principally due to higher volume related and other expenses, partially offset by favorable foreign currency translation. The second quarter operating expense margin was 27.2% in both years. As a result of these factors, operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $68 million, including $6.7 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased $7.5 million, and the operating margin of 17.1% improved 70 basis points.
Turning to the Repair Systems & Information or RS&I Group shown on Slide 9. Sales of $277.4 million in the quarter increased 3.3% organically from 2014 levels. The organic sales increase primarily reflects a mid-single-digit gain in sales of diagnostics and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers and low single-digit gains in both sales of undercar equipment and sales to OEM dealerships.
Gross profit of $129.6 million increased $2.1 million over 2014 levels, principally due to benefit of higher sales, savings from RCI initiatives and lower restructuring cost, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency effects. The gross margin of 46.7% improved 90 basis points year-over-year.
Operating expenses of $61.9 million in the quarter decreased $1 million from 2014 levels, primarily due to favorable foreign currency translation and savings from RCI initiatives, partially offset by higher volume related and other expenses. The operating expense margin of 22.3% improved 30 basis points from 2014. Second quarter operating earnings for the RS&I Group of $67.7 million, including $3.3 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased $3.1 million from prior year levels, and the operating margin of 24.4% improved 120 basis points.
Now turning to Slide 10. In the second quarter, operating earnings from Financial Services of $41.4 million on revenue of $58.7 million compared with operating earnings of $34.8 million on revenue of $51.7 million last year. The average yield on finance receivables of 17.8% in the quarter compared with 17.5% last year, and the average yield on contract receivables of 9.4% compared with 9.5% last year. Originations of $253.4 million increased 8.9% from 2014 levels.
Moving to Slide 11. As of quarter end, our balance sheet includes approximately $1.47 billion of gross financing receivables, including $1.27 billion from our U.S. Snap-on Credit operation. Approximately 80% of our U.S. financing portfolio relates to extended credit loans to technicians. During the quarter, our worldwide finance portfolio grew approximately $63 million. As for finance portfolio losses and delinquency trends, these continue to be in line with our expectations.
Now turning to Slide 12. Cash provided by operations of $160.3 million in the quarter increased $35.9 million from comparable 2014 levels, reflecting higher net earnings in 2015 and net changes in operating assets and liabilities. Net cash used by investing activities of $85.4 million included $58.1 million to fund a net increase in finance receivables. Second quarter capital expenditures of $27.7 million included $7.8 million to acquire a previously leased bandsaw manufacturing facility in the United Kingdom. Capital expenditures in the second quarter of last year were $22.7 million.
Turning to Slide 13. Days sales outstanding for trade receivables of 60 days compared with 61 days at 2014 year-end. Inventories increased $23.7 million from 2014 year-end levels, primarily to support continued higher customer demand and new product introductions.
On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 3.5 compared with 3.7 turns at 2014 year end. Our quarter end cash position of $124.6 million decreased $8.3 million from 2014 year-end levels. The net decrease includes the impact of funding $416 million of new finance receivables, the repurchase of 580,000 shares for $86.9 million, dividend payments of $61.7 million and capital expenditures of $45.8 million.
These cash decreases were largely offset by $319.3 million of cash from collections of finance receivables, $238.4 million of cash from operations, net of $25 million of discretionary cash contributions to the company's domestic pension plans and $36.5 million of cash proceeds from stock purchase and option plan exercises.
Our net debt-to-capital ratio of 25.8% compared with 26.3% at 2014 year-end. In addition to our $124.6 million of cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $700 million in available credit facilities, and our current short-term credit ratings allow us to access the commercial paper markets. At quarter end, we had $35 million of commercial paper borrowings outstanding.
This concludes my remarks on our second quarter performance. Now I'll turn the call over to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick?"

Once again, we believe the period stands as a clear testimony to the opportunities abundant along our runways for growth and for improvement. And it confirms our team's capability to keep taking full advantage despite the challenges by unfavorable currency, turbulent economies and varying industry dynamics.
We are progressing along our runways for growth. C&I organic sales rising 11.2%. OI margin 14.3%, up 100 basis points. Extended to critical industries, gains in aviation and the military, building in emerging markets. The Tools Group, enhancing the van channel, wielding the network more powerfully than ever. Organic sales up 11.2%; OI margin 17.1%, a 70 basis point increase.
In RS&I, organic sales up 3.3%. OI margin 24.4%, an increase of 120 basis points. And the overall corporation growing organically at 8.4%, overcoming the headwind.
And we demonstrated progress down our runways for improvement. The corporate OI margin was 17.7%, up 100 basis points, more than offsetting 40 basis points of unfavorable currency impact. Putting it all together with Financial Services contributions, earnings per share reached $2.03, up 12.8% against the wind. 
Second quarter was encouraging, and we believe it demonstrates again that Snap-on has the inherent advantages, the opportunities and the capabilities to advance to resist the turbulence, to keep progressing and to extend our positive trends of performance as we go forward.
Before I turn the call over to the operator for questions, I'll speak a moment to our franchisees and associates. As always, I know many of you are listening.

I think they're -- what were they, 8.9% this quarter in originations and 11.2%. But last quarter, they were reverse. It was 14.2% versus 12.9%. And the quarter before that, it was -- in other words, 14.2% was the originations and 12.9% was the Tools Group. And 17.5% was the originations in the fourth quarter and 11.8% was the Tools Group.

I mean, first of all, it's one quarter. That's one thing. And that can be moved up and down. But the diagnostics and information business, the sale of diagnostics on our information products into independent repair shops, which is a space we're talking about, was up fairly strongly in the quarter. I think we said high single digits, so -- or mid-single digits. So that was a little bit better than RS&I. And then the second thing is I would offer that I was just on these Rock ‘N Roll -- I was on one of these Techno-Vans recently, and the van driver told me, said we're not associated, we're not worried about competition. Our biggest competition is the difficulty in getting to a technician and explaining to him the product, getting him to appreciate the value of our business. He didn't cite any competitors at all. In fact, I never see -- I was just with 12 other customers over the weekend, and I'm not -- 10 days ago, and they were talking about this product. And basically, they talked about the idea that was better than anything else we had brought out. Secondly -- I mean, thirdly, I would suppose that when you -- when we survey independent technicians and we ask them what's your preferred form of diagnostic, it's still overwhelmingly Snap-on. I think the numbers -- the latest numbers we have are 60 for Snap-on, 11 for #2. So you see all those. Now if you come back to RS&I, I suppose your question was, well, RS&I, I personally -- we were encouraged by the RS&I growth because of the Equipment business, which tends to get dinged because of Eastern Europe. So ironically, Equipment business was -- grew, I think Aldo said, low single digits. So it's somewhat of a drag from a volume point of view. But from a margin point of view, because in my remarks, I talked about that new aligner, the V2400. Hey, that's a great product, and it's selling very well, and it's a great margin generator for us. So what you saw from the Equipment business actually was a little bit of drag on diagnostics -- on RS&I revenues, but a boost on RS&I margins because of the aligner business if it helps you understand RS&I a little bit more. But we don't  see -- actually we don't see, at least in my interactions from the market, so logically or at least in talking to them, we don't see much pressure. And then empirically, we don't see it in the numbers as pressure either."

And so maintenance techs as opposed to repair techs, guys who do oil changes and battery changes and just tune up the cars are going to have to use diagnostics to do these kinds of things to reset some of the parameters that they start with, that they change when they make these changes. And so we'll be looking to sell diagnostics those things, thus the purpose of the ETHOS Tech. So you would expect that, that would add a boost to that. But I would still say, let's not talk the 4% to 6%. I would still say that if you look at the long-term sort of over-the-horizon opportunities for our businesses, I would rank C&I with the critical industries and the emerging markets as the highest growth opportunity. It's got unbounded opportunity. You look at, I would say, this particular one, sits in the middle. And then the Tools Group, we've been able to wheel that model better and better, reach more technicians. But at the end of the day, it is bound. So I put them in those pieces. Now maybe you might cheat up between the 4% to 6%, the number, but I -- for our overall business, but I still see RS&I in that middle, in middle."

When I said 4% to 6%, I meant generally, we can grow at that level if you want to look at the Tools Group. We said it at the -- we can grow at that level, roughly double GDP, without necessarily coming up with things that would make our models more powerful. We could capture more customers. We could add more -- no accelerators. Now you see what happened in the Tools Group. We got accelerators on top of that, breaking through the barriers of space and time. I was just on a Techno -- I just said, I was on a Techno-Van, we talked about that. And we always thought about that, well, it saves time. And what it does is both the Rock ‘N Roll cab and the Techno-Van save time for the franchisee, because when he -- when the franchisee rides in parallel with these vans a couple of times a year, it's like a training seminar, because the guy who is running the van, is an incredible salesman. And it saves our franchisee from going to training center -- seminar to learn how to sell tool storage or to learn how to sell diagnostics. And that's one of the reasons why the sales are up. We not only added to the retail space, but we also boosted the capabilities of our franchisees. That's why same-store sales have been up greater than 6% 20 of the last 21 quarters. That's the kind of effect. So I think if we keep discovering ways to do that, we'll beat that 4% to 6%."

The repair ways will rise. We will take advantage of it. The shape of that advantage we have to figure out going forward. That's really our situation. I don't -- of course, Asia is now -- I think, it's correct and popular to say that Asia is varying, and it is. You see variations in India. MODIS isn't catching on quite a bit. You see Indonesia coming back actually. Japan is actually getting a little better. We had a pretty good reasonable quarter in Japan. Korea came back. Even though MERS has given us some problem, we had a good quarter in Korea. So you have variations, but nothing that interdicts the long-term view. And I spent 6 weeks a year there."

I think -- but actually, I'm not so sure it has -- last time, it was up against the wind. And I think for us, we're just starting to penetrate these areas. So they're not so driven by the economics as they are -- when you're just starting to penetrate, you can get quite a variation from quarter-to-quarter. And that's the kind of thing we saw. We saw some flatness in things like mining, stuff like that. But generally, that's the lens. Military was up double digits. We kind of expect C&I to keep -- the idea of extending to critical industries to keep going, to keep moving. Now I don't say it happens every quarter. I mean, this is a great example. I mean, I say every third -- every second quarter that we feel very good from a C&I -- we feel very good right now about our Commercial & Industrial trajectory. We feel very good about our tools trajectory. We feel very good about our software and diagnostics trajectory. But that's the trajectory, and without giving -- I'm not warning anything or saying anything about -- the third quarter is always scrolly [ph].

That's the things that are occurring. And that when you marry it up with RCI, that allows you to do these things more effectively, allows you to drive profitability upwards as well as volume. One other thing is that -- I think I've said this is, is that one of the things that works for us, kind of a tailwind in a way, is that we're a company that has complex product offerings, 65,000 SKUs.

Our second quarter results were encouraging. We believe they once again offer strong evidence of clear Snap-on advancements along our runways for both growth and for improvement. Organic sales were up 8.4% from last year. The operating margin expanded by 100 basis points. And earnings per share, they reached $2.03, up 12.8% compared with the $1.80 we reported last year.
Our reported sales increase was 3.1%. That total includes the continuing weight of unfavorable foreign currency translation this quarter, an impact of $43.4 million. Including the incremental $2.8 million from last year's Pro-Cut acquisition, our total reported sales for the period were $851.8 million.
The opco operating margin reached 17.7%, up from 16.7% in 2014, and as I said, representing 100 basis point increase, more than offsetting the 40 basis point impact on profit from unfavorable currency. Financial Services operating income grew to $41.4 million from last year's $34.8 million, driving our consolidating operating margin, Financial Services plus opco, to 21.1%, higher by 140 basis points.
It was an encouraging quarter. From an overall macro perspective, we believe the conditions remain favorable for our businesses serving automotive repair customers, the businesses like the Tools Group and the Repair Systems & Information or RS&I Group.
In the second quarter, the Tools Group organic activity increased 11.2%. The tailwinds of changing vehicle technology and the aging of the fleet continue to provide opportunity. And the rising strength of our van network and our robust continuing line of new products, they enable Snap-on to take greater advantage of those tailwinds, and clear -- and it's clearly evidenced in the numbers.
In RS&I, net organic gains of 3.3%, led by higher sales of diagnostics and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers, increased sales to OEM dealerships and higher sales of our car equipment, all serving to offset the particular challenges in Russia, Eastern Europe and the Middle East, where that group had made particular progress in prior periods.
For the Commercial & Industrial Group or C&I, there are also continued signs of advancement. Organic sales up 11.2% in the quarter. And for C&I, along our runways for growth, we saw important and clear headway, headway in our efforts to extend in the critical industries, in our European business and in several emerging markets. That progress was won against pockets of turbulence in geographies like Europe, where the uncertainty of Greece looms; in places like Japan, where recovery is sporadic; and in the U.S. military. U.S. military, it's been a somewhat unpredictable sector. Well, in the second quarter, U.S. military activity experienced for Snap-on another strong period, up double digits from last year.
However, we do remain cautious on the military business. There -- this is a period of uncertainty. Changing deployments and budget pressure make it difficult to predict the future trajectory of that business with any confidence. But having said that, we believe we're well positioned in the military sector to make the most of any available opportunities, any available openings.
Overall, the C&I results are quite positive, the opportunity is definitely outweighing the challenges, and the results, they confirm it.
More broadly, for the whole operation for all of Snap-on, the operating income gains across the corporation clearly demonstrate the leverage and the power of Snap-on -- of the Snap-on Value Creation Processes. Safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and rapid continuous improvement, they all drive our improvement every day, and they helped to offer our 100 basis point gain in the quarter, overcoming the significant challenges.
Now let's highlight some of the advancements in growth and in improvements demonstrated by the individual groups. Let's start with C&I.
As I just said, an 11.2% organic sales gain, and that follows a 9.8% organic sales gain in the first quarter. C&I's operating income margin was 14.3%, up 100 basis points. Both the higher volume and the benefits of Snap-on Value Creation drove that rise. And there was some very positive volume gains.
SNA Europe registered its seventh straight quarter of year-over-year growth, a promising trend, outperforming the storm clouds that occupied the headlines of Europe. The industrial division saw particularly strong activity in the aviation sector, a key area of our focus in extending the critical industries.
Some of those aerospace gains can be attributed to our growing line of innovative new products specifically aimed at that industry, products like our new array of aircraft tire gauges and inflators. When it comes to aircraft tires and struts, proper measurement and inflation are key for safe takeoffs and landing as well as for braking predictability and effectiveness.
We talk about critical industry, those sound kind of critical for people who travel. Raising the bar in that arena, our new line of 300 psi analog and digital tire gauges offer improved accuracy. Our approval for hazardous environments and incorporate a reflective glow dialer backlit display, it makes -- they make the technicians work more effective, safer and easier, meeting all type of challenges in all types of conditions.
Also in the quarter aimed right at aviation, we introduced the new Snap-on Electrostatic Discharge-Safe Precision Pliers. They're designed for use on static-sensitive components and circuitry, with a specifically designed handle to dissipate electricity, improves squeezing torque control and a low-profile design for greater accessibility than the standard pliers, all features that are valued by professionals performing those critical aviation tasks.
The 300 psi tire gauges, the static discharge safe pliers, innovative new products adding to our growing aerospace offering and clearly demonstrating our efforts to roll the Snap-on brand out of the garage to extend to critical industries like aviation. And the second quarter results, they confirm that it's working.
Now let's speak about SNA Europe, our European hand tools -- our European-based hand tool business. SNA Europe, broad organic growth and gains in the period up mid-single digits, growth in Spain, the United Kingdom and the Nordic region. And beside that volume rise, SNA Europe continued its trajectory of operating margin improvement, leveraging the additional sales, but also realizing the benefits of RCI and Snap-on Value Creation against the backdrop of substantial euroland turbulence. SNA Europe, sales up for the seventh straight quarter, but once again, profits up more.
And we're also continuing to build in emerging markets. Asia Pacific was another contributor to C&I growth, activity up in relatively uneven markets like Korea and Indonesia. C&I did have an encouraging quarter, but we know there's still more opportunity, opportunity to continue building on the momentum generated by our European operations to strengthen our position in -- within emerging markets and to proceed forward down our runways of critical industries, extending to even more customers.
Now let's move to the Tools Group. Sales were up 11.2% organically with double-digit gains in the U.S. and internationally. Operating margin of 17.1%, up 70 basis points versus the 16.4% recorded last year, and overcoming within the quarter, 120 basis points of unfavorable currency impact. That 70 basis point improvement brings our Tools Group OI margin to new levels. And that margin performance clearly speaks to our improving position, and when combined with the growth this quarter, demonstrates the success we're having on this decisive runway, enhancing the franchise network. You can see it in the sales, and you can see it in the overall franchise health metrics, trending positively again this quarter.
Snap-on franchisees are a committed and capable group. And you're convinced of that every time you meet one of them. And we're working hard every day to support their effort through creative marketing, access to in-house customer financing with Snap-on Credit and a growing array of innovative new products, products like our new ratcheting combination wrenches with an innovative design, higher strength and enhanced durability. Our new ratcheting gear design safely delivers 25% more torque and 95% longer fatigue life. Innovative Snap-on technology, enabling the transfer of more power in a thinner, smaller diameter wrench head, helping to access and remove the most stubborn of fasteners in tight, tight spaces.
The Dual 80® design with an 80-tooth ratcheting gear and dual pawls minimizes the swing arc that's needed to move fasteners, a great enabler, a great enabler in the engine compartments of today's vehicles. And of course, that new -- the new wrench features our unique Flank Drive wrenching system that consistently minimizes fastener damage. Snap-on's new line of combination wrenches raises the bar for professionals in performing critical and difficult tasks. It's a winning tool line on an existing product platform, a direct result of Snap-on Value Creation, shaped by customer connection, direct observations in the shop and delivered by the Snap-on innovation process. It's already generating excitement in the repair shops all over this country, and there's more to come.
Now the growing strength of our van network, our rolling selling space to the van network is--is evident with the increases in big ticket sales. And a considerable boost comes from our hands-on demonstration vehicles like the Rock ‘N Roll Cab Express vans, 66 of them, bringing a much wider range of our tool storage lineups directly to the shop, more colors, more shapes, more options and more choices displayed across our customer base. And if you've been listening to these calls for any time, you've heard the story of this innovative marketing initiative, the Rock ‘N Roll van, expanding our van selling space. And they continue to be a significant contributor to the Tools Group.
In the quarter, big ticket sales were up strong double digits, and our demonstration vans were a big driver. But those vans weren't the only factor. Big ticket gains were also propelled by new tool storage products, winning offerings like our special edition 95th anniversary box, another in a long line of our customized tool storage systems. We mentioned them, I think, on the last quarter's call, and they've been popular. Technicians upgrading their workspace, celebrating our milestone year and providing clear testimony to the strength of the Snap-on brand positioned in shopped -- shops all around the world.
Another key advantage for the Tools Group is our Financial Services arm, Snap-on Credit. Strategic programs aimed at smoothing the way for those big ticket purchases. Our credit company plays an essential role in enhancing the van network, and again this quarter, it did just that. Well, that's the Tools Group, attractive new products guided by customer connection, innovative marketing and a unique credit facility, all increasing the power of the Snap-on van channel and driving sales to new levels.
Now on to RS&I. Organic sales growth of $8.7 million or 3.3%. The second quarter operating margin, 24.4%, rising 120 basis points compared to last year's 23.2%.
Margin expansion, another demonstration of RCI and Snap-on Value Creation. The organic sales gain was broad-based. The diagnostics and information businesses, selling to independent repair shop owners and managers with a mid-single-digit gain in volume, helped by new products, products like the ETHOS Tech, our newest diagnostic handheld offering, aimed -- it's aimed at individual shop technicians and first-time diagnostic buyers.
The ETHOS Tech is a full function scan tool with a quick boot-up, streamlined interface, a large color screen and full comprehensive coverage of car makes and vehicle systems, all the features that are so important even for the entry-level technician in today's environment, where vehicle diagnostics are becoming essential for everyday maintenance as well as complex repair. More technicians than ever before will be using diagnostics in almost every job, and the ETHOS Tech is a great way for them to get started.
Also in the quarter, RS&I released its latest software update for our PRO-LINK Ultra, supplying truck shops with even broader diagnostic data, covering both diesel and larger gasoline engines. The PRO-LINK Ultra is capable of diagnosing commercial vehicles from light diesel to Class A heavy-duty trucks. It delivers the widest coverage ever available on a -- at a single handheld diagnostic tool, including data for major vehicle systems. It's a great enabler for the -- it's a great enabler that, I guess quite simply, provides heavy-duty technicians with the range of diagnostics information now necessary to perform their daily tasks. And it's becoming the choice across the heavy-duty sector.
Equipment division registered a low single-digit organic sales rise, overcoming the turbulence in Eastern Europe. Some of those gains were authored by our new aligner, the V2400, launched just this period. The V2400 designed for premium OEM dealerships and for high-end wheel service shops, places that require advanced alignment techniques. It offers increased accuracy and repeatability, high-resolution cameras that produce live alignment and diagnostic data, passive lightweight front and rear targets that improve durability and advanced dimensioning that identifies frame or structural damage or mismatched tire sizes, a regular cause of vehicle pulling or driver complaints. All of those are features that aid greatly in technician productivity. We believe we have an exceptional product in this next-generation aligner, and early returns indicate that our customers are saying the same thing.
Speaking about the Equipment division. May marked the 1 year anniversary of our acquisition of the Pro-Cut on-car brake lathes. We're excited that Pro-Cut is part of the team. When we put Pro-Cut advanced brake servicing product line together with our -- with another recent add, Challenger Lifts, it gives us more to sell to the vehicle repair shop owners and managers, the customers and the independent shops, national service chains and OEM dealerships. And when package along with our other established RS&I products, Snap-on now offers a wider range of shop solutions than ever before.
So to wrap up RS&I, we see new diagnostics, unique truck repair information and a growing undercar equipment offering, driving positive trends, improving our position with repair shop owners and managers across the globe.
Well, that's the highlights of our quarter: growth and improvement; C&I strength at SNA Europe, in emerging markets and in critical industries; expanding margins. The Tools Group, growing double digits again, robust sales and operating margin, continuing to enhance our franchise network. RS&I, advancing its position, making gains in both independent shops and OEMs, growing operating margins by 120 basis points. And Financial Services, raising its contribution and helping provide strategic evidence of growth for our Tools Group. And overall, overall for the corporation, sales increasing organically by 8.4%. Opco, operating income margin of 17.7%, up 100 basis points. EPS, $2.03 in the quarter, 12.8% higher than the $1.80 last year. It was another encouraging quarter.
Now I'll turn the call over to Aldo, who will take you through the financials in detail. Aldo?"

Net sales of $851.8 million in the quarter were up 8.4% organically. On a reported basis, net sales, including $43.4 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation, increased $25.3 million or 3.1% from 2014 levels. As you know, Snap-on has significant international operations and is subject to foreign currency fluctuations. Largely due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, foreign currency movements adversely impacted our year-over-year Q2 sales comparisons by 570 basis points.
Consolidated gross profit of $419 million increased $18.6 million from 2014 levels, primarily due to benefits from higher sales, savings from RCI initiatives and lower restructuring costs, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency effects. The gross margin of 49.2% in the quarter improved 80 basis points from 48.4% a year ago.
Operating expenses of $268.2 million increased $5.9 million, largely due to higher volume related and other expenses, including higher pension expense, partially offset by favorable foreign currency translation and savings from RCI initiatives. The operating expense margin of 31.5% improved 20 basis points from 31.7% last year.
No restructuring costs were incurred in the second quarter of 2015. In the second quarter of last year, we incurred $1.4 million of such costs. Pension expense in the quarter was approximately $2 million higher as compared to the prior year, mostly reflecting the impacts of lower discount rates as well as increased life expectancies.
As a result of these factors, operating earnings before Financial Services of $150.8 million in the quarter, including $12 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased 9.2%, and as a percentage of sales, improved 100 basis points to 17.7%.
Financial Services revenue of $58.7 million in the quarter increased 13.5% from 2014 levels, while operating earnings of $41.4 million increased 19%. The increases in both revenue and operating earnings primarily reflect the continued growth of the Financial Services portfolio.
Consolidated operating earnings of $192.2 million in the quarter, including $12.6 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased 11.2%. And the operating margin of 21.1% improved 140 basis points from 19.7% a year ago.
Our second quarter effective income tax rate of 32% compared with 32.9% in the second quarter and 32.1% for the 2014 full year. Finally, net earnings of $120 million or $2.03 per diluted share increased $13.9 million or $0.23 per share, representing a 12.8% increase in diluted earnings per share.
Now let's turn to our segment results. Starting with Commercial & Industrial, our C&I Group on Slide 7. Sales of $295.8 million in the quarter were up 11.2% organically, reflecting a high single-digit gain in sales to customers in critical industries, a mid-single-digit increase in the segment's European-based hand tools business and double-digit increases in both the segment's power tools and Asia Pacific operations.
Gross profit in the C&I Group of $112.9 million in the quarter increased $1.1 million from 2014 levels, primarily due to the benefits of higher sales and savings from RCI initiatives, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency effects. The gross margin of 38.2% decreased 70 basis points, largely due to shift to lower gross margin sales, including higher sales to the military and increased sales in our Asia Pacific operations.
Operating expenses of $70.7 million in the quarter decreased $2.9 million from 2014 levels, primarily due to favorable foreign currency translation, partially offset by higher volume related and other expenses. The operating expense margin of 23.9% improved 170 basis points, mostly due to sales volume leverage including benefits from the previously mentioned sales shift.
As a result of these factors, operating earnings for the C&I segment of $42.2 million, including $2 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased $4 million from 2014 levels, and the operating margin of 14.3% improved 100 basis points.
Turning now to Slide 8. Second quarter sales of the Snap-on Tools Group of $398.7 million increased 11.2% organically, reflecting double-digit sales gains in both the company's U.S. and international franchise operations.

The second quarter operating expense margin was 27.2% in both years. As a result of these factors, operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $68 million, including $6.7 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased $7.5 million, and the operating margin of 17.1% improved 70 basis points.
Turning to the Repair Systems & Information or RS&I Group shown on Slide 9. Sales of $277.4 million in the quarter increased 3.3% organically from 2014 levels. The organic sales increase primarily reflects a mid-single-digit gain in sales of diagnostics and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers and low single-digit gains in both sales of undercar equipment and sales to OEM dealerships.
Gross profit of $129.6 million increased $2.1 million over 2014 levels, principally due to benefit of higher sales, savings from RCI initiatives and lower restructuring cost, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency effects. The gross margin of 46.7% improved 90 basis points year-over-year.
Operating expenses of $61.9 million in the quarter decreased $1 million from 2014 levels, primarily due to favorable foreign currency translation and savings from RCI initiatives, partially offset by higher volume related and other expenses. The operating expense margin of 22.3% improved 30 basis points from 2014. Second quarter operating earnings for the RS&I Group of $67.7 million, including $3.3 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased $3.1 million from prior year levels, and the operating margin of 24.4% improved 120 basis points.

The average yield on finance receivables of 17.8% in the quarter compared with 17.5% last year, and the average yield on contract receivables of 9.4% compared with 9.5% last year. Originations of $253.4 million increased 8.9% from 2014 levels.
Moving to Slide 11. As of quarter end, our balance sheet includes approximately $1.47 billion of gross financing receivables, including $1.27 billion from our U.S. Snap-on Credit operation. Approximately 80% of our U.S. financing portfolio relates to extended credit loans to technicians. During the quarter, our worldwide finance portfolio grew approximately $63 million. As for finance portfolio losses and delinquency trends, these continue to be in line with our expectations.
Now turning to Slide 12. Cash provided by operations of $160.3 million in the quarter increased $35.9 million from comparable 2014 levels, reflecting higher net earnings in 2015 and net changes in operating assets and liabilities. Net cash used by investing activities of $85.4 million included $58.1 million to fund a net increase in finance receivables. Second quarter capital expenditures of $27.7 million included $7.8 million to acquire a previously leased bandsaw manufacturing facility in the United Kingdom. Capital expenditures in the second quarter of last year were $22.7 million.
Turning to Slide 13. Days sales outstanding for trade receivables of 60 days compared with 61 days at 2014 year-end. Inventories increased $23.7 million from 2014 year-end levels, primarily to support continued higher customer demand and new product introductions.
On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 3.5 compared with 3.7 turns at 2014 year end. Our quarter end cash position of $124.6 million decreased $8.3 million from 2014 year-end levels. The net decrease includes the impact of funding $416 million of new finance receivables, the repurchase of 580,000 shares for $86.9 million, dividend payments of $61.7 million and capital expenditures of $45.8 million.
These cash decreases were largely offset by $319.3 million of cash from collections of finance receivables, $238.4 million of cash from operations, net of $25 million of discretionary cash contributions to the company's domestic pension plans and $36.5 million of cash proceeds from stock purchase and option plan exercises.
Our net debt-to-capital ratio of 25.8% compared with 26.3% at 2014 year-end. In addition to our $124.6 million of cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $700 million in available credit facilities, and our current short-term credit ratings allow us to access the commercial paper markets. At quarter end, we had $35 million of commercial paper borrowings outstanding.
This concludes my remarks on our second quarter performance. Now I'll turn the call over to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick?"

Once again, we believe the period stands as a clear testimony to the opportunities abundant along our runways for growth and for improvement. And it confirms our team's capability to keep taking full advantage despite the challenges like unfavorable currency, turbulent economies and varying industry dynamics.
We are progressing along our runways for growth. C&I organic sales rising 11.2%. OI margin 14.3%, up 100 basis points. Extended to critical industries, gains in aviation and the military, building in emerging markets. The Tools Group, enhancing the van channel, wielding the network more powerfully than ever.

I mean, first of all, it's one quarter. That's one thing. And that can be moved up and down. But the diagnostics and information business, the sale of diagnostics on our information products into independent repair shops, which is the space we're talking about, was up fairly strongly in the quarter. I think we said high single digits, so -- or mid-single digits. So that was a little bit better than RS&I. And then the second thing is I would offer that I was just on these Rock ‘N Roll -- I was on one of these Techno-Vans recently, and the van driver told me, he said we're not associated, we're not worried about competition. Our biggest competition is the difficulty in getting to a technician and explaining to him the product, getting him to appreciate the value of our business. He didn't cite any competitors at all. In fact, I never see -- I was just with 1200 customers over the weekend, and not -- 10 days ago, and they were talking about this product. And basically, they talked about the idea that it was better than anything else we had brought out. Secondly -- I mean, thirdly, I would suppose that when you -- when we survey independent technicians and we ask them what's your preferred form of diagnostic, it's still overwhelmingly Snap-on. I think the numbers -- the latest numbers we have are 60 for Snap-on, 11 for #2. So you see all those. Now if you come back to RS&I, I suppose your question was, well, RS&I, I personally -- we were encouraged by the RS&I growth because of the Equipment business, which tends to get dinged because of Eastern Europe. So ironically, Equipment business was -- grew, I think Aldo said, low single digits. So it's somewhat of a drag from a volume point of view. But from a margin point of view, because in my remarks, I talked about that new aligner, the V2400. Hey, that's a great product, and it's selling very well, and it's a great margin generator for us. So what you saw from the Equipment business actually was a little bit of drag on diagnostics -- on RS&I revenues, but a boost on RS&I margins because of the aligner business if it helps you understand RS&I a little bit more. But we don't  see -- actually we don't see, at least in my interactions from the market, so logically or at least in talking to them, we don't see much pressure. And then empirically, we don't see it in the numbers as pressure either."

The more -- the higher-level ones that a shop would buy and might have 1 or 2 of them in the shop. We still have a lot of runway in that area. So -- and it's a very important product line for us. And in fact, we feel pretty positive about the possibilities and the opportunity for that opportunity. But what you say is very true. We now know that more and more of the repair activities in a shop are going to require diagnostics. I think I said possibly on the last call that roughly 40% of repairs require diagnostics today, and the new cars, 80% of the repairs. So you can see how that's going to go as new cars roll into the marketplace. And so maintenance techs as opposed to repair techs, guys who do oil changes and battery changes and just tune up the cars are going to have to use diagnostics to do these kinds of things to reset some of the parameters that they start with, that they change when they make these changes. And so we'll be looking to sell diagnostics for those things, thus the purpose of the ETHOS Tech. So you would expect that, that would add a boost to that. But I would still say, let's not talk the 4% to 6%. I would still say that if you look at the long-term sort of over-the-horizon opportunities for our businesses, I would rank C&I with the critical industries and the emerging markets as the highest growth opportunity. It's got unbounded opportunity. You look at, I would say, this particular one, sits in the middle. And then the Tools Group, we've been able to wield that model better and better, reach more technicians. But at the end of the day, it is bounded. So I put them in those pieces. Now maybe you might cheat up between the 4% to 6%, the number, but I -- for our overall business, but I still see RS&I in that middle, in middle."

We said it would be at the -- we can grow at that level, roughly double GDP, without necessarily coming up with things that would make our models more powerful. We could capture more customers. We could add more -- no accelerators. Now you see what happened in the Tools Group. We got accelerators on top of that, breaking through the barriers of space and time. I was just on a Techno -- I just said, I was on a Techno-Van, we talked about that. And we always thought about that, well, it saves time. And what it does is both the Rock ‘N Roll cab and the Techno-Van save time for the franchisee, because when he -- when the franchisee rides in parallel with these vans a couple of times a year, it's like a training seminar, because the guy who is running the van, is an incredible salesman. And it saves our franchisee from going to training center -- seminar to learn how to sell tool storage or to learn how to sell diagnostics. And that's one of the reasons why the sales are up. We not only added to the retail space, but we also boosted the capabilities of our franchisees. That's why same-store sales have been up greater than 6%, 20 of the last 21 quarters. That's the kind of effect. So I think if we keep discovering ways to do that, we'll beat that 4% to 6%."

We saw some flatness in things like mining, stuff like that. But generally, that's the lens. Military was up double digits.

Middle East, if you want to call that an emerging market, that was kind of weak. South America was okay. Chile was up. Argentina was up. So you kind of got a balance there, a cocktail of things. So let me just summarize. Asia Pacific, double digits. I think South America, the South -- the Latin American countries, the bigger ones for us were up more -- kind of double-digit E-type stuff. Eastern Europe, tough, down and Middle East down. So that's where we are.

Our second quarter results were encouraging. We believe they once again offer strong evidence of clear Snap-on advancements along our runways for both growth and for improvement. Organic sales were up 8.4% from last year. The operating margin expanded by 100 basis points. And earnings per share, they reached $2.03, up 12.8% compared with the $1.80 we reported last year.
Our reported sales increase was 3.1%. That total includes the continuing weight of unfavorable foreign currency translation this quarter, an impact of $43.4 million. Including the incremental $2.8 million from last year's Pro-Cut acquisition, our total reported sales for the period were $851.8 million.
The opco operating margin reached 17.7%, up from 16.7% in 2014, and as I said, representing 100 basis point increase, more than offsetting the 40 basis point impact on profit from unfavorable currency. Financial Services operating income grew to $41.4 million from last year's $34.8 million, driving our consolidating operating margin, Financial Services plus opco, to 21.1%, higher by 140 basis points.
It was an encouraging quarter. From an overall macro perspective, we believe the conditions remain favorable for our businesses serving automotive repair customers, the businesses like the Tools Group and the Repair Systems & Information or RS&I Group.
In the second quarter, the Tools Group organic activity increased 11.2%. The tailwinds of changing vehicle technology and the aging of the fleet continue to provide opportunity. And the rising strength of our van network and our robust continuing line of new products, they enable Snap-on to take greater advantage of those tailwinds, and clear -- and it's clearly evidenced in the numbers.
In RS&I, net organic gains of 3.3%, led by higher sales of diagnostics and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers, increased sales to OEM dealerships and higher sales of our car equipment, all serving to offset the particular challenges in Russia, Eastern Europe and the Middle East, where that group had made particular progress in prior periods.
For the Commercial & Industrial Group or C&I, there are also continued signs of advancement. Organic sales up 11.2% in the quarter. And for C&I, along our runways for growth, we saw important and clear headway, headway in our efforts to extend in the critical industries, in our European business and in several emerging markets. That progress was won against pockets of turbulence in geographies like Europe, where the uncertainty of Greece looms; in places like Japan, where recovery is sporadic; and in the U.S. military. U.S. military, it's been a somewhat unpredictable sector. Well, in the second quarter, U.S. military activity experienced for Snap-on another strong period, up double digits from last year.
However, we do remain cautious on the military business. There -- this is a period of uncertainty. Changing deployments and budget pressure make it difficult to predict the future trajectory of that business with any confidence. But having said that, we believe we're well positioned in the military sector to make the most of any available opportunities, any available openings.
Overall, the C&I results are quite positive, the opportunity is definitely outweighing the challenges, and the results, they confirm it.
More broadly, for the whole operation for all of Snap-on, the operating income gains across the corporation clearly demonstrate the leverage and the power of Snap-on -- of the Snap-on Value Creation Processes. Safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and rapid continuous improvement, they all drive our improvement every day, and they helped to offer our 100 basis point gain in the quarter, overcoming the significant challenges.
Now let's highlight some of the advancements in growth and in improvements demonstrated by the individual groups. Let's start with C&I.
As I just said, an 11.2% organic sales gain, and that follows a 9.8% organic sales gain in the first quarter. C&I's operating income margin was 14.3%, up 100 basis points. Both the higher volume and the benefits of Snap-on Value Creation drove that rise. And there was some very positive volume gains.
SNA Europe registered its seventh straight quarter of year-over-year growth, a promising trend, outperforming the storm clouds that occupied the headlines of Europe. The industrial division saw particularly strong activity in the aviation sector, a key area of our focus in extending the critical industries.
Some of those aerospace gains can be attributed to our growing line of innovative new products specifically aimed at that industry, products like our new array of aircraft tire gauges and inflators. When it comes to aircraft tires and struts, proper measurement and inflation are key for safe takeoffs and landing as well as for braking predictability and effectiveness.
We talk about critical industry, those sound kind of critical for people who travel. Raising the bar in that arena, our new line of 300 psi analog and digital tire gauges offer improved accuracy. Our approval for hazardous environments and incorporate a reflective glow dialer backlit display, it makes -- they make the technicians work more effective, safer and easier, meeting all type of challenges in all types of conditions.
Also in the quarter aimed right at aviation, we introduced the new Snap-on Electrostatic Discharge-Safe Precision Pliers. They're designed for use on static-sensitive components and circuitry, with a specifically designed handle to dissipate electricity, improves squeezing torque control and a low-profile design for greater accessibility than the standard pliers, all features that are valued by professionals performing those critical aviation tasks.
The 300 psi tire gauges, the static discharge safe pliers, innovative new products adding to our growing aerospace offering and clearly demonstrating our efforts to roll the Snap-on brand out of the garage to extend to critical industries like aviation. And the second quarter results, they confirm that it's working.
Now let's speak about SNA Europe, our European hand tools -- our European-based hand tool business. SNA Europe, broad organic growth and gains in the period up mid-single digits, growth in Spain, the United Kingdom and the Nordic region. And beside that volume rise, SNA Europe continued its trajectory of operating margin improvement, leveraging the additional sales, but also realizing the benefits of RCI and Snap-on Value Creation against the backdrop of substantial euroland turbulence. SNA Europe, sales up for the seventh straight quarter, but once again, profits up more.
And we're also continuing to build in emerging markets. Asia Pacific was another contributor to C&I growth, activity up in relatively uneven markets like Korea and Indonesia. C&I did have an encouraging quarter, but we know there's still more opportunity, opportunity to continue building on the momentum generated by our European operations to strengthen our position in -- within emerging markets and to proceed forward down our runways of critical industries, extending to even more customers.
Now let's move to the Tools Group. Sales were up 11.2% organically with double-digit gains in the U.S. and internationally. Operating margin of 17.1%, up 70 basis points versus the 16.4% recorded last year, and overcoming within the quarter, 120 basis points of unfavorable currency impact. That 70 basis point improvement brings our Tools Group OI margin to new levels. And that margin performance clearly speaks to our improving position, and when combined with the growth this quarter, demonstrates the success we're having on this decisive runway, enhancing the franchise network. You can see it in the sales, and you can see it in the overall franchise health metrics, trending positively again this quarter.
Snap-on franchisees are a committed and capable group. And you're convinced of that every time you meet one of them. And we're working hard every day to support their effort through creative marketing, access to in-house customer financing with Snap-on Credit and a growing array of innovative new products, products like our new ratcheting combination wrenches with an innovative design, higher strength and enhanced durability. Our new ratcheting gear design safely delivers 25% more torque and 95% longer fatigue life. Innovative Snap-on technology, enabling the transfer of more power in a thinner, smaller diameter wrench head, helping to access and remove the most stubborn of fasteners in tight, tight spaces.
The Dual 80 design with an 80-tooth ratcheting gear and dual pawls minimizes the swing arc that's needed to move fasteners, a great enabler, a great enabler in the engine compartments of today's vehicles. And of course, that new -- the new wrench features our unique Flank Drive wrenching system that consistently minimizes fastener damage. Snap-on's new line of combination wrenches raises the bar for professionals in performing critical and difficult tasks. It's a winning tool line on an existing product platform, a direct result of Snap-on Value Creation, shaped by customer connection, direct observations in the shop and delivered by the Snap-on innovation process. It's already generating excitement in the repair shops all over this country, and there's more to come.
Now the growing strength of our van network, our rolling selling space to the van network is evident with the increases in big ticket sales. And a considerable boost comes from our hands-on demonstration vehicles like the Rock ‘N Roll Cab Express vans, 66 of them, bringing a much wider range of our tool storage lineups directly to the shop, more colors, more shapes, more options and more choices displayed across our customer base. And if you've been listening to these calls for any time, you've heard the story of this innovative marketing initiative, the Rock ‘N Roll van, expanding our van selling space. And they continue to be a significant contributor to the Tools Group.
In the quarter, big ticket sales were up strong double digits, and our demonstration vans were a big driver. But those vans weren't the only factor. Big ticket gains were also propelled by new tool storage products, winning offerings like our special edition 95th anniversary box, another in a long line of our customized tool storage systems. We mentioned them, I think, on the last quarter's call, and they've been popular. Technicians upgrading their workspace, celebrating our milestone year and providing clear testimony to the strength of the Snap-on brand positioned in shopped -- shops all around the world.
Another key advantage for the Tools Group is our Financial Services arm, Snap-on Credit. Strategic programs aimed at smoothing the way for those big ticket purchases. Our credit company plays an essential role in enhancing the van network, and again this quarter, it did just that. Well, that's the Tools Group, attractive new products guided by customer connection, innovative marketing and a unique credit facility, all increasing the power of the Snap-on van channel and driving sales to new levels.
Now on to RS&I. Organic sales growth of $8.7 million or 3.3%. The second quarter operating margin, 24.4%, rising 120 basis points compared to last year's 23.2%.
Margin expansion, another demonstration of RCI and Snap-on Value Creation. The organic sales gain was broad-based. The diagnostics and information businesses, selling to independent repair shop owners and managers with a mid-single-digit gain in volume, helped by new products, products like the ETHOS Tech, our newest diagnostic handheld offering, aimed -- it's aimed at individual shop technicians and first-time diagnostic buyers.
The ETHOS Tech is a full function scan tool with a quick boot-up, streamlined interface, a large color screen and full comprehensive coverage of car makes and vehicle systems, all the features that are so important even for the entry-level technician in today's environment, where vehicle diagnostics are becoming essential for everyday maintenance as well as complex repair. More technicians than ever before will be using diagnostics in almost every job, and the ETHOS Tech is a great way for them to get started.
Also in the quarter, RS&I released its latest software update for our PRO-LINK Ultra, supplying truck shops with even broader diagnostic data, covering both diesel and larger gasoline engines. The PRO-LINK Ultra is capable of diagnosing commercial vehicles from light diesel to Class A heavy-duty trucks. It delivers the widest coverage ever available on a -- at a single handheld diagnostic tool, including data for major vehicle systems. It's a great enabler for the -- it's a great enabler that, I guess quite simply, provides heavy-duty technicians with the range of diagnostics information now necessary to perform their daily tasks. And it's becoming the choice across the heavy-duty sector.
Equipment division registered a low single-digit organic sales rise, overcoming the turbulence in Eastern Europe. Some of those gains were authored by our new aligner, the V2400, launched just this period. The V2400 designed for premium OEM dealerships and for high-end wheel service shops, places that require advanced alignment techniques. It offers increased accuracy and repeatability, high-resolution cameras that produce live alignment and diagnostic data, passive lightweight front and rear targets that improve durability and advanced dimensioning that identifies frame or structural damage or mismatched tire sizes, a regular cause of vehicle pulling or driver complaints. All of those are features that aid greatly in technician productivity. We believe we have an exceptional product in this next-generation aligner, and early returns indicate that our customers are saying the same thing.
Speaking about the Equipment division. May marked the 1 year anniversary of our acquisition of the Pro-Cut on-car brake lathes. We're excited that Pro-Cut is part of the team. When we put Pro-Cut advanced brake servicing product line together with our -- with another recent add, Challenger Lifts, it gives us more to sell to the vehicle repair shop owners and managers, the customers and the independent shops, national service chains and OEM dealerships. And when package along with our other established RS&I products, Snap-on now offers a wider range of shop solutions than ever before.
So to wrap up RS&I, we see new diagnostics, unique truck repair information and a growing undercar equipment offering, driving positive trends, improving our position with repair shop owners and managers across the globe.
Well, that's the highlights of our quarter: growth and improvement; C&I strength at SNA Europe, in emerging markets and in critical industries; expanding margins. The Tools Group, growing double digits again, robust sales and operating margin, continuing to enhance our franchise network. RS&I, advancing its position, making gains in both independent shops and OEMs, growing operating margins by 120 basis points. And Financial Services, raising its contribution and helping provide strategic evidence of growth for our Tools Group. And overall, overall for the corporation, sales increasing organically by 8.4%. Opco, operating income margin of 17.7%, up 100 basis points. EPS, $2.03 in the quarter, 12.8% higher than the $1.80 last year. It was another encouraging quarter.
Now I'll turn the call over to Aldo, who will take you through the financials in detail. Aldo?"

Net sales of $851.8 million in the quarter were up 8.4% organically. On a reported basis, net sales, including $43.4 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation, increased $25.3 million or 3.1% from 2014 levels. As you know, Snap-on has significant international operations and is subject to foreign currency fluctuations. Largely due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, foreign currency movements adversely impacted our year-over-year Q2 sales comparisons by 570 basis points.
Consolidated gross profit of $419 million increased $18.6 million from 2014 levels, primarily due to benefits from higher sales, savings from RCI initiatives and lower restructuring costs, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency effects. The gross margin of 49.2% in the quarter improved 80 basis points from 48.4% a year ago.
Operating expenses of $268.2 million increased $5.9 million, largely due to higher volume related and other expenses, including higher pension expense, partially offset by favorable foreign currency translation and savings from RCI initiatives. The operating expense margin of 31.5% improved 20 basis points from 31.7% last year.
No restructuring costs were incurred in the second quarter of 2015. In the second quarter of last year, we incurred $1.4 million of such costs. Pension expense in the quarter was approximately $2 million higher as compared to the prior year, mostly reflecting the impacts of lower discount rates as well as increased life expectancies.
As a result of these factors, operating earnings before Financial Services of $150.8 million in the quarter, including $12 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased 9.2%, and as a percentage of sales, improved 100 basis points to 17.7%.
Financial Services revenue of $58.7 million in the quarter increased 13.5% from 2014 levels, while operating earnings of $41.4 million increased 19%. The increases in both revenue and operating earnings primarily reflect the continued growth of the Financial Services portfolio.
Consolidated operating earnings of $192.2 million in the quarter, including $12.6 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased 11.2%. And the operating margin of 21.1% improved 140 basis points from 19.7% a year ago.
Our second quarter effective income tax rate of 32% compared with 32.9% in the second quarter and 32.1% for the 2014 full year. Finally, net earnings of $120 million or $2.03 per diluted share increased $13.9 million or $0.23 per share, representing a 12.8% increase in diluted earnings per share.
Now let's turn to our segment results. Starting with Commercial & Industrial, our C&I Group on Slide 7. Sales of $295.8 million in the quarter were up 11.2% organically, reflecting a high single-digit gain in sales to customers in critical industries, a mid-single-digit increase in the segment's European-based hand tools business and double-digit increases in both the segment's power tools and Asia Pacific operations.
Gross profit in the C&I Group of $112.9 million in the quarter increased $1.1 million from 2014 levels, primarily due to the benefits of higher sales and savings from RCI initiatives, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency effects. The gross margin of 38.2% decreased 70 basis points, largely due to shift to lower gross margin sales, including higher sales to the military and increased sales in our Asia Pacific operations.
Operating expenses of $70.7 million in the quarter decreased $2.9 million from 2014 levels, primarily due to favorable foreign currency translation, partially offset by higher volume related and other expenses. The operating expense margin of 23.9% improved 170 basis points, mostly due to sales volume leverage including benefits from the previously mentioned sales shift.
As a result of these factors, operating earnings for the C&I segment of $42.2 million, including $2 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased $4 million from 2014 levels, and the operating margin of 14.3% improved 100 basis points.
Turning now to Slide 8. Second quarter sales of the Snap-on Tools Group of $398.7 million increased 11.2% organically, reflecting double-digit sales gains in both the company's U.S. and international franchise operations. Gross profit of $176.5 million increased $15.4 million from 2014 levels. And the gross margin of 44.3% in the quarter improved 70 basis points, primarily due to benefits from higher sales and savings from RCI initiatives, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency effects.
Operating expenses of $108.5 million increased $7.9 million from 2014 levels, principally due to higher volume related and other expenses, partially offset by favorable foreign currency translation. The second quarter operating expense margin was 27.2% in both years. As a result of these factors, operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $68 million, including $6.7 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased $7.5 million, and the operating margin of 17.1% improved 70 basis points.
Turning to the Repair Systems & Information or RS&I Group shown on Slide 9. Sales of $277.4 million in the quarter increased 3.3% organically from 2014 levels. The organic sales increase primarily reflects a mid-single-digit gain in sales of diagnostics and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers and low single-digit gains in both sales of undercar equipment and sales to OEM dealerships.
Gross profit of $129.6 million increased $2.1 million over 2014 levels, principally due to benefit of higher sales, savings from RCI initiatives and lower restructuring cost, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency effects. The gross margin of 46.7% improved 90 basis points year-over-year.
Operating expenses of $61.9 million in the quarter decreased $1 million from 2014 levels, primarily due to favorable foreign currency translation and savings from RCI initiatives, partially offset by higher volume related and other expenses. The operating expense margin of 22.3% improved 30 basis points from 2014. Second quarter operating earnings for the RS&I Group of $67.7 million, including $3.3 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased $3.1 million from prior year levels, and the operating margin of 24.4% improved 120 basis points.
Now turning to Slide 10. In the second quarter, operating earnings from Financial Services of $41.4 million on revenue of $58.7 million compared with operating earnings of $34.8 million on revenue of $51.7 million last year. The average yield on finance receivables of 17.8% in the quarter compared with 17.5% last year, and the average yield on contract receivables of 9.4% compared with 9.5% last year. Originations of $253.4 million increased 8.9% from 2014 levels.
Moving to Slide 11. As of quarter end, our balance sheet includes approximately $1.47 billion of gross financing receivables, including $1.27 billion from our U.S. Snap-on Credit operation. Approximately 80% of our U.S. financing portfolio relates to extended credit loans to technicians. During the quarter, our worldwide finance portfolio grew approximately $63 million. As for finance portfolio losses and delinquency trends, these continue to be in line with our expectations.
Now turning to Slide 12. Cash provided by operations of $160.3 million in the quarter increased $35.9 million from comparable 2014 levels, reflecting higher net earnings in 2015 and net changes in operating assets and liabilities. Net cash used by investing activities of $85.4 million included $58.1 million to fund a net increase in finance receivables. Second quarter capital expenditures of $27.7 million included $7.8 million to acquire a previously leased bandsaw manufacturing facility in the United Kingdom. Capital expenditures in the second quarter of last year were $22.7 million.
Turning to Slide 13. Days sales outstanding for trade receivables of 60 days compared with 61 days at 2014 year-end. Inventories increased $23.7 million from 2014 year-end levels, primarily to support continued higher customer demand and new product introductions.
On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 3.5 compared with 3.7 turns at 2014 year end. Our quarter end cash position of $124.6 million decreased $8.3 million from 2014 year-end levels. The net decrease includes the impact of funding $416 million of new finance receivables, the repurchase of 580,000 shares for $86.9 million, dividend payments of $61.7 million and capital expenditures of $45.8 million.
These cash decreases were largely offset by $319.3 million of cash from collections of finance receivables, $238.4 million of cash from operations, net of $25 million of discretionary cash contributions to the company's domestic pension plans and $36.5 million of cash proceeds from stock purchase and option plan exercises.
Our net debt-to-capital ratio of 25.8% compared with 26.3% at 2014 year-end. In addition to our $124.6 million of cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $700 million in available credit facilities, and our current short-term credit ratings allow us to access the commercial paper markets. At quarter end, we had $35 million of commercial paper borrowings outstanding.
This concludes my remarks on our second quarter performance. Now I'll turn the call over to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick?"

Once again, we believe the period stands as a clear testimony to the opportunities abundant along our runways for growth and for improvement. And it confirms our team's capability to keep taking full advantage despite the challenges like unfavorable currency, turbulent economies and varying industry dynamics.
We are progressing along our runways for growth. C&I organic sales rising 11.2%. OI margin 14.3%, up 100 basis points. Extended to critical industries, gains in aviation and the military, building in emerging markets. The Tools Group, enhancing the van channel, wielding the network more powerfully than ever. Organic sales up 11.2%; OI margin 17.1%, a 70 basis point increase.
In RS&I, organic sales up 3.3%. OI margin 24.4%, an increase of 120 basis points. And the overall corporation growing organically at 8.4%, overcoming the headwind.
And we demonstrated progress down our runways for improvement. The corporate OI margin was 17.7%, up 100 basis points, more than offsetting 40 basis points of unfavorable currency impact. Putting it all together with Financial Services contributions, earnings per share reached $2.03, up 12.8% against the wind. 
Second quarter was encouraging, and we believe it demonstrates again that Snap-on has the inherent advantages, the opportunities and the capabilities to advance, to resist the turbulence, to keep progressing and to extend our positive trends of performance as we go forward.
Before I turn the call over to the operator for questions, I'll speak a moment to our franchisees and associates. As always, I know many of you are listening. Please know that the encouraging results of the second quarter would not have been possible without your dedication and capability, for your demonstrated skills, clear commitment and extraordinary contribution to our team. You have my congratulations, and you have my thanks.

I think they're -- what were they, 8.9% this quarter in originations and 11.2%. But last quarter, they were reversed. It was 14.2% versus 12.9%. And the quarter before that, it was -- in other words, 14.2% was the originations and 12.9% was the Tools Group. And 17.5% was the originations in the fourth quarter and 11.8% was the Tools Group.

I mean, first of all, it's one quarter. That's one thing. And that can be moved up and down. But the diagnostics and information business, the sale of diagnostics on our information products into independent repair shops, which is the space we're talking about, was up fairly strongly in the quarter. I think we said high single digits, so -- or mid-single digits. So that was a little bit better than RS&I. And then the second thing is I would offer that I was just on these Rock ‘N Roll -- I was on one of these Techno-Vans recently, and the van driver told me, he said we're not associated, we're not worried about competition. Our biggest competition is the difficulty in getting to a technician and explaining to him the product, getting him to appreciate the value of our business. He didn't cite any competitors at all. In fact, I never see -- I was just with 1,200 customers over the weekend, and not -- 10 days ago, and they were talking about this product. And basically, they talked about the idea that it was better than anything else we had brought out. Secondly -- I mean, thirdly, I would suppose that when you -- when we survey independent technicians and we ask them what's your preferred form of diagnostic, it's still overwhelmingly Snap-on. I think the numbers -- the latest numbers we have are 60 for Snap-on, 11 for #2. So you see all those. Now if you come back to RS&I, I suppose your question was, well, RS&I, I personally -- we were encouraged by the RS&I growth because of the Equipment business, which tends to get dinged because of Eastern Europe. So ironically, Equipment business was -- grew, I think Aldo said, low single digits. So it's somewhat of a drag from a volume point of view. But from a margin point of view, because in my remarks, I talked about that new aligner, the V2400. Hey, that's a great product, and it's selling very well, and it's a great margin generator for us. So what you saw from the Equipment business actually was a little bit of drag on diagnostics -- on RS&I revenues, but a boost on RS&I margins because of the aligner business if it helps you understand RS&I a little bit more. But we don't see -- actually we don't see, at least in my interactions from the market, so logically or at least in talking to them, we don't see much pressure. And then empirically, we don't see it in the numbers as pressure either."

And in fact, we feel pretty positive about the possibilities and the opportunity for that opportunity. But what you say is very true. We now know that more and more of the repair activities in a shop are going to require diagnostics. I think I said possibly on the last call that roughly 40% of repairs require diagnostics today, and the new cars, 80% of the repairs. So you can see how that's going to go as new cars roll into the marketplace. And so maintenance techs as opposed to repair techs, guys who do oil changes and battery changes and just tune up the cars are going to have to use diagnostics to do these kinds of things to reset some of the parameters that they start with, that they change when they make these changes. And so we'll be looking to sell diagnostics for those things, thus the purpose of the ETHOS Tech. So you would expect that, that would add a boost to that. But I would still say, let's not talk the 4% to 6%. I would still say that if you look at the long-term sort of over-the-horizon opportunities for our businesses, I would rank C&I with the critical industries and the emerging markets as the highest growth opportunity. It's got unbounded opportunity. You look at, I would say, this particular one, sits in the middle. And then the Tools Group, we've been able to wield that model better and better, reach more technicians. But at the end of the day, it is bounded. So I put them in those pieces.

We could add more -- no accelerators. Now you see what happened in the Tools Group. We got accelerators on top of that, breaking through the barriers of space and time. I was just on a Techno -- I just said, I was on a Techno-Van, we talked about that. And we always thought about that, well, it saves time. And what it does is both the Rock ‘N Roll cab and the Techno-Van save time for the franchisee, because when he -- when the franchisee rides in parallel with these vans a couple of times a year, it's like a training seminar, because the guy who is running the van, is an incredible salesman. And it saves our franchisee from going to training center -- seminar to learn how to sell tool storage or to learn how to sell diagnostics. And that's one of the reasons why the sales are up. We not only added to the retail space, but we also boosted the capabilities of our franchisees. That's why same-store sales have been up greater than 6%, 20 of the last 21 quarters. That's the kind of effect. So I think if we keep discovering ways to do that, we'll beat that 4% to 6%."

And one principal component of that was the geography of certain big players, and Asia Pacific is one of them, lower gross margin, lower SG&A, but OI margin kind of on track for what we like to do if you adjust for that forward investment. So we feel okay about that. I think we continue to be confident in that regard."

Well, if you offer it to them at a couple of hundred dollars, they're even more enthusiastic. So part of what we're seeing there is this kind of push. We put the -- our 0.5-inch pneumatic impact, which is a popular product, but we garbed it in the 95th anniversary, or the cordless ratchet or our air hammers, things like that, or our cordless impact. And those have become popular. I don't think it's a special demand thing. I think power tools are kind of--people--they wear out, people buy them periodically, and it's like a new car. You show up with a new color and especially 95th anniversary colors for Snap-on is a collector item and a particularly compelling color. And so they like that. That's what's driving this."

This quarter, we happened to have a good -- we had good progress in aviation, heavy duty. The heavy-duty sector was strong for us. Railroads were strong. Oil and gas was weak. I think -- but actually, I'm not so sure it has -- last time, it was up against the wind. And I think for us, we're just starting to penetrate these areas. So they're not so driven by the economics as they are -- when you're just starting to penetrate, you can get quite a variation from quarter-to-quarter. And that's the kind of thing we saw. We saw some flatness in things like mining, stuff like that. But generally, that's the lens. Military was up double digits. We kind of expect C&I to keep -- the idea of extending to critical industries to keep going, to keep moving. Now I don't say it happens every quarter. I mean, this is a great example. I mean, I say every third -- every second quarter that we feel very good from a C&I -- we feel very good right now about our Commercial & Industrial trajectory. We feel very good about our tools trajectory. We feel very good about our software and diagnostics trajectory. But that's the trajectory, and without giving -- I'm not warning anything or saying anything about -- the third quarter is always squirrely. I mean, we have vacations in the third quarter and so on. So you can't tell what sectors will be going in and out, because we have our franchisees going on vacation sometimes, usually in the third quarter, Europe is on vacation. So it's hard for me to predict it for every quarter. But I can tell you we feel very encouraged by the trajectory. And I'm not in any way trying to say that we're going to have a tepid third quarter or anything like that."

This management team has been in -- they're learning how to wield this capable, tremendous model even better, things like the Rock ‘N Roll cab, the Techno Express, learning what products, learning the power of garbing the power tools into the 95th anniversary, figuring out how to do that. That's the things that are occurring. And that when you marry it up with RCI, that allows you to do these things more effectively, allows you to drive profitability upwards as well as volume. One other thing is that -- I think I've said this is, is that one of the things that works for us, kind of a tailwind in a way, is that we're a company that has complex product offerings, 65,000 SKUs. And we keep turning out more, because we try to solve everybody's, we try to solve a wide array of problems. Well, the idea of modern technology, 3D printing, finite element analysis, x-ray diffractometers that allows you to look more accurately at the metallurgy, the kinds of things we get out of more accurately getting information out of customer connection into the -- into our innovation process, those kind of things accrue with amplified advantage to somebody who has a complex product line.

In the third quarter, we again showed progress along our runways for growth and for improvement, and we saw those gains across our operating segment. Organic sales were up 7.3% from last year. Opco operating margin, it reached 17.5%, up 130 basis points. When you add the $43.5 million in operating earnings from Financial Services, up from $37.7 million in 2014, the consolidated operating margin was 21.2%, an increase of 160 basis points. And EPS, EPS was $1.98, up $0.22 or 12.5% from the $1.76 last year. Our reported sales increase was 1.9% including the impact of unfavorable foreign currency. And in this quarter, that total was $42.6 million, about the same as the second quarter.
Adding the incremental $2.1 million sales from our third quarter acquisition of, the total reported sales for the period were $821.5 million.
For automotive repair businesses, the environment continues to be favorable. Actually, it's been that way for a while. And our Tools Group and Repair Systems & Information, our RS&I group, are both well positioned to take full advantage. You can see it in the performance. Another quarter of solid gains for both groups, advancing along our runways for growth. 
Clearly, the Tools Group demonstrated enhancements to the franchise network. Gains in all its markets, continuing to take advantage of the opportunities that are so abundant in a changing vehicle fleet not only in the United States, but in places like the U.K. and Australia.
And RS&I, with strong sales across North America and parts of Europe, double-digit growth in the U.S. and modest gains in Western Europe, offsetting the continuing softness in Eastern Europe and particularly in Russia.
RS&I progress, achieved with independent repair shop owners and managers and with OEM dealerships, advanced by our latest diagnostics and undercar product offerings.
For the Commercial & Industrial or C&I group, we overcame some increased headwinds, with the overall organic sales rise offsetting mixed environments across industries and across geographies.
That said, in the third quarter, our European-based hand tool businesses and our Asia Pacific operations recorded high single-digit gains, overcoming the turbulence within their particular markets.
Now our industrial division did have some headwinds in the period impacted by weak U.S. Military volume and slowdowns in our oil and gas activity.
We consistently mentioned that uncertainty associated with the military. In the third quarter, that caution materialized, and our results included a double-digit decrease, measured spending and budget constraints making the present tight and the future even more difficult to predict.
Within our natural resources segment, volume in oil and gas was down substantially. You see it in oil prices and you read about it in newspapers and despite our small share and opportunities for penetration, we were impacted. But that said, saying that, will always be headwinds. They've been a factor in other quarters and they were present in the third quarter and we overcame because we are well-positioned to confront the challenges and proceed down all our runways for growth, enhancing the franchise network, expanding our repairs and managers, extending the critical industries and building in emerging markets. These do represent avenues for advancement, and there has been consistent progress along each of those paths.
At the same time, those growth drivers are joined and supported by the benefits of Snap-on Value Creation, safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and rapid continuous improvement or RCI. These are the processes, the tools we use each and every day to drive improvements, but this quarter we especially benefited from customer connection and innovation.
Customer connection, snap-on's continuing pursuit of understanding of work derived from the hours and the days we spend with professionals.
Innovation, taking that practical insight and matching it with the possibilities of modern technology. And in the quarter, those processes resulted in more prestigious product awards for the Corporation. We are again honored with 2 MOTOR Magazine top 20 tool awards. The winners this time our 3 age steering rack socket and our diagnostic handheld. 
Let's talk about the steering rack socket. The S6229 was developed from a customer connection drive from direct observation award and from conversations with multiple technicians. This innovative tool allows the tech to replace power steering old rings without removing the whole steering assembly, saving up to an hour of labor, clearly making work easier and professional repair more productive.
In addition, also created deep inside in the repair process, the innovative sol's edge, coverage for hundreds of vehicle systems, including hybrid TPMS, steering and clean diesel. And it all comes loaded with our fast-track troubleshooter database with its vehicle specific tips, tests and timesavers. The Solis edged enhance coverage is enhanced coverage for over 40 car makes without the cost or complexity of factories canned tools. And for all its power, for all its strength, it's easy to use. The large 8 inch touchscreen displays 8 visibility and the software provides accurate results in as little as 30 seconds. Quick. 
I've mentioned these awards because they're just the most recent recognition. But a growing list of very popular products that provide unique advantages, created by the observations of our franchisees and direct sales people who are committed to translating that insight into productivity innovation. And that broad value creation is reflected in the positive results registered across all our operating groups again this quarter.
Now let's focus on those individual groups. Starting with Commercial & Industrial. Organic sales were up 3.4%. Operating margins reached 14.3%, up 60 basis points from last year's 13.7%. Growth along with the benefits of Snap-on Value Creation. Now I said, as we said, there are headwinds. But our industrial direct sales have been expanding their reach nevertheless and to sectors like railroad, up double digits, growing our presence, offering a wider variety of tools and tool control solutions. We spoken in the past about building our understanding working critical industry, expanding our customer connection. But one way that's happening is by using our experience in RCI, participating in customer lien events, participating in the customer sponsored green events. Our team was able to assist in improving railroad operations while at the same time gaining a better understanding of the work processes, their product requirements, their businesses needs and the overall industry direction, all key customer connections gained through lean event participation.
One of the tools conceived from those insights was our special extendable line of 2 wrenches, great for heavy duty work on railroad cars and tracks. Made in our Elizabethton, Tennessee plant, these 2 wrenches replace the traditional slugging wrenches in railroad application, allowing the operator better access, eliminating the need for costly 2 persons slugging procedures and making work easier, safer and more productive.
Let's speak about SNA Europe. Now 8 quarters in a row of year-over-year growth, navigating through some of the most difficult geographies and tepid economies. SNA Europe activities continues to be encouraged, activities continue to be encouraging. But its profits, it's profits, are even more positive, now up significantly for 10 straight quarters. And we believe there is much more room for further gain.
And related to our Asia Pacific operations, the environments are mix, but we had overall gains with upward movement in places like Thailand, Indonesia and Vietnam. Nice to see progress in that in Vietnam, that emerging Southeast Asian nation.
So that provides a bit of color on C&I.
Now onto the Tools Group. Organic sales up 11%, 11%. Significant growth in the U.S. and internationally. Operating income, $56.3 million compared to $49.5 million in 2014. Operating income margins were up 14.8%, rose 90 basis points from last year's 13.9%. The additional volume as well as operating improvements firm RCI translated into significant margin improvement in that 90 basis point gain, overcame 120 basis points of negative currency. When you consider the Tools Group success, you see the power of Snap-on Value Creation and the benefits of our award-winning innovative new products. Beside the MOTOR Top 20 award, the Tools Group also received recognition from the readers of Professional Tool & Equipment News, gaining 5 people's choice selections for new tool innovations, products, once again borne of the intersection between customer connection insight and Advanced Technology wielded by our innovation teams. Products like the KRL 72-inch rolled up with its power tool organizer systems, the powerful and light CT8850 18 volt with impact wrench. The new brake caliper press, our new advanced battery system tester with its print capability and our new double CD to full view welding helmet, all selected by the readers of BT and magazine and by our technician customers as great new products, products that make work easier and products that provide further evidence of Snap-on innovation.
You might remember that the third quarter is also when we hold the annual Snap-on franchisee conference, our SFC. This year it was in Washington DC with more than thousand attendees, franchise and family members from over 3,000 routes [ph], 3 days of showcasing the opportunities to enhance the franchise channel, to amplify the power of our advanced space and all of our franchisees time. And based on the optimism and the confidence of our franchisees, it was a strong success. And oh by the way, orders were up once again, beating the record level achieved in 2014.
When we speak of advance channel, we also have to consider the strategic, very strategic contributions of Snap-on Credit. Our Financial Services arm helps great opportunities across our organization but especially within the Tools Group. And credit has a strong presence at the SFC, supporting franchises with unique programs, enabling sales, those big ticket items which are so essential to franchisee success. And in the third quarter, Financial Services OI was up $8.8 million or 15.4%, another period of powerful contribution to the organization.
Let's move to RS&I. Organic sales were up 8.2%. The operating margin, up 24.6%. It increased 130 basis points from 23.3% just last year. RS&I was charged with expanding our presence with repair shop owners and managers and in the quarter, it did just that. We once again had growth within our businesses providing repair, information and diagnostics independence. In fact, we appear to be gaining traction across many dimensions, in automotive and medium and heavy duty garages, serving both OEM dealerships as well as those independent shops, all fueled by our expanding product offerings. And one of those great RS&I products came from our diagnostics division.
Demonstrating its continuing innovation, our diagnostics team launched its new VERUS edge handheld, an enhanced top-of-the-line offering, thinner, lighter, including important features like 5-second ready to use capability, 5 hour battery life, a solid state hard drive for increased durability and, of course, access to our unique integrated sure track real-world fixes based on masses of actual repair data, all features guided by effective customer connection inputs.
In the VERUS edge, we believe we have a winner, advancing the state-of-the-art and addressing the most serious of repair challenges. And initial sales are breaking the records and exceeding our expectations.
Also in the third quarter and with a focus on heavy-duty shops, RS&I introduced the latest generation of its proprietary vehicle interface, the NEXIQ USB link 2, now with Wi-Fi connectivity. It extends our leading position by adding wireless capabilities to the already successful family of NEXIQ heavy duty diagnostics products. The USB link 2 is compatible with heavy duty diagnostic applications for engines, transmissions, instrument clusters and much more. It supports virtually every standardized vehicle network protocol in nearly every software application and vehicle sectors like construction, agriculture and, of course, heavy-duty truck. 5x the speed of its predecessors with 16x the memory, the USB link 2 is perfect for dealership, fleets and truck shops. Its speed the repair times of these particularly mission-critical vehicles and it improves technician productivity. It's a great upgrade to an already successful product of our RS&I group.
Also in the third quarter, our equipment division registered high single-digit growth with strong volume in North America, helping to offset the Russian market, which is our primary headwind in Eastern Europe. Overall undercar gains in the U.S. were quite solid, with especially impressive increased sales. Increases are challenging the lift division.
Challenger has been a great addition to our Snap-on team and again this quarter, and we believe there is much more to come helping RS&I to expand with a repair shop owners and managers.
RS&I, great new product, with demonstrated growth in diagnostics, heavy duty and undercar equipment, and all that played out in the third quarter results.
Well, that's the highlights of our quarter. Organic sales, up 7.3%. Gains across all groups. Clear progress along our runways for growth. Snap-on Value Creation at the forefront of our activities. Customer connection leading to innovation, creating powerful new product, RCI driving improvement and it all shows in the results. OI margin at 17.5%, up 130 basis points. It was an encouraging quarter.
Now I'll turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo?"

Our third quarter consolidated operating results is summarized on Slide 6. Net sales of $821.5 million in the quarter were up 7.3% organically. On a reported basis, net sales including $42.6 million of unfavorable foreign currency increased",1473,"Thanks, Nick. Our third quarter consolidated operating results is summarized on Slide 6. Net sales of $821.5 million in the quarter were up 7.3% organically. On a reported basis, net sales including $42.6 million of unfavorable foreign currency increased 1.9%. As you know, Snap-on has significant international operations and is subject to foreign currency fluctuations. Largely due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, foreign currency movements adversely impacted our Q3 sales comparisons by 570 basis points.
Net sales in the third quarter also included $2.1 million of sales from our July 2015 acquisition of techniques, a designer and manufacturer of automatic vehicle air conditioning maintenance equipment for OEM dealerships and independent repair shops.
Consolidated gross profit of $406.9 million increased $13 million from 2014 levels, primarily due to higher sales and savings from RCI initiatives, partially offset by 30 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects.
The gross margin of 49.5% in the quarter improved 60 basis points from 48.9% a year ago.
Operating expenses were $263.3 million in both the third quarters of 2015 and 2014. The operating expense margin of 32% improved 70 basis points from 2014 levels, primarily due to benefits from sales volume leverage, partially offset by higher pension expense. No restructuring costs were included in operating earnings in the third quarter of 2015. 
Last year, we incurred $2 million of such costs.
As a result of these factors, operating earnings before Financial Services of $143.6 million in the quarter, including $11.9 million or 50 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased 10% and, as a percentage of sales, improved 130 basis points to 17.5%.
Financial Services revenue of $61.1 million in the quarter increased 14% from 2014 levels and operating earnings of $43.5 million increased 15.4%. These increases primarily reflect the continued growth of the Financial Services portfolio.
Consolidated operating earnings of $187.1 million in the quarter, including $12.7 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased 11.2%. And the operating margin of 21.2% improved 160 basis points from 19.6% the year-ago.
Our third quarter effective income tax rate of 31.6% compared with 31.8% last year.
Finally, net earnings of $116.8 million or $1.98 per diluted share increased $13.1 million or $0.22 per share, representing a 12.5% increase in diluted earnings per share.
Now let's turn to our segment results. Starting with the Commercial & industrial or C&I group on Slide 7, sales of $288.5 million in the quarter were up 3.4% organically, driven primarily by high single-digit gains in both the segments European-based hand held business and Asia Pacific operations and a double-digit increase in the segment's Power Tools operation. These sales increases were partially offset by a mid single-digit decline in sales to customers in critical industries, primarily reflecting lower sales to the military and to customers in the oil and gas sector.
Gross profit in the C&I group of $109.5 million in the quarter decreased $2.3 million from 2014 levels, while the gross margin of 37.9% improved 50 basis points, principally due to savings from RCI initiatives and lower restructuring costs.
Operating expenses of $68.2 million in the quarter decreased $2.8 million from 2014 levels. And the operating expense margin of 23.6% improved 10 basis points from 23.7% last year.
As a result of these factors, operating earnings for the C&I segment of $41.3 million, including $2.9 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased $0.5 million from 2014 levels. And the operating margin of 14.3% improved 60 basis points.
Turning now to Slide 8. Third quarter sales in the Snap-on Tools Group of $380.6 million increased 11% organically, reflecting continued double-digit gains in both the company's U.S. and international franchise operations.
Gross profit of $166.5 million in the quarter increased $11.7 million from 2014 levels. And the gross margin of 43.8% improved 20 basis points. Benefits from the higher sales and savings from RCI initiatives were largely offset by 110 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects.
Operating expenses of $110.2 million in the quarter increased $4.9 million from 2014 levels. And the operating expense margin of 29% improved 70 basis points, principally due to sales volume leverage.
As a result of these factors, operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $56.3 million increased $6.8 million. And the operating margin of 14.8% improved 90 basis points, including $6.8 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects.
Turning to the Repair Systems & Information or RS&I group shown on Slide 9. Sales of $282.9 million in the quarter increased 8.2% organically. The organic sales increase primarily reflects a double-digit gain in sales to OEM dealerships, a high single-digit increase in sales of undercar equipment and a mid-single-digit gain in sales of diagnostics and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers.
Gross profit of $130.9 million increased $3.6 million over 2014 levels. Gross margin of 46.3% in the quarter decreased 60 basis points from 46.9% last year, primarily due to a shift in sales that included higher volumes of lower gross margin products, including increased essential tool and sales to OEM dealerships, partially offset by lower restructuring costs.
Operating expenses of $61.2 million in the quarter decreased $2.8 million from 2014 levels. The operating expense margin of 21.7% improved 190 basis points, mostly due to sales volume leverage, including benefits from the sales shift noted above.
Third quarter operating earnings for the RS&I group of $69.7 million, including $2.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased $6.4 million  from prior year levels. And the operating margin of 24.6% improved 130 basis points.
Now turning to Slide 10. In the third quarter, operating earnings from Financial Services of $43.5 million and revenue of $61.1 million compared with operating earnings of $37.7 million on revenue of $53.6 million last year. The average yield on finance receivables of 17.9% in the quarter compared with 17.6% last year. And the average yield on contract receivables was 9.5% in both years. 
Originations of $257.6 million increased 16.2% from 2014 levels.
Moving to Slide 11. As of quarter end, our balance sheet includes $1.53 billion of gross financing receivables, including $1.33 billion from our U.S. Snap-on Credit operation. Approximately 80% of our U.S. financing portfolio relates to extended credit loans to technicians. During the quarter, our worldwide finance portfolio grew approximately $62 million. As for finance portfolio losses and delinquency trends, these continue to be in line with our expectations.
Now turning to Slide 12. Cash provided by operations of $113.7 million in the quarter increased $25.7 million from comparable 2014 levels, primarily reflecting higher net earnings in 2015 and net changes in operating assets and liabilities.
Net cash used by investing activities of $86.9 million included $55.9 million to fund a net increase in finance receivables. Third quarter capital expenditures of $18.5 million in 2015 compared to $22.3 million last year. Cash used in investing activities in the quarter also included $13.1 million for the acquisition of echo techniques.
Turning to Slide 13. Days sales outstanding for trade receivables were 61 days of both quarter end and 2014 year-end. Inventories increased $52.2 million from 2014 year-end levels, primarily to support continued higher customer demand and new product introductions as well as inventories related to the echo techniques acquisition. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of $3.4 million compared with $3.6 million turns a year ago.
Our quarter end cash position of $119.2 million decreased $13.7 million from 2014 year-end levels. The net decrease includes the impact of funding $629.2 million of new finance receivables, the repurchase of 670,000 shares for $101.6 million, dividend payments of $92.5 million and capital expenditures of $64.3 million. These cash decreases were largely offset by $476.6 million of cash from collections of finance receivables, $352.1 million of cash from operations net of $30 million of discretionary cash contribution to the company's domestic pension plans and $39.7 million of cash proceeds from stock purchase and option and plan exercises.
Our net debt to capital ratio of 27 -- 25.7% compared with 26.3% at 2014 year-end. In addition to our $119.2 million of cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $700 million in available credit facilities and our current short-term credit ratings allow us access to the commercial paper markets.
At quarter end, we had $45.2 million of commercial paper borrowings outstanding.
This concludes my remarks in my third quarter performance. I'll now briefly review our outlook guidance for the balance of 2015.
We anticipate that capital expenditures in 2015 will be in the range of $80 million to $85 million, of which $64.3 million was incurred through the end of the third quarter. We continue to expect our 2015 full year effective income tax rate would be at or below our 2014 full year rate of 32.1%.

Sales up organically 7.3% against some significant headwinds. Of course, say often will always be headwinds, always be challenges but in the midst of that, we believe our runways for growth are wide with abundant opportunities and you can see it in the operating groups. C&I, in the center of the turbulence, sales up 3.4%, profits up 60 basis points. RS&I, wielding software and hardware with repair shop owners and managers, activity rising 8.2% and OI margin of 24.6%, up 130 basis points. Tools, an established and storied business, reaching higher, capturing more customers, sales up 11% and a greater than 6% increase in 21 of the last 22 quarters, OI margin up 90 basis points despite 120 basis points of unfavorable currency. And beside that growth, we see the effects of Snap-on Value Creation paving our runways for improving, helping to drive our opco margin to 17.5%, up 130 basis points, including 50 basis points of currency headwind. And rolling all together with Financial Services, our EPS was $1.98, up 12.5%.
We believe that the third quarter results, extending our positive trends, continuing confirmation of the Snap-on possibilities for both growth and for improvement. And we believe, as demonstrated this past quarter, we can continue on those positive runways as we proceed forward.
Now before I turn the call over to the operator for questions, I think it's appropriate to speak to our franchisees and associates. I know many of you are listening in again. The encouraging results for the third quarter and our positive trends are a direct reflection of your capability and your effort. For the gains you've achieved, you have my congratulations.

You can see it, I'm sure you've looked at the trends, and you can see that, I think the numbers are something like somewhere under 50% of cars today require no grudges, require diagnostics repairs and all grudges require diagnostics units, but something like 7 of 10 repairs in new cars require diagnostics unit.

Actually, C&I, if you go back and you look at the late 2013, the critical industries again was bedeviled by a reduction associated with the military, and that was directly associated with the word sequestration. And so you start to see those kinds of things now and Washington people talking about government shutdowns and so on, it's making the military nervous and they're spending less.

Rock 'n roll cab's have been solid for some time. Having said that, the same number for some time. But I wouldn't necessarily sign up to the idea that I wouldn't add more going forward. Rock 'n roll cab's were introduced somewhere in 2011. And I have to tell you, Gary, we've been learning about how to use them better and how effective they are and where they're most effective and how to do that each quarter. But for now, they're pretty much where they're going to be. The techno is something else. So we've added quite a few. I think actually year-over-year for techno, we've added 21 TechKnow  and I think we'll be probably trying to see how that 21 plays out for a little while. And then we'll make a decision whether we need more or not going forward. But it's a mistake to think that tool storage sales is directly proportional to the number of rock 'n roll cab's. That's not true. What we found is that they got more and more productive, more and more liberating every time, every quarter. And same thing for techno vans."

What we know is the industry problems, the economic environments created overhang. And then in places like for us and you see it in oil and gas this time, you can see that mining, although mining was a contributory for us. So it's very difficult to look at any macro and say it's going to affect us. All you can say is, look, the general macro is going to create an overhang, how well we do on offsetting is another question but we do have the ability to offset it from time to time. Like in this quarter, we felt we feel when we look at industrial, when we look at critical, we feel we can see the trajectory of upward trends even though it was a tepid quarter. It was a drag on us this time because we can see the gains in railroad in places like mining and heavy duty. So we can see the proof of concept working through. It's hard for us to give you any guidance on that. In Asia Pacific, for example, the turbulence around Asia Pacific did really create an overhang for us, but we succeeded in some markets and had some difficulty in others. Our operations and our sales in both those markets ended up being a growth situation. And in Europe, it seems like and I think what's worked for us in Europe is we came from such a low position. We kept investing. We create new products that were growing even as the market is tepid. So it's kind of a cocktail of things, and I can't quite give you any particular macro on which to trend. But I can tell you is adding we feel progress in each of those places."

So the bits and the bytes and the metal and the mechanisms, we sell more of that, we are happy. We are encouraged by that. So even in C&I, which was down that, 3.4% organic is what we follow because that looks to us to be customer gain. That's one. Two is, is that what you see in this situation is, what I'm talking about, when I'm talking about RCI, I'm talking about things like being able to make the product less expensively. We reduce the setup times in the factory which is a big deal for us. We find ways through customer connection and our innovation process to wield new technologies that allow us to develop new product cheaper. Remember, in C&I, for example, last year in aviation we brought last year in oil and gas I think our heavy truck I'd say we brought 859 new products, in aviation was 996 and one of the things that allowed us to do that better is to put technology like 3D printing and [indiscernible] and so on. And that cut Cost and the design cycle allows us to bring up those new. products with lower cost than before. Those are the kinds of things to do and even if we -- so even if we had lower as reported revenues, our cost gets driven down because of some of that. And it doesn't happen every quarter. It happens, if I reduce the cost on one particular product, well maybe the product sells well this quarter and I get some good benefit out of it. That may not sell so well next quarter and I don't quite get the same benefit."

And so we figured it was the most critical of industries, we invested in its bigger. If you take our revenues, which is somewhere north of 450 or something like that, let's say, and you divide them by 6 and you take one of the bigger ones, that would be the military. And oil and gas will be more in the middle some place. So that helps. I think that should give you some ballpark view of this.

And that was --  the 9.9 was, I would say, artificially depressed by the fact that we had the credit company in transition, somewhat, not huge, but that's a factor there a little bit. And so you can say, all right, it impacted some, but maybe not much but okay we had that transition going on and so on. Maybe arithmetically it's ineffective. But down there we had some turbulence. And so then the big difference there is now is we're starting at 17 5. So I mean, I wouldn't expect it to be worse than that deterioration. The other factor I'd offer is this is 2 factors. One, is I believe we are stronger in our market positions therefore even more resistant, number one. Number two -- number three, and this is harder to predict. Last time, our customer base, which was principally the 70% of customer base, the automotive repair technician, I spent a lot of time talking about the fact that they were cash rich and confidence poor. They were getting up every day and reading bad news for breakfast. It was the worst recession of our lifetime. People are talking about putting dollars in mattresses. Well, I'm not sure and so therefore, they didn't buy big-ticket items even though they had a lot of cash. That would happen again, but I'm not sure it would be the same extent. I don't know. That's a judgment call, of course. And we're more experienced in RCI than we were. And the other thing is we are just better in RCI and so we probably -- you can't you don't have 24 hours a day, so you can't if you think the prospects for growth are less, you turn more toward improvement."

As usual, I'll start with the third quarter highlights, provide an update on the environment and then speak a bit about our trends. Aldo will then provide a detailed review of the financials.
In the third quarter, we again showed progress along our runways for growth and for improvement, and we saw those gains across our operating segments. Organic sales were up 7.3% from last year. Opco operating margin, it reached 17.5%, up 130 basis points. When you add the $43.5 million in operating earnings from Financial Services, up from $37.7 million in 2014, the consolidated operating margin was 21.2%, an increase of 160 basis points. And EPS, EPS was $1.98, up $0.22 or 12.5% from the $1.76 last year. Our reported sales increase was 1.9%, including the impact of unfavorable foreign currency. And in this quarter, that total was $42.6 million, about the same as the second quarter.
Adding the incremental $2.1 million sales from our third quarter acquisition of Ecotechnics, the total reported sales for the period were $821.5 million.
For automotive repair businesses, the environment continues to be favorable. Actually, it's been that way for a while. And our Tools Group and Repair Systems & Information, our RS&I group, are both well positioned to take full advantage. You can see it in the performance. Another quarter of solid gains for both groups, advancing along our runways for growth. 
Clearly, the Tools Group demonstrated enhancements to the franchise network. Gains in all its markets, continuing to take advantage of the opportunities that are so abundant in a changing vehicle fleet, not only in the United States, but in places like the U.K. and Australia.
And RS&I, with strong sales across North America and parts of Europe, double-digit growth in the U.S. and modest gains in Western Europe, offsetting the continuing softness in Eastern Europe and particularly in Russia.
RS&I progress, achieved with independent repair shop owners and managers and with OEM dealerships, advanced by our latest diagnostics and undercar product offerings.
For the Commercial & Industrial or C&I group, we overcame some increased headwinds, with the overall organic sales rise offsetting mixed environments across industries and across geographies.
That said, in the third quarter, our European-based hand tool businesses and our Asia Pacific operations recorded high single-digit gains, overcoming the turbulence within their particular markets.
Now our industrial division did have some headwinds in the period, impacted by weak U.S. Military volume and slowdowns in our oil and gas activity.
We consistently mentioned the uncertainty associated with the military. In the third quarter, that caution materialized, and our results included a double-digit decrease, measured spending and budget constraints making the present tight and the future even more difficult to predict.
Within our natural resources segment, volume in oil and gas was down substantially. You see it in oil prices and you read about it in newspapers and despite our small share and opportunities for penetration, we were impacted. But that said, saying that, will always be headwinds. They've been a factor in other quarters, and they were present in the third quarter and we overcame because we are well-positioned to confront the challenges and proceed down all our runways for growth, enhancing the franchise network, expanding our repairs [indiscernible] and managers, extending the critical industries and building an emerging market. These do represent avenues for advancement, and there has been consistent progress along each of those paths.
At the same time, those growth drivers are joined and supported by the benefits of Snap-on Value Creation, safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and rapid continuous improvement or RCI. These are the processes, the tools we use each and every day to drive improvements, but this quarter we especially benefited from customer connection and innovation.
Customer connection, Snap-on's continuing pursuit of understanding of work derived from the hours and the days we spend with professionals.
Innovation, taking that practical insight and matching it with the possibilities of modern technology. And in the quarter, those processes resulted in more prestigious product awards for the Corporation. We are again honored with 2 MOTOR Magazine top 20 tool awards. The winners this time, our 3/8-inch drive steering rack socket and our [indiscernible] diagnostic handheld. 
Let's talk about the steering rack socket. The S6229 was developed from a customer connection drive from direct observation award and from conversations with multiple technicians. This innovative tool allows the tech to replace power steering O-rings without removing the whole steering assembly, saving up to an hour of labor, clearly making work easier and professional repair more productive.
In addition, also created a deep insight in the repair process, the innovative SOLUS Edge, coverage for hundreds of vehicle systems, including hybrid TPMS, steering and clean diesel. And it all comes loaded with our fast-track troubleshooter database with its vehicle-specific tips, tests and timesavers. The SOLUS Edge enhanced coverage -- is enhanced coverage for over 40 car makes without the cost or complexity of factory scan tools. And for all its power, for all its strength, it's easy to use. The large 8-inch touchscreen displays an aid to visibility and the software provides accurate results in as little as 30 seconds. Quick. 
I mentioned these awards because they're just the most recent recognitions of a growing list of very popular products that provide unique advantages, created by the observations of our franchisees and direct sales people who are committed to translating that insight into productivity innovation. And that broad value creation is reflected in the positive results registered across all our operating groups again this quarter.
Now let's focus on those individual groups. Starting with Commercial & Industrial. Organic sales were up 3.4%. Operating margins reached 14.3%, up 60 basis points from last year's 13.7%. Growth along with the benefits of Snap-on Value Creation. Now I said, as we said, there are headwinds. But our industrial direct salesmen have been expanding their reach nevertheless into sectors like railroads, up double digits, growing our presence, offering a wider variety of tools and tool control solutions. We've spoken in the past about building our understanding of work in critical industries, expanding our customer connection. One way that's happening is by using our experience in RCI, participating in customer lean events, participating in the customer-sponsored lean events. Our team was able to assist in improving railroad operations while at the same time gaining a better understanding of the work processes, their product requirements, their business needs and the overall industry direction, all key customer connections gained through lean event participation.
One of the tools conceived from those insights was our special extendable line of 2 wrenches, great for heavy duty work on railroad cars and tracks. Made in our Elizabeth and Tennessee plants, these 2 wrenches replace the traditional slugging wrenches in railroad application, allowing the operator better access, eliminating the need for costly 2 persons slugging procedures and making work easier, safer and more productive.
Let's speak about SNA Europe. Now 8 quarters in a row of year-over-year growth, navigating through some of the most difficult geographies and tepid economies. SNA Europe activities continues to be encouraged -- activity continues to be encouraging. But its profits -- its profits, are even more positive, now up significantly for 10 straight quarters. And we believe there is much more room for further gain.
And related to our Asia Pacific operations, the environments are mixed, but we had overall gains with upward movement in places like Thailand, Indonesia and Vietnam. Nice to -- actually it's nice to see progress in that in Vietnam, that emerging Southeast Asian nation.
So that provides a bit of color on C&I.
Now onto the Tools Group. Organic sales up 11% -- 11%. Significant growth in the U.S. and internationally. Operating income, $56.3 million compared to $49.5 million in 2014. Operating income margins were up 14.8%, rose 90 basis points from last year's 13.9%. The additional volume as well as operating improvements for -- from RCI translated into significant margin improvement in that 90 basis point gain, overcame 120 basis points of negative currency. When you consider the Tools Group success, you see the power of Snap-on Value Creation and the benefits of our award-winning innovative new products. Beside the MOTOR Top 20 award, the Tools Group also received recognition from the readers of Professional Tool & Equipment News, gaining 5 people's choice selections for new tool innovations, products, once again borne of the intersection between customer connection insight and Advanced Technology wielded by our innovation teams. Products like the KRL 72-inch roll cab with its power tool organizer system, the powerful and light CT8850 18-volt Cordless impact wrench. The new -- our new brake caliper press, our new advanced battery system tester with its print capability and our new double [indiscernible] full view welding helmet, all selected by the readers of [indiscernible] magazine and by our technician customers as great new products, products that make work easier and products that provide further evidence of Snap-on innovation.
You might remember that the third quarter is also when we hold the annual Snap-on franchisee conference, our SFC. This year it was in Washington DC with more than 8,000 attendees, franchise and family members from over 3,000 routes , 3 days of showcasing the opportunities to enhance the franchise channel, to amplify the power of our advanced space and of our franchisees' time. And based on the optimism and the confidence of our franchisees, it was a strong success. And by the way, orders were up once again, beating the record level achieved in 2014.
When we speak of the van channel, we also have to consider the strategic -- very strategic contributions of Snap-on Credit. Our Financial Services arm helps create opportunities across our organization but especially within the Tools Group. And credit has a strong presence at the SFC, supporting franchises with unique programs, enabling sales of those big ticket items which are so essential to franchisee success. And in the third quarter, Financial Services OI was up $5.8 million or 15.4%, another period of powerful contribution to the organization.
Let's move to RS&I. Organic sales were up 8.2%. The operating margin, up 24.6%. It increased 130 basis points from 23.3% just last year. RS&I was charged with expanding our presence to repair shop owners and managers and in the quarter, it did just that. We once again had growth in our businesses providing repair, information and diagnostics independence. In fact, we appear to be gaining traction across many dimensions, in automotive and medium and in heavy duty garages, serving both OEM dealerships as well as those independent shops, all fueled by our expanding product offerings. And one of those great RS&I products came from our diagnostics division.
Demonstrating its continuing innovation, our diagnostics team launched its new VERUS edge handheld, an enhanced top-of-the-line offering, thinner, lighter, including important features like 5-second, ready-to-use capability, 5-hour battery life, a solid state hard drive for increased durability and, of course, access to our unique integrated SureTrack real-world fixes based on masses of actual repair data, all features guided by effective customer connection inputs.
In the VERUS Edge, we believe we have a winner, advancing the state-of-the-art and addressing the most serious of repair challenges. And initial sales are breaking records and exceeding our expectations.
Also in the third quarter and with a focus on heavy-duty shops, RS&I introduced the latest generation of its proprietary vehicle interface, the NEXIQ USB-Link 2, now with Wi-Fi connectivity. It extends our leading position by adding wireless capabilities to the already successful family of NEXIQ heavy-duty diagnostics products. The USB-Link 2 is compatible with heavy-duty diagnostic applications for engines, transmission, ABS and instrument clusters and much more. It supports virtually every standardized vehicle network protocol in nearly every software application and vehicle sectors like construction, agriculture and, of course, heavy-duty truck. 5x the speed of its predecessors with 16x the memory, the USB-Link 2 is perfect for dealership, fleets and truck shops. It speeds the repair times of these particularly mission-critical vehicles, and it improves technician productivity. It's a great upgrade to an already successful product from our RS&I group.
Also in the third quarter, our equipment division registered high single-digit growth with strong volume in North America, helping to offset the Russian market, which is our primary headwind in Eastern Europe. Overall, undercar gains in the U.S. were quite solid, with especially impressive increased sales, increases at our Challenger Lifts division.
Challenger has been a great addition to our Snap-on team and it proves that again this quarter, and we believe there is much more to come helping RS&I to expand with repair shop owners and managers.
RS&I, great new product, with demonstrated growth in diagnostics, heavy duty and undercar equipment, and all that played out in the third quarter results.
Well, that's the highlights of our quarter. Organic sales, up 7.3%. Gains across all groups. Clear progress along our runways for growth. Snap-on Value Creation at the forefront of our activities. Customer connection leading to innovation, creating powerful new product, RCI driving improvement and it all shows in the results. OI margin to 17.5%, up 130 basis points. It was an encouraging quarter.
Now I'll turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo?"

Net sales of $821.5 million in the quarter were up 7.3% organically. On a reported basis, net sales including $42.6 million of unfavorable foreign currency increased 1.9%. As you know, Snap-on has significant international operations and is subject to foreign currency fluctuations. Largely due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, foreign currency movements adversely impacted our Q3 sales comparisons by 570 basis points.
Net sales in the third quarter also included $2.1 million of sales from our July 2015 acquisition of Ecotechnics, a designer and manufacturer of automatic vehicle air conditioning maintenance equipment for OEM dealerships and independent repair shops.
Consolidated gross profit of $406.9 million increased $13 million from 2014 levels, primarily due to higher sales and savings from RCI initiatives, partially offset by 30 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects.
The gross margin of 49.5% in the quarter improved 60 basis points from 48.9% a year ago.
Operating expenses were $263.3 million in both the third quarters of 2015 and 2014. The operating expense margin of 32% improved 70 basis points from 2014 levels, primarily due to benefits from sales volume leverage, partially offset by higher pension expense. No restructuring costs were included in operating earnings in the third quarter of 2015. 
Last year, we incurred $2 million of such costs.
As a result of these factors, operating earnings before Financial Services of $143.6 million in the quarter, including $11.9 million or 50 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased 10% and, as a percentage of sales, improved 130 basis points to 17.5%.
Financial Services revenue of $61.1 million in the quarter increased 14% from 2014 levels and operating earnings of $43.5 million increased 15.4%. These increases primarily reflect the continued growth of the Financial Services portfolio.
Consolidated operating earnings of $187.1 million in the quarter, including $12.7 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased 11.2%. And the operating margin of 21.2% improved 160 basis points from 19.6% a year ago.
Our third quarter effective income tax rate of 31.6% compared with 31.8% last year.
Finally, net earnings of $116.8 million or $1.98 per diluted share increased $13.1 million or $0.22 per share, representing a 12.5% increase in diluted earnings per share.
Now let's turn to our segment results. Starting with the Commercial & industrial or C&I group on Slide 7, sales of $288.5 million in the quarter were up 3.4% organically, driven primarily by high single-digit gains in both the segments European-based hand tools business and Asia Pacific operations and a double-digit increase in the segment's Power Tools operations. These sales increases were partially offset by a mid-single-digit decline in sales to customers in critical industries, primarily reflecting lower sales to the military and to customers in the oil and gas sector.
Gross profit in the C&I group of $109.5 million in the quarter decreased $2.3 million from 2014 levels, while the gross margin of 37.9% improved 50 basis points, principally due to savings from RCI initiatives and lower restructuring costs.
Operating expenses of $68.2 million in the quarter decreased $2.8 million from 2014 levels. And the operating expense margin of 23.6% improved 10 basis points from 23.7% last year.
As a result of these factors, operating earnings for the C&I segment of $41.3 million, including $2.9 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased $0.5 million from 2014 levels. And the operating margin of 14.3% improved 60 basis points.
Turning now to Slide 8. Third quarter sales in the Snap-on Tools Group of $380.6 million increased 11% organically, reflecting continued double-digit gains in both the company's U.S. and international franchise operations.
Gross profit of $166.5 million in the quarter increased $11.7 million from 2014 levels. And the gross margin of 43.8% improved 20 basis points. Benefits from the higher sales and savings from RCI initiatives were largely offset by 110 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects.
Operating expenses of $110.2 million in the quarter increased $4.9 million from 2014 levels. And the operating expense margin of 29% improved 70 basis points, principally due to sales volume leverage.
As a result of these factors, operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $56.3 million increased $6.8 million. And the operating margin of 14.8% improved 90 basis points, including $6.8 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects.
Turning to the Repair Systems & Information or RS&I group shown on Slide 9. Sales of $282.9 million in the quarter increased 8.2% organically. The organic sales increase primarily reflects a double-digit gain in sales to OEM dealerships, a high single-digit increase in sales of undercar equipment and a mid-single-digit gain in sales of diagnostics and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers.
Gross profit of $130.9 million increased $3.6 million over 2014 levels. Gross margin of 46.3% in the quarter decreased 60 basis points from 46.9% last year, primarily due to a shift in sales that included higher volumes of lower gross margin products, including increased essential tool and [indiscernible] sales to OEM dealerships, partially offset by lower restructuring costs.
Operating expenses of $61.2 million in the quarter decreased $2.8 million from 2014 levels. The operating expense margin of 21.7% improved 190 basis points, mostly due to sales volume leverage, including benefits from the sales shift noted above.
Third quarter operating earnings for the RS&I group of $69.7 million, including $2.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased $6.4 million from prior year levels. And the operating margin of 24.6% improved 130 basis points.
Now turning to Slide 10. In the third quarter, operating earnings from Financial Services of $43.5 million and revenue of $61.1 million compared with operating earnings of $37.7 million on revenue of $53.6 million last year. The average yield on finance receivables of 17.9% in the quarter compared with 17.6% last year. And the average yield on contract receivables was 9.5% in both years. 
Originations of $257.6 million increased 16.2% from 2014 levels.
Moving to Slide 11. As of quarter end, our balance sheet includes $1.53 billion of gross financing receivables, including $1.33 billion from our U.S. Snap-on Credit operation. Approximately 80% of our U.S. financing portfolio relates to extended credit loans to technicians. During the quarter, our worldwide finance portfolio grew approximately $62 million. As for finance portfolio losses and delinquency trends, these continue to be in line with our expectations.
Now turning to Slide 12. Cash provided by operations of $113.7 million in the quarter increased $25.7 million from comparable 2014 levels, primarily reflecting higher net earnings in 2015 and net changes in operating assets and liabilities.
Net cash used by investing activities of $86.9 million included $55.9 million to fund a net increase in finance receivables. Third quarter capital expenditures of $18.5 million in 2015 compared to $22.3 million last year. Cash used in investing activities in the quarter also included $13.1 million for the acquisition of Ecotechnics.
Turning to Slide 13. Days sales outstanding for trade receivables were 61 days of both quarter end and 2014 year-end. Inventories increased $52.2 million from 2014 year-end levels, primarily to support continued higher customer demand and new product introductions as well as inventories related to the Ecotechnics acquisition. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of $3.4 million compared with $3.6 million turns a year ago.
Our quarter end cash position of $119.2 million decreased $13.7 million from 2014 year-end levels. The net decrease includes the impact of funding $629.2 million of new finance receivables, the repurchase of 670,000 shares for $101.6 million, dividend payments of $92.5 million and capital expenditures of $64.3 million. These cash decreases were largely offset by $476.6 million of cash from collections of finance receivables, $352.1 million of cash from operations net of $30 million of discretionary cash contribution to the company's domestic pension plans and $39.7 million of cash proceeds from stock purchase and option plan exercises.
Our net debt to capital ratio of 27 -- 25.7% compared with 26.3% at 2014 year-end. In addition to our $119.2 million of cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $700 million in available credit facilities and our current short-term credit ratings allow us access to the commercial paper markets.
At quarter end, we had $45.2 million of commercial paper borrowings outstanding.
This concludes my remarks on our third quarter performance. I'll now briefly review a few outlook guidance for the balance of 2015.
We anticipate that capital expenditures in 2015 will be in the range of $80 million to $85 million, of which $64.3 million was incurred through the end of the third quarter. We continue to expect our 2015 full year effective income tax rate would be at or below our 2014 full year rate of 32.1%.

Sales up organically 7.3% against some significant headwinds. Of course, as we say often, will always be headwinds, always be challenges but in the midst of that, we believe our runways for growth are wide with abundant opportunities and you can see it in the operating groups.

And rolling all together with Financial Services, our EPS was $1.98, up 12.5%.
We believe that the third quarter results, extending our positive trends, continuing confirmation of the Snap-on possibilities for both growth and for improvement. And we believe, we -- we believe, as demonstrated this past quarter, we can continue on those positive runways as we proceed forward.

Actually, C&I, if you go back and you look at the late 2013, the critical industries again was bedeviled by a reduction associated with the military, and that was directly associated with the word sequestration. And so you're starting to see those kinds of things now and Washington people talking about government shutdowns and so on, and it's making the military nervous and they're spending less. We feel we're pretty well positioned though to take full advantage when they're ready to spend."

So it's very difficult to look at any macro and say it's going to affect us. All you can say is, look, the general macro is going to create an overhang, how well we do in offsetting it is another question but we do have the ability to offset it from time to time. Like in this quarter, we felt -- we feel when we look at industrial, when we look at critical industry, we feel we can see the trajectory of upward trends even though it was a tepid quarter. It was a drag on us this time because we can see the gains in railroad in places like mining and heavy duty. So we can see the proof of concept working through. It's hard for us to give you any guidance on that. In Asia Pacific, for example, the turbulence around Asia Pacific did really create an overhang for us, but we succeeded in some markets and had some difficulty in others. Our operations and our sales in both those markets ended up being a growth situation. In Europe, it seems like and I think what's worked for us in Europe is we came from such a low position. We kept investing. We create new product that we're growing even as the market is tepid. So it's kind of a cocktail of things, and I can't quite give you any particular macro on which to trend.

So the bits and the bytes and the metal and the mechanisms, we sell more of that, we are happy. We are encouraged by that. So even in C&I, which was down that, 3.4% organic is what we follow because that looks to us to be customer gain. That's one. Two is, is that what you see in this situation is, what I'm talking about, when I'm talking about RCI, I'm talking about things like being able to make the product less expensively. We reduce the setup times in the factory which is a big deal for us. We find ways through customer connection and our innovation process to wield new technologies that allow us to develop new product cheaper. Remember, in C&I, for example, last year in aviation we brought -- last year in oil and gas, I think, we -- our heavy truck, let's say, we brought 859 new products, in aviation was 996 and one of the things that allows us to make -- to do that better is to -- is new technology like 3D printing and finite element analysis and so on. And that's cut cost and the design cycle allows us to bring out those new products with lower cost than before. Those are the kinds of things we do and even if we -- so even if we have lower as reported revenues, our cost gets driven down because of some of that. And it doesn't happen every quarter. It happens, if I reduce the cost of one particular product, well maybe that product sells well this quarter and I get some good benefit out of it.

And the other thing is we are just better at RCI and so we'd probably step that up -- if you can't -- you only have 24 hours in a day, so you can't if you think the prospects for growth are less, you turn more toward improvement."

In the third quarter, we again showed progress along our runways for growth and for improvement, and we saw those gains across our operating segments. Organic sales were up 7.3% from last year. Opco operating margin, it reached 17.5%, up 130 basis points. When you add the $43.5 million in operating earnings from Financial Services, up from $37.7 million in 2014, the consolidated operating margin was 21.2%, an increase of 160 basis points. And EPS, EPS was $1.98, up $0.22 or 12.5% from the $1.76 last year. Our reported sales increase was 1.9%, including the impact of unfavorable foreign currency. And in this quarter, that total was $42.6 million, about the same as the second quarter.
Adding the incremental $2.1 million sales from our third quarter acquisition of Ecotechnics, the total reported sales for the period were $821.5 million.
For automotive repair businesses, the environment continues to be favorable. Actually, it's been that way for a while. And our Tools Group and Repair Systems & Information, our RS&I group, are both well positioned to take full advantage. You can see it in the performance. Another quarter of solid gains for both groups, advancing along our runways for growth. 
Clearly, the Tools Group demonstrated enhancements to the franchise network. Gains in all its markets, continuing to take advantage of the opportunities that are so abundant in a changing vehicle fleet, not only in the United States, but in places like the U.K. and Australia.
And RS&I, with strong sales across North America and parts of Europe, double-digit growth in the U.S. and modest gains in Western Europe, offsetting the continuing softness in Eastern Europe and particularly in Russia.
RS&I progress, achieved with independent repair shop owners and managers and with OEM dealerships, advanced by our latest diagnostics and undercar product offerings.
For the Commercial & Industrial or C&I group, we overcame some increased headwinds, with the overall organic sales rise offsetting mixed environments across industries and across geographies.
That said, in the third quarter, our European-based hand tool businesses and our Asia Pacific operations recorded high single-digit gains, overcoming the turbulence within their particular markets.
Now our industrial division did have some headwinds in the period, impacted by weak U.S. Military volume and slowdowns in our oil and gas activity.
We consistently mentioned the uncertainty associated with the military. In the third quarter, that caution materialized, and our results included a double-digit decrease, measured spending and budget constraints making the present tight and the future even more difficult to predict.
Within our natural resources segment, volume in oil and gas was down substantially. You see it in oil prices and you read about it in newspapers and despite our small share and opportunities for penetration, we were impacted. But that said, saying that, will always be headwinds. They've been a factor in other quarters, and they were present in the third quarter and we overcame because we are well-positioned to confront the challenges and proceed down all our runways for growth, enhancing the franchise network, expanding our repairs [indiscernible] and managers, extending the critical industries and building an emerging market. These do represent avenues for advancement, and there has been consistent progress along each of those paths.
At the same time, those growth drivers are joined and supported by the benefits of Snap-on Value Creation, safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and rapid continuous improvement or RCI. These are the processes, the tools we use each and every day to drive improvements, but this quarter we especially benefited from customer connection and innovation.
Customer connection, Snap-on's continuing pursuit of understanding of work derived from the hours and the days we spend with professionals.
Innovation, taking that practical insight and matching it with the possibilities of modern technology. And in the quarter, those processes resulted in more prestigious product awards for the Corporation. We are again honored with 2 MOTOR Magazine top 20 tool awards. The winners this time, our 3/8-inch drive steering rack socket and our SOLUS EDGE diagnostic handheld. 
Let's talk about the steering rack socket. The S6229 was developed from a customer connection drive from direct observation award and from conversations with multiple technicians. This innovative tool allows the tech to replace power steering O-rings without removing the whole steering assembly, saving up to an hour of labor, clearly making work easier and professional repair more productive.
In addition, also created a deep insight in the repair process, the innovative SOLUS Edge, coverage for hundreds of vehicle systems, including hybrid TPMS, steering and clean diesel. And it all comes loaded with our fast-track troubleshooter database with its vehicle-specific tips, tests and timesavers. The SOLUS Edge enhanced coverage -- is enhanced coverage for over 40 car makes without the cost or complexity of factory scan tools. And for all its power, for all its strength, it's easy to use. The large 8-inch touchscreen displays an aid to visibility and the software provides accurate results in as little as 30 seconds. Quick. 
I mentioned these awards because they're just the most recent recognitions of a growing list of very popular products that provide unique advantages, created by the observations of our franchisees and direct sales people who are committed to translating that insight into productivity innovation. And that broad value creation is reflected in the positive results registered across all our operating groups again this quarter.
Now let's focus on those individual groups. Starting with Commercial & Industrial. Organic sales were up 3.4%. Operating margins reached 14.3%, up 60 basis points from last year's 13.7%. Growth along with the benefits of Snap-on Value Creation. Now I said, as we said, there are headwinds. But our industrial direct salesmen have been expanding their reach nevertheless into sectors like railroads, up double digits, growing our presence, offering a wider variety of tools and tool control solutions. We've spoken in the past about building our understanding of work in critical industries, expanding our customer connection. One way that's happening is by using our experience in RCI, participating in customer lean events, participating in the customer-sponsored lean events. Our team was able to assist in improving railroad operations while at the same time gaining a better understanding of the work processes, their product requirements, their business needs and the overall industry direction, all key customer connections gained through lean event participation.
One of the tools conceived from those insights was our special extendable line of 2 wrenches, great for heavy duty work on railroad cars and tracks. Made in our Elizabeth and Tennessee plants, these 2 wrenches replace the traditional slugging wrenches in railroad application, allowing the operator better access, eliminating the need for costly 2 persons slugging procedures and making work easier, safer and more productive.
Let's speak about SNA Europe. Now 8 quarters in a row of year-over-year growth, navigating through some of the most difficult geographies and tepid economies. SNA Europe activities continues to be encouraged -- activity continues to be encouraging. But its profits -- its profits, are even more positive, now up significantly for 10 straight quarters. And we believe there is much more room for further gain.
And related to our Asia Pacific operations, the environments are mixed, but we had overall gains with upward movement in places like Thailand, Indonesia and Vietnam. Nice to -- actually it's nice to see progress in that in Vietnam, that emerging Southeast Asian nation.
So that provides a bit of color on C&I.
Now onto the Tools Group. Organic sales up 11% -- 11%. Significant growth in the U.S. and internationally. Operating income, $56.3 million compared to $49.5 million in 2014. Operating income margins were up 14.8%, rose 90 basis points from last year's 13.9%. The additional volume as well as operating improvements for -- from RCI translated into significant margin improvement in that 90 basis point gain, overcame 120 basis points of negative currency. When you consider the Tools Group success, you see the power of Snap-on Value Creation and the benefits of our award-winning innovative new products. Beside the MOTOR Top 20 award, the Tools Group also received recognition from the readers of Professional Tool & Equipment News, gaining 5 people's choice selections for new tool innovations, products, once again borne of the intersection between customer connection insight and Advanced Technology wielded by our innovation teams. Products like the KRL 72-inch roll cab with its power tool organizer system, the powerful and light CT8850 18-volt Cordless impact wrench. The new -- our new brake caliper press, our new advanced battery system tester with its print capability and our new double [indiscernible] full view welding helmet, all selected by the readers of P10  magazine and by our technician customers as great new products, products that make work easier and products that provide further evidence of Snap-on innovation.
You might remember that the third quarter is also when we hold the annual Snap-on franchisee conference, our SFC. This year it was in Washington DC with more than 8,000 attendees, franchise and family members from over 3,000 routes , 3 days of showcasing the opportunities to enhance the franchise channel, to amplify the power of our advanced space and of our franchisees' time. And based on the optimism and the confidence of our franchisees, it was a strong success. And by the way, orders were up once again, beating the record level achieved in 2014.
When we speak of the van channel, we also have to consider the strategic -- very strategic contributions of Snap-on Credit. Our Financial Services arm helps create opportunities across our organization but especially within the Tools Group. And credit has a strong presence at the SFC, supporting franchises with unique programs, enabling sales of those big ticket items which are so essential to franchisee success. And in the third quarter, Financial Services OI was up $5.8 million or 15.4%, another period of powerful contribution to the organization.
Let's move to RS&I. Organic sales were up 8.2%. The operating margin, up 24.6%. It increased 130 basis points from 23.3% just last year. RS&I was charged with expanding our presence to repair shop owners and managers and in the quarter, it did just that. We once again had growth in our businesses providing repair, information and diagnostics independence. In fact, we appear to be gaining traction across many dimensions, in automotive and medium and in heavy duty garages, serving both OEM dealerships as well as those independent shops, all fueled by our expanding product offerings. And one of those great RS&I products came from our diagnostics division.
Demonstrating its continuing innovation, our diagnostics team launched its new VERUS edge handheld, an enhanced top-of-the-line offering, thinner, lighter, including important features like 5-second, ready-to-use capability, 5-hour battery life, a solid state hard drive for increased durability and, of course, access to our unique integrated SureTrack real-world fixes based on masses of actual repair data, all features guided by effective customer connection inputs.
In the VERUS Edge, we believe we have a winner, advancing the state-of-the-art and addressing the most serious of repair challenges. And initial sales are breaking records and exceeding our expectations.
Also in the third quarter and with a focus on heavy-duty shops, RS&I introduced the latest generation of its proprietary vehicle interface, the NEXIQ USB-Link 2, now with Wi-Fi connectivity. It extends our leading position by adding wireless capabilities to the already successful family of NEXIQ heavy-duty diagnostics products. The USB-Link 2 is compatible with heavy-duty diagnostic applications for engines, transmission, ABS and instrument clusters and much more. It supports virtually every standardized vehicle network protocol in nearly every software application and vehicle sectors like construction, agriculture and, of course, heavy-duty truck. 5x the speed of its predecessors with 16x the memory, the USB-Link 2 is perfect for dealership, fleets and truck shops. It speeds the repair times of these particularly mission-critical vehicles, and it improves technician productivity. It's a great upgrade to an already successful product from our RS&I group.
Also in the third quarter, our equipment division registered high single-digit growth with strong volume in North America, helping to offset the Russian market, which is our primary headwind in Eastern Europe. Overall, undercar gains in the U.S. were quite solid, with especially impressive increased sales, increases at our Challenger Lifts division.
Challenger has been a great addition to our Snap-on team and it proves that again this quarter, and we believe there is much more to come helping RS&I to expand with repair shop owners and managers.
RS&I, great new product, with demonstrated growth in diagnostics, heavy duty and undercar equipment, and all that played out in the third quarter results.
Well, that's the highlights of our quarter. Organic sales, up 7.3%. Gains across all groups. Clear progress along our runways for growth. Snap-on Value Creation at the forefront of our activities. Customer connection leading to innovation, creating powerful new product, RCI driving improvement and it all shows in the results. OI margin to 17.5%, up 130 basis points. It was an encouraging quarter.
Now I'll turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo?"

Net sales of $821.5 million in the quarter were up 7.3% organically. On a reported basis, net sales including $42.6 million of unfavorable foreign currency increased 1.9%. As you know, Snap-on has significant international operations and is subject to foreign currency fluctuations. Largely due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, foreign currency movements adversely impacted our Q3 sales comparisons by 570 basis points.
Net sales in the third quarter also included $2.1 million of sales from our July 2015 acquisition of Ecotechnics, a designer and manufacturer of automatic vehicle air conditioning maintenance equipment for OEM dealerships and independent repair shops.
Consolidated gross profit of $406.9 million increased $13 million from 2014 levels, primarily due to higher sales and savings from RCI initiatives, partially offset by 30 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects.
The gross margin of 49.5% in the quarter improved 60 basis points from 48.9% a year ago.
Operating expenses were $263.3 million in both the third quarters of 2015 and 2014. The operating expense margin of 32% improved 70 basis points from 2014 levels, primarily due to benefits from sales volume leverage, partially offset by higher pension expense. No restructuring costs were included in operating earnings in the third quarter of 2015. 
Last year, we incurred $2 million of such costs.
As a result of these factors, operating earnings before Financial Services of $143.6 million in the quarter, including $11.9 million or 50 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased 10% and, as a percentage of sales, improved 130 basis points to 17.5%.
Financial Services revenue of $61.1 million in the quarter increased 14% from 2014 levels and operating earnings of $43.5 million increased 15.4%. These increases primarily reflect the continued growth of the Financial Services portfolio.
Consolidated operating earnings of $187.1 million in the quarter, including $12.7 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased 11.2%. And the operating margin of 21.2% improved 160 basis points from 19.6% a year ago.
Our third quarter effective income tax rate of 31.6% compared with 31.8% last year.
Finally, net earnings of $116.8 million or $1.98 per diluted share increased $13.1 million or $0.22 per share, representing a 12.5% increase in diluted earnings per share.
Now let's turn to our segment results. Starting with the Commercial & industrial or C&I group on Slide 7, sales of $288.5 million in the quarter were up 3.4% organically, driven primarily by high single-digit gains in both the segments European-based hand tools business and Asia Pacific operations and a double-digit increase in the segment's Power Tools operations. These sales increases were partially offset by a mid-single-digit decline in sales to customers in critical industries, primarily reflecting lower sales to the military and to customers in the oil and gas sector.
Gross profit in the C&I group of $109.5 million in the quarter decreased $2.3 million from 2014 levels, while the gross margin of 37.9% improved 50 basis points, principally due to savings from RCI initiatives and lower restructuring costs.
Operating expenses of $68.2 million in the quarter decreased $2.8 million from 2014 levels. And the operating expense margin of 23.6% improved 10 basis points from 23.7% last year.
As a result of these factors, operating earnings for the C&I segment of $41.3 million, including $2.9 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased $0.5 million from 2014 levels. And the operating margin of 14.3% improved 60 basis points.
Turning now to Slide 8. Third quarter sales in the Snap-on Tools Group of $380.6 million increased 11% organically, reflecting continued double-digit gains in both the company's U.S. and international franchise operations.
Gross profit of $166.5 million in the quarter increased $11.7 million from 2014 levels. And the gross margin of 43.8% improved 20 basis points. Benefits from the higher sales and savings from RCI initiatives were largely offset by 110 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects.
Operating expenses of $110.2 million in the quarter increased $4.9 million from 2014 levels. And the operating expense margin of 29% improved 70 basis points, principally due to sales volume leverage.
As a result of these factors, operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $56.3 million increased $6.8 million. And the operating margin of 14.8% improved 90 basis points, including $6.8 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects.
Turning to the Repair Systems & Information or RS&I group shown on Slide 9. Sales of $282.9 million in the quarter increased 8.2% organically. The organic sales increase primarily reflects a double-digit gain in sales to OEM dealerships, a high single-digit increase in sales of undercar equipment and a mid-single-digit gain in sales of diagnostics and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers.
Gross profit of $130.9 million increased $3.6 million over 2014 levels. Gross margin of 46.3% in the quarter decreased 60 basis points from 46.9% last year, primarily due to a shift in sales that included higher volumes of lower gross margin products, including increased essential tool and [indiscernible] sales to OEM dealerships, partially offset by lower restructuring costs.
Operating expenses of $61.2 million in the quarter decreased $2.8 million from 2014 levels. The operating expense margin of 21.7% improved 190 basis points, mostly due to sales volume leverage, including benefits from the sales shift noted above.
Third quarter operating earnings for the RS&I group of $69.7 million, including $2.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased $6.4 million from prior year levels. And the operating margin of 24.6% improved 130 basis points.
Now turning to Slide 10. In the third quarter, operating earnings from Financial Services of $43.5 million and revenue of $61.1 million compared with operating earnings of $37.7 million on revenue of $53.6 million last year. The average yield on finance receivables of 17.9% in the quarter compared with 17.6% last year. And the average yield on contract receivables was 9.5% in both years. 
Originations of $257.6 million increased 16.2% from 2014 levels.
Moving to Slide 11. As of quarter end, our balance sheet includes $1.53 billion of gross financing receivables, including $1.33 billion from our U.S. Snap-on Credit operation. Approximately 80% of our U.S. financing portfolio relates to extended credit loans to technicians. During the quarter, our worldwide finance portfolio grew approximately $62 million. As for finance portfolio losses and delinquency trends, these continue to be in line with our expectations.
Now turning to Slide 12. Cash provided by operations of $113.7 million in the quarter increased $25.7 million from comparable 2014 levels, primarily reflecting higher net earnings in 2015 and net changes in operating assets and liabilities.
Net cash used by investing activities of $86.9 million included $55.9 million to fund a net increase in finance receivables. Third quarter capital expenditures of $18.5 million in 2015 compared to $22.3 million last year. Cash used in investing activities in the quarter also included $13.1 million for the acquisition of Ecotechnics.
Turning to Slide 13. Days sales outstanding for trade receivables were 61 days of both quarter end and 2014 year-end. Inventories increased $52.2 million from 2014 year-end levels, primarily to support continued higher customer demand and new product introductions as well as inventories related to the Ecotechnics acquisition. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of $3.4 million compared with $3.6 million turns a year ago.
Our quarter end cash position of $119.2 million decreased $13.7 million from 2014 year-end levels. The net decrease includes the impact of funding $629.2 million of new finance receivables, the repurchase of 670,000 shares for $101.6 million, dividend payments of $92.5 million and capital expenditures of $64.3 million. These cash decreases were largely offset by $476.6 million of cash from collections of finance receivables, $352.1 million of cash from operations net of $30 million of discretionary cash contribution to the company's domestic pension plans and $39.7 million of cash proceeds from stock purchase and option plan exercises.
Our net debt to capital ratio of 27 -- 25.7% compared with 26.3% at 2014 year-end. In addition to our $119.2 million of cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $700 million in available credit facilities and our current short-term credit ratings allow us access to the commercial paper markets.
At quarter end, we had $45.2 million of commercial paper borrowings outstanding.
This concludes my remarks on our third quarter performance. I'll now briefly review a few outlook guidance for the balance of 2015.
We anticipate that capital expenditures in 2015 will be in the range of $80 million to $85 million, of which $64.3 million was incurred through the end of the third quarter. We continue to expect our 2015 full year effective income tax rate would be at or below our 2014 full year rate of 32.1%.
Now I'll turn the call over to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick?"

Sales up organically 7.3% against some significant headwinds. Of course, as we say often,there will always be headwinds, always be challenges but in the midst of that, we believe our runways for growth are wide with abundant opportunities and you can see it in the operating groups. C&I, in the center of the turbulence, sales up 3.4%, profit's up 60 basis points. RS&I, wielding software and hardware with repair shop owners and managers, activity rising 8.2% and OI margin of 24.6%, up 130 basis points. Tools, an established and storied business, reaching higher, capturing more customers, sales up 11% and a greater than 6% increase in 21 of the last 22 quarters, OI margin up 90 basis points despite 120 basis points of unfavorable currency. And beside that growth, we see the effects of Snap-on Value Creation paving our runways for improving, helping to drive our opco margin to 17.5%, up 130 basis points, including 50 basis points of currency headwind. And rolling all together with Financial Services, our EPS was $1.98, up 12.5%.
We believe that the third quarter results, extending our positive trends, continuing confirmation of the Snap-on possibilities for both growth and for improvement. And we believe, we -- we believe, as demonstrated this past quarter, we can continue on those positive runways as we proceed forward.
Now before I turn the call over to the operator for questions, I think it's appropriate to speak to our franchisees and associates. I know many of you are listening in again. The encouraging results of the third quarter and our positive trends are a direct reflection of your capability and your effort. For the gains you've achieved, you have my congratulations. And for your commitment and your extraordinary contribution to our team, you have my thanks.
Now I'll turn the call over to the operator. Operator?"

But I think structurally the whole automotive repair business has got a nice tailwind in terms of changes in vehicles. And in fact, as you have more vehicles that want to do more things automatically, self-driving and so on, the precision of calibration becomes more and more important. And therefore, the more accuracy and -- more accuracy, things like alignment become more important. Therefore the speed of that alignment becomes important, therefore the need for new product. And so I think it's nice times for automotive repair in general and, in particular, for undercar equipment. And I think ours is being pushed by both that tailwind and some nice new products that's in place as well."

You can see it, I'm sure you've looked at the trends, and you can see that, I think the numbers are something like somewhere under 50% of cars today require -- in all garages,, require diagnostic -- repairs in all garages require diagnostics units, but something like 7 of 10 repairs in new cars require diagnostics unit.

All you can say is, look, the general macro is going to create an overhang, how well we do in offsetting it is another question but we do have the ability to offset it from time to time. Like in this quarter, we felt -- we feel when we look at industrial, when we look at critical industry, we feel we can see the trajectory of upward trends even though it was a tepid quarter. It was a drag on us this time because we can see the gains in railroad in places like mining and heavy duty. So we can see the proof of concept working through. It's hard for us to give you any guidance on that. In Asia Pacific, for example, the turbulence around Asia Pacific did really create an overhang for us, but we succeeded in some markets and had some difficulty in others. Our operations and our sales in both those markets ended up being a growth situation. In Europe, it seems like and I think what's worked for us in Europe is we came from such a low position. We kept investing. We create new product that we're growing even as the market is tepid. So it's kind of a cocktail of things, and I can't quite give you any particular macro on which to trend.

So the bits and the bytes and the metal and the mechanisms, we sell more of that, we are happy. We are encouraged by that. So even in C&I, which was down that, 3.4% organic is what we follow because that looks to us to be customer gain. That's one. Two is, is that what you see in this situation is, what I'm talking about, when I'm talking about RCI, I'm talking about things like being able to make the product less expensively. We reduce the setup times in the factory which is a big deal for us. We find ways through customer connection and our innovation process to wield new technologies that allow us to develop new product cheaper. Remember, in C&I, for example, last year in aviation we brought -- last year in oil and gas, I think, we -- our heavy truck, let's say, we brought 859 new products, in aviation was 996 and one of the things that allows us to make -- to do that better is to -- is new technology like 3D printing and finite element analysis and so on. And that's cut cost and the design cycle allows us to bring out those new products with lower cost than before. Those are the kinds of things we do and even if we -- so even if we have lower as reported revenues, our cost gets driven down because of some of that. And it doesn't happen every quarter. It happens, if I reduce the cost of one particular product, well maybe that product sells well this quarter and I get some good benefit out of it. That may not sell so well next quarter, and I don't quite get the same benefit."

But when you step back and look at the trend of everything, it really is, there is a lot of noise from quarter-to-quarter. You kind of got to look back. And if you look at 3 quarters, you'll see it's pretty close to the same between Tools Group growth and originations pretty close to the same as you say the Tools Group did big-ticket grew faster, it makes sense."

And so we figured it was the most critical of industries, we invested in its bigger. If you take our revenues, which is somewhere north of 450 or something like that, let's say, and you divide them by 6 and you take one of the bigger ones, that would be the military. And oil and gas will be more in the middle some place. So that helps. I think that should give you some ballpark view of this.

And so you can say, all right, it impacted some, but maybe not much but, okay, we had that transition going on in SOLUS group and so on. Maybe arithmetically it's ineffective. But down there, we had some turbulence. And so then the big difference there now is we're starting at 17.5. So I mean, I wouldn't expect it to be worse than that deterioration. The other factor I'd offer is this, is 2 factors. One, is I believe we are stronger in our market positions, therefore even more resistant, number one. Number two -- number three, and this is harder to predict. Last time, our customer base, which was principally the 70% of customer base, the automotive repair technician, I spent a lot of time talking about the fact that they were cash rich and confidence poor. They were getting up every day and reading bad news for breakfast. It was the worst recession of our lifetime. People were talking about putting dollars in mattresses. Well, I'm not sure and so therefore, they didn't buy big-ticket items even though they had a lot of cash. That would happen again, but I'm not sure it would be the same extent. I don't know. That's a judgment call, of course. And we're more experienced in RCI than we were. And the other thing is we are just better at RCI and so we'd probably step that up -- if you can't -- you only have 24 hours in a day, so you can't if you think the prospects for growth are less, you turn more toward improvement."

In the third quarter, we again showed progress along our runways for growth and for improvement, and we saw those gains across our operating segments. Organic sales were up 7.3% from last year. Opco operating margin, it reached 17.5%, up 130 basis points. When you add the $43.5 million in operating earnings from Financial Services, up from $37.7 million in 2014, the consolidated operating margin was 21.2%, an increase of 160 basis points. And EPS, EPS was $1.98, up $0.22 or 12.5% from the $1.76 last year. Our reported sales increase was 1.9%, including the impact of unfavorable foreign currency. And in this quarter, that total was $42.6 million, about the same as the second quarter.
Adding the incremental $2.1 million sales from our third quarter acquisition of Ecotechnics, the total reported sales for the period were $821.5 million.
For automotive repair businesses, the environment continues to be favorable. Actually, it's been that way for a while. And our Tools Group and Repair Systems & Information, our RS&I group, are both well positioned to take full advantage. You can see it in the performance. Another quarter of solid gains for both groups, advancing along our runways for growth. 
Clearly, the Tools Group demonstrated enhancements to the franchise network. Gains in all its markets, continuing to take advantage of the opportunities that are so abundant in a changing vehicle fleet, not only in the United States, but in places like the U.K. and Australia.
And RS&I, with strong sales across North America and parts of Europe, double-digit growth in the U.S. and modest gains in Western Europe, offsetting the continuing softness in Eastern Europe and particularly in Russia.
RS&I progress, achieved with independent repair shop owners and managers and with OEM dealerships, advanced by our latest diagnostics and undercar product offerings.
For the Commercial & Industrial or C&I group, we overcame some increased headwinds, with the overall organic sales rise offsetting mixed environments across industries and across geographies.
That said, in the third quarter, our European-based hand tool businesses and our Asia Pacific operations recorded high single-digit gains, overcoming the turbulence within their particular markets.
Now our industrial division did have some headwinds in the period, impacted by weak U.S. Military volume and slowdowns in our oil and gas activity.
We consistently mentioned the uncertainty associated with the military. In the third quarter, that caution materialized, and our results included a double-digit decrease, measured spending and budget constraints making the present tight and the future even more difficult to predict.
Within our natural resources segment, volume in oil and gas was down substantially. You see it in oil prices and you read about it in newspapers and despite our small share and opportunities for penetration, we were impacted. But that said, saying that, will always be headwinds. They've been a factor in other quarters, and they were present in the third quarter and we overcame because we are well-positioned to confront the challenges and proceed down all our runways for growth, enhancing the franchise network, expanding our repairs [indiscernible] and managers, extending the critical industries and building an emerging market. These do represent avenues for advancement, and there has been consistent progress along each of those paths.
At the same time, those growth drivers are joined and supported by the benefits of Snap-on Value Creation, safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and rapid continuous improvement or RCI. These are the processes, the tools we use each and every day to drive improvements, but this quarter we especially benefited from customer connection and innovation.
Customer connection, Snap-on's continuing pursuit of understanding of work derived from the hours and the days we spend with professionals.
Innovation, taking that practical insight and matching it with the possibilities of modern technology. And in the quarter, those processes resulted in more prestigious product awards for the Corporation. We are again honored with 2 MOTOR Magazine top 20 tool awards. The winners this time, our 3/8-inch drive steering rack socket and our SOLUS EDGE diagnostic handheld. 
Let's talk about the steering rack socket. The S6229 was developed from a customer connection drive from direct observation award and from conversations with multiple technicians. This innovative tool allows the tech to replace power steering O-rings without removing the whole steering assembly, saving up to an hour of labor, clearly making work easier and professional repair more productive.
In addition, also created a deep insight in the repair process, the innovative SOLUS Edge, coverage for hundreds of vehicle systems, including hybrid TPMS, steering and clean diesel. And it all comes loaded with our fast-track troubleshooter database with its vehicle-specific tips, tests and timesavers. The SOLUS Edge enhanced coverage -- is enhanced coverage for over 40 car makes without the cost or complexity of factory scan tools. And for all its power, for all its strength, it's easy to use. The large 8-inch touchscreen displays an aid to visibility and the software provides accurate results in as little as 30 seconds. Quick. 
I mentioned these awards because they're just the most recent recognitions of a growing list of very popular products that provide unique advantages, created by the observations of our franchisees and direct sales people who are committed to translating that insight into productivity innovation. And that broad value creation is reflected in the positive results registered across all our operating groups again this quarter.
Now let's focus on those individual groups. Starting with Commercial & Industrial. Organic sales were up 3.4%. Operating margins reached 14.3%, up 60 basis points from last year's 13.7%. Growth along with the benefits of Snap-on Value Creation. Now I said, as we said, there are headwinds. But our industrial direct salesmen have been expanding their reach nevertheless into sectors like railroads, up double digits, growing our presence, offering a wider variety of tools and tool control solutions. We've spoken in the past about building our understanding of work in critical industries, expanding our customer connection. One way that's happening is by using our experience in RCI, participating in customer lean events, participating in the customer-sponsored lean events. Our team was able to assist in improving railroad operations while at the same time gaining a better understanding of the work processes, their product requirements, their business needs and the overall industry direction, all key customer connections gained through lean event participation.
One of the tools conceived from those insights was our special extendable line of 2 wrenches, great for heavy duty work on railroad cars and tracks. Made in our Elizabeth and Tennessee plants, these 2 wrenches replace the traditional slugging wrenches in railroad application, allowing the operator better access, eliminating the need for costly 2 persons slugging procedures and making work easier, safer and more productive.
Let's speak about SNA Europe. Now 8 quarters in a row of year-over-year growth, navigating through some of the most difficult geographies and tepid economies. SNA Europe activities continues to be encouraged -- activity continues to be encouraging. But its profits -- its profits, are even more positive, now up significantly for 10 straight quarters. And we believe there is much more room for further gain.
And related to our Asia Pacific operations, the environments are mixed, but we had overall gains with upward movement in places like Thailand, Indonesia and Vietnam. Nice to -- actually it's nice to see progress in that in Vietnam, that emerging Southeast Asian nation.
So that provides a bit of color on C&I.
Now onto the Tools Group. Organic sales up 11% -- 11%. Significant growth in the U.S. and internationally. Operating income, $56.3 million compared to $49.5 million in 2014. Operating income margins were up 14.8%, rose 90 basis points from last year's 13.9%. The additional volume as well as operating improvements for -- from RCI translated into significant margin improvement in that 90 basis point gain, overcame 120 basis points of negative currency. When you consider the Tools Group success, you see the power of Snap-on Value Creation and the benefits of our award-winning innovative new products. Beside the MOTOR Top 20 award, the Tools Group also received recognition from the readers of Professional Tool & Equipment News, gaining 5 people's choice selections for new tool innovations, products, once again borne of the intersection between customer connection insight and Advanced Technology wielded by our innovation teams. Products like the KRL 72-inch roll cab with its power tool organizer system, the powerful and light CT8850 18-volt Cordless impact wrench. The new -- our new brake caliper press, our new advanced battery system tester with its print capability and our new double [indiscernible] full view welding helmet, all selected by the readers of P10  magazine and by our technician customers as great new products, products that make work easier and products that provide further evidence of Snap-on innovation.
You might remember that the third quarter is also when we hold the annual Snap-on franchisee conference, our SFC. This year it was in Washington DC with more than 8,000 attendees, franchise and family members from over 3,000 routes , 3 days of showcasing the opportunities to enhance the franchise channel, to amplify the power of our advanced space and of our franchisees' time. And based on the optimism and the confidence of our franchisees, it was a strong success. And by the way, orders were up once again, beating the record level achieved in 2014.
When we speak of the van channel, we also have to consider the strategic -- very strategic contributions of Snap-on Credit. Our Financial Services arm helps create opportunities across our organization but especially within the Tools Group. And credit has a strong presence at the SFC, supporting franchises with unique programs, enabling sales of those big ticket items which are so essential to franchisee success. And in the third quarter, Financial Services OI was up $5.8 million or 15.4%, another period of powerful contribution to the organization.
Let's move to RS&I. Organic sales were up 8.2%. The operating margin, up 24.6%. It increased 130 basis points from 23.3% just last year. RS&I was charged with expanding our presence to repair shop owners and managers and in the quarter, it did just that. We once again had growth in our businesses providing repair, information and diagnostics independence. In fact, we appear to be gaining traction across many dimensions, in automotive and medium and in heavy duty garages, serving both OEM dealerships as well as those independent shops, all fueled by our expanding product offerings. And one of those great RS&I products came from our diagnostics division.
Demonstrating its continuing innovation, our diagnostics team launched its new VERUS edge handheld, an enhanced top-of-the-line offering, thinner, lighter, including important features like 5-second, ready-to-use capability, 5-hour battery life, a solid state hard drive for increased durability and, of course, access to our unique integrated SureTrack real-world fixes based on masses of actual repair data, all features guided by effective customer connection inputs.
In the VERUS Edge, we believe we have a winner, advancing the state-of-the-art and addressing the most serious of repair challenges. And initial sales are breaking records and exceeding our expectations.
Also in the third quarter and with a focus on heavy-duty shops, RS&I introduced the latest generation of its proprietary vehicle interface, the NEXIQ USB-Link 2, now with Wi-Fi connectivity. It extends our leading position by adding wireless capabilities to the already successful family of NEXIQ heavy-duty diagnostics products. The USB-Link 2 is compatible with heavy-duty diagnostic applications for engines, transmission, ABS and instrument clusters and much more. It supports virtually every standardized vehicle network protocol in nearly every software application and vehicle sectors like construction, agriculture and, of course, heavy-duty truck. 5x the speed of its predecessors with 16x the memory, the USB-Link 2 is perfect for dealership, fleets and truck shops. It speeds the repair times of these particularly mission-critical vehicles, and it improves technician productivity. It's a great upgrade to an already successful product from our RS&I group.
Also in the third quarter, our equipment division registered high single-digit growth with strong volume in North America, helping to offset the Russian market, which is our primary headwind in Eastern Europe. Overall, undercar gains in the U.S. were quite solid, with especially impressive increased sales, increases at our Challenger Lifts division.
Challenger has been a great addition to our Snap-on team and it proves that again this quarter, and we believe there is much more to come helping RS&I to expand with repair shop owners and managers.
RS&I, great new product, with demonstrated growth in diagnostics, heavy duty and undercar equipment, and all that played out in the third quarter results.
Well, that's the highlights of our quarter. Organic sales, up 7.3%. Gains across all groups. Clear progress along our runways for growth. Snap-on Value Creation at the forefront of our activities. Customer connection leading to innovation, creating powerful new product, RCI driving improvement and it all shows in the results. OI margin to 17.5%, up 130 basis points. It was an encouraging quarter.

Net sales of $821.5 million in the quarter were up 7.3% organically. On a reported basis, net sales including $42.6 million of unfavorable foreign currency increased 1.9%. As you know, Snap-on has significant international operations and is subject to foreign currency fluctuations. Largely due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, foreign currency movements adversely impacted our Q3 sales comparisons by 570 basis points.
Net sales in the third quarter also included $2.1 million of sales from our July 2015 acquisition of Ecotechnics, a designer and manufacturer of automatic vehicle air conditioning maintenance equipment for OEM dealerships and independent repair shops.
Consolidated gross profit of $406.9 million increased $13 million from 2014 levels, primarily due to higher sales and savings from RCI initiatives, partially offset by 30 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects.
The gross margin of 49.5% in the quarter improved 60 basis points from 48.9% a year ago.
Operating expenses were $263.3 million in both the third quarters of 2015 and 2014. The operating expense margin of 32% improved 70 basis points from 2014 levels, primarily due to benefits from sales volume leverage, partially offset by higher pension expense. No restructuring costs were included in operating earnings in the third quarter of 2015. 
Last year, we incurred $2 million of such costs.
As a result of these factors, operating earnings before Financial Services of $143.6 million in the quarter, including $11.9 million or 50 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased 10% and, as a percentage of sales, improved 130 basis points to 17.5%.
Financial Services revenue of $61.1 million in the quarter increased 14% from 2014 levels and operating earnings of $43.5 million increased 15.4%. These increases primarily reflect the continued growth of the Financial Services portfolio.
Consolidated operating earnings of $187.1 million in the quarter, including $12.7 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased 11.2%. And the operating margin of 21.2% improved 160 basis points from 19.6% a year ago.
Our third quarter effective income tax rate of 31.6% compared with 31.8% last year.
Finally, net earnings of $116.8 million or $1.98 per diluted share increased $13.1 million or $0.22 per share, representing a 12.5% increase in diluted earnings per share.
Now let's turn to our segment results. Starting with the Commercial & industrial or C&I group on Slide 7, sales of $288.5 million in the quarter were up 3.4% organically, driven primarily by high single-digit gains in both the segments European-based hand tools business and Asia Pacific operations and a double-digit increase in the segment's Power Tools operations. These sales increases were partially offset by a mid-single-digit decline in sales to customers in critical industries, primarily reflecting lower sales to the military and to customers in the oil and gas sector.
Gross profit in the C&I group of $109.5 million in the quarter decreased $2.3 million from 2014 levels, while the gross margin of 37.9% improved 50 basis points, principally due to savings from RCI initiatives and lower restructuring costs.
Operating expenses of $68.2 million in the quarter decreased $2.8 million from 2014 levels. And the operating expense margin of 23.6% improved 10 basis points from 23.7% last year.
As a result of these factors, operating earnings for the C&I segment of $41.3 million, including $2.9 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased $0.5 million from 2014 levels. And the operating margin of 14.3% improved 60 basis points.
Turning now to Slide 8. Third quarter sales in the Snap-on Tools Group of $380.6 million increased 11% organically, reflecting continued double-digit gains in both the company's U.S. and international franchise operations.
Gross profit of $166.5 million in the quarter increased $11.7 million from 2014 levels. And the gross margin of 43.8% improved 20 basis points. Benefits from the higher sales and savings from RCI initiatives were largely offset by 110 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects.
Operating expenses of $110.2 million in the quarter increased $4.9 million from 2014 levels. And the operating expense margin of 29% improved 70 basis points, principally due to sales volume leverage.
As a result of these factors, operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $56.3 million increased $6.8 million. And the operating margin of 14.8% improved 90 basis points, including $6.8 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects.
Turning to the Repair Systems & Information or RS&I group shown on Slide 9. Sales of $282.9 million in the quarter increased 8.2% organically. The organic sales increase primarily reflects a double-digit gain in sales to OEM dealerships, a high single-digit increase in sales of undercar equipment and a mid-single-digit gain in sales of diagnostics and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers.
Gross profit of $130.9 million increased $3.6 million over 2014 levels. Gross margin of 46.3% in the quarter decreased 60 basis points from 46.9% last year, primarily due to a shift in sales that included higher volumes of lower gross margin products, including increased essential tool and [indiscernible] sales to OEM dealerships, partially offset by lower restructuring costs.
Operating expenses of $61.2 million in the quarter decreased $2.8 million from 2014 levels. The operating expense margin of 21.7% improved 190 basis points, mostly due to sales volume leverage, including benefits from the sales shift noted above.
Third quarter operating earnings for the RS&I group of $69.7 million, including $2.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased $6.4 million from prior year levels. And the operating margin of 24.6% improved 130 basis points.
Now turning to Slide 10. In the third quarter, operating earnings from Financial Services of $43.5 million and revenue of $61.1 million compared with operating earnings of $37.7 million on revenue of $53.6 million last year. The average yield on finance receivables of 17.9% in the quarter compared with 17.6% last year. And the average yield on contract receivables was 9.5% in both years. 
Originations of $257.6 million increased 16.2% from 2014 levels.
Moving to Slide 11. As of quarter end, our balance sheet includes $1.53 billion of gross financing receivables, including $1.33 billion from our U.S. Snap-on Credit operation. Approximately 80% of our U.S. financing portfolio relates to extended credit loans to technicians. During the quarter, our worldwide finance portfolio grew approximately $62 million. As for finance portfolio losses and delinquency trends, these continue to be in line with our expectations.
Now turning to Slide 12. Cash provided by operations of $113.7 million in the quarter increased $25.7 million from comparable 2014 levels, primarily reflecting higher net earnings in 2015 and net changes in operating assets and liabilities.
Net cash used by investing activities of $86.9 million included $55.9 million to fund a net increase in finance receivables. Third quarter capital expenditures of $18.5 million in 2015 compared to $22.3 million last year. Cash used in investing activities in the quarter also included $13.1 million for the acquisition of Ecotechnics.
Turning to Slide 13. Days sales outstanding for trade receivables were 61 days of both quarter end and 2014 year-end. Inventories increased $52.2 million from 2014 year-end levels, primarily to support continued higher customer demand and new product introductions as well as inventories related to the Ecotechnics acquisition. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of $3.4 million compared with $3.6 million turns a year ago.
Our quarter end cash position of $119.2 million decreased $13.7 million from 2014 year-end levels. The net decrease includes the impact of funding $629.2 million of new finance receivables, the repurchase of 670,000 shares for $101.6 million, dividend payments of $92.5 million and capital expenditures of $64.3 million. These cash decreases were largely offset by $476.6 million of cash from collections of finance receivables, $352.1 million of cash from operations net of $30 million of discretionary cash contribution to the company's domestic pension plans and $39.7 million of cash proceeds from stock purchase and option plan exercises.
Our net debt to capital ratio of 27 -- 25.7% compared with 26.3% at 2014 year-end. In addition to our $119.2 million of cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $700 million in available credit facilities and our current short-term credit ratings allow us access to the commercial paper markets.
At quarter end, we had $45.2 million of commercial paper borrowings outstanding.
This concludes my remarks on our third quarter performance. I'll now briefly review a few outlook guidance for the balance of 2015.
We anticipate that capital expenditures in 2015 will be in the range of $80 million to $85 million, of which $64.3 million was incurred through the end of the third quarter. We continue to expect our 2015 full year effective income tax rate would be at or below our 2014 full year rate of 32.1%.
Now I'll turn the call over to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick?"

Sales up organically 7.3% against some significant headwinds. Of course, as we say often, there will always be headwinds, always be challenges but in the midst of that, we believe our runways for growth are wide with abundant opportunities and you can see it in the operating groups. C&I, in the center of the turbulence, sales up 3.4%, profit's up 60 basis points. RS&I, wielding software and hardware with repair shop owners and managers, activity rising 8.2% and OI margin of 24.6%, up 130 basis points. Tools, an established and storied business, reaching higher, capturing more customers, sales up 11% and a greater than 6% increase in 21 of the last 22 quarters, OI margin up 90 basis points despite 120 basis points of unfavorable currency. And beside that growth, we see the effects of Snap-on Value Creation paving our runways for improving, helping to drive our opco margin to 17.5%, up 130 basis points, including 50 basis points of currency headwind. And rolling all together with Financial Services, our EPS was $1.98, up 12.5%.
We believe that the third quarter results, extending our positive trends, continuing confirmation of the Snap-on possibilities for both growth and for improvement. And we believe, we -- we believe, as demonstrated this past quarter, we can continue on those positive runways as we proceed forward.
Now before I turn the call over to the operator for questions, I think it's appropriate to speak to our franchisees and associates. I know many of you are listening in again. The encouraging results of the third quarter and our positive trends are a direct reflection of your capability and your effort. For the gains you've achieved, you have my congratulations. And for your commitment and your extraordinary contribution to our team, you have my thanks.

But I think structurally the whole automotive repair business has got a nice tailwind in terms of changes in vehicles.

And therefore, the more accuracy and -- more accuracy, things like alignment become more important. Therefore the speed of that alignment becomes important, therefore the need for new product. And so I think it's nice times for automotive repair in general and, in particular, for undercar equipment.

You can see it, I'm sure you've looked at the trends, and you can see that, I think the numbers are something like somewhere under 50% of cars today require -- in all garages,, require diagnostic -- repairs in all garages require diagnostics units, but something like 7 of 10 repairs in new cars require diagnostics unit.

Actually, C&I, if you go back and you look at the late 2013, the critical industries again was bedeviled by a reduction associated with the military, and that was directly associated with the word sequestration. And so you're starting to see those kinds of things now and Washington people talking about government shutdowns and so on, and it's making the military nervous and they're spending less.

What we know is the industry problems, the economic environments create an overhang. And then in places like for us and you see it in oil and gas this time, you can see it in mining, although mining was a contributory for us. So it's very difficult to look at any macro and say it's going to affect us. All you can say is, look, the general macro is going to create an overhang, how well we do in offsetting it is another question but we do have the ability to offset it from time to time. Like in this quarter, we felt -- we feel when we look at industrial, when we look at critical industry, we feel we can see the trajectory of upward trends even though it was a tepid quarter. It was a drag on us this time because we can see the gains in railroad in places like mining and heavy duty. So we can see the proof of concept working through. It's hard for us to give you any guidance on that. In Asia Pacific, for example, the turbulence around Asia Pacific did really create an overhang for us, but we succeeded in some markets and had some difficulty in others. Our operations and our sales in both those markets ended up being a growth situation. In Europe, it seems like and I think what's worked for us in Europe is we came from such a low position. We kept investing. We create new product that we're growing even as the market is tepid. So it's kind of a cocktail of things, and I can't quite give you any particular macro on which to trend. All I can tell you is I think we feel progress in each of those places."

We actually had a pretty good quarter with those in places like Singapore and Hong Kong. And the equipment actually was one of the things that drove us into Vietnam. We're actually pretty pleased about Vietnam. I have been waiting for Vietnam to give us some daylight for some time, and this is the quarter which has kind of worked. So it was an encouraging event."

Of course, there are headwinds and they might impact us, and I never said we would keep going -- marching upward every quarter, it's almost impossible for anybody to do that, although we have. And so we just believe in the future of extending the critical industries, enhancing the van channel, expanding the repair shop margins in emerging markets. So we keep investing in it."

So let me reconcile this. It seems as though there has been some cost-cutting. I'm looking specifically at the C&I segment. We had a negative 5% incremental margin.

First of all, we view, you may not like this either, but we view, as reported sales as arithmetic, organic sales are up for us. So the bits and the bytes and the metal and the mechanisms, we sell more of that, we are happy. We are encouraged by that. So even in C&I, which was down that, 3.4% organic is what we follow because that looks to us to be customer gain. That's one. Two is, is that what you see in this situation is, what I'm talking about, when I'm talking about RCI, I'm talking about things like being able to make the product less expensively. We reduce the setup times in the factory which is a big deal for us. We find ways through customer connection and our innovation process to wield new technologies that allow us to develop new product cheaper. Remember, in C&I, for example, last year in aviation we brought -- last year in oil and gas, I think, we -- our heavy truck, let's say, we brought 859 new products, in aviation was 996 and one of the things that allows us to make -- to do that better is to -- is new technology like 3D printing and finite element analysis and so on. And that's cut cost and the design cycle allows us to bring out those new products with lower cost than before. Those are the kinds of things we do and even if we -- so even if we have lower as reported revenues, our cost gets driven down because of some of that. And it doesn't happen every quarter. It happens, if I reduce the cost of one particular product, well maybe that product sells well this quarter and I get some good benefit out of it. That may not sell so well next quarter, and I don't quite get the same benefit."

And you also got an SFC that flows through this, so in originations are things like loans that go through for franchisees themselves, van loans and things like that, that occur.

But when you step back and look at the trend of everything, it really is, there is a lot of noise from quarter-to-quarter. You kind of got to look back. And if you look at 3 quarters, you'll see it's pretty close to the same between Tools Group growth and originations pretty close to the same as you say the Tools Group did big-ticket grew faster, it makes sense."

Just as I said before, when the bullets are flying overhead, I can assure you, this from personal experience, when the bullets are flying overhead people kind of want to make sure things work. And so we figured it was the most critical of industries, we invested in its bigger. If you take our revenues, which is somewhere north of 450 or something like that, let's say, and you divide them by 6 and you take one of the bigger ones, that would be the military. And oil and gas will be more in the middle some place. So that helps. I think that should give you some ballpark view of this.

And that was --  the 9.9 was, I would say, artificially depressed by the fact that we had the credit company in transition, somewhat, not huge, but that's a factor there a little bit. And so you can say, all right, it impacted some, but maybe not much but, okay, we had that transition going on in SOLUS group and so on. Maybe arithmetically it's ineffective. But down there, we had some turbulence. And so then the big difference there now is we're starting at 17.5. So I mean, I wouldn't expect it to be worse than that deterioration. The other factor I'd offer is this, is 2 factors. One, is I believe we are stronger in our market positions, therefore even more resistant, number one. Number two -- number three, and this is harder to predict. Last time, our customer base, which was principally the 70% of customer base, the automotive repair technician, I spent a lot of time talking about the fact that they were cash rich and confidence poor. They were getting up every day and reading bad news for breakfast. It was the worst recession of our lifetime. People were talking about putting dollars in mattresses. Well, I'm not sure and so therefore, they didn't buy big-ticket items even though they had a lot of cash. That would happen again, but I'm not sure it would be the same extent. I don't know. That's a judgment call, of course. And we're more experienced in RCI than we were. And the other thing is we are just better at RCI and so we'd probably step that up -- if you can't -- you only have 24 hours in a day, so you can't if you think the prospects for growth are less, you turn more toward improvement."
