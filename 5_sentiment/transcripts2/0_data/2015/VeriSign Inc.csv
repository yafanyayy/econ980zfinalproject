Our fourth quarter and full year 2014 results were in line with our objective of offering security and stability to our customers, while generating profitable growth and providing long-term value to our shareholders. 
During 2014, VeriSign delivered strong financial performance, including reporting $1,010,000,000 in revenue, expanding free cash flow to $568 million and producing full year non-GAAP operating margins of 60.2%. 
Exceeding $1 billion marks a significant growth and an important milestone since the completion of our divestiture program in 2010, a year in which we reported $681 million in revenues. 
Operationally, 2014 was another strong year for the company. VeriSign processed 34 million new domain name registrations and finished the year with 130.6 million names in the domain name base. 
During the year, we marked more than 17 years of uninterrupted availability of the. com and .net domain name systems. 
As part of managing our business, during the fourth quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 3.7 million shares for $209 million. 
During the full year 2014, we repurchased 16.3 million shares for $867 million. 
Effective January 30, 2015, the Board of Directors increased the amount of VeriSign common stock authorized for repurchase by approximately $453 million to a total of $1 billion authorized and available under the share buyback program, which has no expiration. 
Our balance sheet remains strong with $1.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. 
Our strategic framework to protect, grow and manage the business continues to serve us well as we see operational and financial benefits from our focus and discipline. 
We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases. 
As you recall, one way VeriSign participated in ICANN's new gTLD program was by applying for internationalized domain name transliterations of .com and .net, as well as .verisign and .com sec. 
We have signed the registry agreements for. com and 11 IDN TLDs, 8 of which are transliterations of .com and 3 are transliterations of .net. 
While these registry agreements with ICANN are signed before these domains become generally available, a few more steps remain, including delegation, controlled interruption, which deals with potential name collisions, completion of the a sunrise period and finalization and approval of our launch plans. The period to gain approval, if required, could delay a general availability dates or could result in VeriSign having to revise our go-to-market strategy for the IDNs. 
I'll comment now on fourth quarter operating highlights. At the end of December, the domain name based in .com and .net was 130.6 million, consisting of 115.6 million names for .com and 15 million names for .net.  This represents an increase of 2.7% year-over-year. 
In the fourth quarter, we added 0.59 million net names to the domain names after processing 8.2 million new gross registrations. In a few moments, George will discuss an update we intend to make the definition of the domain name base, which will start in the fourth quarter of 2015. 
In the third quarter of 2014, the renewal rate was 72% compared with 72.7% for the third quarter of 2013. While renewal and rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the fourth quarter of 2014 will be approximately 72.4%. 
This rate compares to 72.2% achieved in the fourth quarter of 2013. 
As we discussed over the last few quarters, there are many factors that drive domain growth. These include Internet adoption, economic and eCommerce activity and changes in register to our go-to-market strategies. 
Also, as we have discussed in previous calls, renewal rates for first time renewing names have been softer impacting the overall renewal rate. This change is influenced by a number of factors, including search engine algorithm changes, growth in geographies with lower first time renewal rates, previous year registrar promotions, as well as other factors. 
Net name additions during the fourth quarter came in below our expectations, primarily due to fewer gross additions. Some of the gross additions strength we saw during the third quarter, which was coming from emerging markets, including China, did not continue the same -- at the same growth rate during the fourth quarter. 
Based on these factors and current trends, we are forecasting first quarter 2015 net additions to the domain name based to be between 1 million and 1.5 million names. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to George."

During the fourth quarter, we generated revenue of $256 million, up 4.2% year-over-year and delivered GAAP operating income of $142 million, up 9% from $130 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. 
The GAAP operating margin in the quarter came to 55.6% compared to 53% in the same quarter a year ago. 
GAAP net income totaled $65 million compared to $292 million a year earlier, which produced diluted GAAP earnings per share of $0.48 in the fourth quarter this year compared to $0.194 in the fourth quarter last year. 
Fourth quarter 2014 net income was decreased by $26 million and diluted earnings per share decreased by $0.19, primarily due to a non-U.S. income tax charge related to a reorganization of certain international operations and a change in estimates for U.S. income tax charges related to the repatriation of offshore assets in 2014. 
As described, last year, fourth quarter 2013 GAAP results included tax benefits, pretax nonoperating gains and expenses, which collectively increased the net income by approximately $218 million and increased diluted earnings per share by $1.45. 
As of December 31, 2014, the company maintained total assets of $2.2 billion. These assets included $1.4 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of which $486 million were held domestically with the remainder held internationally. 
Total liabilities were $3 billion at the quarter end, down from $3.1 billion a year ago. 
I'll now review some of our key fourth quarter  operating metrics, which are revenue, deferred revenue, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then discuss our 2015 full year guidance. 
As mentioned, revenue totaled $256 million for the fourth quarter, 61% of our revenue was derived from customers in the U.S. and 39% was from international customers. 2014 full year revenue was $1,010,000,000, up 4.7% from full year 2013 revenues. 
Deferred revenue at year-end 2014 totaled $890 million, a $35 million increase from year-end 2013. Fourth quarter non-GAAP operating expense, which excludes $10 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $104 million compared with $101 million in the third quarter of 2014 and $106 million in the same quarter a year ago. 
Non-GAAP operating margin for the fourth quarter was 59.4% compared to 56.9% in the same quarter of 2013. 
Full year 2014 non-GAAP operating margin was 60.2%. 
Non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $95 million, resulting in a non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.70 compared to $0.65 in the fourth quarter of 2013 and $0.70 last quarter. 
Full year 2014 non-GAAP earnings per share was $2.72, a 13% increase over 2013. Non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP nonoperating income net for 2014 was a $77 million expense. 
We had a weighted average diluted share count of 135.9 million shares in the fourth quarter compared to 138.1 million shares in the third quarter. Dilution related to the convertible debentures was 14.7 million shares based on the average share price during the fourth quarter compared with 13.7 million for the same quarter in 2013. 
The share count was reduced by the full effect of third quarter repurchase activity and the weighted effect of 3.7 million shares repurchased during the fourth quarter. 
Operating cash flow was $170 million for the fourth quarter compared to $168 million for the third quarter of 2014 and $147 million for the fourth quarter last year. 
Full year 2014 operating cash flow was $601 million compared with $579 million for 2013. Fourth quarter free cash flow was $159 million, including a use of $9 million in capital expenditures. Free cash flow for 2014 was $568 million, including a net $6 million of excess tax benefits and a use of $39 million in capital expenditures. 
With respect to taxes, we used a tax rate of 28% to calculate our non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share during 2014. 
As we continue to optimize our tax structure, we believe a more reasonable estimate of the tax rate to calculate our non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share going forward is 26%. 
As a result, we expect to use a 26% non-GAAP tax rate when reporting first quarter 2015 and non-GAAP results. 
Also, as we discussed last quarter, we expect our cash tax rate to say stay well below our tax rate use for non-GAAP calculations for at least the next several years. 
In 2015, we expect to pay cash taxes of approximately $35 million to $45 million.  Substantially all of the expected cash taxes in 2015 are international. 
As Jim mentioned, I want to note a change we'll be making to our domain name base definition and reporting starting next quarter. 
Currently, we report our domain name base to you both on our website and during earnings each quarter. The domain name base includes the active zone, which is defined as the names that resolve in the zone, plus the names that are requested to be not configured for use in the top-level domain zone filed by the registrant. 
Historically, there is also been an immaterial portion of names that we manage and for which we are paid that are not included in our domain name base definition.  These names get removed from the active zone primarily by registrars when they place the name on hold status. 
Over the last several years, the average amount of names in the on hold status category has been approximately 400,000 names and the net change year-over-year has been very small. 
While still immaterial, during 2014, we saw an increase in the amount of names registrars have placed on hold status, which appears to be a result of these registrars complying with the new mandated compliance mechanisms in ICANN's 2013 Registrar Accreditation Agreement or RAA. 
In 2014, we saw an increase in domain names placed on hold status from roughly 394,000 names at the end of 2013 to about 870,000 at the end of 2014. 
While the number of these names in total is not material to our overall the domain name base of over 130.6 million domain names, as registrars use of this mechanism has increased, we believe it now make sense to include these names when we report the number of domain names in the domain name base. 
As we are paid for these on hold names, and they have always been included in our reported revenue and gross additions, starting with our first quarter 2015 report, we plan to amend our current definition of our domain name base to include these on hold status names and we'll be consistent in our reporting of prior periods by also including these names for comparative purposes going forward. 
Before our next earnings call, we intend to update the daily reporting on our website to included these names. 
In the meantime, updates to the domain name base are still posted on our website for our current definition at least once per day allowing you to continue to track the domain name base throughout the coming quarter. 
The Q1 net addition guidance Jim gave earlier of 1 million to 1.5 million net name additions is not affected by this new domain name base definition as our quarterly guidance is focused on gross additions and deletions. 
With respect to full year 2015 guidance, revenue for 2015 is expected to be in the range of $1,040,000,000 to $1,060,000,000, representing an annual growth rate of 3% to 5%. 
This revenue range is based on domain name base growth of between 2% and 3.5% for 2015. Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be at least 80%. Full year 2015 non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be between 60% and 62%. Our non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP nonoperating income is expected to be an expense of between $84 million and $90 million for 2015 and includes the continued interest expense accrual on our convertible debentures. 
Capital expenditures for the year are expected to be between $40 million and $50 million. Our guidance is based on expectations about the outlook of our business in addition to our financial projections for interest income and expense. 
In summary, the company continued to demonstrate solid financial performance throughout 2014. We have grown non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP net income. We have maintained a strong balance sheet and expect strong operating cash flow generation to continue as a result of our financial model. 
Now, I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks."

These previous record is due to the expertise of our people and our specialized infrastructure. 
Also, I want to highlight that this quarter marks the 30th anniversaries of both .com and .net. We're proud to be the registry operator of these 2 top-level domains, which are a key component of the Internet infrastructure. 
We drive profitable growth by strengthening and marketing our current service offerings. While we continue to actively invest in the development of new products and services where we continue to make progress, we don't have an update at this time. 
Finally, we have been managing the business effectively as demonstrated by our proven operating margins, improve tax position and by the return of cash to shareholders through share repurchases. 
During 2014, we repurchased 16.3 million shares returning $867 million to shareholders and repatriated $741 million of cash held by our foreign subsidiaries. 
We remain committed to operating the security and stability that are the core of our business and make VeriSign a company with an unparallel DNS service record and a company committed to long-term value creation for our shareholders.

On hold names are simply management mechanism used primarily by registrars to place names into a hold status, which will lose and active zone file and prevent them from resolving. The name, however, is still registered by the registrar regardless of the status. Now these names represent a very small and not material portion of the domain name base. Approximately 400,000 at the start of 2014 and their totals have been relatively constant for many years. I'd also add, however, that registrars uses mechanism -- use of this mechanism have increased during 2014 and as a result, we feel appropriate to amend our definition to include these names going forward. As mentioned at the end of 2014, the names classified with a hold designation totaled about 870,000, which was an increase of about 475,000 in 2014, up from 394,000 at the end of 2013.

As far as commenting on -- I'm sorry, not new gTLDs but in terms of what we may do in promotion, we constantly run regular programs of promotion with the registrars. We use marketing programs to try to drive our resources geographically and through other means. We did recently launched a contest for .com names and a number of other promotions that we're doing. We'll be doing a number of things through the year in recognition of the 30th anniversary of .com in particular.

This is Jim. The marketing plan that Pat alluded to that's a little different, the different Sunrise period, during the Sunrise period, trademark holders are invited to come in and register their marked names prior to general availability. We have what you might call a much more brand friendly sort of Sunrise in the sense that we are reserving the transliteration of the brands that are registered in .com. And so that implies that there'll be a different marketing approach. We'll simply be notifying existing registrants brands that the transliteration of their .com registration is available to them. So it's hard to say, it's not a traditional sort of a marketing effort. I think in general, it means that we are not going to need to go out and promote the availability of these IDN, and so that will certainly do some of that because people are freaked to register whatever they like in them. But the brand holders who are registered in .com have their brand name reserved for them in the IDNs. They're protected against somebody else registering a name, who doesn't own that name. But it's an opportunity for them to have their brand name in the native language script of countries that they operate in. So I think you can see the obvious benefits of that. Putting a price tag on that marketing effort, I think, it's just kind of too early to say what it will be, but it will be focused. It will be more focused because it's quite targeted. It's unique, I think, as part of any TLD that's ever been launched."

People will also have domains that they don't want to have in the general zone, so that they can have the name registered, but not able to resolve, it might be something detrimental to their corporate brand, and they don't want it to be out there. And then the one that we've seen most recently is the 2013 Registrar Correlation Agreement requires registrars to put on hold domain names that they cannot validate who is information. And so that's where we've seen the largest trend these days in terms of what the growth is in those particular hold names. Now once they do validate down who is data, those names come out of the whole status, and then of course be active at that point in time."

For example, something that is not bothering about a corporate name. A corporation may defensively registered that, they simply don't want it to resolve. We gave get paid for it, but it doesn't appear in the act, it doesn't appear in the active zone. You can think of these holdings are going to treat them up together with these dark domains very similarly. So we'll get paid for them, but you'll see them reported in our domain name base, they'll be counted in there. The other thing is that George mentioned this new 2013 registrar accreditation agreement. This is the new agreement that the registrars signed with ICANN that they operate under. Now the number of accredited registrars is, I think, closer to 1500 today where it was 900 some years ago. So I think -- I hope what we're seeing here just to keep everything simple is that all of them have pretty much signed us during 2014. And I think almost all of the registrars have signed a large number of them. So I think there's just this initial sort of compliance effort. Pat mentioned that they have to collect who is data. This also means that some registers that do not have direct distribution models, who actually sell indirectly through distributions may find it a little more difficult or may find that it takes more time to collect accurate who is data. And so these names will get put on hold while they go up doing that, and then eventually they come off hold, and then they're up here and active zone. So that's sort of activity that goes on. But if you understand how dark domains have worked and been counted, these are just like that. You can now think of these names on hold just like that."

Again, that's an emerging market. As those markets mature, I would expect those renewal rates to improve, but it's a large market that's growing and it's still emerging.

Our fourth quarter and full year 2014 results were in line with our objective of offering security and stability to our customers while generating profitable growth and providing long-term value to our shareholders. 
During 2014, VeriSign delivered strong financial performance, including reporting $1,010,000,000 in revenues, expanding free cash flow to $568 million and producing full year non-GAAP operating margins of 60.2%. 
Exceeding $1 billion marks a significant growth and an important milestone since the completion of our divestiture program in 2010, a year in which we reported $681 million in revenues. 
Operationally, 2014 was another strong year for the company. VeriSign processed 34 million new domain name registrations and finished the year with 130.6 million names in the domain name base. During the year, we marked more than 17 years of uninterrupted availability of the .com and .net domain name systems. 
As part of managing our business, during the fourth quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 3.7 million shares for $209 million. 
During the full year 2014, we repurchased 16.3 million shares for $867 million. 
Effective January 30, 2015, the Board of Directors increased the amount of VeriSign common stock authorized for repurchase by approximately $453 million to a total of $1 billion authorized and available under the share buyback program, which has no expiration. 
Our balance sheet remains strong with $1.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. 
Our strategic framework to protect, grow and manage the business continues to serve us well as we see operational and financial benefits from our focus and discipline. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases. 
As you recall, one way VeriSign participated in ICANN's new gTLD program was by applying for internationalized domain name transliterations of .com and .net, as well as .verisign and .comsec. We have signed the registry agreements for. comsec and 11 IDN TLDs, 8 of which are transliterations of .com and 3 are transliterations of .net. 
While these registry agreements with ICANN are signed before these domains become generally available, a few more steps remain, including delegation; controlled interruption, which deals with potential name collisions; completion of a Sunrise period; and finalization and approval of our launch plans. The failure to gain approval, if required, could delay a general availability date or could result in VeriSign having to revise our go-to-market strategy for the IDNs. 
I'll comment now on fourth quarter operating highlights. At the end of December, the domain name based in .com and .net was 130.6 million, consisting of 115.6 million names for .com and 15 million names for .net.  This represents an increase of 2.7% year-over-year. In the fourth quarter, we added 0.59 million net names to the domain name base after processing 8.2 million new gross registrations. In a few moments, George will discuss an update we intend to make to our definition of the domain name base, which will start with the first quarter of 2015. 
In the third quarter of 2014, the renewal rate was 72% compared with 72.7% for the third quarter of 2013. While renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the fourth quarter of 2014 will be approximately 72.4%. This rate compares to 72.2% achieved in the fourth quarter of 2013. 
As we discussed over the last few quarters, there are many factors that drive domain growth. These include Internet adoption, economic and eCommerce activity and changes in registrar go-to-market strategies. 
Also, as we have discussed in previous calls, renewal rates for first-time renewing names have been softer, impacting the overall renewal rate. This change is influenced by a number of factors, including search engine algorithm changes, growth in geographies with lower first-time renewal rates, previous year registrar promotions as well as other factors. 
Net name additions during the fourth quarter came in below our expectations, primarily due to fewer gross additions. Some of the gross additions strength we saw during the third quarter, which was coming from emerging markets, including China, did not continue the same -- at the same growth rate during the fourth quarter. 
Based on these factors and current trends, we are forecasting first quarter 2015 net additions to the domain name base to be between 1 million and 1.5 million names. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to George."

During the fourth quarter, we generated revenue of $256 million, up 4.2% year-over-year, and delivered GAAP operating income of $142 million, up 9% from $130 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. The GAAP operating margin in the quarter came to 55.6% compared to 53% in the same quarter a year ago. 
GAAP net income totaled $65 million compared to $292 million a year earlier, which produced diluted GAAP earnings per share of $0.48 in the fourth quarter this year compared to $1.94 in the fourth quarter of last year. 
Fourth quarter 2014 net income was decreased by $26 million and diluted earnings per share decreased by $0.19, primarily due to a non-U.S. income tax charge related to a reorganization of certain international operations and a change in estimates for U.S. income tax charges related to the repatriation of offshore assets in 2014. 
As described, last year, fourth quarter 2013 GAAP results included tax benefits, pretax nonoperating gains and expenses, which collectively increased net income by approximately $218 million and increased diluted earnings per share by $1.45. 
As of December 31, 2014, the company maintained total assets of $2.2 billion. These assets included $1.4 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of which $486 million were held domestically with the remainder held internationally. 
Total liabilities were $3 billion at the quarter end, down from $3.1 billion a year ago. 
I'll now review some of our key fourth quarter  operating metrics, which are revenue, deferred revenue, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then discuss our 2015 full year guidance. 
As mentioned, revenue totaled $256 million for the fourth quarter. 61% of our revenue was derived from customers in the U.S. and 39% was from international customers. 2014 full year revenue was $1,010,000,000, up 4.7% from full year 2013 revenues. Deferred revenue at year-end 2014 totaled $890 million, a $35 million increase from year-end 2013. Fourth quarter non-GAAP operating expense, which excludes $10 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $104 million compared with $101 million in the third quarter of 2014 and $106 million in the same quarter a year ago. Non-GAAP operating margin for the fourth quarter was 59.4% compared to 56.9% in the same quarter of 2013. 
Full year 2014 non-GAAP operating margin was 60.2%. 
Non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $95 million, resulting in a non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.70 compared to $0.65 in the fourth quarter of 2013 and $0.70 last quarter. 
Full year 2014 non-GAAP earnings per share was $2.72, a 13% increase over 2013. Non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP nonoperating income net for 2014 was a $77 million expense. 
We had a weighted average diluted share count of 135.9 million shares in the fourth quarter compared to 138.1 million shares in the third quarter. dilution related to the convertible debentures was 14.7 million shares based on the average share price during the fourth quarter compared with 13.7 million for the same quarter in 2013. The share count was reduced by the full effect of third quarter repurchase activity and the weighted effect of 3.7 million shares repurchased during the fourth quarter. 
Operating cash flow was $170 million for the fourth quarter compared to $168 million for the third quarter of 2014 and $147 million for the fourth quarter last year. 
Full year 2014 operating cash flow was $601 million compared with $579 million for 2013. 
Fourth quarter free cash flow was $159 million, including a use of $9 million in capital expenditures. 
Free cash flow for 2014 was $568 million, including a net $6 million of excess tax benefits and a use of $39 million in capital expenditures. 
With respect to taxes, we used a tax rate of 28% to calculate our non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share during 2014. As we continue to optimize our tax structure, we believe a more reasonable estimate of the tax rate to calculate our non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share going forward is 26%. As a result, we expect to use a 26% non-GAAP tax rate when reporting first quarter 2015 non-GAAP results. 
Also, as we discussed last quarter, we expect our cash tax rate to say stay well below our tax rate use for non-GAAP calculations for at least the next several years. In 2015, we expect to pay cash taxes of approximately $35 million to $45 million.  Substantially all of the expected cash taxes in 2015 are international. 
As Jim mentioned, I want to note a change we'll be making to our domain name base definition and reporting starting next quarter. 
Currently, we report our domain name base to you both on our website and during earnings each quarter. The domain name base includes the active zone, which is defined as the names that resolve in the zone plus the names that are requested to be not configured for use in the top-level domain zone filed by the registrant. Historically, there has also been an immaterial portion of names that we manage and for which we are paid that are not included in our domain name base definition.  These names get removed from the active zone primarily by registrars when they place the name on hold status. 
Over the last several years, the average amount of names in the on-hold status category has been approximately 400,000 names and the net change year-over-year has been very small. 
While still immaterial, during 2014, we saw an increase in the amount of names registrars have placed on hold status, which appears to be a result of these registrars complying with the new mandated compliance mechanisms in ICANN's 2013 Registrar Accreditation Agreement or RAA. 
In 2014, we saw an increase in domain names placed on hold status from roughly 394,000 names at the end of 2013 to about 870,000 at the end of 2014. 
While the number of these names in total is not material to our overall domain name base of over 130.6 million domain names, as registrars use of this mechanism has increased, we believe it now makes sense to include these names when we report the number of domain names in the domain name base. 
As we are paid for these on-hold names and they have always been included in our reported revenue and gross additions, starting with our first quarter 2015 report, we plan to amend our current definition of our domain name base to include these on-hold status names and we'll be consistent in our reporting of prior periods by also including these names for comparative purposes going forward. 
Before our next earnings call, we intend to update the daily reporting on our website to included these names. 
In the meantime, updates to the domain name base are still posted on our website per our current definition at least once per day allowing you to continue to track the domain name base throughout the coming quarter. 
The Q1 net addition guidance Jim gave earlier of 1 million to 1.5 million net name additions is not affected by this new domain name base definition as our quarterly guidance is focused on gross additions and deletions. 
With respect to full year 2015 guidance. Revenue for 2015 is expected to be in the range of $1,040,000,000 to $1,060,000,000, representing an annual growth rate of 3% to 5%. This revenue range is based on domain name base growth rate of between 2% and 3.5% for 2015. 
Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be at least 80%. Full year 2015 non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be between 60% and 62%. 
Our non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP nonoperating income net is expected to be an expense of between $84 million and $90 million for 2015 and includes the contingent interest expense accrual on our convertible debentures. 
Capital expenditures for the year are expected to be between $40 million and $50 million. 
Our guidance is based on expectations about the outlook of our business in addition to our financial projections for interest income and expense. 
In summary, the company continued to demonstrate solid financial performance throughout 2014. We have grown non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP net income. We have maintained a strong balance sheet and expect strong operating cash flow generation to continue as a result of our financial model. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks."

These fearless record is due to the expertise of our people and our specialized infrastructure. Also, I want to highlight that this quarter marks the 30th anniversaries of both .com and .net. We're proud to be the registry operator of these 2 top-level domains, which are a key component of the Internet's infrastructure. 
We drive profitable growth by strengthening and marketing our current service offerings. While we continue to actively invest in the development of new products and services where we continue to make progress, we don't have an update at this time. 
Finally, we have been managing the business effectively as demonstrated by our improved operating margins, improved tax position and by the return of cash to shareholders through share repurchases. During 2014, we repurchased 16.3 million shares, returning $867 million to shareholders, and repatriated $741 million of cash held by our foreign subsidiaries. 
We remain committed to offering the security and stability that are at the core of our business and make VeriSign a company with an unparalleled DNS service record and a company committed to long-term value creation for our shareholders.

They just haven't been included in our domain name base definition. So as a result, they've not been included in the total 130.6 million name count. On-hold names are a simply management mechanism used primarily by registrars to place names into a hold status, which removes them from the active zone file and prevent them from resolving. The name, however, is still registered by the registrar regardless of the status. Now these names represent a very small and nonmaterial portion of the domain name base, approximately 400,000 at the start of 2014, and their totals have been relatively constant for many years. I'd also add, however, that registrars use this mechanism -- use of this mechanism has increased during 2014, and as a result, we feel it appropriate to amend our definition to include these names going forward. As mentioned at the end of 2014, the names classified with a hold designation totaled about 870,000, which was an increase of about 470,000 -- 475,000 in 2014, up from 394,000 at the end of 2013.

And as of the end of December, at the end of the year, that's roughly the same as the total number of registrations in all of the new gTLDs combined. So it's a strong brand, it's been around for 30 years, it's going to be around for the next 30 years. I mentioned on the last call and I think it's still true that there is some confusion with the .net is suffering from, that this -- the 400-plus new gTLDs that are out and available today are sort of bringing some confusion. There are hundreds more that are coming, so I think that will probably continue. But net is a strong brand, 30 years old, well-respected, 3.6 million gross adds last year, 800,000 adds last quarter, so it's going to be around for a while and it will do well."

As far as commenting on -- I'm sorry, not new gTLDs, but in terms of what we may do in promotion, we constantly run regular programs of promotion with the registrars. We use marketing programs to try to drive resources geographically and through other means. We did recently launch a contest for .com names and a number of other promotions that we're doing. We'll be doing a number of things through the year in recognition of the 30th anniversary of .com, in particular.

The marketing plan that Pat alluded to that's a little different with different Sunrise period, during the Sunrise period, trademark holders are invited to come in and register their marked names prior to general availability. We have what you might call a much more brand-friendly sort of Sunrise in the sense that we are reserving the transliteration of the brands that are registered in .com. And so that implies that there'll be a different marketing approach. We'll simply be notifying existing registrants brands that the transliteration of their .com registration is available to them. So it's hard to say, it's not a traditional sort of a marketing effort. I think, in general, it means that we're not going to need to go out and promote the availability of these IDNs, although we'll certainly do some of that because people are free to register whatever they like in them. But the brand holders who are registered in .com have their brand name reserved for them in the IDNs. They're protected against somebody else registering a name who doesn't own that name. But it's an opportunity for them to have their brand name in the native language script of countries that they operate in. So I think you can see the obvious benefits of that. Putting a price tag on that marketing effort, I think, is just kind of too early to say what it will be. But it'll be focused. It'll be more focused because it's quite targeted. It's unique, I think, as far as any TLD that's ever been launched."

It may be something detrimental to their corporate brand and they don't want it to be out there. And then the one that we've seen most recently is the 2013 Registrar Accreditation Agreement requires registrars to put on hold domain names that they cannot validate the who-is information. And so that's where we've seen the largest trend these days in terms of what the growth is in those particular hold names. Now once they do validate down the who-is data, those names will come out of the hold status and then, of course, be active at that point in time."

If you're familiar with the so-called dark domains, these are the nonconfigured names where the registrant does not want it to resolve, for example, something that is not bothering about a corporate name. A corporation may defensively register that and they simply don't want it to resolve. We get paid for it, but it doesn't appear in the act -- it does not appear in the active zone. You can think of these hold names, we're going to treat them all together with these dark domains very similarly. So we'll get paid for them, but you'll see them reported in our domain name base, they'll be counted in there. The other thing is that George had mentioned this new 2013 Registrar Accreditation Agreement. This is the new agreement that the registrars signed with ICANN that they operate under. Now the number of accredited registrars is, I think, closer to 1,500 today where it was 900 some years ago. So I think -- I hope what we're seeing here, just to keep everything simple, is that all of them have pretty much signed us during 2014. And I think almost all of the registrars have signed in, a large number of them. So I think there's just this initial sort of compliance effort. Pat mentioned that they have to collect who-is data. This also means that some registrars that do not have direct distribution models, who actually sell indirectly through distributions, may find it a little more difficult or may find that it takes more time to collect accurate who-is data. And so these names will get put on hold while they go about doing that and then eventually they come off hold and then they're up here in the active zone. So that's sort of the activity that goes on. But if you understand how dark domains have worked and been counted, these are just like that. You can now think of these names on hold just like that."

Previous-renewed rates were very consistent at about 82%. And so we did see some of the first-time renewal rates come down and I think more of that is a function of the growth we're seeing in China, which has typically lower first-time renewal rate than the U.S., which is our largest market now. Again, that's an emerging market. As those markets mature, I would expect those renewal rates to improve, but it's a large market that's growing and it's still emerging. And so it's just becoming a larger portion of the base and so you get a weighted average effect on the first-time renewal rate."

Our fourth quarter and full year 2014 results were in line with our objective of offering security and stability to our customers while generating profitable growth and providing long-term value to our shareholders. 
During 2014, VeriSign delivered strong financial performance, including reporting $1.010 billion  in revenues, expanding free cash flow to $568 million and producing full year non-GAAP operating margins of 60.2%. 
Exceeding $1 billion marks a significant growth and an important milestone since the completion of our divestiture program in 2010, a year in which we reported $681 million in revenues. 
Operationally, 2014 was another strong year for the company. VeriSign processed 34 million new domain name registrations and finished the year with 130.6 million names in the domain name base. During the year, we marked more than 17 years of uninterrupted availability of the .com and .net domain name systems. 
As part of managing our business, during the fourth quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 3.7 million shares for $209 million. 
During the full year 2014, we repurchased 16.3 million shares for $867 million. 
Effective January 30, 2015, the Board of Directors increased the amount of VeriSign common stock authorized for repurchase by approximately $453 million to a total of $1 billion authorized and available under the share buyback program, which has no expiration. 
Our balance sheet remains strong with $1.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. 
Our strategic framework to protect, grow and manage the business continues to serve us well as we see operational and financial benefits from our focus and discipline. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases. 
As you recall, one way VeriSign participated in ICANN's new gTLD program was by applying for internationalized domain name transliterations of .com and .net, as well as .verisign and .comsec. We have signed the registry agreements for. comsec and 11 IDN TLDs, 8 of which are transliterations of .com and 3 are transliterations of .net. 
While these registry agreements with ICANN are signed before these domains become generally available, a few more steps remain, including delegation; controlled interruption, which deals with potential name collisions; completion of a Sunrise period; and finalization and approval of our launch plans. The failure to gain approval, if required, could delay a general availability date or could result in VeriSign having to revise our go-to-market strategy for the IDNs. 
I'll comment now on fourth quarter operating highlights. At the end of December, the domain name base in .com and .net was 130.6 million, consisting of 115.6 million names for .com and 15 million names for .net.  This represents an increase of 2.7% year-over-year. In the fourth quarter, we added 0.59 million net names to the domain name base after processing 8.2 million new gross registrations. In a few moments, George will discuss an update we intend to make to our definition of the domain name base, which will start with the first quarter of 2015. 
In the third quarter of 2014, the renewal rate was 72% compared with 72.7% for the third quarter of 2013. While renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the fourth quarter of 2014 will be approximately 72.4%. This rate compares to 72.2% achieved in the fourth quarter of 2013. 
As we discussed over the last few quarters, there are many factors that drive domain growth. These include Internet adoption, economic and eCommerce activity and changes in registrar go-to-market strategies. 
Also, as we have discussed in previous calls, renewal rates for first-time renewing names have been softer, impacting the overall renewal rate. This change is influenced by a number of factors, including search engine algorithm changes, growth in geographies with lower first-time renewal rates, previous year registrar promotions as well as other factors. 
Net name additions during the fourth quarter came in below our expectations, primarily due to fewer gross additions. Some of the gross additions strength we saw during the third quarter, which was coming from emerging markets, including China, did not continue the same -- at the same growth rate during the fourth quarter. 
Based on these factors and current trends, we are forecasting first quarter 2015 net additions to the domain name base to be between 1 million and 1.5 million names. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to George."

During the fourth quarter, we generated revenue of $256 million, up 4.2% year-over-year, and delivered GAAP operating income of $142 million, up 9% from $130 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. The GAAP operating margin in the quarter came to 55.6% compared to 53% in the same quarter a year ago. 
GAAP net income totaled $65 million compared to $292 million a year earlier, which produced diluted GAAP earnings per share of $0.48 in the fourth quarter this year compared to $1.94 in the fourth quarter of last year. 
Fourth quarter 2014 net income was decreased by $26 million and diluted earnings per share decreased by $0.19, primarily due to a non-U.S. income tax charge related to a reorganization of certain international operations and a change in estimates for U.S. income tax charges related to the repatriation of offshore assets in 2014. 
As described, last year, fourth quarter 2013 GAAP results included tax benefits, pretax nonoperating gains and expenses, which collectively increased net income by approximately $218 million and increased diluted earnings per share by $1.45. 
As of December 31, 2014, the company maintained total assets of $2.2 billion. These assets included $1.4 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of which $486 million were held domestically with the remainder held internationally. 
Total liabilities were $3 billion at the quarter end, down from $3.1 billion a year ago. 
I'll now review some of our key fourth quarter  operating metrics, which are revenue, deferred revenue, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then discuss our 2015 full year guidance. 
As mentioned, revenue totaled $256 million for the fourth quarter. 61% of our revenue was derived from customers in the U.S. and 39% was from international customers. 2014 full year revenue was $1.010 billion up 4.7% from full year 2013 revenues. Deferred revenue at year-end 2014 totaled $890 million, a $35 million increase from year-end 2013. Fourth quarter non-GAAP operating expense, which excludes $10 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $104 million compared with $101 million in the third quarter of 2014 and $106 million in the same quarter a year ago. Non-GAAP operating margin for the fourth quarter was 59.4% compared to 56.9% in the same quarter of 2013. 
Full year 2014 non-GAAP operating margin was 60.2%. 
Non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $95 million, resulting in a non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.70 compared to $0.65 in the fourth quarter of 2013 and $0.70 last quarter. 
Full year 2014 non-GAAP earnings per share was $2.72, a 13% increase over 2013. Non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP nonoperating income net for 2014 was a $77 million expense. 
We had a weighted average diluted share count of 135.9 million shares in the fourth quarter compared to 138.1 million shares in the third quarter. Dilution related to the convertible debentures was 14.7 million shares based on the average share price during the fourth quarter compared with 13.7 million for the same quarter in 2013. The share count was reduced by the full effect of third quarter repurchase activity and the weighted effect of 3.7 million shares repurchased during the fourth quarter. 
Operating cash flow was $170 million for the fourth quarter compared to $168 million for the third quarter of 2014 and $147 million for the fourth quarter last year. 
Full year 2014 operating cash flow was $601 million compared with $579 million for 2013. 
Fourth quarter free cash flow was $159 million, including a use of $9 million in capital expenditures. 
Free cash flow for 2014 was $568 million, including a net $6 million of excess tax benefits and a use of $39 million in capital expenditures. 
With respect to taxes, we used a tax rate of 28% to calculate our non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share during 2014. As we continue to optimize our tax structure, we believe a more reasonable estimate of the tax rate to calculate our non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share going forward is 26%. As a result, we expect to use a 26% non-GAAP tax rate when reporting first quarter 2015 non-GAAP results. 
Also, as we discussed last quarter, we expect our cash tax rate to say stay well below our tax rate use for non-GAAP calculations for at least the next several years. In 2015, we expect to pay cash taxes of approximately $35 million to $45 million.  Substantially all of the expected cash taxes in 2015 are international. 
As Jim mentioned, I want to note a change we'll be making to our domain name base definition and reporting starting next quarter. 
Currently, we report our domain name base to you both on our website and during earnings each quarter. The domain name base includes the active zone, which is defined as the names that resolve in the zone plus the names that are requested to be not configured for use in the top-level domain zone filed by the registrant. Historically, there has also been an immaterial portion of names that we manage and for which we are paid that are not included in our domain name base definition.  These names get removed from the active zone primarily by registrars when they place the name on hold status. 
Over the last several years, the average amount of names in the on-hold status category has been approximately 400,000 names and the net change year-over-year has been very small. 
While still immaterial, during 2014, we saw an increase in the amount of names registrars have placed on hold status, which appears to be a result of these registrars complying with the new mandated compliance mechanisms in ICANN's 2013 Registrar Accreditation Agreement or RAA. 
In 2014, we saw an increase in domain names placed on hold status from roughly 394,000 names at the end of 2013 to about 870,000 at the end of 2014. 
While the number of these names in total is not material to our overall domain name base of over 130.6 million domain names, as registrars use of this mechanism has increased, we believe it now makes sense to include these names when we report the number of domain names in the domain name base. 
As we are paid for these on-hold names and they have always been included in our reported revenue and gross additions, starting with our first quarter 2015 report, we plan to amend our current definition of our domain name base to include these on-hold status names and we'll be consistent in our reporting of prior periods by also including these names for comparative purposes going forward. 
Before our next earnings call, we intend to update the daily reporting on our website to included these names. 
In the meantime, updates to the domain name base are still posted on our website per our current definition at least once per day allowing you to continue to track the domain name base throughout the coming quarter. 
The Q1 net addition guidance Jim gave earlier of 1 million to 1.5 million net name additions is not affected by this new domain name base definition as our quarterly guidance is focused on gross additions and deletions. 
With respect to full year 2015 guidance. Revenue for 2015 is expected to be in the range of $1.040 billion to $1.060 billion, representing an annual growth rate of 3% to 5%. This revenue range is based on domain name base growth rate of between 2% and 3.5% for 2015. 
Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be at least 80%. Full year 2015 non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be between 60% and 62%. 
Our non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP nonoperating income net is expected to be an expense of between $84 million and $90 million for 2015 and includes the contingent interest expense accrual on our convertible debentures. 
Capital expenditures for the year are expected to be between $40 million and $50 million. 
Our guidance is based on expectations about the outlook of our business in addition to our financial projections for interest income and expense. 
In summary, the company continued to demonstrate sound financial performance throughout 2014. We have grown non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP net income. We have maintained a strong balance sheet and expect strong operating cash flow generation to continue as a result of our financial model. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks."

They just haven't been included in our domain name base definition. So as a result, they've not been included in the total 130.6 million name count. On-hold names are a simply management mechanism used primarily by registrars to place names into a hold status, which removes them from the active zone file and prevent them from resolving. The name, however, is still registered by the registrar regardless of the status. Now these names represent a very small and nonmaterial portion of the domain name base, approximately 400,000 at the start of 2014, and their totals have been relatively constant for many years. I'd also add, however, that registrars use this mechanism -- use of this mechanism has increased during 2014, and as a result, we feel it appropriate to amend our definition to include these names going forward. As mentioned at the end of 2014, the names classified with a hold designation totaled about 870,000, which was an increase of about 470,000 -- 475,000 in 2014, up from 394,000 at the end of 2013.

So if you looked at our total non-GAAP operating expense, it actually was -- for the fourth quarter, actually it was down year-over-year, but it was up sequentially by about $3.4 million. And we saw that increase really come primarily in G&A. We saw that being up about $2.4 million and G&A was up in the quarter primarily because we had about $1 million of severance expense in the quarter. And then we have about another $1 million of, what I would call, seasonal fourth quarter expenses that hit us, some of which were related to higher consulting expenses as we approached the year-end. The other increase we had was in R&D, and as far as R&D goes, we saw a slight decrease in the amount of labor that we actually capitalized on the balance sheet. And as a result of that lower amount of capitalization, some of that flowed into the income statement and that was the majority of the increase in the R&D expense."

I mentioned on the last call and I think it's still true that there is some confusion with the .net is suffering from, that this -- the 400-plus new gTLDs that are out and available today are sort of bringing some confusion.

The marketing plan that Pat alluded to that's a little different with different Sunrise period, during the Sunrise period, trademark holders are invited to come in and register their marked names prior to general availability. We have what you might call a much more brand-friendly sort of Sunrise in the sense that we are reserving the transliteration of the brands that are registered in .com. And so that implies that there'll be a different marketing approach. We'll simply be notifying existing registrants brands that the transliteration of their .com registration is available to them. So it's hard to say, it's not a traditional sort of a marketing effort. I think, in general, it means that we're not going to need to go out and promote the availability of these IDNs, although we'll certainly do some of that because people are free to register whatever they like in them. But the brand holders who are registered in .com have their brand name reserved for them in the IDNs. They're protected against somebody else registering a name who doesn't own that name. But it's an opportunity for them to have their brand name in the native language script of countries that they operate in. So I think you can see the obvious benefits of that. Putting a price tag on that marketing effort, I think, is - it's just kind of too early to say what it will be. But it'll be focused. It'll be more focused because it's quite targeted. It's unique, I think, as far as any TLD that's ever been launched."

It may be something detrimental to their corporate brand and they don't want it to be out there. And then the one that we've seen most recently is the 2013 Registrar Accreditation Agreement requires registrars to put on hold domain names that they cannot validate the who-is information. And so that's where we've seen the largest trend these days in terms of what the growth is in those particular hold names. Now once they do validate  the who-is data, those names will come out of the hold status and then, of course, be active at that point in time."

If you're familiar with the so-called dark domains, these are the nonconfigured names where the registrant does not want it to resolve, for example, something that is not flattering about a corporate name. A corporation may defensively register that and they simply don't want it to resolve. We get paid for it, but it doesn't appear in the act -- it does not appear in the active zone. You can think of these hold names, we're going to treat them all together with these dark domains very similarly. So we'll get paid for them, but you'll see them reported in our domain name base, they'll be counted in there. The other thing is that George had mentioned this new 2013 Registrar Accreditation Agreement. This is the new agreement that the registrars signed with ICANN that they operate under. Now the number of accredited registrars is, I think, closer to 1,500 today where it was 900 some years ago. So I think -- I hope what we're seeing here, just to keep everything simple, is that all of them have pretty much signed this during 2014. And I think almost all of the registrars have signed it, a large number of them. So I think there's just this initial sort of compliance effort. Pat mentioned that they have to collect who-is data. This also means that some registrars that do not have direct distribution models, who actually sell indirectly through distributions, may find it a little more difficult or may find that it takes more time to collect accurate who-is data. And so these names will get put on hold while they go about doing that and then eventually they come off hold and then they're up here in the active zone. So that's sort of the activity that goes on. But if you understand how dark domains have worked and been counted, these are just like that. You can now think of these names on hold just like that."

That being said, for some non-U.S. buyers of domain names, the strength of the U.S. dollar could create a perceived price increase, which could have an impact on demand. But while the strength of the U.S. dollar may be having some effect on demand, we really haven't seen that in any of our numbers, so it hasn't really been an impact for us to date."

Previous-renewed rates were very consistent at about 82%. And so we did see some of the first-time renewal rates come down and I think more of that is a function of the growth we're seeing in China, which has typically lower first-time renewal rate than the U.S., which is our largest market now. Again, that's an emerging market. As those markets mature, I would expect those renewal rates to improve, but it's a large market that's growing and is still emerging. And so it's just becoming a larger portion of the base and so you get a weighted average effect on the first-time renewal rate."

Our first quarter 2015 results mark a solid start to the year and were in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers, while generating profitable growth and providing long-term value to our shareholders. We reported revenue of $258 million, up 3.9% year-over-year, and we delivered strong financial performance, including $126 million in free cash flow. We processed 8.7 million new registrations during the first quarter and added 1.51 million net new names, ending with 133 million .com and .net domain names in the domain name base.
Our financial position is strong with $1.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. During the first quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 2.7 million shares for $160 million. As of March 31, 2015, we have 917 million remaining in our share repurchase program, which has no expiration. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investment needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases.
I'll comment now on a few recent events. In March, I was pleased to announce the appointment of Todd Strubbe as Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. Todd joined us this week, and we're delighted to have him on the team. Also in March, we completed the issuance of our 10-year, $500 million senior unsecured notes with a 5.25% coupon. We're pleased with the results of this issuance, which further enhances our capital structure.
Finally, as you may recall, one way VeriSign has been visiting ICANN's new gTLD program was by applying for internationalized domain name transliterations of.com and .net. As mentioned during the last earnings call, we have signed 11 IDN TLD Registry agreements and are seeking a modified Sunrise period from ICANN. Since we spoke to you last quarter, we have submitted our requests for this modified Sunrise period and are awaiting response from ICANN. But [indiscernible] gain approval could delay our general availability date or could result in VeriSign having to revise our go-to-market strategy for the IDNs.
I'll comment now on first quarter operating highlights. At the end of March, the domain name base in .com and .net was 133 million, consisting of 117.9 million names for .com and 15.1 million names for .net. This represents an increase of 3.1% year-over-year, as calculated including domain names on hold for both periods. In the first quarter, we added 1.51 million net names to the domain name base after processing 8.7 million new gross registrations.
In the fourth quarter of 2014, the renewal rate was 72.5% compared with 72.2% for the fourth quarter of 2013. While renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the first quarter of 2015 will be approximately 73.5%. This rate compares favorably to 72.6% achieved in the first quarter of 2014.
As we discussed over the last few quarters, there are many factors that drive domain growth. These include Internet adoption, economic and eCommerce activity and registrar go-to-market strategies. Based on these and other factors, we are forecasting second quarter 2015 net additions to the domain name base to be between 0.3 million and 0.8 million names. 2015 will mark the third year in a row where the second quarter is expected to be the lowest quarter from a net additions perspective. Q2 has been our lowest quarter as deletions are historical at their seasonal high point in Q2. We believe this is because seasonal gross additions are typically at their high point in Q1 and most registrars take advantage of our 45-day grace period after expiry to delete domains which fall into the second quarter.
Similar to last year, we expect second half 2015 net additions to increase relative to Q2's expected performance. As noted in prior calls, updates to the domain name base are posted on our website at least once per day and reflect the definition change to include on-hold status names as we discussed during the last earnings call. This website allows you to track the domain name base throughout the coming quarter.
And now I'd like to turn the call over to George."

During the first quarter, we generated revenue of $258 million, up 3.9% year-over-year and delivered GAAP operating income of $144 million, up 3% from $140 million in the first quarter of 2014. The GAAP operating margin in the quarter came to 55.8% compared to 56.1% in the same quarter a year ago. GAAP net income totaled $88 million compared to $94 million a year earlier, which produced diluted GAAP earnings per share of $0.66 in the first quarter this year compared to $0.64 for the first quarter last year. During the first quarter, the company continued to manage its capital structure through the issuance of its $500 million, 10-year, senior secured notes offering. The notes, which are not callable, mature in 2025, and they're a fixed interest rate of 5.25%. In addition, the company also entered into a new, 5-year, $200 million, unsecured revolving credit facility that matures in April 2020, which takes the place of our prior unsecured revolving credit facility. The company had no borrowings under this facility at the end of the quarter. The first quarter ending balance sheet reflects the March 2015 issuance of the $500 million senior secured notes due 2025.
As of March 31, 2015, the company maintained total assets of $2.6 billion. These assets included $1.9 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which $901 million were held domestically, with the remainder held internationally.
Total liabilities were $3.6 billion at the quarter-end, up from $3 billion at the end of 2014.
I will now review some of our key first quarter operating metrics, which are revenue, deferred revenue, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then discuss our 2015 full year guidance. As mentioned, revenue totaled $258 million for the first quarter. 61% of our revenue was derived from customers in the U.S. and 39% was from international customers. Deferred revenue at the end of the first quarter totaled $925 million, a $35 million increase from year-end 2014.
First quarter non-GAAP operating expense, which excludes $10 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $104 million, the same as for the fourth quarter of 2014 and compared with $99 million in the same quarter a year ago. Non-GAAP operating margin for the first quarter was 59.7% compared to 60.1% in the same quarter of 2014.
Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter was $99 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.74, using a weighted average diluted share count of 133.8 million shares. This compares to $0.64 in the first quarter of 2014 and $0.70 last quarter using 148.6 million and 135.9 million weighted average diluted shares, respectively.
Operating cash flow was $133 million for the first quarter compared to $170 million for the fourth quarter of 2014 and $142 million for the first quarter last year. First quarter free cash flow was $126 million, including $6 million of excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation and reduced by $13 million in capital expenditures. With respect to taxes, as we noted in our last earnings call, starting with the first quarter of 2015, we have used a tax rate of 26% to calculate our non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share. Also, as we've discussed in recent earning calls, we expect our tax rate -- our cash tax rate to stay well below our tax rate use for non-GAAP calculations for at least the next several years. In 2015, we still expect to pay cash taxes of approximately $35 million to $45 million. Substantially, all of the expected cash taxes in 2015 are international.
With respect to our full year 2015 guidance, revenue for 2015 is now expected to be in a range of $1,043,000,000 to $1,057,000,000, representing an annual growth rate of 3% to 5%. This revenue range is changed from the $1,040,000,000 to $1,060,000,000 [ph] range given in our last call. This revenue range still assumes a domain base growth rate of between 2% and 2.5% [ph] for 2015. Non-GAAP gross margins is still expected to be at least 80%. Full year 2015 non-GAAP operating margin is still expected to be between 60% and 62%. Our non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP nonoperating income net is now expected to be an expense of between $104 million to $110 million, changed from between $84 million and $90 million for 2015 and reflects the interest expense of the new bond issue. Capital expenditures for the year are still expected to be between $40 million and $50 million. Our guidance is based on expectations about the outlook of our business in addition to our financial projections for interest income and expense.
In summary, the company continued to demonstrate sound financial performance in the first quarter. We have grown non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP net income. We have maintained a strong financial position and expect our strong operating cash flow generation to continue as a result of our financial model. Now I'll return the call back to Jim for his closing remarks."

And the majority of that increase, approximately $2 million, was the result of a onetime non-income related tax accrual that we made in the quarter.

It's a way for those hardware vendors to basically right to allows them to seamlessly transition to have acquired mitigation using our DDoS Protection Service.

Our first quarter 2015 results mark a solid start to the year and were in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers, while generating profitable growth and providing long-term",713,"Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. Our first quarter 2015 results mark a solid start to the year and were in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers, while generating profitable growth and providing long-term value to our shareholders. We reported revenue of $258 million, up 3.9% year-over-year, and we delivered strong financial performance, including $126 million in free cash flow. We processed 8.7 million new registrations during the first quarter and added 1.51 million net new names, ending with 133 million .com and .net domain names in the domain name base.
Our financial position is strong with $1.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. During the first quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 2.7 million shares for $160 million. As of March 31, 2015, we have $917 million remaining in our share repurchase program, which has no expiration. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases.
I'll comment now on a few recent events. In March, I was pleased to announce the appointment of Todd Strubbe as Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. Todd joined us just this week, and we're delighted to have him on the team. Also in March, we completed the issuance of our 10-year, $500 million senior unsecured notes with a 5.25% coupon. We're pleased with the results of this issuance, which further enhances our capital structure.
Finally, as you may recall, one way VeriSign has been participating in ICANN's new gTLD program was by applying for internationalized domain name transliterations of.com and .net. As mentioned during the last earnings call, we have signed 11 IDN TLD Registry Agreements and are seeking a modified Sunrise period from ICANN. Since we spoke to you last quarter, we have submitted our requests for this modified Sunrise period and are awaiting a response from ICANN. The failure to gain approval could delay a general availability date or could result in VeriSign having to revise our go-to-market strategy for the IDNs.
I'll comment now on first quarter operating highlights. At the end of March, the domain name base in .com and .net was 133 million, consisting of 117.9 million names for .com and 15.1 million names for .net. This represents an increase of 3.1% year-over-year, as calculated, including domain names on hold for both periods. In the first quarter, we added 1.51 million net names to the domain name base after processing 8.7 million new gross registrations.
In the fourth quarter of 2014, the renewal rate was 72.5% compared with 72.2% for the fourth quarter of 2013. While renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the first quarter of 2015 will be approximately 73.5%. This rate compares favorably to 72.6% achieved in the first quarter of 2014.
As we discussed over the last few quarters, there are many factors that drive domain growth. These include Internet adoption, economic and eCommerce activity and registrar go-to-market strategies. Based on these and other factors, we are forecasting second quarter 2015 net additions to the domain name base to be between 0.3 million and 0.8 million names. 2015 will mark the third year in a row where the second quarter is expected to be the lowest quarter from a net additions perspective. Q2 has been our lowest quarter as deletions are historically at their seasonal high point in Q2. We believe this is because seasonal gross additions are typically at their high point in Q1 and most registrars take advantage of our 45-day grace period after expiry to delete domains which fall into the second quarter.
Similar to last year, we expect second half 2015 net additions to increase relative to Q2's expected performance. As noted in prior calls, updates to the domain name base are posted on our website at least once per day and reflect the definition change to include on-hold status names as we discussed during the last earnings call. This website allows you to track the domain name base throughout the coming quarter.

During the first quarter, we generated revenue of $258 million, up 3.9% year-over-year and delivered GAAP operating income of $144 million, up 3% from $140 million in the first quarter of 2014. The GAAP operating",841,"Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. During the first quarter, we generated revenue of $258 million, up 3.9% year-over-year and delivered GAAP operating income of $144 million, up 3% from $140 million in the first quarter of 2014. The GAAP operating margin in the quarter came to 55.8% compared to 56.1% in the same quarter a year ago. GAAP net income totaled $88 million compared to $94 million a year earlier, which produced diluted GAAP earnings per share of $0.66 in the first quarter this year compared to $0.64 for the first quarter last year. 
During the first quarter, the company continued to manage its capital structure through the issuance of its $500 million, 10-year, senior secured notes offering. The notes, which are not callable, mature in 2025, and they're a fixed interest rate of 5.25%. In addition, the company also entered into a new, 5-year, $200 million, unsecured revolving credit facility that matures in April 2020, which takes the place of our prior unsecured revolving credit facility. The company had no borrowings under this facility at the end of the quarter. The first quarter ending balance sheet reflects the March 2015 issuance of the $500 million senior secured notes due 2025.
As of March 31, 2015, the company maintained total assets of $2.6 billion. These assets included $1.9 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which $901 million were held domestically, with the remainder held internationally. Total liabilities were $3.6 billion at the quarter end, up from $3 billion at the end of 2014.
I'll now review some of our key first quarter operating metrics, which are revenue, deferred revenue, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then discuss our 2015 full year guidance. As mentioned, revenue totaled $258 million for the first quarter. 61% of our revenue was derived from customers in the U.S. and 39% was from international customers. Deferred revenue at the end of the first quarter totaled $925 million, a $35 million increase from year-end 2014.
First quarter non-GAAP operating expense, which excludes $10 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $104 million, the same as for the fourth quarter of 2014 and compared with $99 million in the same quarter a year ago. Non-GAAP operating margin for the first quarter was 59.7% compared to 60.1% in the same quarter of 2014.
Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter was $99 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.74, using a weighted average diluted share count of 133.8 million shares. This compares to $0.64 in the first quarter of 2014 and $0.70 last quarter using 148.6 million and 135.9 million weighted average diluted shares, respectively.
Operating cash flow was $133 million for the first quarter compared to $170 million for the fourth quarter of 2014 and $142 million for the first quarter last year. First quarter free cash flow was $126 million, including $6 million of excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation and reduced by $13 million in capital expenditures. With respect to taxes, as we noted in our last earnings call, starting with the first quarter of 2015, we have used a tax rate of 26% to calculate our non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share. Also, as we've discussed in recent earning calls, we expect our tax rate -- our cash tax rate to stay well below our tax rate use for non-GAAP calculations for at least the next several years. In 2015, we still expect to pay cash taxes of approximately $35 million to $45 million. Substantially, all of the expected cash taxes in 2015 are international.
With respect to our full year 2015 guidance, revenue for 2015 is now expected to be in the range of $1,043,000,000 to $1,057,000,000, representing an annual growth rate of 3% to 5%. This revenue range is changed from the $1,040,000,000 to $1,060,000,000 range given in our last call. This revenue range still assumes a domain name base growth rate of between 2% and 3.5% for 2015. Non-GAAP gross margins is still expected to be at least 80%. 
Full year 2015 non-GAAP operating margin is still expected to be between 60% and 62%. Our non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP nonoperating income net is now expected to be an expense of between $104 million to $110 million, changed from between $84 million and $90 million for 2015 and reflects the interest expense of the new bond issue. Capital expenditures for the year are still expected to be between $40 million and $50 million. Our guidance is based on expectations about the outlook of our business in addition to our financial projections for interest income and expense.
In summary, the company continued to demonstrate sound financial performance in the first quarter. We have grown non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP net income. We have maintained a strong financial position and expect our strong operating cash flow generation to continue as a result of our financial model. Now I'll return the call back to Jim for his closing remarks."

As far as renewal rates between international and domestic geographies, what I can tell you is that in the Q1 preliminary number, we saw increases in both domestic and international first-time renewing rates and an improvement in international rates for previously renewed names. Domestic previously renewed -- renewal rates were relatively flat in the first quarter. Again, the renewal rate is preliminary.

It's a way for those hardware vendors to basically right to inspect that allows them to seamlessly transition to in a cloud mitigation using our DDoS Protection Service. We think that's really a great trend in the future. It's great for customers. It's a great distribution model for us. It's more efficient.

Our first quarter 2015 results mark a solid start to the year and were in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers, while generating profitable growth and providing long-term",713,"Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. Our first quarter 2015 results mark a solid start to the year and were in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers, while generating profitable growth and providing long-term value to our shareholders. We reported revenue of $258 million, up 3.9% year-over-year, and we delivered strong financial performance, including $126 million in free cash flow. We processed 8.7 million new registrations during the first quarter and added 1.51 million net new names, ending with 133 million .com and .net domain names in the domain name base.
Our financial position is strong with $1.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. During the first quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 2.7 million shares for $160 million. As of March 31, 2015, we have $917 million remaining in our share repurchase program, which has no expiration. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases.
I'll comment now on a few recent events. In March, I was pleased to announce the appointment of Todd Strubbe as Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. Todd joined us just this week, and we're delighted to have him on the team. Also in March, we completed the issuance of our 10-year, $500 million senior unsecured notes with a 5.25% coupon. We're pleased with the results of this issuance, which further enhances our capital structure.
Finally, as you may recall, one way VeriSign has been participating in ICANN's new gTLD program was by applying for internationalized domain name transliterations of.com and .net. As mentioned during the last earnings call, we have signed 11 IDN TLD Registry Agreements and are seeking a modified Sunrise period from ICANN. Since we spoke to you last quarter, we have submitted our requests for this modified Sunrise period and are awaiting a response from ICANN. The failure to gain approval could delay a general availability date or could result in VeriSign having to revise our go-to-market strategy for the IDNs.
I'll comment now on first quarter operating highlights. At the end of March, the domain name base in .com and .net was 133 million, consisting of 117.9 million names for .com and 15.1 million names for .net. This represents an increase of 3.1% year-over-year, as calculated, including domain names on hold for both periods. In the first quarter, we added 1.51 million net names to the domain name base after processing 8.7 million new gross registrations.
In the fourth quarter of 2014, the renewal rate was 72.5% compared with 72.2% for the fourth quarter of 2013. While renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the first quarter of 2015 will be approximately 73.5%. This rate compares favorably to 72.6% achieved in the first quarter of 2014.
As we discussed over the last few quarters, there are many factors that drive domain growth. These include Internet adoption, economic and eCommerce activity and registrar go-to-market strategies. Based on these and other factors, we are forecasting second quarter 2015 net additions to the domain name base to be between 0.3 million and 0.8 million names. 2015 will mark the third year in a row where the second quarter is expected to be the lowest quarter from a net additions perspective.
Q2 has been our lowest quarter as deletions are historically at their seasonal high point in Q2. We believe this is because seasonal gross additions are typically at their high point in Q1 and most registrars take advantage of our 45-day grace period after expiry to delete domains which fall into the second quarter.
Similar to last year, we expect second half 2015 net additions to increase relative to Q2's expected performance. As noted in prior calls, updates to the domain name base are posted on our website at least once per day and reflect the definition change to include on-hold status names as we discussed during the last earnings call. This website allows you to track the domain name base throughout the coming quarter.
And now I'd like to turn the call over to George."

During the first quarter, we generated revenue of $258 million, up 3.9% year-over-year and delivered GAAP operating income of $144 million, up 3% from $140 million in the first quarter of 2014. The GAAP operating margin in the quarter came to 55.8% compared to 56.1% in the same quarter a year ago. GAAP net income totaled $88 million compared to $94 million a year earlier, which produced diluted GAAP earnings per share of $0.66 in the first quarter this year compared to $0.64 for the first quarter last year. 
During the first quarter, the company continued to manage its capital structure through the issuance of its $500 million, 10-year, senior secured notes offering. The notes, which are not callable, mature in 2025, and they're a fixed interest rate of 5 1/4%. In addition, the company also entered into a new, 5-year, $200 million, unsecured revolving credit facility that matures in April 2020, which takes the place of our prior unsecured revolving credit facility. The company had no borrowings under this facility at the end of the quarter. The first quarter ending balance sheet reflects the March 2015 issuance of the $500 million senior secured notes due 2025.
As of March 31, 2015, the company maintained total assets of $2.6 billion. These assets included $1.9 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which $901 million were held domestically, with the remainder held internationally. Total liabilities were $3.6 billion at the quarter end, up from $3 billion at the end of 2014.
I'll now review some of our key first quarter operating metrics, which are revenue, deferred revenue, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then discuss our 2015 full year guidance. As mentioned, revenue totaled $258 million for the first quarter. 61% of our revenue was derived from customers in the U.S. and 39% was from international customers. Deferred revenue at the end of the first quarter totaled $925 million, a $35 million increase from year-end 2014.
First quarter non-GAAP operating expense, which excludes $10 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $104 million, the same as for the fourth quarter of 2014 and compared with $99 million in the same quarter a year ago. Non-GAAP operating margin for the first quarter was 59.7% compared to 60.1% in the same quarter of 2014.
Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter was $99 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.74, using a weighted average diluted share count of 133.8 million shares. This compares to $0.64 in the first quarter of 2014 and $0.70 last quarter using 148.6 million and 135.9 million weighted average diluted shares, respectively.
Operating cash flow was $133 million for the first quarter compared to $170 million for the fourth quarter of 2014 and $142 million for the first quarter last year. First quarter free cash flow was $126 million, including $6 million of excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation and reduced by $13 million in capital expenditures. 
With respect to taxes, as we noted in our last earnings call, starting with the first quarter of 2015, we have used a tax rate of 26% to calculate our non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share. Also, as we've discussed in recent earning calls, we expect our tax rate -- our cash tax rate to stay well below our tax rate used for non-GAAP calculations for at least the next several years. In 2015, we still expect to pay cash taxes of approximately $35 million to $45 million. Substantially, all of the expected cash taxes in 2015 are international.
With respect to our full year 2015 guidance, revenue for 2015 is now expected to be in the range of $1,043,000,000 to $1,057,000,000, representing an annual growth rate of 3% to 5%. This revenue range is changed from the $1,040,000,000 to $1,060,000,000 range given in our last call. This revenue range still assumes a domain name base growth rate of between 2% and 3.5% for 2015. Non-GAAP gross margins is still expected to be at least 80%. 
Full year 2015 non-GAAP operating margin is still expected to be between 60% and 62%. Our non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP nonoperating income net is now expected to be an expense of between $104 million to $110 million, changed from between $84 million and $90 million for 2015 and reflects the interest expense of the new bond issue. Capital expenditures for the year are still expected to be between $40 million and $50 million. Our guidance is based on expectations about the outlook of our business in addition to our financial projections for interest income and expense.
In summary, the company continued to demonstrate sound financial performance in the first quarter. We have grown non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP net income. We have maintained a strong financial position and expect our strong operating cash flow generation to continue as a result of our financial model. Now I'll return the call back to Jim for his closing remarks."

So that's really more of a timing issue. On the G&A front, we were up about $3 million from the year-ago period. And the majority of that increase, approximately $2 million, was the result of a one-time non-income related tax accrual that we made in the quarter.

It's a way for those hardware vendors to basically right to inspect that allows them to seamlessly transition to in a cloud mitigation using our DDoS Protection Service.

I'm pleased to report another solid quarter for VeriSign. Second quarter results were in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers while generating profitable growth and building long-term value for our shareholders. We reported revenue of $263 million, up 4.9% year-over-year, and we delivered strong financial performance, including $171 million in free cash flow. We processed 8.7 million new registrations during the second quarter and added 0.52 million net new names, ending with 133.5 million .com and .net domain names in the domain name base.
Our financial position is strong with $1.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. Our track record of returning cash to shareholders continued during the second quarter as we repurchased 2.5 million shares for $156 million. As of June 30, 2015, we have $761 million remaining in our share repurchase program, which has no expiration. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investment needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases.
Before I get into the second quarter results, I want to provide a few updates since our last earnings call. Today, we announced an increase in the annual wholesale fee for a .net domain name registration, as allowed by agreement with ICANN. As of February 1, 2016, the annual wholesale fee for a .net domain name registration will increase from $6.79 to $7.46. As of the end of Q2, there were approximately 15 million .net registered names. Also as you recall, one way VeriSign has been participating in ICANN's new gTLD program was by applying for internationalized domain name versions of common .net. Based primarily on feedback from the domain name community stakeholders, we have revised our IDN launch strategy. We will offer these new IDN top-level domains as stand-alone domain names, subject to normal introductory availability and rights protection mechanisms available to all new gTLDs. This revised approach will not require ICANN approval and is designed to provide end users and businesses with the greatest flexibility, and for registrars, a simple and straightforward framework to serve the market. Finally, we believe this approach would provide the best opportunity for increased universal acceptance of IDNs. We expect to begin a phased rollout of the IDNs towards the end of this year, and we'll provide more information on our launch plans when appropriate.
I'll comment now on second quarter operating highlights. At the end of June, the domain name base and common .net was 133.5 million, consisting of 118.5 million [ph] names for.com and 15 million names for .net. This represents an increase of 3.1% year-over-year, as calculated, including domain names on hold for both periods. In the second quarter, we added 0.52 million .net names to the domain name base after processing 8.7 million new gross registrations.
In the first quarter of 2015, the renewal rate was 73.4% compared with 72.6% for the first quarter of 2014. While renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the second quarter of 2015 will be approximately 72.6%. This preliminary rate compares favorably to 71.8% achieved in the second quarter of 2014.
As we discussed over the last few quarters, there are many factors that drive domain name growth. These include Internet adoption, economic activity, eCommerce activity and registrar go-to-market strategies. Based on these and other factors, we are forecasting third quarter 2015 net additions to the domain name base to be between 0.6 million and 1.1 million names. As noted in prior calls, updates to the domain name base are posted on our website at least once per day and reflect the definition change to include on-hold-status names as we discussed during our February earnings call. This website allows you to track the domain name base throughout the coming quarter.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to George."

During the second quarter, we generated revenue of $263 million, up 4.9% year-over-year and delivered GAAP operating income of $149 million, up 4.1% from $143 million in the second quarter of 2014. The GAAP operating margin in the quarter came to 56.7% compared to 57.2% in the same quarter a year ago. GAAP net income totaled $93 million compared to $100 million a year earlier, which produced diluted GAAP earnings per share of $0.70 in the second quarter this year compared to $0.71 for the second quarter last year. GAAP net income was lower year-over-year, primarily based on an increase in interest expense related to the new senior notes and contingent interest on the convertible debentures.
As of June 30, 2015, the company maintained total assets of $2.6 billion. These assets included the $1.9 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which $844 million were held domestically with the remainder held internationally. Total liabilities were $3.6 billion at the quarter-end, up from $3 billion at the end of 2014.
I'll now review some of our key second quarter operating metrics, which are revenue, deferred revenue, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I'll then discuss our 2015 full year guidance. As mentioned, revenue totaled $263 million for the second quarter. 61% of our revenue was derived from customers in the United States and 39% was from international customers. Deferred revenue at the end of the second quarter totaled $932 million, a $41 million increase from year-end 2014.
Second quarter non-GAAP operating expenses, which exclude $12 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $102 million, down from $104 million in the first quarter of 2015 and compared with $98 million in the same quarter a year ago.
Non-GAAP operating margin for the second quarter was 61.3% compared to 60.9% in the same quarter of 2014. Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter was $99 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.74 using a weighted average diluted share count of 133.3 million shares. This compares to $0.68 in the second quarter of 2014 and $0.74 last quarter using 141.1 million and 133.8 million weighted average diluted shares, respectively. Year-over-year, non-GAAP earnings per share improved primarily due to a lower share count and the use of a 26% non-GAAP tax rate this year compared with last year's 28% non-GAAP tax rate.
Operating cash flow and free cash flow for the second quarter were $175 million and $171 million, respectively, compared with $121 million and $129 million, respectively, for the second quarter last year. The year-over-year increase in cash flow was primarily related to last year's second quarter international cash tax payment related to the offshore repatriation of cash. Also, as we have discussed in recent earnings calls, we expect our cash tax rate to stay well below our tax rate used for non-GAAP calculations for at least the next several years. In 2015, we still expect to pay cash taxes of approximately $35 million to $45 million. Substantially, all of the expected cash taxes in 2015 are international.
With respect to our full year 2015 guidance. Revenue for 2015 is now expected to be in the range of $1,045,000,000 to $1,055,000,000, representing an annual growth rate of 3.5% to 4.5%. This revenue range is narrowed from the $1,043,000,000 to $1,057,000,000 given on our last call. Non-GAAP gross margin is still expected to be at least 80%. Full year 2015 non-GAAP operating margin is also still expected to be between 60% and 62%. Our non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP nonoperating income net is still expected to be an expense of between $104 million and $110 million. Capital expenditures for the year are also still expected to be between $40 million and $50 million. Our guidance is based on expectations about the outlook of our business in addition to our financial projections for interest income and expense.
In summary, the company continues to demonstrate sound financial performance in the second quarter. We have grown non-GAAP operating income, operating cash flow and free cash flow. We have maintained a strong financial position and expect strong operating cash flow generation to continue as a result of our financial model.
Now I'll turn the call back over to Jim for his closing remarks."

So that means that we will proceed with a standard IDN rollout for all of our -- the standard rollout for all of our IDNs, which does not require any ICANN approval. I think the important difference here in today's news versus what we talked about to you a quarter ago is that we no longer are waiting or require any ICANN approval, and we have some more certainty around the timing in rollout. We know what we need to do now. We have these set activities that proceed an actual rollout.

But as far as the individual nuances for the net zone, some of those factors harken back to promotions that registrars may have run a year ago, and their expected renewal rates and effectiveness of those programs. Other issues may go to programs running this year that are driving net adds. And so it's really a confluence of obviously adds and deletes. You're probably seeing more volatility all in the sense that the net adds in each quarter -- from several years ago are small than they used to be -- than they are currently. But we saw 500,000 net adds in the second quarter. As you can see, our guidance, we're expecting just like last year, the third quarter, the continue to improve quarter over quarter. And we still see strong demand for our product globally."

And since we run the registry -- we would be running the register for both .com and for .verisign, for us is the same reliable platform. But we do see -- we do -- we are aware of some brands, who -- in fact, most of the .Brand said have applied, many of them are our back-end registry customers. So they're not only keeping their .com, but they're also moving their .Brand onto our platform to make sure they run on the same reliable, 18 years of 100% availability infrastructure that we operate.

I'm pleased to report another solid quarter for VeriSign. Second quarter results were in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers, while generating profitable growth and building long-term value for our shareholders. We reported revenue of $263 million, up 4.9% year-over-year, and we delivered strong financial performance, including $171 million in free cash flow. We processed 8.7 million new registrations during the second quarter and added 0.52 million net new names, ending with 133.5 million .com and .net domain names in the domain name base.
Our financial position is strong with $1.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. Our track record of returning cash to shareholders continued during the second quarter as we repurchased 2.5 million shares for $156 million. As of June 30, 2015, we have $761 million remaining in our share repurchase program, which has no expiration. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases.
Before I get into the second quarter results, I want to provide a few updates since our last earnings call. Today, we announced an increase in the annual wholesale fee for a .net domain name registration, as allowed by our agreement with ICANN. As of February 1, 2016, the annual wholesale fee for a .net domain name registration will increase from $6.79 to $7.46. As of the end of Q2, there were approximately 15 million .net registered names.
Also, as you recall, one way VeriSign has been participating in ICANN's new gTLD program was by applying for internationalized domain name versions of common net. Based primarily on feedback from domain name community stakeholders, we have revised our IDN launch strategy. We will offer these new IDN top-level domains as stand-alone domain names, subject to normal introductory availability and rights protection mechanisms available to all new gTLDs. This revised approach will not require ICANN approval and is designed to provide end users and businesses with the greatest flexibility, and for registrars, a simple and straightforward framework to serve the market. Finally, we believe this approach would provide the best opportunity for increased universal acceptance of IDNs. We expect to begin a phased rollout of the IDNs towards the end of this year, and we'll provide more information on our launch plans when appropriate.
I'll comment now on second quarter operating highlights. At the end of June, the domain name base and common net was 133.5 million, consisting of 118.5 million names for .com and 15 million names for .net. This represents an increase of 3.1% year-over-year, as calculated, including domain names on hold for both periods. In the second quarter, we added 0.52 million net names to the domain name base after processing 8.7 million new gross registrations.
In the first quarter of 2015, the renewal rate was 73.4%, compared with 72.6% for the first quarter of 2014. While renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the second quarter of 2015 will be approximately 72.6%. This preliminary rate compares favorably to 71.8% achieved in the second quarter of 2014.
As we discussed over the last few quarters, there are many factors that drive domain name growth. These include Internet adoption, economic activity, eCommerce activity and registrar go-to-market strategies. Based on these and other factors, we are forecasting third quarter 2015 net additions to the domain name base to be between 0.6 million and 1.1 million names. As noted in prior calls, updates to the domain name base are posted on our website at least once per day and reflect the definition change to include on-hold-status names, as we discussed during our February earnings call. This website allows you to track the domain name base throughout the coming quarter.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to George."

During the second quarter, we generated revenue of $263 million, up 4.9% year-over-year, and delivered GAAP operating income of $149 million, up 4.1% from $143 million in the second quarter of 2014. The GAAP operating margin in the quarter came to 56.7%, compared to 57.2% in the same quarter a year ago. GAAP net income totaled $93 million, compared to $100 million a year earlier, which produced diluted GAAP earnings per share of $0.70 in the second quarter this year, compared to $0.71 for the second quarter last year. GAAP net income was lower year-over-year, primarily based on an increase in interest expense related to the new senior notes and contingent interest on the convertible debentures.
As of June 30, 2015, the company maintained total assets of $2.6 billion. These assets included $1.9 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which $844 million were held domestically, with the remainder held internationally. Total liabilities were $3.6 billion at the quarter end, up from $3 billion at the end of 2014.
I'll now review some of our key second quarter operating metrics, which are revenue, deferred revenue, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I'll then discuss our 2015 full year guidance.
As mentioned, revenue totaled $263 million for the second quarter. 61% of our revenue was derived from customers in the United States and 39% was from international customers. Deferred revenue at the end of the second quarter totaled $932 million, a $41 million increase from year-end 2014.
Second quarter non-GAAP operating expenses, which exclude $12 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $102 million, down from $104 million in the first quarter of 2015 and compared with $98 million in the same quarter a year ago.
Non-GAAP operating margin for the second quarter was 61.3%, compared to 60.9% in the same quarter of 2014. Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter was $99 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.74 using a weighted average diluted share count of 133.3 million shares. This compares to $0.68 in the second quarter of 2014 and $0.74 last quarter using 141.1 million and 133.8 million weighted average diluted shares, respectively. Year-over-year, non-GAAP earnings per share improved primarily due to a lower share count and the use of a 26% non-GAAP tax rate this year, compared with last year's 28% non-GAAP tax rate.
Operating cash flow and free cash flow for the second quarter were $175 million and $171 million, respectively, compared with $121 million and $129 million, respectively, for the second quarter last year. The year-over-year increase in cash flow was primarily related to last year's second quarter international cash tax payment related to the offshore repatriation of cash.
Also, as we have discussed on recent earnings calls, we expect our cash tax rate to stay well below our tax rate used for non-GAAP calculations for at least the next several years. In 2015, we still expect to pay cash taxes of approximately $35 million to $45 million. Substantially, all of the expected cash taxes in 2015 are international.
With respect to our full year 2015 guidance, revenue for 2015 is now expected to be in the range of $1,045,000,000 to $1,055,000,000, representing an annual growth rate of 3.5% to 4.5%. This revenue range is narrowed from the $1,043,000,000 to $1,057,000,000 given on our last call. Non-GAAP gross margin is still expected to be at least 80%.
Full year 2015 non-GAAP operating margin is also still expected to be between 60% and 62%. Our non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP nonoperating income net is still expected to be an expense of between $104 million and $110 million. Capital expenditures for the year are also still expected to be between $40 million and $50 million. Our guidance is based on expectations about the outlook of our business, in addition to our financial projections for interest income and expense.
In summary, the company continued to demonstrate sound financial performance in the second quarter. We have grown non-GAAP operating income, operating cash flow and free cash flow. We have maintained a strong financial position and expect strong operating cash flow generation to continue as a result of our financial model.
Now I'll turn the call back over to Jim for his closing remarks."

But as far as the individual nuances for the net zone, some of those factors harken back to promotions that registrars may have run a year ago and their respective renewal rates and effectiveness of those programs. Other issues may go to programs running this year that are driving net adds. And so it's really a confluence of, obviously, adds and deletes. You're probably seeing more volatility all in the sense that the net adds in each quarter from several years ago are small than they used to be -- they are currently. But we saw 500,000 net adds in the second quarter. As you can see, our guidance, we're expecting just like last year, the third quarter, to continue to improve quarter-over-quarter.

We'd never abandon it. And since we run the registry for -- we would be running the registry for both .com and for .verisign, for us, it's the same reliable platform. But we do see -- we do -- we are aware of some brands, who -- in fact, most of the .brands that have applied, many of them are our back-end registry customers. So they're not only keeping their .com, but they're also moving their .brand onto our platform to make sure they run on the same reliable, 18 years of 100% availability infrastructure that we operate.

I'm pleased to report another solid quarter for VeriSign. Second quarter results were in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers, while generating profitable growth and building long-term value for our shareholders. We reported revenue of $263 million, up 4.9% year-over-year, and we delivered strong financial performance, including $171 million in free cash flow. We processed 8.7 million new registrations during the second quarter and added 0.52 million net new names, ending with 133.5 million .com and .net domain names in the domain name base.
Our financial position is strong with $1.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. Our track record of returning cash to shareholders continued during the second quarter as we repurchased 2.5 million shares for $156 million. As of June 30, 2015, we have $761 million remaining in our share repurchase program, which has no expiration. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases.
Before I get into the second quarter results, I want to provide a few updates since our last earnings call. Today, we announced an increase in the annual wholesale fee for a .net domain name registration, as allowed by our agreement with ICANN. As of February 1, 2016, the annual wholesale fee for a .net domain name registration will increase from $6.79 to $7.46. As of the end of Q2, there were approximately 15 million .net registered names.
Also, as you recall, one way VeriSign has been participating in ICANN's new gTLD program was by applying for internationalized domain name versions of common net. Based primarily on feedback from domain name community stakeholders, we have revised our IDN launch strategy. We will offer these new IDN top-level domains as stand-alone domain names, subject to normal introductory availability and rights protection mechanisms available to all new gTLDs. This revised approach will not require ICANN approval and is designed to provide end users and businesses with the greatest flexibility, and for registrars, a simple and straightforward framework to serve the market. Finally, we believe this approach would provide the best opportunity for increased universal acceptance of IDNs. We expect to begin a phased rollout of the IDNs towards the end of this year, and we'll provide more information on our launch plans when appropriate.
I'll comment now on second quarter operating highlights. At the end of June, the domain name base and common net was 133.5 million, consisting of 118.5 million names for .com and 15 million names for .net. This represents an increase of 3.1% year-over-year, as calculated, including domain names on hold for both periods. In the second quarter, we added 0.52 million net names to the domain name base after processing 8.7 million new gross registrations.
In the first quarter of 2015, the renewal rate was 73.4%, compared with 72.6% for the first quarter of 2014. While renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the second quarter of 2015 will be approximately 72.6%. This preliminary rate compares favorably to 71.8% achieved in the second quarter of 2014.
As we discussed over the last few quarters, there are many factors that drive domain name growth. These include Internet adoption, economic activity, eCommerce activity and registrar go-to-market strategies. Based on these and other factors, we are forecasting third quarter 2015 net additions to the domain name base to be between 0.6 million and 1.1 million names. As noted in prior calls, updates to the domain name base are posted on our website at least once per day and reflect the definition change to include on-hold-status names, as we discussed during our February earnings call. This website allows you to track the domain name base throughout the coming quarter.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to George."

During the second quarter, we generated revenue of $263 million, up 4.9% year-over-year, and delivered GAAP operating income of $149 million, up 4.1% from $143 million in the second quarter of 2014. The GAAP operating margin in the quarter came to 56.7%, compared to 57.2% in the same quarter a year ago. GAAP net income totaled $93 million, compared to $100 million a year earlier, which produced diluted GAAP earnings per share of $0.70 in the second quarter this year, compared to $0.71 for the second quarter last year. GAAP net income was lower year-over-year, primarily based on an increase in interest expense related to the new senior notes and contingent interest on the convertible debentures.
As of June 30, 2015, the company maintained total assets of $2.6 billion. These assets included $1.9 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which $844 million were held domestically, with the remainder held internationally. Total liabilities were $3.6 billion at the quarter end, up from $3 billion at the end of 2014.
I'll now review some of our key second quarter operating metrics, which are revenue, deferred revenue, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I'll then discuss our 2015 full year guidance.
As mentioned, revenue totaled $263 million for the second quarter. 61% of our revenue was derived from customers in the United States and 39% was from international customers. Deferred revenue at the end of the second quarter totaled $932 million, a $41 million increase from year-end 2014.
Second quarter non-GAAP operating expenses, which exclude $12 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $102 million, down from $104 million in the first quarter of 2015 and compared with $98 million in the same quarter a year ago.
Non-GAAP operating margin for the second quarter was 61.3%, compared to 60.9% in the same quarter of 2014. Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter was $99 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.74 using a weighted average diluted share count of 133.3 million shares. This compares to $0.68 in the second quarter of 2014 and $0.74 last quarter using 141.1 million and 133.8 million weighted average diluted shares, respectively. Year-over-year, non-GAAP earnings per share improved primarily due to a lower share count and the use of a 26% non-GAAP tax rate this year, compared with last year's 28% non-GAAP tax rate.
Operating cash flow and free cash flow for the second quarter were $175 million and $171 million, respectively, compared with $121 million and $129 million, respectively, for the second quarter last year. The year-over-year increase in cash flow was primarily related to last year's second quarter international cash tax payment related to the offshore repatriation of cash.
Also, as we have discussed on recent earnings calls, we expect our cash tax rate to stay well below our tax rate used for non-GAAP calculations for at least the next several years. In 2015, we still expect to pay cash taxes of approximately $35 million to $45 million. Substantially, all of the expected cash taxes in 2015 are international.
With respect to our full year 2015 guidance, revenue for 2015 is now expected to be in the range of $1,045,000,000 to $1,055,000,000, representing an annual growth rate of 3.5% to 4.5%. This revenue range is narrowed from the $1,043,000,000 to $1,057,000,000 given on our last call. Non-GAAP gross margin is still expected to be at least 80%.
Full year 2015 non-GAAP operating margin is also still expected to be between 60% and 62%. Our non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP nonoperating income net is still expected to be an expense of between $104 million and $110 million. Capital expenditures for the year are also still expected to be between $40 million and $50 million. Our guidance is based on expectations about the outlook of our business, in addition to our financial projections for interest income and expense.
In summary, the company continued to demonstrate sound financial performance in the second quarter. We have grown non-GAAP operating income, operating cash flow and free cash flow. We have maintained a strong financial position and expect strong operating cash flow generation to continue as a result of our financial model.
Now I'll turn the call back over to Jim for his closing remarks."

Just this past week, we marked 100 -- we marked 18 continuous years of 100% availability of the .com and .net DNS. This peerless record is due to the expertise of our people and our specialized infrastructure. As businesses and economic activity rely increasingly on digital infrastructure, availability will become more and more important.

Other issues may go to programs running this year that are driving net adds. And so it's really a confluence of, obviously, adds and deletes. You're probably seeing more volatility all in the sense that the net adds in each quarter from several years ago are small than they used to be -- they are currently.

I'm pleased to report another solid quarter for VeriSign. Second quarter results were in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers, while generating profitable growth and building long-term value for our shareholders. We reported revenue of $263 million, up 4.9% year-over-year, and we delivered strong financial performance, including $171 million in free cash flow. We processed 8.7 million new registrations during the second quarter and added 0.52 million net new names, ending with 133.5 million .com and .net domain names in the domain name base.
Our financial position is strong with $1.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. Our track record of returning cash to shareholders continued during the second quarter as we repurchased 2.5 million shares for $156 million. As of June 30, 2015, we have $761 million remaining in our share repurchase program, which has no expiration. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases.
Before I get into the second quarter results, I want to provide a few updates since our last earnings call. Today, we announced an increase in the annual wholesale fee for a .net domain name registration, as allowed by our agreement with ICANN. As of February 1, 2016, the annual wholesale fee for a .net domain name registration will increase from $6.79 to $7.46. As of the end of Q2, there were approximately 15 million .net registered names.
Also, as you recall, one way VeriSign has been participating in ICANN's new gTLD program was by applying for internationalized domain name versions of common net. Based primarily on feedback from domain name community stakeholders, we have revised our IDN launch strategy. We will offer these new IDN top-level domains as stand-alone domain names, subject to normal introductory availability and rights protection mechanisms available to all new gTLDs. This revised approach will not require ICANN approval and is designed to provide end users and businesses with the greatest flexibility, and for registrars, a simple and straightforward framework to serve the market. Finally, we believe this approach would provide the best opportunity for increased universal acceptance of IDNs. We expect to begin a phased rollout of the IDNs towards the end of this year, and we'll provide more information on our launch plans when appropriate.
I'll comment now on second quarter operating highlights. At the end of June, the domain name base and common net was 133.5 million, consisting of 118.5 million names for .com and 15 million names for .net. This represents an increase of 3.1% year-over-year, as calculated, including domain names on hold for both periods. In the second quarter, we added 0.52 million net names to the domain name base after processing 8.7 million new gross registrations.
In the first quarter of 2015, the renewal rate was 73.4%, compared with 72.6% for the first quarter of 2014. While renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the second quarter of 2015 will be approximately 72.6%. This preliminary rate compares favorably to 71.8% achieved in the second quarter of 2014.
As we discussed over the last few quarters, there are many factors that drive domain name growth. These include Internet adoption, economic activity, eCommerce activity and registrar go-to-market strategies. Based on these and other factors, we are forecasting third quarter 2015 net additions to the domain name base to be between 0.6 million and 1.1 million names. As noted in prior calls, updates to the domain name base are posted on our website at least once per day and reflect the definition change to include on-hold-status names, as we discussed during our February earnings call. This website allows you to track the domain name base throughout the coming quarter.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to George."

During the second quarter, we generated revenue of $263 million, up 4.9% year-over-year, and delivered GAAP operating income of $149 million, up 4.1% from $143 million in the second quarter of 2014. The GAAP operating margin in the quarter came to 56.7%, compared to 57.2% in the same quarter a year ago. GAAP net income totaled $93 million, compared to $100 million a year earlier, which produced diluted GAAP earnings per share of $0.70 in the second quarter this year, compared to $0.71 for the second quarter last year. GAAP net income was lower year-over-year, primarily based on an increase in interest expense related to the new senior notes and contingent interest on the convertible debentures.
As of June 30, 2015, the company maintained total assets of $2.6 billion. These assets included $1.9 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which $844 million were held domestically, with the remainder held internationally. Total liabilities were $3.6 billion at the quarter end, up from $3 billion at the end of 2014.
I'll now review some of our key second quarter operating metrics, which are revenue, deferred revenue, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I'll then discuss our 2015 full year guidance.
As mentioned, revenue totaled $263 million for the second quarter. 61% of our revenue was derived from customers in the United States and 39% was from international customers. Deferred revenue at the end of the second quarter totaled $932 million, a $41 million increase from year-end 2014.
Second quarter non-GAAP operating expenses, which exclude $12 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $102 million, down from $104 million in the first quarter of 2015 and compared with $98 million in the same quarter a year ago.
Non-GAAP operating margin for the second quarter was 61.3%, compared to 60.9% in the same quarter of 2014. Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter was $99 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.74 using a weighted average diluted share count of 133.3 million shares. This compares to $0.68 in the second quarter of 2014 and $0.74 last quarter using 141.1 million and 133.8 million weighted average diluted shares, respectively. Year-over-year, non-GAAP earnings per share improved primarily due to a lower share count and the use of a 26% non-GAAP tax rate this year, compared with last year's 28% non-GAAP tax rate.
Operating cash flow and free cash flow for the second quarter were $175 million and $171 million, respectively, compared with $121 million and $129 million, respectively, for the second quarter last year. The year-over-year increase in cash flow was primarily related to last year's second quarter international cash tax payment related to the offshore repatriation of cash.
Also, as we have discussed on recent earnings calls, we expect our cash tax rate to stay well below our tax rate used for non-GAAP calculations for at least the next several years. In 2015, we still expect to pay cash taxes of approximately $35 million to $45 million. Substantially, all of the expected cash taxes in 2015 are international.
With respect to our full year 2015 guidance, revenue for 2015 is now expected to be in the range of $1,045,000,000 to $1,055,000,000, representing an annual growth rate of 3.5% to 4.5%. This revenue range is narrowed from the $1,043,000,000 to $1,057,000,000 given on our last call. Non-GAAP gross margin is still expected to be at least 80%.
Full year 2015 non-GAAP operating margin is also still expected to be between 60% and 62%. Our non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP nonoperating income net is still expected to be an expense of between $104 million and $110 million. Capital expenditures for the year are also still expected to be between $40 million and $50 million. Our guidance is based on expectations about the outlook of our business, in addition to our financial projections for interest income and expense.
In summary, the company continued to demonstrate sound financial performance in the second quarter. We have grown non-GAAP operating income, operating cash flow and free cash flow. We have maintained a strong financial position and expect strong operating cash flow generation to continue as a result of our financial model.
Now I'll turn the call back over to Jim for his closing remarks."

So that means that we will proceed with a standard IDN rollout for all of our -- standard TLD rollout for all of our IDNs, which does not require any ICANN approval. I think the important difference here in today's news versus what we talked about to you a quarter ago is that we no longer are waiting or require any ICANN approval, and we have some more certainty around the timing and rollout. We know what we need to do now. We have these set activities that precede an actual rollout.

Clearly, we have varying growth rates in markets around the world, as I mentioned last quarter, and it holds true for this quarter as well. We still see more growth internationally than we do domestic. Our Asia and general markets are growing much faster. But as far as the individual nuances for the net zone, some of those factors harken back to promotions that registrars may have run a year ago and their respective renewal rates and effectiveness of those programs. Other issues may go to programs running this year that are driving net adds. And so it's really a confluence of, obviously, adds and deletes. You're probably seeing more volatility all in the sense that the net adds in each quarter from several years ago are small than they used to be -- they are currently. But we saw 500,000 net adds in the second quarter. As you can see, our guidance, we're expecting just like last year, the third quarter, to continue to improve quarter-over-quarter.

We'd never abandon it. And since we run the registry for -- we would be running the registry for both .com and for .verisign, for us, it's the same reliable platform. But we do see -- we do -- we are aware of some brands, who -- in fact, most of the .brands that have applied, many of them are our back-end registry customers. So they're not only keeping their .com, but they're also moving their .brand onto our platform to make sure they run on the same reliable, 18 years of 100% availability infrastructure that we operate.

I am pleased to report another solid quarter for VeriSign. Third quarter results were in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers, while generating profitable growth and providing long-term value to our shareholders. 
We reported revenue of $266 million, up 4.2% year-over-year, and we delivered strong financial performance, including $157 million in free cash flow. 
We processed 9.2 million new registrations during the third quarter and added 1.68 million net new names ending with 135.2 million .com and .net  domain names in the domain name base. 
Our financial probation is strong with $1.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. 
Our commitment to returning value to shareholders continued during the third quarter as we repurchased 2.3 million shares for $156 million. 
As of September 30, 2015, we have $605 million remaining in our share repurchase program, which has no expiration. 
We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases. 
As discussed on our last call, we're making progress as we prepare to launch the internationalized domain name versions of .com and. net. Our launch preparations are proceeding according to plan as we prepare to begin a phased rollout of the IDNs towards the end of this year. We will provide more information on our launch plans when appropriate. 
I'll comment now on third quarter operating highlights. At the end of September, the domain name base .com and .net was 135.2 million, consisting of 120.1 million name for .com and 15.1 million names for .net. This represents an increase of 3.4% year-over-year as calculated, including domain names on hold for both periods. 
In the third quarter, we added 1.68 million net names to the domain name base after processing 9.2 million new gross registrations. 
In the second quarter of 2015, the renewal rate was 72.7% compared with 71.8% for the same quarter of 2014. 
While renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the third quarter of 2015 will be approximately 71.8%. This preliminary rate compares to 72% -- 72.0% achieved in the third quarter of 2014. 
As we discussed over the last few quarters, there are many factors that drive domain growth. This include Internet adoption, economic activity, eCommerce activity and registrar go-to-market strategies. 
During the third quarter, we saw strength in gross additions coming out of emerging and international markets, particularly in Asia. While we believe these markets will continue to perform well, we believe the pace of activity we saw during the third quarter will slow sequentially in the fourth quarter. 
Also, due to seasonal factors, the fourth quarter tends to have fewer net additions than the third quarter as was seen in the last 2 years. 
Based on these and other factors, we are forecasting fourth quarter 2015 net additions to the domain name base to be between 1.1 million and 1.6 million names. 
As noted in prior calls, updates to the domain name base are posted on our website at least once per day and reflect the definition change to include on hold status names as we discussed during our February earnings call. Our website allows you to track the domain name base throughout the coming quarter. 
And now, I'd like to turn the call over to George."

The GAAP operating margin in the quarter came to 58.1% compared to 54.7% in the same quarter a year ago. 
GAAP net income totaled $92 million, compared to $95 million a year earlier, which produced diluted GAAP earnings per share of $0.70 in the third quarter this year compared to $0.69 for the third quarter last year. 
As of September 30, 2015, the company maintained total assets of $2.6 billion. These assets included $1.9 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which $794 million were held domestically, with the remainder held internationally. 
Total liabilities were $3.6 billion at the quarter end, up from $3 billion at the end of 2014. 
I'll now review some of our key third quarter operating metrics, which are revenue, deferred revenue, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then discuss our 2015 full year guidance. 
As mentioned, revenue totaled $266 million for the third quarter. 60% of our revenue was derived from customers in the U.S. and 40% was from international customers. 
Deferred revenue at the end of the third quarter totaled $940 million, a $50 million increase from year-end 2014. 
Third quarter non-GAAP operating expense, which excludes $12 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $99 million, down from $102 million in the second quarter of 2015 and compared with $101 million in the same quarter a year ago. 
Non-GAAP operating margin for the third quarter was 62.7% compared to 60.6% in the same quarter of 2014. Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter was $103 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.78 based on a weighted average diluted share count of 131.7 million shares. This compares to $0.70 in the third quarter of 2014 and $0.74 last quarter based on 138.1 million and 133.3 million weighted average diluted shares, respectively. 
Operating cash flow and free cash flow for the third quarter were $155 million and $157 million, respectively, compared with $168 million and $150 million, respectively, for the third quarter last year. 
Also, as we've discussed on recent earnings calls, we expect our cash tax rate to stay below our tax rate used for non-GAAP calculations for at least the next several years. 
In 2015, we still expect to pay cash taxes of approximately $35 million to $45 million. Substantially, all of the expected cash taxes in 2015 are international. 
With respect to full year 2015 guidance, revenue for 2015 is now expected to be in the range of $1,050,000,000  to $1,055,000,000, representing an annual growth rate of 4% to 4.5%.  This revenue range is narrowed from the $1,045,000,000 to $1,055,000,000 given on our last call.  Non-GAAP gross margin is still expected to be at least 80%. 
Full year 2015 non-GAAP operating margin is now expected to be between 61% and 62%. This has been narrowed from the 60% to 62% range given on our last call. 
Our non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP nonoperating income net is now expected to be an expense of between $104 million to $108 million, narrowed from the $104 million to $110 million expense range given on our last call. 
Capital expenditures for the year are now expected to be between $37 million and $42 million, changed from $40 million and $50 million range given on our last call. 
In summary, the company continued to demonstrate sound financial performance in the third quarter. We have grown non-GAAP operating margins and non-GAAP net income. We have maintained a strong financial position and expect strong operating cash flow generation to continue as a result of our financial model. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks."

I'd like to expand a bit on what we think that actually means.  I believe the best way to do that is to offer some long-term perspective on VeriSign's performances since the completion of our divestitures 5 years or 20 quarters ago. Our goal then was to simplify the company's business through divestment of non-core assets and to focus on profitability and value creation. 
Since then, revenue has grow sequentially for 20 straight quarters. Non-GAAP EPS has grown steadily from $0.31 in Q4 2010 to $0.78 in Q3 2015. Free cash flow has gone steadily and was $612 million over the trailing 4 quarters. Non-GAAP operating margin has risen steadily, from 44.3% in Q4 2010 to 62.7% in the most recent quarter. 
Over the last 20 quarters, we've returned $4.2 billion to our shareholders. We repurchased over 69 million shares for $3.22 billion, which exceeds our domestic free cash flow for the same period. And in that same timeframe, we've returned $982 million in special dividends, excluding payments to convert holders, triggered by that special dividends. 
Our $2.75 per share dividend in 2011 was a 100% tax-free return of capital. 
We believe the long trendlines of growth in the top and bottom line, along with a consistent track record and returning generated value to our shareholders through effective capital allocation and an efficient capital structure, are what matter most to our shareholders. We believe that proper balance within our strategy framework, protect grow and manage, is what makes it possible for us to deliver this type of consistent, long-term results and simultaneously serve the interest of our shareholders, employees and customers. We intend to continue our steady focus on long-term consistency. 
We will now take your questions. And operator, we're ready for the first question."

What we do know for certain is that we will begin with at least 1 IDN before the end of the year. So there is some ICANN process that does play out here. There is an early period where brand holders have the ability to come in. There may be some early access opportunities for those who wish to get into this tour early, so to speak, but that process will have begun before the end of the year. I expect that certainly by the turn of the year and in Q1, we will be with at least 1, I think that's only thing I could say comfortably without speculating in market. So we are selling and there should be activity, and we should be learning, and we'll have more to talk about when we do talk about Q1 certainly.

There were some delays associated with the .brand, in particular, as ICANN recognize the .brand had needs that were different beyond what ICANN originally anticipated, different needs as opposed to those who are getting into the business of selling domain names. So some contractual issues were worked on between the brand community, ICANN, and additional time was given to the brands I believe I don't have a specific number for you, but a number of brands that engage in that process, some did sign contracts by a deadline. I believe, there was another extension for some additional work by some brands who had special conditions. But we haven't seen a lot of them out in the market yet, but some of them have certainly announced their intentions to roll out their brand TLD. So they're not visible, it's not that active, but there was some quite a bit of activity mostly contract signing with brands. So I would expect that next year, you'll see some .brand in the market."

But there are, in some cases, at least global brands an extraordinarily large amount of traffic associated with their current domain. So it's very easy for them to simply redirect that traffic to it. So this is, I think, you're getting to a question that I've answered in the past, which is that I don't expect these people to adopt brand to abandon .com. They're certainly not going to do that, it is their brand, it is inexpensive for them and there's much investment in branding and traffic. So I expected to be either an experiment or complementary registration, and we'll see how it plays out in the years ahead. But I certainly don't expect people to abandon their .com.

When I look sequentially of changes, there's really nothing that jumps out of me per se in our core, we had a little bit lower depreciation, maybe a little lower travel in our sales and marketing, while it was down sequentially. If you look at the year-to-date 9-month period, it's relatively flat, it's really a timing of when we roll expenses out, we rolled them out those program a little earlier this year than previous years. So you have some inter-quarter variances, but overall, year-to-date, from a sales and marketing, we're pretty much on track. R&D were down a little bit. We've optimized some of our spend in R&D area, and we have a slight headcount decrease and then G&A, we had some legal expenses increased.

I think those are really the important issues. There's always give and takes, as George said, but again, from $102 million a year ago, quarter 2, to $99 million this year, I think it's roughly equivalent in our view.

I am pleased to report another solid quarter for VeriSign. Third quarter results were in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers, while generating profitable growth and providing long-term value to our shareholders.
We reported revenue of $266 million, up 4.2% year-over-year, and we delivered strong financial performance, including $157 million in free cash flow.
We processed 9.2 million new registrations during the third quarter and added 1.68 million net new names, ending with 135.2 million .com and .net  domain names in the domain name base. 
Our financial position is strong with $1.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter.
Our commitment to returning value to shareholders continued during the third quarter as we repurchased 2.3 million shares for $156 million.
As of September 30, 2015, we have $605 million remaining in our share repurchase program, which has no expiration.
We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases.
As discussed on our last call, we're making progress as we prepare to launch the internationalized domain name versions of .com and .net. Our launch preparations are proceeding according to plan as we prepare to begin a phased rollout of the IDNs toward the end of this year. We will provide more information on our launch plans when appropriate.
I'll comment now on the third quarter operating highlights. At the end of September, the domain name base in .com and .net was 135.2 million, consisting of 120.1 million names for .com and 15.1 million names for .net. This represents an increase of 3.4% year-over-year as calculated, including domain names on hold for both periods.
In the third quarter, we added 1.68 million net names to the domain name base after processing 9.2 million new gross registrations. 
In the second quarter of 2015, the renewal rate was 72.7% compared with 71.8% for the same quarter of 2014. While renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the third quarter of 2015 will be approximately 71.8%. This preliminary rate compares to 72% -- 72.0% achieved in the third quarter of 2014.
As we discussed over the last few quarters, there are many factors that drive domain growth. This include Internet adoption, economic activity, eCommerce activity and registrar go-to-market strategies. 
During the third quarter, we saw strength in gross additions coming out of emerging and international markets, particularly in Asia. While we believe these markets will continue to perform well, we believe the pace of activity we saw during the third quarter will slow sequentially in the fourth quarter.
Also, due to seasonal factors, the fourth quarter tends to have fewer net additions than the third quarter as was seen in the last 2 years.
Based on these and other factors, we are forecasting fourth quarter 2015 net additions to the domain name base to be between 1.1 million and 1.6 million names.
As noted in prior calls, updates to the domain name base are posted on our website at least once per day and reflect the definition change to include on hold status names as we discussed during our February earnings call. Our website allows you to track the domain name base throughout the coming quarter.
And now I'd like to turn the call over to George."

During the third quarter, we generated revenue of $266 million, up 4.2% year-over-year; and delivered GAAP operating income of $154 million, up 10.7% from $139 million in the third quarter of 2014.
The GAAP operating margin in the quarter came to 58.1% compared to 54.7% in the same quarter a year ago.
GAAP net income totaled $92 million compared to $95 million a year earlier, which produced diluted GAAP earnings per share of $0.70 in the third quarter this year compared to $0.69 for the third quarter last year.
As of September 30, 2015, the company maintained total assets of $2.6 billion. These assets included $1.9 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which $794 million were held domestically, with the remainder held internationally. 
Total liabilities were $3.6 billion at the quarter end, up from $3 billion at the end of 2014.
I'll now review some of our key third quarter operating metrics, which are revenue, deferred revenue, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then discuss our 2015 full year guidance.
As mentioned, revenue totaled $266 million for the third quarter. 60% of our revenue was derived from customers in the U.S. and 40% was from international customers.
Deferred revenue at the end of the third quarter totaled $940 million, a $50 million increase from year-end 2014.
Third quarter non-GAAP operating expense, which excludes $12 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $99 million, down from $102 million in the second quarter of 2015 and compared with $101 million in the same quarter a year ago.
Non-GAAP operating margin for the third quarter was 62.7% compared to 60.6% in the same quarter of 2014. Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter was $103 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.78 based on a weighted average diluted share count of 131.7 million shares. This compares to $0.70 in the third quarter of 2014 and $0.74 last quarter based on 138.1 million and 133.3 million weighted average diluted shares, respectively.
Operating cash flow and free cash flow for the third quarter were $155 million and $157 million, respectively, compared with $168 million and $150 million, respectively, for the third quarter last year.
Also, as we've discussed on recent earnings calls, we expect our cash tax rate to stay below our tax rate used for non-GAAP calculations for at least the next several years.
In 2015, we still expect to pay cash taxes of approximately $35 million to $45 million. Substantially, all of the expected cash taxes in 2015 are international.
With respect to full year 2015 guidance, revenue for 2015 is now expected to be in the range of $1,050,000,000  to $1,055,000,000, representing an annual growth rate of 4% to 4.5%.  This revenue range is narrowed from the $1,045,000,000 to $1,055,000,000 given on our last call.  Non-GAAP gross margin is still expected to be at least 80%.
Full year 2015 non-GAAP operating margin is now expected to be between 61% and 62%. This has been narrowed from the 60% to 62% range given on our last call.
Our non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP nonoperating income net is now expected to be an expense of between $104 million to $108 million, narrowed from the $104 million to $110 million expense range given on our last call.
Capital expenditures for the year are now expected to be between $37 million and $42 million, changed from $40 million and $50 million range given on our last call.
In summary, the company continued to demonstrate sound financial performance in the third quarter. We have grown non-GAAP operating margins and non-GAAP net income. We have maintained a strong financial position and expect strong operating cash flow generation to continue as a result of our financial model.
Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks."

I'd like to expand a bit on what we think that actually means.  I believe the best way to do that is to offer some long-term perspective on VeriSign's performance since the completion of our divestitures 5 years or 20 quarters ago. Our goal then was to simplify the company's business through divestment of noncore assets and to focus on profitability and value creation.
Since then, revenue has grow sequentially for 20 straight quarters. Non-GAAP EPS has grown steadily from $0.31 in Q4 2010 to $0.78 in Q3 2015. Free cash flow has gone steadily and was $612 million over the trailing 4 quarters. Non-GAAP operating margin has risen steadily, from 44.3% in Q4 2010 to 62.7% in the most recent quarter.
Over the last 20 quarters, we've returned $4.2 billion to our shareholders. We repurchased over 69 million shares for $3.22 billion, which exceeds our domestic free cash flow for the same period. And in that same time frame, we returned $982 million in special dividends, excluding payments to convert holders, triggered by that special dividends.
Our $2.75 per share dividend in 2011 was a 100% tax-free return of capital.
We believe the long trend lines of growth in the top and bottom line, along with a consistent track record in returning generated value to our shareholders through effective capital allocation and an efficient capital structure, are what matter most to our shareholders. We believe that proper balance within our strategy framework, protect, grow and manage, is what makes it possible for us to deliver this type of consistent, long-term results and simultaneously serve the interest of our shareholders, employees and customers. We intend to continue our steady focus on long-term consistency.
We'll now take your questions. And operator, we're ready for the first question."

What we do know for certain is that we will begin with at least 1 IDN before the end of the year. So there is some ICANN process that does play out here. There's an early period where brand holders have the ability to come in. There may be some early access opportunities for those who wish to get into the store early, so to speak. But that process will have begun before the end of the year. I expect that certainly by the turn of the year and in Q1, we will be with at least 1.

I haven't -- I don't have a specific number for you, but a number of brands that engage in that process, some did sign contracts by a deadline. I believe there was another extension for some additional work by some brands who had special conditions.

But there are, in some cases, at least global brands, an extraordinarily large amount of traffic associated with their current domain. So it's very easy for them to simply redirect that traffic to it. So this is -- I think you're getting to a question that I've answered in the past, which is that I don't expect these people to get a .brand to abandon a .com. They certainly aren't going to do that. It is their brand. It's inexpensive for them and there's a heavy investment in branding and traffic. So I expect it to be either an experiment or complementary registration, and we'll see how it plays out in the years ahead. But I certainly don't expect people to abandon their .coms.

We had a little bit lower depreciation, maybe a little lower travel in our sales and marketing, while it was down sequentially. If you look at the year-to-date 9-month period, it's relatively flat. It's really a timing of when we roll expenses out. We roll them out -- those programs a little earlier this year than previous years. So you have some inter-quarter variances. But overall, year-to-date, from a sales and marketing, we're pretty much on track. R&D were down a little bit. We've optimized some of our spend in our R&D area, and we have a slight headcount decrease. And then G&A, we had some legal expenses increased.

I think those are really the important issues. There are always gives and takes, as George said. But again, from $102 million the year-ago quarter to $99 million this year, I think, is roughly equivalent, in our view. It allows us to continue the trend lines that we're really focused on."

I am pleased to report another solid quarter for VeriSign. Third quarter results were in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers, while generating profitable growth and providing long-term value to our shareholders.
We reported revenue of $266 million, up 4.2% year-over-year, and we delivered strong financial performance, including $157 million in free cash flow.
We processed 9.2 million new registrations during the third quarter and added 1.68 million .net new names, ending with 135.2 million .com and .net  domain names in the domain name base. 
Our financial position is strong with $1.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter.
Our commitment to returning value to shareholders continued during the third quarter as we repurchased 2.3 million shares for $156 million.
As of September 30, 2015, we have $605 million remaining in our share repurchase program, which has no expiration.
We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases.
As discussed on our last call, we're making progress as we prepare to launch the internationalized domain name versions of .com and .net. Our launch preparations are proceeding according to plan as we prepare to begin a phased rollout of the IDNs toward the end of this year. We will provide more information on our launch plans when appropriate.
I'll comment now on the third quarter operating highlights. At the end of September, the domain name base in .com and .net was 135.2 million, consisting of 120.1 million names for .com and 15.1 million names for .net. This represents an increase of 3.4% year-over-year as calculated, including domain names on hold for both periods.
In the third quarter, we added 1.68 million net names to the domain name base after processing 9.2 million new gross registrations. 
In the second quarter of 2015, the renewal rate was 72.7% compared with 71.8% for the same quarter of 2014. While renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the third quarter of 2015 will be approximately 71.8%. This preliminary rate compares to 72% -- 72.0% achieved in the third quarter of 2014.
As we discussed over the last few quarters, there are many factors that drive domain growth. These include Internet adoption, economic activity, eCommerce activity and registrar go-to-market strategies. 
During the third quarter, we saw strength in gross additions coming out of emerging and international markets, particularly in Asia. While we believe these markets will continue to perform well, we believe the pace of activity we saw during the third quarter will slow sequentially in the fourth quarter.
Also, due to seasonal factors, the fourth quarter tends to have fewer net additions than the third quarter as was seen in the last 2 years.
Based on these and other factors, we are forecasting fourth quarter 2015 net additions to the domain name base to be between 1.1 million and 1.6 million names.
As noted in prior calls, updates to the domain name base are posted on our website at least once per day and reflect the definition change to include on hold status names as we discussed during our February earnings call. Our website allows you to track the domain name base throughout the coming quarter.
And now I'd like to turn the call over to George."

During the third quarter, we generated revenue of $266 million, up 4.2% year-over-year; and delivered GAAP operating income of $154 million, up 10.7% from $139 million in the third quarter of 2014.
The GAAP operating margin in the quarter came to 58.1% compared to 54.7% in the same quarter a year ago.
GAAP net income totaled $92 million compared to $95 million a year earlier, which produced diluted GAAP earnings per share of $0.70 in the third quarter this year compared to $0.69 for the third quarter last year.
As of September 30, 2015, the company maintained total assets of $2.6 billion. These assets included $1.9 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which $794 million were held domestically, with the remainder held internationally. 
Total liabilities were $3.6 billion at the quarter end, up from $3 billion at the end of 2014.
I'll now review some of our key third quarter operating metrics, which are revenue, deferred revenue, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then discuss our 2015 full year guidance.
As mentioned, revenue totaled $266 million for the third quarter. 60% of our revenue was derived from customers in the U.S. and 40% was from international customers.
Deferred revenue at the end of the third quarter totaled $940 million, a $50 million increase from year-end 2014.
Third quarter non-GAAP operating expense, which excludes $12 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $99 million, down from $102 million in the second quarter of 2015 and compared with $101 million in the same quarter a year ago.
Non-GAAP operating margin for the third quarter was 62.7% compared to 60.6% in the same quarter of 2014. Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter was $103 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.78 based on a weighted average diluted share count of 131.7 million shares. This compares to $0.70 in the third quarter of 2014 and $0.74 last quarter based on 138.1 million and 133.3 million weighted average diluted shares, respectively.
Operating cash flow and free cash flow for the third quarter were $155 million and $157 million, respectively, compared with $168 million and $150 million, respectively, for the third quarter last year.
Also, as we've discussed on recent earnings calls, we expect our cash tax rate to stay below our tax rate used for non-GAAP calculations for at least the next several years.
In 2015, we still expect to pay cash taxes of approximately $35 million to $45 million. Substantially, all of the expected cash taxes in 2015 are international.
With respect to full year 2015 guidance, revenue for 2015 is now expected to be in the range of $1,050,000,000  to $1,055,000,000, representing an annual growth rate of 4% to 4.5%.  This revenue range is narrowed from the $1,045,000,000 to $1,055,000,000 given on our last call.  Non-GAAP gross margin is still expected to be at least 80%.
Full year 2015 non-GAAP operating margin is now expected to be between 61% and 62%. This has been narrowed from the 60% to 62% range given on our last call.
Our non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP nonoperating income net is now expected to be an expense of between $104 million to $108 million, narrowed from the $104 million to $110 million expense range given on our last call.
Capital expenditures for the year are now expected to be between $37 million and $42 million, changed from $40 million and $50 million range given on our last call.
In summary, the company continued to demonstrate sound financial performance in the third quarter. We have grown non-GAAP operating margins and non-GAAP net income. We have maintained a strong financial position and expect strong operating cash flow generation to continue as a result of our financial model.
Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks."

I'd like to expand a bit on what we think that actually means.  I believe the best way to do that is to offer some long-term perspective on VeriSign's performance since the completion of our divestitures 5 years or 20 quarters ago. Our goal then was to simplify the company's business through divestment of non-core assets and to focus on profitability and value creation.
Since then, revenue has grown sequentially for 20 straight quarters. Non-GAAP EPS has grown steadily from $0.31 in Q4 2010 to $0.78 in Q3 2015. Free cash flow has gone steadily and was $612 million over the trailing 4 quarters. Non-GAAP operating margin has risen steadily, from 44.3% in Q4 2010 to 62.7% in the most recent quarter.
Over the last 20 quarters, we've returned $4.2 billion to our shareholders. We repurchased over 69 million shares for $3.22 billion, which exceeds our domestic free cash flow for the same period. And in that same time frame, we returned $982 million in special dividends, excluding payments to convert holders, triggered by that special dividend.
Our $2.75 per share dividend in 2011 was a 100% tax-free return of capital.
We believe the long trend lines of growth in the top and bottom line, along with a consistent track record in returning generated value to our shareholders through effective capital allocation and an efficient capital structure, are what matter most to our shareholders. We believe that proper balance within our strategy framework, protect, grow and manage, is what makes it possible for us to deliver this type of consistent, long-term result and simultaneously serve the interest of our shareholders, employees and customers. We intend to continue our steady focus on long-term consistency.
We'll now take your questions. And operator, we're ready for the first question."

It seems to accelerate in the quarter, we're having a good month to date as well over there. So we'll monitor that activity. But we've been -- we got it up for the fourth quarter versus last year. We're guiding 1.1 million to 1.6 million. But good demand out of the Asia region is what we're seeing over there."

I will say that I think when we're talking to you a quarter from now, obviously, the beginning of the rollout with the first IDN or IDNs at that time will give us some things to talk to you about. And I'm sure when we're talking about Q1 2015, by then, we'll actually have been in market, we'll be beyond rollout, we'll be in market. And we'll certainly have more data for you and more to talk about then. So early now to speculate about any of those things.

There's going to be a phased rollout that's based on our preparations, market analysis, readiness, ICANN process, a lot of different factors that will go into that. What we do know for certain is that we will begin with at least 1 IDN before the end of the year. So there is some ICANN process that does play out here. There's an early period where brand holders have the ability to come in. There may be some early access opportunities for those who wish to get into the store early, so to speak. But that process will have begun before the end of the year. I expect that certainly by the turn of the year and in Q1, we will be with at least 1. I think that's the only thing I can say comfortably without speculating in market. So we will be selling, and there should be activity and we should be learning. And we'll have more to talk about when we do talk about Q1, certainly. And more to talk about after Q4 but a lot more to talk about after Q1."

There were some delays associated with .brands, in particular, as ICANN recognize that .brands had needs that were different beyond what ICANN had originally anticipated, different needs as opposed to those who are getting into the business of selling domain names. So some contractual issues were worked on between the brand community and ICANN. And additional time was given to the brands, I believe. I haven't -- I don't have a specific number for you, but a number of brands that engaged in that process, some did sign contracts by a deadline. I believe there was another extension for some additional work by some brands who had special conditions. But we haven't seen a lot of them out in the market yet, but some of them have certainly announced their intentions to roll out their brand TLD. So they're not visible. It's not that active. But there was some -- quite a bit of activity, mostly contract signing with brands. So I would expect that next year, you'll see some .brands in the market."

I think to use a metaphor that may not be exactly perfect but I think will give you the idea, if you had a telephone number that you have invested heavily for years extensively in creating awareness for people to order, just to call you and order your product and you -- a different number became available, and you opted for that, if it cost you $7.85 a year to continue to forward your old number to your new one, you do that for as long as you have any number of people calling it. But there are, in some cases, of these global brands, an extraordinarily large amount of traffic associated with their current domain. So it's very easy for them to simply redirect that traffic to it. So this is -- I think you're getting to a question that I've answered in the past, which is that I don't expect these people to get a .brand to abandon a .com. They certainly aren't going to do that. It is their brand. It's inexpensive for them and there's a heavy investment in branding and traffic. So I expect it to be either an experiment or complementary registration, and we'll see how it plays out in the years ahead. But I certainly don't expect people to abandon their .coms. I just don't think that's going to happen."

When I look sequentially of changes, there's really nothing that jumps out of me per se in our core. We had a little bit lower depreciation, maybe a little lower travel in our sales and marketing, while it was down sequentially. If you look at the year-to-date 9-month period, it's relatively flat. There's really a timing of when we roll expenses out. We rolled them out -- those programs a little earlier this year than previous years. So you have some inter-quarter variances. But overall, year-to-date, from a sales and marketing, we're pretty much on track. R&D were down a little bit. We've optimized some of our spend in our R&D area, and we have a slight headcount decrease. And then G&A, we had some legal expenses increased. But overall, if you read our 10-Q, we expect those major categories to be consistent over the next quarters with what we've just rolled out there or just produced."

I am pleased to report another solid quarter for VeriSign. Third quarter results were in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers, while generating profitable growth and providing long-term value to our shareholders.
We reported revenue of $266 million, up 4.2% year-over-year, and we delivered strong financial performance, including $157 million in free cash flow.
We processed 9.2 million new registrations during the third quarter and added 1.68 million .net new names, ending with 135.2 million .com and .net  domain names in the domain name base. 
Our financial position is strong with $1.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter.
Our commitment to returning value to shareholders continued during the third quarter as we repurchased 2.3 million shares for $156 million.
As of September 30, 2015, we have $605 million remaining in our share repurchase program, which has no expiration.
We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases.
As discussed on our last call, we're making progress as we prepare to launch the internationalized domain name versions of .com and .net. Our launch preparations are proceeding according to plan as we prepare to begin a phased rollout of the IDNs toward the end of this year. We will provide more information on our launch plans when appropriate.
I'll comment now on the third quarter operating highlights. At the end of September, the domain name base in .com and .net was 135.2 million, consisting of 120.1 million names for .com and 15.1 million names for .net. This represents an increase of 3.4% year-over-year as calculated, including domain names on hold for both periods.
In the third quarter, we added 1.68 million net names to the domain name base after processing 9.2 million new gross registrations. 
In the second quarter of 2015, the renewal rate was 72.7% compared with 71.8% for the same quarter of 2014. While renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the third quarter of 2015 will be approximately 71.8%. This preliminary rate compares to 72% -- 72.0% achieved in the third quarter of 2014.
As we discussed over the last few quarters, there are many factors that drive domain growth. These include Internet adoption, economic activity, eCommerce activity and registrar go-to-market strategies. 
During the third quarter, we saw strength in gross additions coming out of emerging and international markets, particularly in Asia. While we believe these markets will continue to perform well, we believe the pace of activity we saw during the third quarter will slow sequentially in the fourth quarter.
Also, due to seasonal factors, the fourth quarter tends to have fewer net additions than the third quarter as was seen in the last 2 years.
Based on these and other factors, we are forecasting fourth quarter 2015 net additions to the domain name base to be between 1.1 million and 1.6 million names.
As noted in prior calls, updates to the domain name base are posted on our website at least once per day and reflect the definition change to include on hold status names as we discussed during our February earnings call. Our website allows you to track the domain name base throughout the coming quarter.
And now I'd like to turn the call over to George."

The GAAP operating margin in the quarter came to 58.1% compared to 54.7% in the same quarter a year ago.
GAAP net income totaled $92 million compared to $95 million a year earlier, which produced diluted GAAP earnings per share of $0.70 in the third quarter this year compared to $0.69 for the third quarter last year.
As of September 30, 2015, the company maintained total assets of $2.6 billion. These assets included $1.9 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which $794 million were held domestically, with the remainder held internationally. 
Total liabilities were $3.6 billion at the quarter end, up from $3 billion at the end of 2014.
I'll now review some of our key third quarter operating metrics, which are revenue, deferred revenue, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then discuss our 2015 full year guidance.
As mentioned, revenue totaled $266 million for the third quarter. 60% of our revenue was derived from customers in the U.S. and 40% was from international customers.
Deferred revenue at the end of the third quarter totaled $940 million, a $50 million increase from year-end 2014.
Third quarter non-GAAP operating expense, which excludes $12 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $99 million, down from $102 million in the second quarter of 2015 and compared with $101 million in the same quarter a year ago.
Non-GAAP operating margin for the third quarter was 62.7% compared to 60.6% in the same quarter of 2014. Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter was $103 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.78 based on a weighted average diluted share count of 131.7 million shares. This compares to $0.70 in the third quarter of 2014 and $0.74 last quarter based on 138.1 million and 133.3 million weighted average diluted shares, respectively.
Operating cash flow and free cash flow for the third quarter were $155 million and $157 million, respectively, compared with $168 million and $150 million, respectively, for the third quarter last year.
Also, as we've discussed on recent earnings calls, we expect our cash tax rate to stay below our tax rate used for non-GAAP calculations for at least the next several years.
In 2015, we still expect to pay cash taxes of approximately $35 million to $45 million. Substantially, all of the expected cash taxes in 2015 are international.
With respect to full year 2015 guidance, revenue for 2015 is now expected to be in the range of $1,050,000,000  to $1,055,000,000, representing an annual growth rate of 4% to 4.5%.  This revenue range is narrowed from the $1,045,000,000 to $1,055,000,000 given on our last call.  Non-GAAP gross margin is still expected to be at least 80%.
Full year 2015 non-GAAP operating margin is now expected to be between 61% and 62%. This has been narrowed from the 60% to 62% range given on our last call.
Our non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP nonoperating income net is now expected to be an expense of between $104 million to $108 million, narrowed from the $104 million to $110 million expense range given on our last call.
Capital expenditures for the year are now expected to be between $37 million and $42 million, changed from $40 million and $50 million range given on our last call.
In summary, the company continued to demonstrate sound financial performance in the third quarter. We have grown non-GAAP operating margins and non-GAAP net income. We have maintained a strong financial position and expect strong operating cash flow generation to continue as a result of our financial model.
Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks."

I'd like to expand a bit on what we think that actually means.  I believe the best way to do that is to offer some long-term perspective on VeriSign's performance since the completion of our divestitures 5 years or 20 quarters ago. Our goal then was to simplify the company's business through divestment of noncore assets and to focus on profitability and value creation.
Since then, revenue has grown sequentially for 20 straight quarters. Non-GAAP EPS has grown steadily from $0.31 in Q4 2010 to $0.78 in Q3 2015. Free cash flow has gone steadily and was $612 million over the trailing 4 quarters. Non-GAAP operating margin has risen steadily, from 44.3% in Q4 2010 to 62.7% in the most recent quarter.
Over the last 20 quarters, we've returned $4.2 billion to our shareholders. We repurchased over 69 million shares for $3.22 billion, which exceeds our domestic free cash flow for the same period. And in that same time frame, we returned $982 million in special dividends, excluding payments to convert holders, triggered by that special dividend.
Our $2.75 per share dividend in 2011 was a 100% tax-free return of capital.
We believe the long trend lines of growth in the top and bottom line, along with a consistent track record in returning generated value to our shareholders through effective capital allocation and an efficient capital structure, are what matter most to our shareholders. We believe that proper balance within our strategy framework, protect, grow and manage, is what makes it possible for us to deliver this type of consistent, long-term result and simultaneously serve the interest of our shareholders, employees and customers. We intend to continue our steady focus on long-term consistency.
We'll now take your questions. And operator, we're ready for the first question."

What we do know for certain is that we will begin with at least 1 IDN before the end of the year. So there is some ICANN process that does play out here. There's an early period where brand holders have the ability to come in. There may be some early access opportunities for those who wish to get into the store early, so to speak. But that process will have begun before the end of the year. I expect that certainly by the turn of the year and in Q1, we will be with at least 1.

There were some delays associated with .brands, in particular, as ICANN recognize that .brands had needs that were different beyond what ICANN had originally anticipated, different needs as opposed to those who are getting into the business of selling domain names. So some contractual issues were worked on between the brand community and ICANN. And additional time was given to the brands, I believe. I haven't -- I don't have a specific number for you, but a number of brands that engaged in that process, some did sign contracts by a deadline. I believe there was another extension for some additional work by some brands who had special conditions. But we haven't seen a lot of them out in the market yet, but some of them have certainly announced their intentions to roll out their brand TLD. So they're not visible. It's not that active.

But there are, in some cases, of these global brands, an extraordinarily large amount of traffic associated with their current domain. So it's very easy for them to simply redirect that traffic to it. So this is -- I think you're getting to a question that I've answered in the past, which is that I don't expect these people to get a .brand to abandon a .com. They certainly aren't going to do that. It is their brand. It's inexpensive for them and there's a heavy investment in branding and traffic. So I expect it to be either an experiment or complementary registration, and we'll see how it plays out in the years ahead. But I certainly don't expect people to abandon their .coms.

We had a little bit lower depreciation, maybe a little lower travel in our sales and marketing, while it was down sequentially. If you look at the year-to-date 9-month period, it's relatively flat. There's really a timing of when we roll expenses out. We rolled them out -- those programs a little earlier this year than previous years. So you have some inter-quarter variances. But overall, year-to-date, from a sales and marketing, we're pretty much on track. R&D were down a little bit.

But we'll give you some more color on our views on 2016 next quarter."

And I see you did have good strength in names. Did you make a trade-off there in terms of sort of marketing programs that you peel back during the quarter as you saw the strength? And generally, how should we think about the level of sales and marketing, especially marketing spend, as we go into Q4 and into early next year?"

As I mentioned earlier to a caller, if you look at the 9-month year-to-date expense in sales and marketing, it's relatively flat. We did this year roll some expenses -- I'm sorry, roll some programs out a little earlier in the year. It's a little bit front-loaded. If you look at it on a quarterly basis, we had slightly higher sales and marketing in Q1 and Q2. It's just kind of how it fell this year. We constantly evaluate our programs, but they seem to be performing well. As far as Q4, we expect the expense in sales and marketing to be consistent with what it was this quarter."
