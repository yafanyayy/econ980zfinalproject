Before I start my prepared remarks, I'll just ask you to be a little patient if I pause, I've been battling a cough, so with that, we'll get underway.
Sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2015 reflected the seasonality we normally see at the beginning of our fiscal year. And in general, we saw fewer large deals this quarter compared to previous quarters. As a result, revenue of $462.8 million was in the lower half of our guided range of $460 million to $470 million, reflecting 14% year-over-year growth and down slightly from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. 
GAAP EPS was $1.21 per share above our guidance of $1.10 to $1.13 per share. Non-GAAP EPS of $1.55 per share also exceeded our guidance of $1.46 to $1.49 per share. Both GAAP and non-GAAP results include the one-time benefit related to the retroactive reinstatement of the R&D tax credit for 2014, resulting in the benefit to EPS of approximately $0.08 per share on a GAAP basis and $0.07 per share on a non-GAAP basis.
Product revenue of $240.9 million in the first quarter was up 10% year-over-year, down 6% sequentially and accounted for 52% of total revenue. Service revenue of $221.9 million grew 18% year-over-year, 6% sequentially and represented 48% of total revenue. 
Accounting for 56% of the total, revenue from the Americas was up 14% from the first quarter of fiscal 2014. EMEA media, which represented 25% of revenue, grew 20% from the first quarter of last year. APAC accounted for 14% of revenue and grew 9% year-over-year and Japan revenue, representing 5% of total, grew 3% from a year ago. 
Sales to enterprise customers represented 63% of total sales during the quarter. Service providers accounted for 23% and government sales were 13%, including 5% of total sales from U.S. federal. 
In Q1, we had 4 greater than 10% distributors, less con, which represented 17.5% of total revenue, Ingram Micro, which accounted for 16.7%, Avnet, representing 13.9%; and Aero, which accounted for 11.4%. 
Our GAAP gross margin in Q1 was 82.9%. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 84.1%. GAAP operating expenses of $251.1 million were within our target range of $245 million to $253 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $222.9 million. GAAP operating margin was 28.6%. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 35.9%. Reflecting the one-time benefit from the retroactive reinstatement of the federal R&D tax credit for 2014, our GAAP effective tax rate for Q1 was 34% and our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 32.3%.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash flow from operations was $186.4 million. In Q1, we repurchased just under 1.2 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $128.70 for a total of $150 million, ending the quarter with approximately $1.17 billion in cash and investments. With the addition of $750 million authorized by the board for stock buyback at our most recent board meeting, approximately $931 million remains authorized under the share repurchase program. 
DSO at the end of Q1 was 50 days. Inventories were $27.6 million. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $10.3 million. Deferred revenue increased 20% year-over-year to $680.3 million. We ended the quarter with approximately 3,945 employees, an increase of 110 from the prior quarter.
Moving onto Q2 outlook. Based on the strength of our current pipeline, including a return in the number of large deal opportunities, and continued momentum from our key drivers, we anticipate sequential and year-over-year growth in the second quarter of fiscal 2015. Our revenue target for the quarter is $465 million to $475 million. GAAP gross margin is anticipated to be in the 82% to 82.5% range, including approximately $3.5 million of stock-based compensation expense and $2.7 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets. Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be in the 83.5% to 84% range. 
As outlined during our Q1 earnings call, we anticipate an increase in stock compensation in Q2 related to the timing of our annual employee grant. As such for Q2, we anticipate GAAP operating expenses in the range of $255 million to $264 million including approximately $34 million of stock-based compensation expense and $0.5 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets. 
For Q2, we are forecasting a GAAP effective tax rate of 38.5% and a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 35.5%. These rates assume no reinstatement of the federal R&D tax credit for 2015. Our GAAP EPS target is $1.07 to $1.10 per share. Our non-GAAP EPS target is $1.48 to $1.51 per share. We plan to increase our headcount in excess of 100 employees in the current quarter and we believe our cash flow from operations will be at or around $110 million reflecting the impact of 2 federal tax payments that we normally incur during our fiscal second quarter.
With that, I will turn the call over to John McAdam."

Although our revenue came in at the lower end of our guidance and I'll comment on that in a moment, I was pleased with the significant progress we made in all our major initiatives. For example, we had some very strategic security sales wins in the server provider market. We had a very successful launch of Silverline, a key component of our hybrid application services strategy. We added significant functionality to our orchestration and management product, BIG-IQ, which was key to winning the strategic security wins and is also another critical component of our hybrid application services strategy. We also continue to make great progress with our SDN partnerships both in technology and in go to market initiatives. 
From a sales perspective, the majority of the shortfall come from the Americas region where we experienced a larger-than-expected drop in million dollars plus deals in both large enterprise and U.S. federal opportunities. We believe this was a seasonality issue due to a very large number of large wins, closing during our fiscal year end Q4 drive. 
On a more positive note, the pipeline creation rate in Q1 was very strong -- I'm sorry, very strong -- the pipeline for the quarter looks very good. So I understand the sentence there from the original I had. Our Japan business was also below our general forecast, but this was not a major factor overall. Both APAC and EMEA delivered year-over-year sales growth. The EMEA region was the star of the quarter and once again, delivered an excellent performance with solid year-over-year growth. 
Our Services business continued to deliver solid results and excellent profitability along with a healthy increase in deferred revenue, which is now approximately $680 million and should bode well for future business. 
We continue to experience strong momentum with our Good, Better, Best sales motion in Q1 with customer adoption continuing to be very strong in the Best category, highlighting the success we have seen with our security solution. I was also very encouraged by the continuous strong growth of our software revenue, which increased 44% year-over-year. 
The fastest growing area in our software business is our core virtualization ADC. Our software growth is being driven by the increasing customer demand for hybrid solutions that allow greater flexibility and the deployment of application services within and across data centers and into the cloud. Our ability to provide our solutions as virtual software offerings across all the major hybrid providers, combined with our unique orchestration functionality and BIG-IQ is enabling customers to move to software-defined data centers and NSV architectures. 
We're also seeing growth across the entire portfolio of our software module offerings driven by the rapidly increasing recognition that an ADC is the ideal platform to ensure application security. Our Security business continues to be a our largest growth driver with strong sales across the security solution portfolio including ASM, APM and AFM. I already made reference to strategic security sales wins in the service provider market. We won a large ASM Gi firewall sales with a Tier 1 service provider, which resulted in 2 transactions in Q1 being over $1 million each in value. 
I have mentioned several times last year that our BIG-IQ security management and orchestration product road map was being influenced by a Tier 1 service provider in North America. This initiative has proved to be very successful and we are now starting to see some real momentum globally with our Gi firewall solutions and we believe it can be a strong growth driver in fiscal 2015 and beyond. 
Overall, we had a solid quarter in the service provider market in Q1. We had several very strategic wins over and above the Gi firewall deals. For example, we won a large 2 million plus software-only NSV application with another Tier 1 server provider in North America. Our consolidation strategy and focus on security, NSV, Gi 1 services and LTE applications is resonating well with the service provider as we offer them the opportunity to reduce OpEx while monetizing the added value services with our unique application and subscriber awareness. 
We continue to see strong sales of Cisco Asia placement last quarter. As we have seen in previous quarters, customers continue to take the opportunity to add additional functionality, for example, our ASM security module when the implement in USI Solutions. We have created a self-service web portal for ACE migrations, which complements a significant experience and consulting expertise and increases our competitive advantage. 
Also we intend to stamp up our market initiatives on ACE opportunities starting this quarter to take advantage of our current momentum and experience a transitioning ACE customers to F5 ADC solutions. We have experienced a very positive reaction to the launch of our Silverline hybrid application services strategy from our sales force, partners and customers. The initial launch included our subscription base DDoS servers and our anti-malware and phishing protection service. These cloud-based offerings deliver flexible, best-in-class services and offer a hybrid model complementing F5 on-premise product and solutions. We have already seen some excellent orders for both our subscription based DDoS servers and anti-malware solutions. We're applying to increase support the portfolio of cloud-based subscription services, starting with the ASM solution in the next few months. 
From a product perspective, we have a host of new functionality and new products on our current road map. We recently released a new high end, 2U platform, the BIG-IP 12,000. This platform extends performance of our content thousand platform by 25%, increases SSL performance by 600% and more than doubles the number of high-performance vCMP instances. The SSL performance is really important given the SSL trend that we're seeing. 
In the near future, we'll be enhancing our management and orchestration capabilities with BIG-IQ release 4.5. This release will include significant enhancements for our data center security products AFM and ASM, as well as comprehensive support for our SDN ecosystem to provide application management capabilities with an SDN-enabled network. The BIG-IQ Clive module now supports SDN control integration with Cisco intake, VMware NSX, Alcatel Mirage, Microsoft SCVM and OpenStack. We will also be adding a new module BIG-IQ ADC. BIG-IQ ADC provides centralized, fine-grained application management across cloud-based SDN and traditional network infrastructure. 
The drivers of our business remain robust and I expect momentum to build in this coming quarter and continue into the second half of the year. Our hybrid application services based on our centers architecture and Silverline cloud services is resonating really well with our customers and partners. This strategy, combined with the strength of our partner ecosystems in areas like SDN, provide F5 with an opportunity to play a very strategic role while customers continue to strive for competitive advantage and maximum agility by moving to new technology architectures. 
Also our portfolio of application products and cloud services continues to expand aggressively, which in turn significantly expands our addressable market and increases the type of revenue streams available to our sales force and partner channel. 
As far as the outlook is concerned, Andy indicated that we expect both sequential and year-over-year growth this quarter. As I mentioned earlier, our business pipeline create rate was very strong in Q1, up significantly over the previous year and a pipeline of business this quarter looks very strong. In particular, we have seen a large increase in the number of large deals in the pipeline. We continue to plan for growth in the business by investing ahead current and infrastructure moving forward, whilst deliver world-class operating margins. 
I continue to feel very positive about future business prospects for F5. I believe that our existing product portfolio, our hybrid application services strategy and our product road map are not only in line with customer and market trends, but are also key to enabling these trends. In conclusion, I'd like to thank the entire F5 team of partners and customers for their support last quarter and with that, we'll hand the call over to Q&A."

I know that's not good because we tend to beat, just to be clear. On the first part, you're absolutely right. If you go back to 2013 when we saw a fairly precipitous drop in million-dollar deals, we did talk about macro and a fair to macro more than once in that case, and that's because when we look to that, the forward-looking pipeline was anything as strong as it's looking today. So we're seeing -- this is a different scenario in our opinion. We really believe this is more seasonality-linked than anything and a piece of fair as well, was clearly some still some lack of transparency in fed that we know in budget, hopefully, that will improve. They were the 2 things that we see, but as we look forward, we see a stronger pipeline with a higher percentage of factoring in that pipeline, hence, as not referring to macro. And the second question was the transition from a software. Now we don't see that. In fact, interestingly enough, these software deals that we see from a virtualization perspective or from an NFV perspective, these are big. I mean these are actually pretty big deals as customers are horizontally scaling across their application and therefore, buying a lot of instances of virtualization, so maybe overtime, we'll see that, but I don't believe that was an indicator this quarter."

But the big drivers are security was a firewall that we talked about, ASM with the solution or DDoS on Prem and off premise and then the service provider, we feel very good about the drivers there and NSV from a security perspective, CCP optimization.

Let me answer the service provider. On the service provider, we have 4 major drivers that I think we were talking about, they were definitely in John's prepared comments, which is consolidation across the board from a service provider point of view and that's consolidation of services, predominantly traffic steering services, carrier grid map services and some other services that were consolidated inside that environment. That reduces CapEx really for many of the operators out there, because they're going from multi vendors to a single vendor. Second major driver we have is security, which is also something we could overlay on that same footprint. Again from a consolidation point of view, but we call it out as a separate driver because it's just the impact from the size associated with that, but there is NFV and the NFV footprints that we're seeing out there, which are still early proof of concepts to some degree and we are in various proof of concepts across the world. We're starting to see some of those pan out and that's what happened this past quarter and why we have a big bump also in our software sales. And the last is the LTE or the mobility movement going to 4G networks, which we've been seeding in the customer environment for the last 2 years and we're starting to see there also from a driver perspective that these networks get deployed, get accepted, usage volume goes up, new devices are being enabled, meaning additional mobile handsets but also new devices from the perspective of the Internet of Things that we're going to see additional software license there. So those are predominantly the 4 major drivers and those are usually either tackling the CapEx volume from a consolidation point of view or the monetization line from something along the perspective of LTE and being able to bring on new services to the market."

Before I start my prepared remarks, I'll just ask you to be a little patient if I pause. I've been battling a cough. So with that, we'll get underway.
Sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2015 reflected the seasonality we normally see at the beginning of our fiscal year. And in general, we saw fewer large deals this quarter compared to previous quarters. As a result, revenue of $462.8 million was in the lower half of our guided range of $460 million to $470 million, reflecting 14% year-over-year growth and down slightly from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. 
GAAP EPS was $1.21 per share above our guidance of $1.10 to $1.13 per share. Non-GAAP EPS of $1.55 per share also exceeded our guidance of $1.46 to $1.49 per share. Both GAAP and non-GAAP results include a onetime benefit related to the retroactive reinstatement of the R&D tax credit for 2014, resulting in a benefit to EPS of approximately $0.08 per share on a GAAP basis and $0.07 per share on a non-GAAP basis.
Product revenue of $240.9 million in the first quarter was up 10% year-over-year, down 6% sequentially and accounted for 52% of total revenue. Service revenue of $221.9 million grew 18% year-over-year, 6% sequentially and represented 48% of total revenue. 
Accounting for 56% of the total, revenue from the Americas was up 14% from the first quarter of fiscal 2014. EMEA, which represented 25% of revenue, grew 20% from the first quarter of last year. APAC accounted for 14% of revenue and grew 9% year-over-year. And Japan revenue, representing 5% of total, grew 3% from a year ago. 
Sales to enterprise customers represented 63% of total sales during the quarter. Service providers accounted for 23%, and government sales were 13%, including 5% of total sales from U.S. federal. 
In Q1, we had 4 greater than 10% distributors: Westcon, which represented 17.5% of total revenue, Ingram Micro, which accounted for 16.7%, Avnet, representing 13.9%; and Arrow, which accounted for 11.4%. 
Our GAAP gross margin in Q1 was 82.9%. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 84.1%. 
GAAP operating expenses of $251.1 million were within our target range of $245 million to $253 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $222.9 million. 
GAAP operating margin was 28.6%. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 35.9%. Reflecting the onetime benefit from the retroactive reinstatement of the federal R&D tax credit for 2014, our GAAP effective tax rate for Q1 was 34% and our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 32.3%.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash flow from operations was $186.4 million. In Q1, we repurchased just under 1.2 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $128.70 for a total of $150 million, ending the quarter with approximately $1.17 billion in cash and investments. With the addition of $750 million authorized by the board for stock buyback at our most recent board meeting, approximately $931 million remains authorized under the share repurchase program. 
DSO at the end of Q1 was 50 days. Inventories were $27.6 million. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $10.3 million. Deferred revenue increased 20% year-over-year to $680.3 million. We ended the quarter with approximately 3,945 employees, an increase of 110 from the prior quarter.
Moving onto Q2 outlook. Based on the strength of our current pipeline, including a return in the number of large deal opportunities, and continued momentum from our key drivers, we anticipate sequential and year-over-year growth in the second quarter of fiscal 2015. Our revenue target for the quarter is $465 million to $475 million. GAAP gross margin is anticipated to be in the 82% to 82.5% range, including approximately $3.5 million of stock-based compensation expense and $2.7 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets. Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be in the 83.5% to 84% range. 
As outlined during our Q1 earnings call, we anticipate an increase in stock compensation in Q2 related to the timing of our annual employee grant. As such for Q2, we anticipate GAAP operating expenses in the range of $255 million to $264 million including approximately $34 million of stock-based compensation expense and $0.5 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets. 
For Q2, we are forecasting a GAAP effective tax rate of 38.5% and a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 35.5%. These rates assume no reinstatement of the federal R&D tax credit for 2015. Our GAAP EPS target is $1.07 to $1.10 per share. Our non-GAAP EPS target is $1.48 to $1.51 per share. We plan to increase our headcount in excess of 100 employees in the current quarter and we believe our cash flow from operations will be at or around $110 million reflecting the impact of 2 federal tax payments that we normally incur during our fiscal second quarter.
With that, I will turn the call over to John McAdam."

Although our revenue came in at the lower end of our guidance, and I'll comment on that in a moment, I was pleased with the significant progress we made in all our major initiatives. For example, we had some ver",1335,"Thanks, Andy, and good afternoon, everyone. Although our revenue came in at the lower end of our guidance, and I'll comment on that in a moment, I was pleased with the significant progress we made in all our major initiatives. For example, we had some very strategic security sales wins in the server provider market. We had a very successful launch of Silverline, a key component of our hybrid application services strategy. We added significant functionality to our orchestration and management product, BIG-IQ, which was key to winning the strategic security wins and is also another critical component of our hybrid application services strategy. We also continue to make great progress with our SDN partnerships both in technology and in go-to-market initiatives. 
From a sales perspective, the majority of the shortfall come from the Americas region, where we experienced a larger-than-expected drop in million-dollar-plus deals in both large enterprise and U.S. federal opportunities. We believe this was a seasonality issue due to a very large number of large wins closing during our fiscal year end Q4 drive. 
On a more positive note, the pipeline creation rate in Q1 was very strong -- I'm sorry, very strong -- the pipeline for the quarter looks very, very good. Sorry, I misspoke our sentence there from the original I had. Our Japan business was also below our general forecast, but this was not a major factor overall. Both APAC and EMEA delivered year-over-year sales growth. The EMEA region was the star of the quarter and once again delivered an excellent performance with solid year-over-year growth. 
 
Our Services business continued to deliver solid results and excellent profitability along with a healthy increase in deferred revenue, which is now approximately $680 million and should bode well for future business. 
We continue to experience strong momentum with our Good, Better, Best sales motion in Q1, with customer adoption continuing to be very strong in the Best category, highlighting the success we have seen with our security solutions. I was also very encouraged by the continuous strong growth of our software revenue, which increased 44% year-over-year. 
The fastest growing area in our software business is our core virtualization ADC. Our software growth is being driven by the increasing customer demand for hybrid solutions that allow greater flexibility in the deployment of application services within and across data centers and into the cloud. Our ability to provide our solutions as virtual software-only offerings across all the major hybrid providers, combined with our unique orchestration functionality and BIG-IQ, is enabling customers to move to software-defined data centers and NFV architectures. 
We're also seeing growth across the entire portfolio of our software module offerings driven by the rapidly increasing recognition that an ADC is the ideal platform to ensure application security. Our Security business continues to be our largest growth driver with strong sales across the security solution portfolio including ASM, APM and AFM. I already made reference to the strategic security sales wins in the service provider market. We won a large ASM Gi firewall sales with a Tier 1 service provider, which resulted in 2 transactions in Q1 being over $1 million each in value. 
I have mentioned several times last year that our BIG-IQ security management and orchestration product road map was being influenced by a Tier 1 service provider in North America. This initiative has proved to be very successful, and we are now starting to see some real momentum globally with our Gi firewall solution and we believe it can be a strong growth driver in fiscal 2015 and beyond. 
Overall, we had a solid quarter in the service provider market in Q1. We had several very strategic wins over and above the Gi firewall deals. For example, we won a large 2 million plus software-only NFV application with another Tier 1 server provider in North America. Our consolidation strategy and focus on security, NFV, Gi  won [ph] services and LTE application is resonating well with the service provider as we offer them the opportunity to reduce OpEx while monetizing their added value services with our unique application and subscriber awareness. 
We continue to see strong sales of Cisco ACE placements last quarter. As we have seen in previous quarters, customers continue to take the opportunity to add additional functionality, for example, our ASM and/or AFM security module, when they implement the new F5 solutions. We have created a self-service web portal for ACE migrations, which complements our significant experience and consulting expertise and increases our competitive advantage. 
Also we intend to step up our market initiatives on the ACE opportunities starting this quarter to take advantage of our current momentum and our experience in transitioning ACE customers to F5 ADC solutions. 
We have experienced a very positive reaction to the launch of our Silverline hybrid application services strategy from our sales force, partners and customers. The initial launch included our subscription-based DDoS servers and our anti-malware and phishing protection service. These cloud-based offerings deliver flexible, best-in-class services and offer a hybrid model complementing F5 on-premise product and solutions. We have already seen some excellent orders for both our subscription-based DDoS servers and anti-malware solutions. We're applying to increase the portfolio of cloud-based subscription services, starting with our WAP ASM solution in the next few months. 
From a product perspective, we have a host of new functionality and new products on our current roadmap. We recently released a new high-end 2U platform, the BIG-IP 12000. This platform extends performance of our current 10000 platform by 25%, increases SSL performance by 600% and more than doubles the number of high-performanced vCMP instances. The SSL performance is really important, given that SSL [ph] trend that we're seeing. 
In the near future, we will be enhancing our management and orchestration capabilities with BIG-IQ release 4.5. This release will include significant enhancements for our data center security products, AFM and ASM, as well as comprehensive support for our SDN ecosystem to provide application management capabilities with an SDN-enabled network. The BIG-IQ Cloud module now supports SDN controller integration with Cisco Atech [ph], VMware NSX, Alcatel Mirage, Microsoft SCVMM and OpenStack. We will also be adding a new module, BIG-IQ ADC. BIG-IQ ADC provides centralized, fine-grained application management across cloud-based SDN and traditional network infrastructure. 
The drivers of our business remain robust, and I expect momentum to build in this coming quarter and continue into the second half of the year. Our hybrid application services based on our Synthesis architecture and Silverline cloud services is resonating really well with our customers and partners. This strategy, combined with the strength of our partner ecosystems in areas like SDN, provide F5 with an opportunity to play a very strategic role while customers continue to strive for competitive advantage and maximum agility by moving to new technology architectures. 
Also, our portfolio of application products and cloud services continues to expand aggressively, which in turn significantly expands our addressable market and increases the type of revenue streams available to our sales force and partner channel. 
As far as the outlook is concerned, Andy indicated that we expect both sequential and year-over-year growth this quarter. As I mentioned earlier, our business pipeline create rate was very strong in Q1, up significantly over the previous year and the pipeline of business this quarter looks very strong. In particular, we have seen a large increase in the number of large deals in the pipeline. We continue to plan for growth in the business by investing in headcount and infrastructure moving forward, whilst deliver world-class operating margins. 
I continue to feel very positive of our future business prospects for F5. I believe that our existing product portfolio, our hybrid application services strategy and our product roadmap are not only in line with customer and market trends, but are also key to enabling these trends. 
In conclusion, I'd like to thank the entire F5 team of partners and customers for their support last quarter. And with that, we'll hand the call over to Q&A."

I know that's not good because we tend to beat, just to be clear. On the first part, you're absolutely right. If you go back to 2013 when we saw a fairly precipitous drop in million-dollar deals, we did talk about macro and refer to macro more than once in that case. And that's because when we looked to that, the forward-looking pipeline was anything as strong as it's looking today. So we're seeing -- this is a different scenario, in our opinion. We really believe this was more seasonality-linked than anything. And a piece of Fed as well, where there's clearly still some lack of transparency in the Fed. When we know the budget, hopefully, that will improve. They were the 2 things that we see. But as we look forward, we see a stronger pipeline with a higher percentage of factoring in that pipeline. Hence, I was not referring to macro. And sorry, and the second question was -- oh yes, the transition from software. Now we don't see that. In fact, interestingly enough, these software deals that we see from a virtualization perspective or from an NFV perspective, these are big.

Obviously, the 1200 with its SSL capability, I think is clearly -- as one point our product, but with its SSL capability, that's a pretty good opportunity to refresh as well. But the big drivers are security, with the firewall that we talked about, ASM, I think WAP solution, our DDoS on-prem and off-premise. And then as a service provider, we feel very good with the drivers there from NFV, from a security perspective, PCP optimization. We still feel good about ACE.

On the service provider, we have 4 major drivers that I think we talked a little bit about. They were definitely in John's prepared comments, which is consolidation across the board from a service provider point of view, and that's consolidation of services, predominantly traffic steering services, carrier grid map services and some other services in there that we're consolidated inside that environment. That reduces CapEx really for many of the operators there, because they're going from multi vendors to a single vendor. Second major driver we have is security, which is also something we can overlay on that same footprint, again from a consolidation point of view. But we call it out as a separate driver because it's just the impact from the size associated with that, but there is NFV and the NFV footprints that we're seeing out there, which are still early proof of concepts to some degree and we are in various proof of concepts across the world. We're starting to see some of those pan out, and that's what happened this past quarter and why we had a big bump also on our software sales. And the last is the LTE or the mobility movement going to 4G networks, which we've been seeding in the customer environment for the last 2 years. And we're starting to see there also from a driver perspective that these networks get deployed, get accepted. Usage volume goes up, new devices are being enabled, meaning additional mobile handsets, but also new devices from the perspective of the Internet of Things that we're going to see additional software license there. So those are predominantly the 4 major drivers and those are usually either tackling the CapEx volume from a consolidation point of view or the monetization line from something along the perspective of LTE and being able to bring on new services to the market."

I don't think it's going to be a complete revolutionary process. I think it's going to be evolutionary. If you look at the -- it's interesting, if you look at the Gi firewall opportunities, the software content in that, of course is very significant, but so is actually the hardware content because it needs to cope with a significant amount of traffic either on the DDoS side of things or just in pure mobile traffic firewall protection, so I think the trends are going to be there. But to take 1 quarter from Q4 to Q1 and say that's a trend, I think, would be very dangerous. We don't believe that."

Before I start my prepared remarks, I'll just ask you to be a little patient if I pause. I've been battling a cough. So with that, we'll get underway.
Sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2015 reflected the seasonality we normally see at the beginning of our fiscal year. And in general, we saw fewer large deals this quarter compared to previous quarters. As a result, revenue of $462.8 million was in the lower half of our guided range of $460 million to $470 million, reflecting 14% year-over-year growth and down slightly from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. 
GAAP EPS was $1.21 per share above our guidance of $1.10 to $1.13 per share. Non-GAAP EPS of $1.55 per share also exceeded our guidance of $1.46 to $1.49 per share. Both GAAP and non-GAAP results include a onetime benefit related to the retroactive reinstatement of the R&D tax credit for 2014, resulting in a benefit to EPS of approximately $0.08 per share on a GAAP basis and $0.07 per share on a non-GAAP basis.
Product revenue of $240.9 million in the first quarter was up 10% year-over-year, down 6% sequentially and accounted for 52% of total revenue. Service revenue of $221.9 million grew 18% year-over-year, 6% sequentially and represented 48% of total revenue. 
Accounting for 56% of the total, revenue from the Americas was up 14% from the first quarter of fiscal 2014. EMEA, which represented 25% of revenue, grew 20% from the first quarter of last year. APAC accounted for 14% of revenue and grew 9% year-over-year and Japan revenue, representing 5% of total, grew 3% from a year ago. 
Sales to enterprise customers represented 63% of total sales during the quarter. Service providers accounted for 23%, and government sales were 13%, including 5% of total sales from U.S. federal. 
In Q1, we had 4 greater than 10% distributors: Westcon, which represented 17.5% of total revenue, Ingram Micro, which accounted for 16.7%, Avnet, representing 13.9%; and Arrow, which accounted for 11.4%. 
Our GAAP gross margin in Q1 was 82.9%. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 84.1%. 
GAAP operating expenses of $251.1 million were within our target range of $245 million to $253 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $222.9 million. 
GAAP operating margin was 28.6%. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 35.9%. Reflecting the onetime benefit from the retroactive reinstatement of the federal R&D tax credit for 2014, our GAAP effective tax rate for Q1 was 34% and our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 32.3%.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash flow from operations was $186.4 million. In Q1, we repurchased just under 1.2 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $128.70 for a total of $150 million, ending the quarter with approximately $1.17 billion in cash and investments. With the addition of $750 million authorized by the board for stock buyback at our most recent board meeting, approximately $931 million remains authorized under the share repurchase program. 
DSO at the end of Q1 was 50 days. Inventories were $27.6 million. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $10.3 million. Deferred revenue increased 20% year-over-year to $680.3 million. We ended the quarter with approximately 3,945 employees, an increase of 110 from the prior quarter.
Moving onto Q2 outlook. Based on the strength of our current pipeline, including a return in the number of large deal opportunities, and continued momentum from our key drivers, we anticipate sequential and year-over-year growth in the second quarter of fiscal 2015. Our revenue target for the quarter is $465 million to $475 million. GAAP gross margin is anticipated to be in the 82% to 82.5% range, including approximately $3.5 million of stock-based compensation expense and $2.7 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets. Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be in the 83.5% to 84% range. 
As outlined during our Q1 earnings call, we anticipate an increase in stock compensation in Q2 related to the timing of our annual employee grant. As such, for Q2 we anticipate GAAP operating expenses in the range of $255 million to $264 million including approximately $34 million of stock-based compensation expense and $0.5 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets. 
For Q2, we are forecasting a GAAP effective tax rate of 38.5% and a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 35.5%. These rates assume no reinstatement of the federal R&D tax credit for 2015. Our GAAP EPS target is $1.07 to $1.10 per share. Our non-GAAP EPS target is $1.48 to $1.51 per share. We plan to increase our headcount in excess of 100 employees in the current quarter and we believe our cash flow from operations will be at or around $110 million reflecting the impact of 2 federal tax payments that we normally incur during our fiscal second quarter.
With that, I will turn the call over to John McAdam."

Although our revenue came in at the lower end of our guidance, and I'll comment on that in a moment, I was pleased with the significant progress we made in all our major initiatives. For example, we had some ver",1331,"Thanks, Andy, and good afternoon, everyone. Although our revenue came in at the lower end of our guidance, and I'll comment on that in a moment, I was pleased with the significant progress we made in all our major initiatives. For example, we had some very strategic security sales wins in the server provider market. We had a very successful launch of Silverline, a key component of our hybrid application services strategy. We added significant functionality to our orchestration and management product, BIG-IQ, which was key to winning the strategic security wins and is also another critical component of our hybrid application services strategy. We also continue to make great progress with our SDN partnerships both in technology and in go-to-market initiatives. 
From a sales perspective, the majority of the shortfall are coming from the Americas region, where we experienced a larger-than-expected drop in $1 million-plus deals in both large enterprise and U.S. federal opportunities. We believe this was a seasonality issue due to a very large number of large wins closing during our fiscal year end Q4 drive. 
On a more positive note, the pipeline creation rate in Q1 was very strong and the pipeline for the quarter looks very, very good. Sorry, I misspoke a sentence there from the original I had. Our Japan business was also below our general forecast, but this was not a major factor overall. Both APAC and EMEA delivered year-over-year sales growth. The EMEA region was the star of the quarter and once again delivered an excellent performance with solid year-over-year growth. 
 
Our Services business continued to deliver solid results and excellent profitability along with a healthy increase in deferred revenue, which is now approximately $680 million and should bode well for future business. 
We continue to experience strong momentum with our Good, Better, Best sales motion [ph] in Q1, with customer adoption continuing to be very strong in the Best category, highlighting the success we have seen with our security solutions. I was also very encouraged by the continuous strong growth of our software revenue, which increased 44% year-over-year. 
The fastest growing area in our software business is our core virtualization ADC. Our software growth is being driven by the increasing customer demand for hybrid solutions that allow greater flexibility in the deployment of application services within and across data centers and into the cloud. Our ability to provide our solutions as virtual software-only offerings across all the major hypervisors, combined with our unique orchestration functionality and BIG-IQ, is enabling customers to move to software-defined data centers and NFV architectures. 
We're also seeing growth across the entire portfolio of our software module offerings driven by the rapidly increasing recognition that an ADC is the ideal platform to ensure application security. Our Security business continues to be our largest growth driver with strong sales across the security solution portfolio including ASM, APM and AFM. I already made reference to the strategic security sales wins in the service provider market. We won a large AFM Gi firewall sale with a Tier 1 service provider, which resulted in 2 transactions in Q1 being over $1 million each in value. 
I have mentioned several times last year that our BIG-IQ security management and orchestration product road map was being influenced by a Tier 1 service provider in North America. This initiative has proved to be very successful, and we are now starting to see some real momentum globally with our Gi firewall solution and we believe it can be a strong growth driver in fiscal 2015 and beyond. 
Overall, we had a solid quarter in the service provider market in Q1. We had several very strategic wins over and above the Gi firewall deals. For example, we won a large 2 million plus software-only NFV application with another Tier 1 server provider in North America. Our consolidation strategy and focus on security, NFV, Gi WAN [ph] services and LTE application is resonating well with the service provider as we offer them the opportunity to reduce OpEx while monetizing their added value services with our unique application and subscriber awareness. 
We continue to see strong sales of Cisco ACE placements last quarter. As we have seen in previous quarters, customers continue to take the opportunity to add additional functionality, for example, our ASM and/or AFM security module, when they implement the new F5 solutions. We have created a self-service web portal for ACE migrations, which complements our significant experience and consulting expertise and increases our competitive advantage. 
Also we intend to step up our marketing initiatives on the ACE opportunities starting this quarter to take advantage of our current momentum and our experience in transitioning ACE customers to F5 ADC solutions. 
We have experienced a very positive reaction to the launch of our Silverline hybrid application services strategy from our sales force, partners and customers. The initial launch included our subscription-based DDoS servers and our anti-malware and phishing protection service. These cloud-based offerings deliver flexible, best-in-class services and offer a hybrid model complementing F5 on-premise product and solutions. We have already seen some excellent orders for both our subscription-based DDoS servers and anti-malware solutions. We're applying to increase the portfolio of cloud-based subscription services, starting with our WAP ASM solution in the next few months. 
From a product perspective, we have a host of new functionality and new products on our current roadmap. We recently released a new high-end 2U platform, the BIG-IP 12000. This platform extends performance of our current 10000 platform by 25%, increases SSL performance by 600% and more than doubles the number of high-performance vCMP instances. The SSL performance is really important, given the SSL everywhere trend that we're seeing. 
In the near future, we will be enhancing our management and orchestration capabilities with BIG-IQ release 4.5. This release will include significant enhancements for our data center security products, AFM and ASM, as well as comprehensive support for our SDN ecosystem to provide application management capabilities with an SDN-enabled network. The BIG-IQ Cloud module now supports SDN controller integration with Cisco APIc, VMware NSX, Alcatel Mirage, Microsoft SCVMM and OpenStack. We will also be adding a new module, BIG-IQ ADC. BIG-IQ ADC provides centralized, fine-grained application management across cloud-based SDN and traditional network infrastructure. 
The drivers of our business remain robust, and I expect momentum to build in this coming quarter and continue into the second half of the year. Our hybrid application services based on our Synthesis architecture and Silverline cloud services is resonating really well with our customers and partners. This strategy, combined with the strength of our partner ecosystems in areas like SDN, provide F5 with an opportunity to play a very strategic role while customers continue to strive for competitive advantage and maximum agility by moving to new technology architectures. 
Also, our portfolio of application products and cloud services continues to expand aggressively, which in turn significantly expands our addressable market and increases the type of revenue streams available to our sales force and partner channel. 
As far as the outlook is concerned, Andy indicated that we expect both sequential and year-over-year growth this quarter. As I mentioned earlier, our business pipeline create rate was very strong in Q1, up significantly over the previous year and the pipeline of business this quarter looks very strong. In particular, we have seen a large increase in the number of large deals in the pipeline. We continue to plan for growth in the business by investing in headcount and infrastructure moving forward, whilst deliver world-class operating margins. 
I continue to feel very positive of our future business prospects for F5. I believe that our existing product portfolio, our hybrid application services strategy and our product roadmap are not only in line with customer and market trends, but are also key to enabling these trends. 
In conclusion, I'd like to thank the entire F5 team of partners and customers for their support last quarter. And with that, we'll hand the call over to Q&A."

If you go back to 2013 when we saw a fairly precipitous drop in million-dollar deals, we did talk about macro and refer to macro more than once in that case.

So we're seeing -- this is a different scenario, in our opinion, where we really believe this was more seasonality-linked than anything. And a piece of Fed as well, where there's clearly still some lack of transparency in the Fed. Although now that they've got a budget, hopefully, that will improve. They were the 2 things that we see. But as we look forward, we see a stronger pipeline with a higher percentage of factoring in that pipeline. Hence, I was not referring to macro. And sorry, and the second question was -- oh yes, the transition from software. No, we don't see that.

So how do you think about the service provider vertical for this year? Do you expect it to grow as a percentage of revenues in fiscal '14? And then on the virtualization side, I certainly, hear you, John, that the deals are large. But if you do a comparison with the architectural changes, if you had sold all hardware instances, as you might have a few years ago versus our mix of hardware and software, what that is doing to the overall dollar value of the deals and also the profitability of the deals? That would be helpful."

On the service provider, we have 4 major drivers that I think we talked a little bit about. They were definitely in John's prepared comments, which is consolidation across the board from a service provider point of view, and that's consolidation of services, predominantly traffic steering services, carrier grid map services and some other services in there that we're consolidated inside that environment. That reduces CapEx really for many of the operators there, because they're going from multi vendors to a single vendor. Second major driver we have is security, which is also something we can overlay on that same footprint, again from a consolidation point of view. But we call it out as a separate driver because of just the impact from the size associated with that, but there is NFV and the NFV footprints that we're seeing out there, which are still early proof of concepts to some degree and we are in various proof of concepts across the world. We're starting to see some of those pan out, and that's what happened this past quarter and why we had a big bump also on our software sales. And the last is the LTE or the mobility movement going to 4G networks, which we've been seeding in the customer environment for the last 2 years. And we're starting to see there also from a driver perspective that these networks get deployed, get accepted. Usage volume goes up, new devices are being enabled, meaning additional mobile handsets, but also new devices from the perspective of the Internet of Things that we're going to see additional software license there. So those are predominantly the 4 major drivers and those are usually either tackling the CapEx volume from a consolidation point of view or the monetization line from something along the perspective of LTE and being able to bring on new services to the market."

Our second quarter fiscal 2015 was marked by solid sales in North America where we saw both the rebound in sales from large deals compared to our first fiscal quarter and record sales levels in our service provider vertical. These areas o",728,"Thank you, John. Our second quarter fiscal 2015 was marked by solid sales in North America where we saw both the rebound in sales from large deals compared to our first fiscal quarter and record sales levels in our service provider vertical. These areas of strength were somewhat offset by some late quarter softness in sales in our EMEA and APAC theaters and Latin America region, likely impacted by the strengthening U.S. dollar. Revenue and earnings both grew sequentially and year-over-year with several factors contributing to strong profitability and cash flow from operations. 
Revenue of $472.1 million grew 2% from the prior quarter and 12% year-over-year, and was above the midpoint of our $465 million to $475 million guided range. GAAP EPS of $1.18 per share was above our guidance of $1.07 to $1.10 per share. Non-GAAP EPS of $1.59 per share also exceeded our guided range of $1.48 to $1.51 per share. The strength in EPS was driven by stronger than anticipated operating margin during the quarter, benefits to operating expenses and other income related to foreign currency and a more favorable tax rate than expected. Product revenue of $244.1 million, up 1% sequentially and 8% year-over-year, represented 52% of total revenue. Service revenue of $228 million increased 3% sequentially, 17% year-over-year and accounted for 48% of total revenue.
Revenue from the Americas accounted for 57% of total during the quarter. EMEA contributed 24%; APAC, 14%; and Japan, 5%. On a year-over-year basis, Americas and EMEA grew revenue 14%, APAC 11% and Japan revenue was down 3%. Enterprise customers represented 65% of total sales during the quarter. Service providers accounted for 24% and government sales were 12%, including 5% of total sales from U.S. federal. In Q2, we had 4 greater than 10% distributors, Westcon, which accounted for 16.6%, Ingram Micro at 15.5%, Avnet representing 13.5% and Arrow, which accounted for 10.5%. 
Our GAAP gross margin in Q2 was 82.5%. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 83.9%. GAAP operating expenses were $256.7 million at the low-end of our guided range of $255 million to $264 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $223.1 million. GAAP operating margin was 28.1%. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 36.6%. Our GAAP effective tax rate for Q2 was 37%. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 34.6%.
Turning to the balance sheet, cash flow from operations was $142.3 million, driven by higher than expected profitability and stronger-than-expected collections in the current quarter. In Q2, we repurchased just under 1.4 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $113.29 for a total of 156.9 million, ending the quarter with approximately $1.13 billion in cash and investments. Approximately $774 million remains authorized under the share repurchase program. 
DSO at the end of Q2 was 50 days. Inventories were $29.3 million. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $10.2 million. Deferred revenue increased to 23% year-over-year to $720.6 million. We ended the quarter with 4,035 employees, an increase of 90 in the prior quarter.
Now for the Q3 outlook. In keeping with recent historical patterns, ongoing strength of our major drivers and the robust pipeline, we anticipate continued sales momentum with sequential and year-over-year growth in the second half of fiscal 2015. That said, we believe the possible continued impact of foreign currency should be considered as we move into Q3. With that in mind, our revenue target for the third quarter of fiscal 2015 is $475 million to $485 million. GAAP gross margin is anticipated to be in the 82% to 82.5% range, including approximately 4 million of stock-based compensation expense and $2.7 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets. Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be in the 83.5% to 84% range. 
We anticipate GAAP operating expenses in the range of $257 million to $266 million. This include approximately $34.5 million of stock-based compensation expense and $0.7 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets. For Q3, we are forecasting a GAAP effective tax rate of 37% and our non-GAAP effective tax rate of 35%. Our GAAP EPS target is $1.16 to $1.19 per share. Our non-GAAP EPS target is $1.57 to $1.60 per share. We plan to increase our headcount by 100 to 125 employees in the current quarter and we believe our cash flow from operations will be at or around $170 million.
With that, I will turn the call over to John McAdam."

Before I go on to talk about Q2 results and Q3 outlook, I just want to say a few opening remarks on the organization announcement that we released today. Firstly, I'd like to congratulate Manny Rivelo, on his appointment as President and CEO of F5, effective on July 1 this year. When I announced my intention to the time I talked about last year, I stated that a key priority would be to work closely with our board to have a smooth and effective transition plan for my successor. I will work with Manny and the F5 executive team over the next couple of months to ensure a smooth and efficient handover of responsibilities, and then assume the position of nonexecutive Chairman of the F5 board. Al Higginson, who was been our nonexecutive Chairman for the last 11 years, will assume the position of lead independent director. I am confident that Manny's understanding of technology trends, his strategic vision, operational experience and tremendous culture fit with the F5 values will ensure that F5 continues to have a fantastic future and I'm sure you'll join me in wishing him great success in his new role.
Okay. Let's talk about our Q2 performance and our outlook for Q3 and beyond. Overall, I was pleased with our performance in Q2. From a sales perspective, the Americas region had a very short [ph] quarter with double-digit year-over-year sales bookings growth, delivering the internal forecast. In particular, sales from $1 million plus deals in Q2 increased significantly over Q1 and this was a significant factor in the Americas region strong results. 
The EMEA region continued to deliver year-over-year sales bookings growth, though the growth was not as strong as we have seen in previous quarters and was below our internal forecast. Sales in our APAC region were also below our initial forecast and sales in Japan was slightly above the forecast. Our Services business continued to deliver solid results and excellent profitability along with a healthy increase in deferred revenue, which is now approximately $721 million, up 6% sequentially, which should bode well for future business. 
From a software perspective, the latest industry analyst report show us as the clear market leader in the addition ADC market, driven by our ability to provide solutions as virtual software offerings, software-only offerings across all the major hypervisors and a unique orchestration functionality in BIG-IQ to enable customers to move to software-defined data centers and NSV architectures. Also, the combination of GBB pricing, virtual ADC sales and a solid attach rate of software modules continue to result in solid software growth. 
We had a number of last project wins with our security solutions last quarter. In our Q1 call, 3 months ago, I mentioned that we had won a large scale, AFM Gi firewall project and a Tier 1 service provider in North America. This project is now in production. We received more orders last quarter as a customer rolls out more of the Gi firewall solution throughout their network and we expect to see continuing business from this project during this fiscal year and in fiscal 2016. 
We also plan to replicate the success whenever possible in the overall service provider market. We continue to believe that our security business will be our largest growth driver. We expect to see strong demand for our increasing portfolio of security solutions as customers look to adopt hybrid architectures, deploying applications both in premise and in the cloud. As you will recall, we launched our Silverline hybrid application strategy in November with the initial launch including our subscription-based DDoS service and our anti-malware and phishing protection service. 
We extended our Silverline services platform a couple of weeks ago with our industry-leading WAF capabilities. As the latest addition to F5's Silverline's cloud-based application services platform, the new WAF offering is built on our industry leading ASM solution. We now offer our customers leading WAF services in both on-premise and subscription-based cloud offerings. This new cloud offering provides both ease and speed of deployment, and allows organization to constantly incorporate cloud resources while protecting out data from increasingly sophisticated security attack, risk and vulnerabilities. 
I was very pleased with the progress we made on our strategic initiatives in the service provider market last quarter. We had a strong presence at Mobile World Congress where we showcased NSV solutions that secure service provider networks. Sales in the service provider market were very solid last quarter with sales bookings at a record high. The American regions in particular had a very solid quarter with several wins with the Tier 1 service providers, as well as a number of competitive wins in the cable companies. We won several competitive replacements last quarter including the Gi firewall project I mentioned earlier, and we had some solid wins with our traffic LTE solution, including license upgrades as LTE traffic increased in install base, also Gi consolidation traffic speeding and optimization also continues to be good drivers for us in the service provider market. 
As I mentioned last quarter, our hybrid application services based -- application services based on our senses of the architecture and Silverline cloud services, is resonating really well with our customers and partners. This strategy combined with the strength of our partner Ecosystem in areas like SDN provide F5 with the opportunity to play a very strategic role as customers continue to fight for competitive advantage and maximum agility by moving to new technology architectures. Also, our portfolio of application products and cloud services continues to expand aggressively, which in turn significantly expands an addressable market and increases the types of revenue streams available to our Salesforce and partner channel. 
As far as the outlook is concerned and we indicated we expect to deliver both sequential and year-over-year growth this quarter. Although, we faced some potential headwinds as a result of the currency movements in some regions, especially in EMEA, I was very pleased with the positive rebound we experienced with the revenue from $1 million plus deals and I continue to believe that the fundamental drivers of our business remained robust. We remain committed to plan for growth in our business by investing in headcount and infrastructure moving forward, whilst delivering world-class operating margins. I believe that our existing product portfolio, our hybrid application services strategy and our product road map are not only in line with customer and market trends, but also key to enabling those trends. 
In conclusion, I would like to thank the entire F5 team, our partners and customers for the support last quarter. Before we move over to Q&A, I will hand over to Manny to give you his thoughts and F5's opportunities looking forward, and talk briefly about our strategic initiatives."

Our leadership team, the board and I, thank you for your dedication and commitment to excellence. We have something truly special here and I am honored to be given the opportunity to lead it into its next era.

In addition, our innovative approach towards protecting applications has made F5 a logical addition to many companies security posture. And lastly, our broad and ecosystem of technology partners will help us deliver our synthesis architecture to meet the ever-increasing SDN, NFV, cloud and security opportunities. In partnership with our leadership team, we will continue to evolve the company to ensure F5 can deliver application services in the way that makes the most business sense to our customers whether that's on premise, in the cloud or on-demand, and always with the confidence that F5 is defending those applications. 
Lastly, our most important asset is our people. I'll lead in a collaborative, transparent and respectful way.

I am excited to get started in the new CEO role and I want to express my gratitude to John and the board for their vote of confidence. Now let's hand the call over for Q&A."

One is that new applications are getting virtual ADCs, meaning in today's architecture are either applications are moving to the cloud or they're moving to a much more software-defined data center. We're seeing those virtual ADCs takeover. However, in those same instances, customers are looking for traditional hardware solutions in what we tend to call internally a 2-tier architecture, meaning the exterior tier of the data center is usually hardware and in that level we provide services with our custom-built hardware that provides high throughput, high-performance and then we apply virtual ADCs at the application layer on the back end of the tier. So we think it's actually complementary. We think that to succeed in the market, you need both the hardware components and the software components working in tandem, providing both on prem and off prem solutions."

Interestingly enough, it was very solid in the Americas, in North America in particular, it was actually very solid with pretty significant growth. We don't see a little bit of deceleration in APAC and EMEA, which is actually somewhat counter-intuitive because they were slower to pick up the GBB process. I actually view that as good news because we think, first of all, that's not a trend that will continue because there's a lot of runway in EMEA and APAC, and it was probably linked to the exchange issues, the country issues, which was the bigger picture of the business.

These areas o",723,"Thank you, John. Our second quarter fiscal 2015 was marked by solid sales in North America where we saw both the rebound in sales from large deals compared to our first fiscal quarter and record sales levels in our service provider vertical. These areas of strength were somewhat offset by some late quarter softness in sales in our EMEA and APAC theaters and Latin America region, likely impacted by the strengthening U.S. dollar. Revenue and earnings both grew sequentially and year-over-year, with several factors contributing to strong profitability and cash flow from operations.
Revenue of $472.1 million grew 2% from the prior quarter and 12% year-over-year and was above the midpoint of our $465 million to $475 million guided range. GAAP EPS of $1.18 per share was above our guidance of $1.07 to $1.10 per share. Non-GAAP EPS of $1.59 per share also exceeded our guided range of $1.48 to $1.51 per share. The strength in EPS was driven by stronger-than-anticipated operating margin during the quarter, benefits to operating expenses and other income related to foreign currency and a more favorable tax rate than expected. Product revenue of $244.1 million, up 1% sequentially and 8% year-over-year, represented 52% of total revenue. Service revenue of $228 million increased 3% sequentially, 17% year-over-year and accounted for 48% of total revenue.
Revenue from the Americas accounted for 57% of total during the quarter; EMEA contributed 24%; APAC, 14%; and Japan, 5%. On a year-over-year basis, Americas and EMEA grew revenue 14%, APAC 11% and Japan revenue was down 3%. Enterprise customers represented 65% of total sales during the quarter. Service providers accounted for 24% and government sales were 12%, including 5% of total sales from U.S. federal. In Q2, we had 4 greater than 10% distributors: Westcon, which accounted for 16.6%; Ingram Micro at 15.5%; Avnet representing 13.5%; and Arrow, which accounted for 10.5%.
Our GAAP gross margin in Q2 was 82.5%. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 83.9%. GAAP operating expenses were $256.7 million, at the low-end of our guided range of $255 million to $264 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $223.1 million. GAAP operating margin was 28.1%. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 36.6%. Our GAAP effective tax rate for Q2 was 37%. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 34.6%.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash flow from operations was $142.3 million, driven by higher-than-expected profitability and stronger-than-expected collections in the current quarter. In Q2, we repurchased just under 1.4 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $113.29 for a total of $156.9 million, ending the quarter with approximately $1.13 billion in cash and investments. Approximately $774 million remains authorized under the share repurchase program.
DSO at the end of Q2 was 50 days. Inventories were $29.3 million. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $10.2 million. Deferred revenue increased 23% year-over-year to $720.6 million. We ended the quarter with 4,035 employees, an increase of 90 in the prior quarter.
Now for the Q3 outlook. In keeping with recent historical patterns, ongoing strength of our major drivers and the robust pipeline, we anticipate continued sales momentum with sequential and year-over-year growth in the second half of fiscal 2015. That said, we believe the possible continued impact of foreign currency should be considered as we move into Q3. With that in mind, our revenue target for the third quarter of fiscal 2015 is $475 million to $485 million. GAAP gross margin is anticipated to be in the 82% to 82.5% range, including approximately $4 million of stock-based compensation expense and $2.7 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets. Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be in the 83.5% to 84% range.
We anticipate GAAP operating expenses in the range of $257 million to $266 million. This includes approximately $34.5 million of stock-based compensation expense and $0.7 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets. For Q3, we are forecasting a GAAP effective tax rate of 37% and a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 35%. Our GAAP EPS target is $1.16 to $1.19 per share. Our non-GAAP EPS target is $1.57 to $1.60 per share. We plan to increase our headcount by 100 to 125 employees in the current quarter and we believe our cash flow from operations will be at or around $170 million.
With that, I will turn the call over to John McAdam."

Before I go on to talk about Q2 results and Q3 outlook, I just want to say a few opening remarks on the organization announcement that we released today. Firstly, I'd like to congratulate Manny Rivelo, on his appointment as President and CEO of F5, effective on July 1 this year. When I announced my intention to retire on October last year, I stated that a key priority would be to work closely with our board to have a smooth and effective transition plan for my successor. I will work with Manny and the F5 executive team over the next couple of months to ensure the smooth and efficient handover of responsibilities, and then assume the position of nonexecutive Chairman of the F5 board. Al Higginson, who was been our nonexecutive Chairman for the last 11 years, will assume the position of lead independent director. I am confident that Manny's understanding of technology trends, his strategic vision, operational experience and tremendous culture fit with the F5 values will ensure that F5 continues to have a fantastic future, and I'm sure you'll join me in wishing him great success in his new role.
Okay. Let's talk about our Q2 performance and our outlook for Q3 and beyond. Overall, I was pleased with our performance in Q2. From a sales perspective, the Americas region had a very solid quarter, with double-digit year-over-year sales bookings growth, delivering the internal forecast. In particular, sales from $1 million plus deals in Q2 increased significantly over Q1 and this was a significant factor in the Americas region's strong results.
The EMEA region continued to deliver year-over-year sales bookings growth, though the growth was not as strong as we have seen in previous quarters and was below our internal forecast. Sales in our APAC region were also below our initial forecast and sales in Japan was slightly above the forecast. Our Services business continued to deliver solid results and excellent profitability, along with a healthy increase in deferred revenue, which is now approximately $721 million, up 6% sequentially, which should bode well for future business.
From a software perspective, the latest industry analyst report show us as the clear market leader in the virtual-addition ADC market, driven by our ability to provide our solutions as virtual software offerings -- software-only offerings across all the major hypervisors and a unique orchestration functionality in BIG-IQ to enable customers to move to software-defined data centers and NFV architectures. Also, the combination of GBB pricing, virtual ADC sales and a solid attach rate of software modules continue to result in solid software growth.
We had a number of last project wins with our security solutions last quarter. In our Q1 call, 3 months ago, I mentioned that we had won a large scale, AFM Gi firewall project and a Tier 1 service provider in North America. This project is now in production. We received more orders last quarter as the customer rolls out more of the Gi firewall solution throughout their network, and we expect to see continuing business from this project during this fiscal year and in fiscal 2016.
We also plan to replicate the success whenever possible in the overall service provider market. We continue to believe that our security business will be our largest growth driver. We expect to see strong demand for our increasing portfolio of security solutions as customers look to adopt hybrid architectures, deploying applications both in premise and in the cloud. As you will recall, we launched our Silverline hybrid application strategy in November with the initial launch including our subscription-based DDoS service and our anti-malware and phishing protection service.
We extended our Silverline services platform a couple of weeks ago with our industry-leading WAF capabilities. As the latest addition to F5's Silverline's cloud-based application services platform, the new WAF offering is built on our industry-leading ASM solution. We now offer our customers leading WAF services in both on-premise and subscription-based cloud offerings. This new cloud offering provides both ease and speed of deployment and allows organization to confidently incorporate cloud resources while protecting out data from increasingly sophisticated security attacks, risks and vulnerabilities.
I was very pleased with the progress we made on our strategic initiatives in the service provider market last quarter. We had a strong presence at Mobile World Congress, where we showcased NFV solutions that power and secure service provider networks. Sales in the service provider market were very solid last quarter, with sales bookings at a record high. The American regions in particular had a very solid quarter, with several wins with the Tier 1 service providers, as well as a number of competitive wins in the cable companies. We won several competitive replacements last quarter, including the Gi firewall project I mentioned earlier, and we had some solid wins with our traffic LTE solution, including license upgrades as LTE traffic increased in the installed base. Also, Gi consolidation, traffic steering and optimization also continue to be good drivers for us in the service provider market.
As I mentioned last quarter, our hybrid application services based on our Synthesis architecture and Silverline cloud services is resonating really well with our customers and partners. This strategy, combined with the strength of our partner ecosystem in areas like SDN, provide F5 with the opportunity to play a very strategic role as customers continue to strive for competitive advantage and maximum agility by moving to new technology architectures. Also, our portfolio of application products and cloud services continues to expand aggressively, which in turn significantly expands our addressable market and increases the types of revenue streams available to our sales force and partner channel.
As far as the outlook is concerned, Andy indicated that we expect to deliver both sequential and year-over-year growth this quarter. Although we face some potential headwinds as a result of the currency movements in some regions, especially EMEA, I was very pleased with the positive rebound we experienced with the revenue from $1 million plus deals, and I continue to believe that the fundamental drivers of our business remain robust. We remain committed to plan for growth in our business by investing in headcount and infrastructure moving forward, whilst delivering world-class operating margins. I believe that our existing product portfolio, our hybrid application services strategy and our product road map are not only in line with customer and market trends but are also key to enabling those trends.
In conclusion, I would like to thank the entire F5 team, our partners and customers for their support last quarter. Before we move over to Q&A, I will hand over to Manny to give you his thoughts on F5's opportunities looking forward and talk briefly about our strategic initiatives."

Regarding our vision. Over the past years, F5 has evolved beyond our traditional data center routes to include a robust hybrid products and services portfolio, including scale out virtual additions, in the cloud products and as a service solutions, all complementing our market-leading ADC technology. In addition, our innovative approach towards protecting applications has made F5 a logical addition to many companies' security posture. And lastly, our broadened ecosystem of technology partners will help us deliver our Synthesis architecture to meet the ever-increasing SDN, NFV, cloud and security applications opportunities. In partnership with our leadership team, we'll continue to evolve the company to ensure F5 can deliver application services in the way that makes the most business sense to our customers, whether that's on premise, in the cloud or on-demand and always with the confidence that F5 is defending those applications.
Lastly, our most important asset is our people. I'll lead in a collaborative, transparent and respectful way. In my first month as CEO, I'm dedicated to listening to our employees, to hearing what motivates them and to hear about their ideas of how to make F5 even a better place to work and also how best to serve our customers.

And that's what has led us to deeper look around the foreign currency elements of this, which we think are tied there.

We're seeing -- actually, our virtual ADCs grow at a nice clip over the last couple of quarters and really over the last couple of years. But what we're seeing is 2 trends. One is that new applications are getting virtual ADCs, meaning in today's architecture where either applications are moving to the cloud or they're moving to a much more software-defined data center, we're seeing those virtual ADCs take over. However, in those same instances, customers are looking for traditional hardware solutions in what we tend to call internally a 2-tier architecture, meaning the exterior tier of the data center is usually hardware and in that level we provide services with our custom-built hardware that provides high throughput, high-performance, and then we apply virtual, if you will, ADCs at the application layer on the back end of the tier. So we think it's actually complementary. We think that to succeed in the market, you need both the hardware components and the software components working in tandem, providing both on prem and off prem solutions."

Interestingly enough, it was very solid in the Americas, in North America in particular, it was actually very solid with pretty significant growth. We did see a little bit of deceleration in APAC and EMEA, which is actually somewhat counterintuitive because they were slower to pick up the GBB process. I actually view that as good news because we think, first of all, that's not a trend that will continue because there's a lot of runway in EMEA and APAC, and it was probably linked to the exchange issues, the foreign currency issues, which was the bigger picture of the business.

So yes, we believe that GBB is transforming the ADC market and the growth rate of the overall ADC market. And the rationale for that is because what we're doing is consolidating a set of services, layer 4 through 7 service inside a product. The traditional ADC product itself was predominantly started out being a load balancer in the early days, if you go back a decade or so ago. And since then, we've incorporated into that product firewall technologies, secure web gate technologies, service provider technologies, the list goes on and on, that's part of the value proposition, the traffic management operating system or BIG-IP that we bring to market. So by looking at that, we think the addressable market of our solutions is about a $12 billion opportunity for us. That's what we talked about at the analyst conference last November. We're tracking to that and we monitor that very closely. If you look at just the ADC market, right, in the old definition, that would be about a $4 billion market. So we think we've added to the new definition approximately $8 billion of incremental TAM."

Have you seen any sign that they're cutting back on their IT purchases? And historically, it's been the case, the first thing that gets cut is networking. Are there any signs of that? And then on the Gi firewall deal that you all called out, in terms of the dollar contribution, can you give us some sense of the magnitude? And I heard you say that you expect this to continue through '16. I guess I'm trying to get a sense of the concentration risk from that 1 deal."

Our second quarter fiscal 2015 was marked by solid sales in North America, where we saw both a rebound in sales from large deals compared to our first fiscal quarter and record sales levels in our service provider vertical. These areas of",721,"Thank you, John. Our second quarter fiscal 2015 was marked by solid sales in North America, where we saw both a rebound in sales from large deals compared to our first fiscal quarter and record sales levels in our service provider vertical. These areas of strength were somewhat offset by some late quarter softness in sales in our EMEA and APAC theaters and Latin America region, likely impacted by the strengthening U.S. dollar. Revenue and earnings both grew sequentially and year-over-year, with several factors contributing to strong profitability and cash flow from operations.
Revenue of $472.1 million grew 2% from the prior quarter and 12% year-over-year and was above the midpoint of our $465 million to $475 million guided range. GAAP EPS of $1.18 per share was above our guidance of $1.07 to $1.10 per share. Non-GAAP EPS of $1.59 per share also exceeded our guided range of $1.48 to $1.51 per share. The strength in EPS was driven by stronger-than-anticipated operating margin during the quarter, benefits to operating expenses and other income related to foreign currency and a more favorable tax rate than expected. Product revenue of $244.1 million, up 1% sequentially and 8% year-over-year, represented 52% of total revenue. Service revenue of $228 million increased 3% sequentially, 17% year-over-year and accounted for 48% of total revenue.
Revenue from the Americas accounted for 57% of total during the quarter; EMEA contributed 24%; APAC, 14%; and Japan, 5%. On a year-over-year basis, Americas and EMEA grew revenue 14%, APAC 11% and Japan revenue was down 3%. Enterprise customers represented 65% of total sales during the quarter. Service providers accounted for 24% and government sales were 12%, including 5% of total sales from U.S. Federal. In Q2, we had 4 greater-than-10% distributors: Westcon, which accounted for 16.6%; Ingram Micro at 15.5%; Avnet representing 13.5%; and Arrow, which accounted for 10.5%.
Our GAAP gross margin in Q2 was 82.5%. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 83.9%. GAAP operating expenses were $256.7 million, at the low-end of our guided range of $255 million to $264 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $223.1 million. GAAP operating margin was 28.1%. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 36.6%. Our GAAP effective tax rate for Q2 was 37%. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 34.6%.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash flow from operations was $142.3 million, driven by higher-than-expected profitability and stronger-than-expected collections in the current quarter. In Q2, we repurchased just under 1.4 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $113.29 for a total of $156.9 million, ending the quarter with approximately $1.13 billion in cash and investments. Approximately $774 million remains authorized under the share repurchase program.
DSO at the end of Q2 was 50 days. Inventories were $29.3 million. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $10.2 million. Deferred revenue increased 23% year-over-year to $720.6 million. We ended the quarter with 4,035 employees, an increase of 90 from the prior quarter.
Now for the Q3 outlook. In keeping with recent historical patterns, ongoing strength of our major drivers and the robust pipeline, we anticipate continued sales momentum with sequential and year-over-year growth in the second half of fiscal 2015. That said, we believe the possible continued impact of foreign currency should be considered as we move into Q3. With that in mind, our revenue target for the third quarter of fiscal 2015 is $475 million to $485 million. GAAP gross margin is anticipated to be in the 82% to 82.5% range, including approximately $4 million of stock-based compensation expense and $2.7 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets. Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be in the 83.5% to 84% range.
We anticipate GAAP operating expenses in the range of $257 million to $266 million. This includes approximately $34.5 million of stock-based compensation expense and $0.7 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets. For Q3, we are forecasting a GAAP effective tax rate of 37% and a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 35%. Our GAAP EPS target is $1.16 to $1.19 per share. Our non-GAAP EPS target is $1.57 to $1.60 per share. We plan to increase our headcount by 100 to 125 employees in the current quarter, and we believe our cash flow from operations will be at or around $170 million.
With that, I will turn the call over to John McAdam."

Before I go on to talk about Q2 results and Q3 outlook, I just want to say a few opening remarks on the organizational announcement that we released today. Firstly, I'd like to congratulate Manny Rivelo, on his appointment as President and CEO of F5, effective on July 1 this year. When I announced my intention to retire in October last year, I stated that a key priority would be to work closely with our board to have a smooth and effective transition plan for my successor. I will work with Manny and the F5 executive team over the next couple of months to ensure a smooth and efficient handover of responsibilities, and then assume the position of nonexecutive Chairman of the F5 board. Al Higginson, who was been our nonexecutive Chairman for the last 11 years, will assume the position of lead independent director. I am confident that Manny's understanding of technology trends, his strategic vision, operational experience and tremendous culture fit with the F5 values will ensure that F5 continues to have a fantastic future, and I'm sure you'll join me in wishing him great success in his new role.
Okay. Let's talk about our Q2 performance and our outlook for Q3 and beyond. Overall, I was pleased with our performance in Q2. From a sales perspective, the Americas region had a very solid quarter with double-digit year-over-year sales bookings growth, delivering the internal forecast. In particular, sales from $1 million-plus deals in Q2 increased significantly over Q1, and this was a significant factor in the Americas region's strong results.
The EMEA region continued to deliver year-over-year sales bookings growth, though the growth was not as strong as we have seen in previous quarters and was below our internal forecast. Sales in our APAC region were also below our initial forecast, and sales in Japan were slightly above the forecast. Our Services business continued to deliver solid results and excellent profitability, along with a healthy increase in deferred revenue, which is now approximately $721 million, up 6% sequentially, which should bode well for future business.
From a software perspective, the latest industry analyst reports show us as the clear market leader in the Virtual Edition ADC market, driven by our ability to provide our solutions as virtual software offerings -- software-only offerings across all the major hypervisors, and our unique orchestration functionality in BIG-IQ to enable customers to move to software-defined data centers and NFV architectures. Also, the combination of GBB pricing, virtual ADC sales and a solid attach rate of software modules continue to result in solid software growth.
We had a number of large project wins with our security solutions last quarter. In our Q1 call, 3 months ago, I mentioned that we had won a large scale, AFM Gi firewall project and a Tier 1 service provider in North America. This project is now in production. We received more orders last quarter as the customer rolls out more of the Gi firewall solution throughout their network. And we expect to see continuing business from this project during this fiscal year and in fiscal 2016.
We also plan to replicate the success wherever possible in the overall service provider market. We continue to believe that our security business will be our largest growth driver. We expect to see strong demand for our increasing portfolio of security solutions as customers look to adopt hybrid architectures, deploying applications both in premise and in the cloud. As you will recall, we launched our Silverline hybrid application strategy in November, with the initial launch including our subscription-based DDoS service and our anti-malware and phishing protection service.
We extended our Silverline services platform a couple of weeks ago with our industry-leading WAF capabilities. As the latest addition to F5 Silverline's cloud-based application services platform, the new WAF offering is built on our industry-leading ASM solution. We now offer our customers leading WAF services in both on-premise and subscription-based cloud offerings. This new cloud offering provides both ease and speed of deployment and allows organizations to confidently incorporate cloud resources while protecting apps and data from increasingly sophisticated security attacks, risks and vulnerabilities.
I was very pleased with the progress we made on our strategic initiatives in the service provider market last quarter. We had a strong presence at Mobile World Congress, where we showcased NFV solutions that power and secure service provider networks. Sales in the service provider market were very solid last quarter, with sales bookings at a record high. The American regions in particular had a very solid quarter, with several wins with the Tier 1 service providers, as well as a number of competitive wins in the cable companies. We won several competitive replacements last quarter, including the Gi firewall project I mentioned earlier, and we had some solid wins with our Traffix LTE solution, including license upgrades as LTE traffic increased in the installed base. Also, Gi consolidation, traffic steering and optimization also continue to be good drivers for us in the service provider market.
As I mentioned last quarter, our hybrid application services based on our Synthesis architecture and Silverline cloud services is resonating really well with our customers and partners. This strategy, combined with the strength of our partner ecosystem in areas like SDN, provide F5 with the opportunity to play a very strategic role as customers continue to strive for competitive advantage and maximum agility by moving to new technology architectures. Also, our portfolio of application products and cloud services continues to expand aggressively, which in turn significantly expands our addressable market and increases the types of revenue streams available to our sales force and partner channels.
As far as the outlook is concerned, Andy indicated that we expect to deliver both sequential and year-over-year growth this quarter. Although we face some potential headwinds as a result of the currency movements in some regions, especially EMEA, I was very pleased with the positive rebound we experienced with the revenue from $1 million-plus deals, and I continue to believe that the fundamental drivers of our business remain robust. We remain committed to plan for growth in our business by investing in headcount and infrastructure moving forward, whilst delivering world-class operating margins. I believe that our existing product portfolio, our hybrid application services strategy and our product road map are not only in line with customer and market trends but are also key to enabling those trends.
In conclusion, I would like to thank the entire F5 team, our partners and customers for their support last quarter. Before we move over to Q&A, I will hand over to Manny to give you his thoughts on F5's opportunities looking forward and talk briefly about our strategic initiatives."

We've been talking with the sales teams, looking at specific deals where we think that was an impact, and that's really how the quarter laid out linearity-wise and has led us to this look at the foreign currency and a little bit of a cautious approach around that."

We're seeing -- actually, our virtual ADCs grow at a nice clip over the last couple of quarters and really over the last couple of years. But what we're seeing is 2 trends. One is that new applications are getting virtual ADCs, meaning in today's architecture, where either applications are moving to the cloud or they're moving to a much more software-defined data center, we're seeing those virtual ADCs take over. However, in those same instances, customers are looking for traditional hardware solutions in what we tend to call internally a 2-tier architecture, meaning the exterior tier of the data center is usually hardware, and in that level we provide services with our custom-built hardware that provides high throughput, high-performance, and then we apply virtual, if you will, ADCs at the application layer on the back end of the tier. So we think it's actually complementary. We think that to succeed in the market, you need both the hardware components and the software components working in tandem, providing both on-prem and off-prem solutions."

Interestingly enough, it was very solid in the Americas. In North America in particular, it was actually very solid with pretty significant growth. We did see a little bit of deceleration in APAC and EMEA, which is actually somewhat counterintuitive because they were slower to pick up the GBB process. I actually view that as good news because we think, first of all, that's not a trend that will continue because there's a lot of runway in EMEA and APAC, and it was probably linked to the exchange issues, the foreign currency issues, which was the bigger picture with the business. So very happy with what happened in North America and let me say, it was still very significant revenue and very material part of the product revenue."

The traditional ADC product itself was predominantly started out being a load balancer in the early days, if you go back a decade or so ago. And since then, we've incorporated into that product firewall technologies, secure web gate technologies, service provider technologies, the list goes on and on, that's part of the value proposition, the traffic management operating system or BIG-IP that we bring to market. So by looking at that, we think the addressable market of our solutions is about a $12 billion opportunity for us. That's what we talked about at the analyst conference last November. We're tracking to that and we monitor that very closely. If you look at just the ADC market, right, in the old definition, that would be about a $4 billion market.

In the third quarter of fiscal 2015, F5 delivered solid results that reflect growing demand for our expanding array of products and services. As more large organizations deploy hybrid architectures, we continue to see momentum in sales of our software offerings, both as modules on our purpose built hardware and the standalone virtual editions.
During Q3, we also saw the beginning of what we believe will be a steady ramp in sales of our subscription-based Silverline services. These trends, combined with the ongoing success of our Good-Better-Best sales motion, demand for our security products and continued traction with our key partners, all contributed to the quarter's positive results.
Revenue of $483.6 million grew 2% from the prior quarter and 10% year-over-year and was at the high end of our $475 million to $485 million guided range. GAAP EPS of $1.29 per share was above our guidance of $1.16 to $1.19 per share. Non-GAAP EPS of $1.67 per share also exceeded our guided range of $1.57 to $1.60 per share. The strength in EPS was driven by our solid revenue and operating margin results and lower-than-expected tax rate during the quarter. Product revenue of $248.8 million, up 2% sequentially and 5% year-over-year, represented 51% of total revenue. Service revenue of $234.8 million increased 3% sequentially, 15% year-over-year and accounted for 49% of total revenue.
The Americas accounted for 58% of revenue during the quarter. EMEA contributed 24%; APAC, 13%; and Japan, 4%. On a year-over-year basis, Americas revenue grew 13%; EMEA revenue grew 14%. Conversely, APAC revenue declined 6% and Japan revenue was down 2%.
Enterprise customers represented 66% of total sales during the quarter. Service providers accounted for 20% and government sales were 14%, including 6% of total sales from U.S. Federal. 
In Q3, we have 3 greater than 10% distributors: Westcon, which accounted for 19.2%; Ingram Micro, which represented 16.7%; and Avnet representing 13.5%.
Our GAAP gross margin in Q3 was 82.3%. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 83.6%. GAAP operating expenses were $257.8 million at the low end of our guided range of $257 million to $266 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $224.3 million.
GAAP operating margin was 29%. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 37.2%. Our GAAP effective tax rate for Q3 was 33.9%. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 33.5%.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash flow from operations was $172.5 million. In Q3, we repurchased just over 1.2 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $124.92 for a total of $150 million, ending the quarter with approximately $1.16 billion in cash and investments. Approximately $624 million remains authorized under the share repurchase program.
DSO at the end of Q3 was 49 days. Inventories were $30 million. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $21.2 million. Deferred revenue increased 20% year-over-year to $742.5 million. We ended the quarter with 4,110 employees, an increase of 75 from the prior quarter.
Now for the outlook. Building on another quarter of solid momentum with our key drivers, we believe we will continue to see strong year-over-year revenue and earnings growth. Our revenue target for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 is $500 million to $510 million.
GAAP gross margin is anticipated to be in the 82% to 82.5% range. This includes approximately $4 million of stock-based compensation expense and $2.7 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets. Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be in the 83.5% to 84% range. We anticipate GAAP operating expenses in the range of $267 million to $276 million. This includes approximately $38.5 million in stock-based compensation expense and $0.07 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets. The stock-based compensation guidance reflects a one-time approximately $5 million increase as a result of the CEO transition as outlined in our 8-K filed April 22.
For Q4, we are forecasting a GAAP effective tax rate of 37% and a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 35%. Reflecting the increased stock-based compensation expense, our GAAP EPS target is $1.26 to $1.29 per share. Our non-GAAP EPS target is $1.72 to $1.75 per share. We plan to increase our headcount by at least 125 employees in the current quarter, and we believe our cash flow from operations will be at or around $185 million.
And with that, I will turn the call over to Manny Rivelo."

Overall, I am with our performance in Q3, as reflected by record revenue and profitability. Among the notable signs of our progress this past quarter, we significantly grew our software revenue with the uptake of our Good-Better-Best packaging driving million dollar plus deals. Moreover, our standalone software module attach rates were solid, especially the security modules. We saw major deals from service providers in the areas of Gi land service consolidation, security, network function virtualization. And we're excited about the progress we saw on our Silverline anti dot subscription service, plus the recently launched Silverline Web application firewall that has opened up new use cases to our customers.
From a regional perspective, we had a strong quarter in the Americas with bookings ahead of our internal expectations. In EMEA, we saw bookings growth rebound off a slower Q2 performance with particular strength in Northern Europe.
Bookings in our Asia Pac and Japan regions were slightly down year-over-year, in line with our expectation heading into the quarter. Now let me drill down into the specifics of our major business drivers, which includes core, security, service provider, professional service and our partner ecosystem.
In our core business, we continue to help our customers leverage our synthesis architecture to deliver their applications in the most efficient, secure and cost-effective manner. This includes optimizing their own data centers, as well as leveraging both private and public clouds.
Key to this is offering all of our products to software that can run on the major industry hypervisors are on top of a high-performance hardware. Software is at the core of everything we do. Over the past 3 years, quarterly revenue from the sales of the software modules and virtual editions has more than doubled, accounting for more than 1/3 of our product revenue in Q3. The growth of our software only business is reflected in a recent industry analyst report, which reported that we grew 2.5x faster than the general virtual ADC market, making us the market leader.
As more of our customers deploy hybrid solutions and adapt our Good-Better-Best offerings, we believe this trend will continue. An example of a key customer win validating our hybrid application services strategy due to the large hardware and software deal with an academic, medical sets that has standardized on F5. Leveraging our Access Policy Manager, specifically, the portal access, we are helping them drive down their total cost of ownership while creating the flexibility to move their applications between different cloud providers.
In addition, we continue to see success with our platform refresh in the Cisco2 ACE replacement programs with many of our customers expanding their solutions to include our enhanced software modules. Lastly, our use of community DevCentral grew nicely at 38% year-over-year with over 200,000 members, further demonstrating the value of our team programmable architecture.
Our security modules remain a very major growth driver for us. Given this past quarter's highly visible cybersecurity FX, customers from an increasing diverse pool are approaching F5 for our ability to secure application, manage user policy and access, and mitigate application attacks across traditional data centers in public and private clouds. 
As a result, we had a number of notable wins this quarter, including a branch of the U.S. government, a prestigious medical research group, both of needed to security organizations for more access capabilities. In addition, a multinational defense contract to purchase our Access Policy Manager for single sign-on Federation. And three, national carriers came to F5 for a variety of security solutions. Key among them was our DNS security for mobile devices.
As you may recall, we also launched our Silverline DDoS mitigation service last November. And this past quarter, we launch our Web application firewall service built on our industry-leading Application Security Manager. We've seen solid early adoption of the services. 
For example, a household name in retail that is an F5 customer added anti-dDoS Silverline protection in Q3 to their global Web properties. Over the next several quarters, we plan to deliver additional server line services, including an upcoming iRule catalogue that can be leveraged for various application solutions allowing 0 day vulnerability protection. Addition, we will deliver hybrid on and off premise solutions that allow seamless inoperability between our Silverline SaaS offerings and BIG-IP on-premise solutions.
In April, we opened a new Security Operations Center in Seattle. This gives us 7 by 24 support to client helping mitigate Web fraud, malware, phishing attempts and to combat DDoS and Web application attacks through our Silverline services. The service provider side, major carriers across the globe continue expanding their use cases with F5, driving down their cost and expanding their monetization strategies. In particular our solutions around GI lab service consideration, network function virtualization, Gi firewall and Diameter routing are helping service providers mission critical service issues like traffic management, increase mobile application delivery and security.
In Q3, we signed our largest service provider security deal to date, a multi-million dollar agreement with a domestic Tier 1 carrier. Meanwhile, a major operator in Asia Pac leveraging 2 of our key ecosystem partners recently achieved Ed C certification for the F5 NSC solution positioning our virtual editions as network functions. 
During Q3, our services business continues produced solid results with 15% year-over-year revenue growth. New and renewed service maintenance contracts drove 20% year-over-year of deferred revenue totaling $743 million, which ensures a positive revenue stream for quarters to come.
From a partner ecosystem perspective, we continue to see great momentum in our partnership with the likes of Amazon, Cisco, VMWare and Microsoft. I can point the competitive SDN, cloud and VDI wins in media companies, technology companies in large U.S. retailers. We are confident that our current and future roadmaps position us well in helping our current customers and future prospects migrate their application services to software defined infrastructures.
In the meantime, as CEO, I want to ensure that we're continually evading delivering best of breed products for customers and as spending our addressable market. ACUVAIL success is continuing to invest in the right people to help F5 reach a next several growth, we've hired and EVP of human resources. Kristen Venlo has joined us from Microsoft and shall be focused on recruiting and retaining world-class talent. 
Another organizational change is a transition of the worldwide sales team to a new leader. After 11 years of service, with sales that ranked in the billions, Dave Inge has decided to step in October 1 to spend more time with his family on the East Coast. I want to thank Dave for all that he is built at F5, especially the strong global sales seem and our lead position in the ADC market. We're actively looking for Dave's successor and plan to announce our decision shortly.
As you heard from Andy, we've had a solid year thus far and look forward to a strong finish in Q4. We will continue to focus on ensuring that our customer's applications can run with it run best, our emphasis will be on driving top line growth, particularly for product revenue. I am excited about what the future holds. In Q4, we'll launch our next version of BIG-IP, version 12.0. This release will help our customers navigate application centric environment without compromising our security our operational efficiency.
With new features like modern. graphic cyber support, HTTP 2.0, single sign-on enhancement, hyper scale BNS and expanded SPN and cloud orchestration and management options, as well as early assets features for our next generation of I app and iRules. We expect this release to open up over $500 million in additional addressable market.
We're excited to our longer-term plan, I want to spend a few minutes on our visions and strategy. We help organizations deliver the fastest, more secure and reliable applications to any one, anywhere on any device. We're delivering on this vision through flexible scale up and skill in architecture that means we can provide our customers with consolidated set of our application of services on-premise, in the cloud and as a service.
More over, we know that applications have become more prolific and dynamic, operational complexity has become the primary constraint holding organizations back. F5 is eliminating this complexity while simultaneously driving down the total cost of obligations ownership via centralized management orchestration and analytics driven insights. We call this F5 Synthesis hybrid application services and is the cornerstone of our business and technology strategy. 
In closing, I would like to thank the entire F5 team, our partners and customers for the support last quarter and we look forward to a great Q4. I will now open the call up for Q&A."

It's not as if the market is rapidly transitioning share software softer to hardware. What we're seeing is a new set of applications that require much more of a scale out solution and/or applications that are going directly into cloud environment. We actually think that the future architectures have 2 tiers associated with it. And what I mean, by that is an ingress here inside into the data center that requires high-performance hardware to mitigate traffic whether it will be firewall services, DDoS attacks and all of those capabilities we provide using our hardware. On top of that, what we see the secretary, which tested much more propagation tier, which could go to these. So we think will have a mix of both hardware and software. And in the other part, are we going to see cannibalization of hardware business? The way the price our VE relative to our hardware is on par from a unit pricing perspective. And I'll just give you an absolute data point so you could have that. If you look at a 5 gig Virtual Edition of our product, it's about $26,000. Our BIG-IP 2200, it's about $28,000. So it's almost on par and those are both 5 gig devices inside the environment. So what we're really seeing is customers making a decision much more another they want accelerate performance and or they want flexibility to software for scale out architecture.

We're seeing additional opportunities that tend to be not the large market count, much more the mid-market that we're going after at this point in time. And then what we're seeing is repeat business, either because these were largest all basis that are being consumed over time and customers are turning. Dozens or hundreds of devices over time, they repeat that purchase cycle. But what we also so when repeat that purchase cycle, we see them consuming our Good-Better-Best licensing modules or our software modules. Meaning, that we're having a deeper penetration and we're swapping out our traditional ACE balance here for really an ADC platform and/or service consolidation platform.

In the third quarter of fiscal 2015, F5 delivered solid results that reflect growing demand for our expanding array of products and services. As more large organizations deploy hybrid architectures, we continue to see momentum in sales of our software offerings, both as modules on our purpose-built hardware and the stand-alone virtual editions.
During Q3, we also saw the beginning of what we believe will be a steady ramp in sales of our subscription-based Silverline services. These trends, combined with the ongoing success of our ‘Good, Better, Best’ sales motion, demand for our security products and continued traction with our key partners, all contributed to the quarter's positive results.
Revenue of $483.6 million grew 2% from the prior quarter and 10% year-over-year and was at the high end of our $475 million to $485 million guided range. GAAP EPS of $1.29 per share was above our guidance of $1.16 to $1.19 per share. Non-GAAP EPS of $1.67 per share also exceeded our guided range of $1.57 to $1.60 per share. The strength in EPS was driven by our solid revenue and operating margin results and lower-than-expected tax rate during the quarter. Product revenue of $248.8 million, up 2% sequentially and 5% year-over-year, represented 51% of total revenue. Service revenue of $234.8 million increased 3% sequentially, 15% year-over-year and accounted for 49% of total revenue.
The Americas accounted for 58% of revenue during the quarter. EMEA contributed 24%; APAC, 13%; and Japan, 4%. On a year-over-year basis, Americas revenue grew 13%. EMEA revenue grew 14%. Conversely, APAC revenue declined 6%, and Japan revenue was down 2%.
Enterprise customers represented 66% of total sales during the quarter. Service providers accounted for 20%, and government sales were 14%, including 6% of total sales from U.S. Federal. 
In Q3, we have 3 greater-than-10% distributors: Westcon, which accounted for 19.2%; Ingram Micro, which represented 16.7%; and Avnet, representing 13.5%.
Our GAAP gross margin in Q3 was 82.3%. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 83.6%. GAAP operating expenses were $257.8 million at the low end of our guided range of $257 million to $266 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $224.3 million.
GAAP operating margin was 29%. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 37.2%. Our GAAP effective tax rate for Q3 was 33.9%. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 33.5%.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash flow from operations was $172.5 million. In Q3, we repurchased just over 1.2 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $124.92 for a total of $150 million, ending the quarter with approximately $1.16 billion in cash and investments. Approximately $624 million remains authorized under the share repurchase program.
DSO at the end of Q3 was 49 days. Inventories were $30 million. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $21.2 million. Deferred revenue increased 20% year-over-year to $742.5 million. We ended the quarter with 4,110 employees, an increase of 75 from the prior quarter.
Now for the outlook. Building on another quarter of solid momentum with our key drivers, we believe we will continue to see strong year-over-year revenue and earnings growth. Our revenue target for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 is $500 million to $510 million.
GAAP gross margin is anticipated to be in the 82% to 82.5% range. This includes approximately $4 million of stock-based compensation expense and $2.7 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets. Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be in the 83.5% to 84% range. We anticipate GAAP operating expenses in the range of $267 million to $276 million. This includes approximately $38.5 million in stock-based compensation expense and $0.07 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets. The stock-based compensation guidance reflects a onetime approximately $5 million increase as a result of the CEO transition as outlined in our 8-K filed April 22.
For Q4, we are forecasting a GAAP effective tax rate of 37% and a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 35%. Reflecting the increased stock-based compensation expense, our GAAP EPS target is $1.26 to $1.29 per share. Our non-GAAP EPS target is $1.72 to $1.75 per share. We plan to increase our headcount by at least 125 employees in the current quarter, and we believe our cash flow from operations will be at or around $185 million.
And with that, I will turn the call over to Manny Rivelo."

I would like to thank everybody for joining F5's 2015 Q3 Earnings Conference Call. Overall, I am pleased with our performance in Q3 as reflected by a record revenue and profitability.

Overall, I am pleased with our performance in Q3 as reflected by a record revenue and profitability. Among the notable signs of our progress this past quarter, we significantly grew our software revenue with the uptake of our ‘Good, Better, Best’ packaging, driving million-dollar plus deals. Moreover, our stand-alone software module attach rates were solid, especially the security modules. We saw major deals from service providers in the areas of Gi LAN service consolidation, security, network function virtualization. And we're excited about the progress we saw on our Silverline anti-DDoS subscription service, plus the recently launched Silverline Web application firewall that has opened up new use cases for our customers.
From a regional perspective, we had a strong quarter in the Americas, with bookings ahead of our internal expectations. In EMEA, we saw bookings growth rebound off a slower Q2 performance, with particular strength in Northern Europe. Bookings in our Asia Pac and Japan regions were slightly down year-over-year, in line with our expectations heading into the quarter. 
Now let me drill down into the specifics of our major business drivers, which include core, security, service provider, professional services and our partner ecosystem.
In our core business, we continue to help our customers leverage our Synthesis architecture to deliver their applications in the most efficient, secure and cost-effective manner. This includes optimizing their own data centers as well as leveraging both private and public clouds. Key to this is offering all of our products and software that can run on the major industry hypervisors on top of a high-performance hardware. Software is at the core of everything we do. Over the past 3 years, quarterly revenue from the sales of software modules and virtual editions has more than doubled, accounting for more than 1/3 of our product revenue in Q3. The growth of our software-only business is reflected in a recent industry analyst report, which reported that we grew 2.5x faster than the general virtual ADC market, making us the market leader.
As more of our customers deploy hybrid solutions and adopt our 'Good, Better, Best' offerings, we believe this trend will continue. An example of a key customer win validating our hybrid application services strategy is a large hardware and software deal with an academic medical center that has standardized on F5. Leveraging our Access Policy Manager, specifically the portal access, we are helping them drive down their total cost of ownership while creating the flexibility to move their applications between different cloud providers.
In addition, we continue to see success with our platform refresh in the Cisco ACE replacement programs, with many of our customers expanding their solutions to include our enhanced software modules. 
Lastly, our use of community, DevCentral grew nicely at 38% year-over-year with over 200,000 members, further demonstrating the value of our TMOS programmable architecture.
 
Our security modules remain a very major growth driver for us. Given this past quarter's highly visible cybersecurity attacks, more customers from an increasing diverse pool are approaching F5 for our ability to secure applications, manage user policy and access and mitigate application attacks across traditional data centers in public and private clouds. As a result, we had a number of notable wins this quarter, including a branch of the U.S. government, a prestigious medical research group, both of whom needed to secure their organizations' remote access capabilities; in addition, a multinational defense contract that purchased our Access Policy Manager for Single Sign-On Federation; and 3 national carriers came to F5 for a variety of security solutions, chief among them was our DNS security for mobile devices.
As you may recall, we also launched our Silverline DDoS mitigation service last November. And this past quarter, we launched our Web application firewall service built on our industry-leading Application Security Manager. We've seen solid early adoption of these services. For example, a household name in retail that is an F5 customer added anti-DDoS Silverline protection in Q3 to their global Web properties. 
Over the next several quarters, we plan to deliver additional Silverline services, including an upcoming iRule catalog that can be leveraged for various application solutions, allowing 0-day vulnerability protection. In addition, we will deliver hybrid on- and off-premise solutions that allow seamless interoperability between our Silverline SaaS offerings and BIG-IP on-premise solutions.
In April, we opened a new Security Operations Center in Seattle. This gives us 7/24 support to client, helping mitigate Web fraud, malware, phishing attempts and to combat DDoS and Web application attacks through our Silverline services. On the service provider side, major carriers across the globe continue expanding their use cases with F5, driving down their costs and expanding their monetization strategies. In particular, our solutions around Gi LAN service consolidation, network function virtualization, Gi firewall and Diameter Routing are helping service providers manage mission-critical issues like traffic management, increased mobile application delivery and security.
In Q3, we signed our largest service provider security deal to date, a multi-million dollar agreement with a domestic Tier 1 carrier. Meanwhile, a major operator in Asia Pac leveraging 2 of our key ecosystem partners recently achieved ETSI certification for the F5 NFV solution, positioning our virtual editions as network functions. 
During Q3, our services business continues to produce solid result with 15% year-over-year revenue growth. New and renewed service maintenance contracts drove 20% year-over-year of deferred revenue, totaling $743 million, which ensures a positive revenue stream for quarters to come.
From a partner ecosystem perspective, we continue to see great momentum in our partnerships with the likes of Amazon, Cisco, VMware and Microsoft. I can point to competitive SDN, cloud and VDI wins of  media companies, technology companies and large U.S. retailers. We are confident that our current and future road maps position us well in helping our current customers and future prospects migrate their application services to software-defined infrastructures.
  
In the meantime, as CEO, I want to ensure that we're continually innovating, delivering best-of-breed products for customers and expanding our addressable market. Key for our success is continuing to invest in the right people. To help F5 reach the next level of growth, we've hired a new EVP of Human Resources. Kristen Dimlow has joined us from Microsoft and shall be focused on recruiting and retaining world-class talent. 
Another organizational change is the transition of the worldwide sales team to a new leader. After 11 years of service, with sales that ranked in the billions, Dave Feringa has decided to step down on October 1 to spend more time with his family on the East Coast. I want to thank Dave for all that he has built at F5, especially the strong global sales team and our lead position in the ADC market. We are actively looking for Dave's successor and plan to announce our decision shortly.
As you heard from Andy, we've had a solid year thus far and look forward to a strong finish in Q4. We will continue to focus on ensuring that our customers' applications can run where they run best. Our emphasis will be on driving top line growth, particularly for product revenue. I am excited about what the future holds. In Q4, we'll launch our next version of BIG-IP, version 12.0. This release will help our customers navigate their application-centric environments without compromising our security or operational efficiency.
With new features like modern cryptographic cyber support, HTTP 2.0, Single Sign-On enhancements, hyperscale DNS and expanded SDN and cloud orchestration and management options as well as early access features for our next generation of iApp and iRules. We expect this release to open up over $500 million in additional addressable market.
 
For insights into our longer-term plans, I want to spend a few moments on our vision and strategy. We help organizations deliver the fastest, most secure and reliable applications to anyone, anywhere on any device. We're delivering on this vision through flexible scale-up and scale-out architectures. That means we can provide our customers with consolidated set of applications and services on-premise, in the cloud and as a service. Moreover, we know that applications have become more prolific and dynamic. Operational complexity has become the primary constraint holding organizations back. F5 is eliminating this complexity while simultaneously driving down the total cost of application ownership via centralized management, orchestration and analytics-driven insights. We call this F5 Synthesis hybrid application services and is the cornerstone of our business and technology strategy. 
 
In closing, I would like to thank the entire F5 team, our partners and customers for the support last quarter, and we look forward to a great Q4. I will now open the call up for Q&A."

So as you know, and we've talked about this in the past, our business is predominately software. What goes in to platform tends to be predominately software, and we've been seeing that growth increases as I pointed out in the comments over the course of the last 3 years. We continue to expect that to increase. But I want to be very clear. It's not as if the market is rapidly transitioning from software to hardware. What we're seeing is a new set of applications that require much more of a scale-out solution and/or applications that are going directly into cloud environment. We actually think that the future architectures have 2 tiers associated with it. And what I mean by that is an ingress tier inside -- into the data center that requires high-performance hardware to mitigate traffic whether it'd be firewall services, DDoS attacks, and all of those capabilities we provide using our hardware. On top of that, what we see is a second tier, which sometimes tend to be much more per-application tier, which could go to these. So we think the future will have a mix of both hardware and software. And in the other part on -- are we going to see cannibalization of the hardware business? The way we price our VE relative to our hardware is on par from a unit pricing perspective. And I'll just give you an absolute data point so you could have that. If you look at a 5 GB virtual edition of our product, it's about $26,000. Our BIG-IP 2200, it's about $28,000. So it's almost on par, and those are both 5 GB devices inside the environment. So what we're really seeing is customers making a decision much more on whether they want accelerated performance and/or they want flexibility to software for scale-out architecture. So we don't anticipate that to be a rapid cannibalization moving by any stretch of imagination."

We did see our largest security Gi firewall win with the domestic Tier 1 operator. It's been repeat business, and we continue to see that ramping up. We continue to see that same traction in other theaters. But I think what's also very interesting is that service providers are moving very rapidly to software-based architectures, using things like NFV, network function virtualization. And our products, because we provide the same feature functionality whether it'd be on accelerated hardware and as virtual editions are very well suited, we're seeing a huge uptake in proof of concepts around NFV. We're seeing that movement really, really rise. So that's future opportunity for us. Early days, like we've spoken about, but very exciting for us."

We're seeing additional opportunities that tend to be not the large marquee accounts, much more the mid-market that we're going after at this point in time. And then what we're seeing is repeat business, either because these were large installed bases that are being consumed over time and customers are turning dozens or hundreds of devices at a time, so they repeat that purchase cycle. But what we also see when they repeat that purchase cycle, we see them consuming our 'Good, Better, Best' licensing modules or our software modules, meaning that we're having a deeper penetration.

But what we are seeing is obviously, because it's smaller numbers, the software business is outpacing the hardware business from a growth perspective. We don't think that there will be a little bit of a mix shift for an enterprise from the perspective that maybe 3 years ago, they were buying all hardware. But the enterprise as we talked about -- the service provider as we talked are not going 100% software. They're really going, as I depicted earlier, to these 2-tier architectures with a set of hardware services that are going -- that they need to scale up really, meaning throughput, connection per second, things of that nature; and the second tier of scale-out services that are much more at the application environment. So we actually think it's incremental. Where we think also it's incremental is in cloud solutions. Cloud solutions, when customers move application more closely to the cloud, predominantly that's the software play. There's a couple of cloud providers that have hardware options, but in general, it's a software play. So we think that's going to mix. Do you want to add to that, Karl?"

So what they want to do is employ whatever software, whatever hardware they can that reduces their operational costs. Their problem is their budgets are scaling linearly but their traffic is growing exponentially, and so they need a way to manage that. And the way they're doing that is through automation, and they want to be able to automate not only aspects of the applications but their entire environment. We play a key role in being able to bridge the applications to the environment and support that overall automation requirement. And so that's what they're looking at us for the brightest part of NFV in addition to being able to support whatever footprint they need, software versus hardware."

So you'll see the telcos, and I'll add and close on this, is the NFV movement is really a management of the total cost of ownership for service providers. And that's been predominately because the cost -- how they were monetizing their networks historically has been a throughput or bandwidth type of connection. The Internet traffic and the consumer is consuming those services faster than they can provide it. So as a result of that, they have to go attack the network costs. Scaling the network costs through the software, sometimes it's easier for them to do and a lot more predictable. So we're seeing that rapid movement by most of the telcos out there. But don't confuse the fact that they're also going to have hardware. They have 100 GB interfaces and above, and those interfaces have to be positioned through hardware sets of technology. So it's a mix that you're going to see into shift of pure hardware to hardware/software."

In the third quarter of fiscal 2015, F5 delivered solid results that reflect growing demand for our expanding array of products and services. As more large organizations deploy hybrid architectures, we continue to see momentum in sales of our software offerings, both as modules on our purpose-built hardware and as stand-alone virtual editions.
During Q3, we also saw the beginning of what we believe will be a steady ramp in sales of our subscription-based Silverline services. These trends, combined with the ongoing success of our ""Good, Better, Best"" sales motion, demand for our security products and continued traction with our key partners, all contributed to the quarter's positive results.
Revenue of $483.6 million grew 2% from the prior quarter and 10% year-over-year, and was at the high end of our $475 million to $485 million guided range. GAAP EPS of $1.29 per share was above our guidance of $1.16 to $1.19 per share. Non-GAAP EPS of $1.67 per share also exceeded our guided range of $1.57 to $1.60 per share. The strength in EPS was driven by our solid revenue and operating margin results and lower-than-expected tax rate during the quarter. Product revenue of $248.8 million, up 2% sequentially and 5% year-over-year, represented 51% of total revenue. Service revenue of $234.8 million increased 3% sequentially, 15% year-over-year and accounted for 49% of total revenue.
The Americas accounted for 58% of revenue during the quarter. EMEA contributed 24%; APAC, 13%; and Japan, 4%. On a year-over-year basis, Americas revenue grew 13%. EMEA revenue grew 14%. Conversely, APAC revenue declined 6%, and Japan revenue was down 2%.
Enterprise customers represented 66% of total sales during the quarter. Service providers accounted for 20%, and government sales were 14%, including 6% of total sales from U.S. Federal. 
In Q3, we have 3 greater-than-10% distributors: Westcon, which accounted for 19.2%; Ingram Micro, which represented 16.7%; and Avnet, representing 13.5%.
Our GAAP gross margin in Q3 was 82.3%. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 83.6%. GAAP operating expenses were $257.8 million, at the low end of our guided range of $257 million to $266 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $224.3 million.
GAAP operating margin was 29%. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 37.2%. Our GAAP effective tax rate for Q3 was 33.9%. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 33.5%.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash flow from operations was $172.5 million. In Q3, we repurchased just over 1.2 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $124.92 for a total of $150 million, ending the quarter with approximately $1.16 billion in cash and investments. Approximately $624 million remains authorized under the share repurchase program.
DSO at the end of Q3 was 49 days. Inventories were $30 million. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $21.2 million. Deferred revenue increased 20% year-over-year to $742.5 million. We ended the quarter with 4,110 employees, an increase of 75 from the prior quarter.
Now for the outlook. Building on another quarter of solid momentum with our key drivers, we believe we will continue to see strong year-over-year revenue and earnings growth. Our revenue target for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 is $500 million to $510 million.
GAAP gross margin is anticipated to be in the 82% to 82.5% range. This includes approximately $4 million of stock-based compensation expense and $2.7 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets. Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be in the 83.5% to 84% range. We anticipate GAAP operating expenses in the range of $267 million to $276 million. This includes approximately $38.5 million in stock-based compensation expense and $0.7 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets. The stock-based compensation guidance reflects a onetime approximately $5 million increase as a result of the CEO transition, as outlined in our 8-K filed April 22.
For Q4, we are forecasting a GAAP effective tax rate of 37% and a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 35%. Reflecting the increased stock-based compensation expense, our GAAP EPS target is $1.26 to $1.29 per share. Our non-GAAP EPS target is $1.72 to $1.75 per share. We plan to increase our headcount by at least 125 employees in the current quarter, and we believe our cash flow from operations will be at or around $185 million.
And with that, I will turn the call over to Manny Rivelo."

I would like to thank everybody for joining F5's 2015 Q3 earnings conference call. Overall, I am pleased with our performance in Q3 as reflected by a record revenue and profitability.

Overall, I am pleased with our performance in Q3 as reflected by a record revenue and profitability. Among the notable signs of our progress this past quarter, we significantly grew our software revenue with the uptake of our ""Good, Better, Best"" packaging, driving million-dollar plus deals. Moreover, our stand-alone software module attach rates were solid, especially the security modules. We saw major deals from service providers in the areas of Gi LAN service consolidation, security, network function virtualization. And we're excited about the progress we saw on our Silverline anti-DDoS subscription service, plus the recently launched Silverline Web application firewall that has opened up new use cases for our customers.
From a regional perspective, we had a strong quarter in the Americas, with bookings ahead of our internal expectations. In EMEA, we saw bookings growth rebound off a slower Q2 performance, with particular strength in Northern Europe. Bookings in our Asia Pac and Japan regions were slightly down year-over-year, in line with our expectations heading into the quarter. 
Now let me drill down into the specifics of our major business drivers, which include core, security, service provider, professional services and our partner ecosystem.
In our core business, we continue to help our customers leverage our Synthesis architecture to deliver their applications in the most efficient, secure and cost-effective manner. This includes optimizing their own data centers as well as leveraging both private and public clouds. Key to this is offering all of our products as software that can run on the major industry hypervisors on top of our high-performance hardware. Software is at the core of everything we do. Over the past 3 years, quarterly revenue from the sales of software modules and virtual editions has more than doubled, accounting for more than 1/3 of our product revenue in Q3. The growth of our software-only business is reflected in a recent industry analyst report, which reported that we grew 2.5x faster than the general virtual ADC market, making us the market leader.
As more of our customers deploy hybrid solutions and adopt our ""Good, Better, Best"" offerings, we believe this trend will continue. An example of a key customer win validating our hybrid application services strategy is a large hardware and software deal with an academic medical center that has standardized on F5. Leveraging our Access Policy Manager, specifically the portal access, we are helping them drive down their total cost of ownership while creating the flexibility to move their applications between different cloud providers.
In addition, we continue to see success with our platform refresh in the Cisco ACE replacement programs, with many of our customers expanding their solutions to include our enhanced software modules. 
Lastly, our user community, DevCentral, grew nicely at 38% year-over-year with over 200,000 members, further demonstrating the value of our TMOS programmable architecture.
 
Our security modules remain a major growth driver for us. Given this past quarter's highly visible cybersecurity attacks, more customers from an increasing diverse pool are approaching F5 for our ability to secure applications, manage user policy and access and mitigate application attacks across traditional data centers in public and private clouds. As a result, we had a number of notable wins this quarter, including a branch of the U.S. government, a prestigious medical research group, both of whom needed to secure their organizations' remote access capabilities; in addition, a multinational defense contract that purchased our Access Policy Manager for Single Sign-On federation; and 3 national carriers came to F5 for a variety of security solutions. Chief among them was our DNS security for mobile devices.
As you may recall, we also launched our Silverline DDoS mitigation service last November. And this past quarter, we launched our Web application firewall service built on our industry-leading Application Security Manager. We've seen solid early adoption of these services. For example, a household name in retail that is an F5 customer added anti-DDoS Silverline protection in Q3 to their global Web properties. 
Over the next several quarters, we plan to deliver additional Silverline services, including an upcoming iRule catalog that can be leveraged for various application solutions, allowing 0-day vulnerability protection. In addition, we will deliver hybrid on- and off-premise solutions that allow seamless interoperability between our Silverline SaaS offerings and BIG-IP on-premise solutions.
In April, we opened a new Security Operations Center in Seattle. This gives us 7/24 support to clients, helping mitigate Web fraud, malware, phishing attempts and to combat DDoS and Web application attacks through our Silverline services. On the service provider side, major carriers across the globe continue expanding their use cases with F5, driving down their costs and expanding their monetization strategies. In particular, our solutions around Gi LAN service consolidation, network function virtualization, Gi firewall and Diameter routing are helping service providers manage mission-critical issues like traffic management, increased mobile application delivery and security.
In Q3, we signed our largest service provider security deal to date, a multi-million dollar agreement with a domestic Tier 1 carrier. Meanwhile, a major operator in Asia Pac leveraging 2 of our key ecosystem partners recently achieved ETSI certification for the F5 NFV solution, positioning our virtual editions as network functions. 
During Q3, our services business continues to produce solid results with 15% year-over-year revenue growth. New and renewed service maintenance contracts drove 20% year-over-year of deferred revenue, totaling $743 million, which ensures a positive revenue stream for quarters to come.
From a partner ecosystem perspective, we continue to see great momentum in our partnerships with the likes of Amazon, Cisco, VMware and Microsoft. I can point to competitive SDN, cloud and VDI wins at media companies, technology companies and large U.S. retailers. We are confident that our current and future road maps position us well in helping our current customers and future prospects migrate their application services to software-defined infrastructures.
  
In the meantime, as CEO, I want to ensure that we're continually innovating, delivering best-of-breed products for customers and expanding our addressable market. Key for our success is continuing to invest in the right people. To help F5 reach the next level of growth, we've hired a new EVP of Human Resources. Kristen Dimlow has joined us from Microsoft and she'll be focused on recruiting and retaining world-class talent. 
Another organizational change is the transition of the worldwide sales team to a new leader. After 11 years of service, with sales that ranked in the billions, Dave Feringa has decided to step down on October 1 to spend more time with his family on the East Coast. I want to thank Dave for all that he has built at F5, especially the strong global sales team and our lead position in the ADC market. We are actively looking for Dave's successor and plan to announce our decision shortly.
As you heard from Andy, we've had a solid year thus far and look forward to a strong finish in Q4. We will continue to focus on ensuring that our customers' applications can run where they run best. Our emphasis will be on driving top line growth, particularly for product revenue. I am excited about what the future holds. In Q4, we'll launch our next version of BIG-IP, version 12.0. This release will help our customers navigate their application-centric environments, without compromising our security or operational efficiency. With new features like modern cryptographic cyber support, HTTP 2.0, Single Sign-On enhancements, hyperscale DNS and expanded SDN and cloud orchestration and management options as well as early access features for our next generation of iApp and iRules, we expect this release to open up over $500 million in additional addressable market.
 
For insights into our longer-term plans, I want to spend a few moments on our vision and strategy. We help organizations deliver the fastest, most secure and reliable applications to anyone, anywhere on any device. We're delivering on this vision through flexible scale-up and scale-out architectures. That means we can provide our customers with a consolidated set of applications and services on-premise, in the cloud and as a service. Moreover, we know that applications have become more prolific and dynamic. Operational complexity has become the primary constraint holding organizations back. F5 is eliminating this complexity while simultaneously driving down the total cost of application ownership via centralized management, orchestration and analytics-driven insights. We call this F5 Synthesis hybrid application services and is the cornerstone of our business and technology strategy. 
 
In closing, I would like to thank the entire F5 team, our partners and customers for the support last quarter, and we look forward to a great Q4. I will now open the call up for Q&A."

So as you know, and we've talked about this in the past, our business is predominately software. What goes in to our platform tends to be predominately software, and we've been seeing that growth increase,",334,"Okay. So let me just address the software growth. So as you know, and we've talked about this in the past, our business is predominately software. What goes in to our platform tends to be predominately software, and we've been seeing that growth increase, as I pointed out in the comments, over the course of the last 3 years. We continue to expect that to increase. But I want to be very clear. It's not as if the market is rapidly transitioning from software to hardware. What we're seeing is a new set of applications that require much more of a scale-out solution and/or applications that are going directly into cloud environments. We actually think that the future architectures have 2 tiers associated with it. And what I mean by that is an ingress tier inside -- into the data center that requires high-performance hardware to mitigate traffic, whether it'd be firewall services, DDoS attacks, and all of those capabilities we provide using our hardware. On top of that, what we see is a second tier, which sometimes tends to be much more per-application tier, which could go to VEs. So we think the future will have a mix of both hardware and software. And then the other part on -- are we going to see cannibalization of the hardware business? The way we price our VE relative to our hardware is on par from a unit pricing perspective. And I'll just give you an absolute data point so you could have that. If you look at a 5 GB virtual edition of our product, it's about $26,000. Our BIG-IP 2200, it's about $28,000. So it's almost on par, and those are both 5 GB devices inside the environment. So what we're really seeing is customers making a decision much more on whether they want accelerated performance and/or they want flexibility of the software for scale-out architecture. So we don't anticipate that to be a rapid cannibalization movement by any stretch of the imagination."

And our products, because we provide the same feature functionality, whether it be on accelerated hardware and our [ph] virtual editions are very well suited, we're seeing a huge uptake in proof of concepts around NFV.

And what it does for us -- I think what you've seen from our portfolio where we've expanded, our vision is really all about hybrid, which is expand beyond the traditional availability set of services, and we're moving to offer our services, not only on-prem, and also in a modernized SDN environment. There's a lot of integration associated with that. We continue to harden our product to make our product easier to work in modern SDN or data center environments but equally, how we run our services inside the cloud. So what you're seeing is the platform expanding so that application services can be in all locations and any kind of infrastructure. And that's the core to part of 12.0. And Karl, maybe you want to add a little color to that."

Obviously, that's a big area for us, and we're adding capabilities across the board in security. And SSL is a big area that we focus a lot of attention, especially in the areas of performance and adding new cyber suites and being able to address new applications. But also, we've added a lot just into the core of the product, being able to address protocols like HTTP 2.0. And that's big because customers are shifting to 2.0 because, one, it's less costly for them to support it with their applications; and two, the performance is much better. And so we're supporting that. Service provider, there's a number of areas that we're enhancing to support service provider functionality, including things with our firewall, in our -- on our PEM modules and CGNAT. Just across the board, we're doing things to help enable core service provider, including NFV-based applications, and then also supporting cloud partners in being able to make -- and we made major enhancements to support VMware, Microsoft, Cisco and others to make ourselves much more natively deployable into their environments. And then there's other things that we've done within our hardware platforms. We talked about our software-defined hardware. Well, we have 2 new major functions that we're releasing to help support significant increases in DNS performance, for example, and also significant increases in security performance, being able to offload a lot more functionality into the hardware itself. So there's a lot of major functions across the board to address some of these -- the things that Manny articulated earlier on in his -- in what he was talking."

So we don't break down the hardware/software revenue as we go forward. But what we are seeing is obviously, because it's smaller numbers, the software business is outpacing the hardware business from a growth perspective. We don't think that there -- there will be a little bit of a mix shift for an enterprise from the perspective that, maybe 3 years ago, they were buying all hardware. But the enterprises we talk to or the service providers we talk to are not going 100% software. They're really going, as I depicted earlier, to these 2-tier architectures with a set of hardware services that are going -- that they need to scale up really, meaning throughput, connection per second, things of that nature; and the second tier of scale-out services that are much more at the application environment. So we actually think it's incremental. Where we think also it's incremental is in cloud solutions. Cloud solutions, when customers move application more close to the cloud, predominantly that's a software play. There's a couple of cloud providers that have hardware options, but in general, it's a software play. So we think that's going to mix. Do you want to add to that, Karl?"

Their problem is their budgets are scaling linearly but their traffic is growing exponentially, and so they need a way to manage that. And the way they're doing that is through automation, and they want to be able to automate not only aspects of the applications but their entire environment. We play a key role in being able to bridge the applications to the environment and support that overall automation requirement. And so that's what they're looking at us for -- to provide as part of NFV, in addition to being able to support whatever footprint they need, software versus hardware."

So you'll see the telcos, and I'll add and close on this, is the NFV movement is really a management of the total cost of ownership for service providers. And that's been predominately because the cost -- how they were monetizing their networks historically has been a throughput or bandwidth type of connection. The Internet traffic and the consumer is consuming those services faster than they can provide it. So as a result of that, they have to go attack the network costs. Scaling the network costs through the software, sometimes it's easier for them to do and a lot more predictable. So we're seeing that rapid movement by most of the telcos out there. But don't confuse the fact that they're also going to have hardware. They have 100 GB interfaces and above, and those interfaces have to be positioned through hardware sets of technology. So it's a mix that you're going to see into shift of pure hardware to hardware/software."

As I normally do on our Q4 call, I will first discuss our results for the fourth quarter and the fiscal year ended September 30; then I will provide guidance for the current quarter; and finally, outline our general planning assumptions and expectations for fiscal year 2016.
We ended fiscal 2015 with an annual revenue run rate of $2 billion and record earnings per share. Revenue of $501.3 million was up 8% compared to Q4 '14 and within our guided range of $500 million to $510 million. GAAP EPS was $1.36 per share, above our guidance of $1.26 to $1.29 per share. Non-GAAP EPS of $1.84 also exceeded our guidance of $1.72 to $1.75 per share.
Q4 product revenue of $257.7 million, up 4% from Q3 and 1% from the fourth quarter of last year, represented 51% of revenue. Service revenue of $243.6 million increased 4% sequentially, 16% year-over-year and accounted for 49% of revenue.
On a regional basis, the Americas grew 7% year-over-year and represented 58% of revenue, with the strongest growth in the U.S. while a difficult macro environment slowed sales in Latin America and Canada. EMEA grew 11% year-over-year and accounted for 23% of overall revenue. APAC, which accounted for 15% of revenue, increased 12% year-over-year. And Japan, at 4% of revenue, was down 6% from a year ago. Enterprise customers represented 65% of total Q4 sales. Service providers accounted for 17%, and government sales were 17%, including 9% from U.S. Federal.
During the quarter, we have 3 greater-than-10% distributors. Westcon, which accounted for 17.2% of total revenue; Ingram Micro, which accounted for 15.6%; and Avnet at 14.3%. 
Continuing down the income statement. GAAP gross margin in Q4 was 83.1%. Non-GAAP gross margin was 84.4%. GAAP operating expenses of $269 million were at the low end of our $267 million to $276 million guided range. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $230.4 million.
Our GAAP operating margin in Q4 was 29.4%, and non-GAAP operating margin was 38.4%. Our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 35.1%, and our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 32.8%.
Turning to the balance sheet. In Q4, we generated $183 million in cash flow from operations, which contributed to cash and investments totaling $1.17 billion at year-end. DSO was 50 days. Inventory at the end of the quarter was $33.7 million. Deferred revenue increased 23% year-over-year to $783.3 million.
In Q4, we repurchased approximately 1.18 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $126.99 per share for a total of $150 million. Approximately $474 million remains authorized under the current share repurchase program.
During the quarter, we closed our test facility in Toms, Russia [ph], eliminating approximately 65 positions. These will be reinvested in other locations over the first half of fiscal 2016. Across the rest of the company, we added a very strong 135 net employees.
For the full year, revenue for fiscal 2015 was $1.92 billion, up 11% from fiscal 2014. Product revenue of $991.5 million was up 6% from the prior year and accounted for 52% of total revenue. Service revenue of $928.3 million grew 17% during the year and represented 48% of the total. GAAP net income for fiscal 2015 was $365 million or $5.03 per share, and non-GAAP net income was $480.3 million or $6.62 per share. And for all of fiscal 2015, cash flow from operations totaled $685 million.
Moving onto our guidance for Q1 and our fiscal year '16 outlook. As we entered fiscal 2016, the growth of IP traffic and connected devices, the proliferation of applications and virtualized data centers in the cloud and the increase in the number and types and security threats all challenged the fast, secure and reliable delivery of applications to increasingly mobile users. Over the past several years, the pace of innovation if FY '15 has accelerated to deliver products and services at enabled customers to meet these challenges by leveraging the cloud, SDN, NFV and other emerging technologies for the reshaping of the industry. As a result of these efforts, our absolute focus on the application, continuing technology leadership over full proxy architecture and our disciplined business model, I am confident that we will see a return to year-over-year product revenue growth and continued solid EPS growth in the coming year.
During the past 2 quarters, FY '15 has had several key management transitions, consisting of both new leadership and realignment of certain internal responsibilities. These moves have already resulted in positive changes to our organizational structure, product road map and sales motions, so they're designed to reaccelerate and drive product revenue growth in the current fiscal year and beyond.
As we enter our fiscal 2016, we are anticipating seasonal softness we typically experience in Q1. We also continue to be cautious due to budget uncertainty driven by foreign currency fluctuations and lingering macro issues. With this in mind, for the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we are targeting revenue in the range of $480 million to $490 million. We expect GAAP gross margins at or around 82.5%, including approximately $4 million of stock-based compensation expense and $2.7 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets. Non-GAAP gross margins are anticipated at or around 84%.
We estimate GAAP operating expense of $268 million to $277 million, including approximately $35 million of stock-based compensation expense and $0.7 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets. We anticipate a GAAP effective tax rate of 37.5% for the quarter and a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 34.5%.
Our Q1 GAAP earnings target is $1.13 to $1.16 per share. Our non-GAAP earnings target is $1.58 to $1.61 per share. We believe we will generate cash flow from operations in excess of $195 million, and we plan to increase our headcount by up to 100 employees during the quarter.
Looking out to the fiscal year ahead. Our general planning assumptions and expectations for the year are as follows: From the base of Q1, we anticipate sequential revenue growth throughout the year, with a strong second half of the fiscal year. We anticipate that non-GAAP gross margins will remain in the 83.5% to 84.5% range. We expect non-GAAP operating margins in the mid-30s range for the first half of the year and increasing through the second half. Stock-based compensation is anticipated to be in the range of $160 million to $170 million for the year. Capital expenditures are expected to range from $15 million to $20 million per quarter for ongoing infrastructure and best man's and facilities expansions. And finally, assuming the R&D tax credit is not extended during fiscal 2016, we expect our effective tax rate to average approximately 37% to 38% on a GAAP basis and 34% to 35% on a non-GAAP basis for the year.
As John mentioned, our Analyst Investor meeting will be November 12 in New York. We hope you can join us as our executive team presents the company strategy and go-to-market plans for F5.
With that, I will turn the call over to Manny Rivelo."

Overall, I'm pleased with the performance this fiscal year. We closed FY '15 with a number of key milestones. Revenues of $1.9 billion with solid financial performance and record non-GAAP earnings per share of $6.62 [ph].
We continue to outpace our competition with our hybrid application services strategy. Year-to-date, we've increased our virtual ADC market share by 13 points and the overall ADC market share by 3 points for a total share of 49% as of the latest industry reports. And for the ninth year in a row, we remained the leader in the 2015 Gartner Magic Quadrant for ADC. We continue to diversify with more than 1/3 of our revenue coming from software sales, driven largely by the demand for security and the uptake of our ""Good, Better, Best"" licensing and continued strength with our virtualization sales. Approximately 41% of total product sales in FY '15 include a one or more security products. This represents a 22% year-over-year growth, driven in large part by our wins in government bimetal service and service providers.
Demonstrating the power of our programmable platform, we exceeded 223,000 members in our Center user community, representing a 22% year-over-year growth. And lastly, we are approaching 4,200 global employees. 
It took us 15 years to reach $1 billion in sales. A mere 4 years later, in Q4, we exited the year at $501 million in sales, putting us at a $2 billion run rate. As you heard from Andy, we had a solid fourth quarter, meeting our revenue guidance and shipping record profitability. From a regional perspective, U.S. enterprises of the quarter, however, all Americas bookings were behind our internal expectations. We attribute this the market fluctuations in Latin America and Canada and some delays in project-driven service provider transactions.
In EMEA, we saw bookings in line with our internal expectations. Bookings at our Asia-Pac region exceeded our targets and showed strong year-over-year growth, while Japan sales was down year-over-year but in line with our internal projections.
In the core of our ADC market, we enjoyed a good quarter. In August, we released the traffic management operating system team miles version 12.0. This is a meaningful major release that allows customers to more easily transition workloads to the cloud and incorporate technologies by HTTP 2.0, while maintaining the same visibility, security and control of traditional infrastructures. 
Our programmable extensible architecture and growing ecosystem of technology partners make our application services an ideal fit for emerging trends such as software-defined networking, network function virtualization and the cloud. We see many emerging opportunities from new projects enabled by our hybrid application services. Our recent F5 global survey of over 3,000 customers showed that 81% plan to run the applications in a hybrid, a private-public cloud environment. We see this trend reflected In our virtualization sales, which were up 57% for the full fiscal year.
In Q4, we launched the F5 ready program to verify F5 virtualization compatibility with a growing of public cloud service providers. This includes Amazon Web services, Blue Lock, British Telecom, Cisco Intercloud, Datacom, Emotion Data, Microsoft Azure, Rackspace, Single Hop, Sky Tap and VMware and VCloud Air. The F5 ready program makes it possible for our customers to run their applications and application services in the cloud environment of their choice. 
We still continue to see opportunities in Cisco replacement. We also see opportunities in selling additional F5 modules to new age-replacement customers. For example, in Q4, we won a competitive million dollar age-replacement order at a Fortune 100 company, chiefly due to our strength in SDN. 
Hybrid deployments are driving security requirements for our customers' cloud adoption. Nearly half, 48% of the customers we surveyed cited consistent policy and audability of all -- with on-premise as an important security flat for the cloud adoption. We see this trend reflected in our wins. 
In Q4, a global consulting firm replaced Juniper with F5 remote access in Single Sign-On solutions across their cloud and on-premise applications.
Because of our strategic point of control to many customers' networks, more and more of our accounts are implementing F5 hybrid security services to combat the increasing volume and sophistication of high-profile cybersecurity breaches. In April, we launched a new Silverline Web application firewall, a of the service. And although it's early days, we are seeing solid interests from our customers and sales organization for our cloud-based offerings, tripling our server on customer base this past year.
This past quarter, based on our growing Silverline and very safe customer demand, we opened a second security operations center in Poland. The team of IT specialists F5 security researchers and analysts in Warsaw will complement our existing facility here in Seattle. Monitoring and investigating global multiplayer attacks, the center will maintain up-to-date information on the latest malware, 0-day and phishing attacks.
In the service provider industry, a recent survey shows that on a daily basis, an average Tier 1 operator experiences roughly 10 to 15 gig [ph] of attacks and 2,000 application attacks, which can result in leaked customer data, intercepted or blocked calls, roaming fraud as well as deterioration of network and service performance. These trends have increased -- these trends have increasingly driven growth of our security offerings within our service provider business.
In particular, we are enjoying rapid expansion in our U.S. carrier segment, where our Gi LAN and anti-DDoS service capabilities as well as our firewall and application protection capabilities are helping us to secure competitive multimillion repeat wins. 
As the demand for high-bandwidth, low-latency network only increases, our NFV, PCP optimization and advanced traffic experience solutions are helping our service providers customer significantly increase their efficiency, ensure their peak network performance. We signed several multimillion dollar agreement in the past order that further evidence our carrier freight capabilities.
In addition, we have increased our NFV partner ecosystem. In Q4, we announced a partnership with HP, and Telstra to demonstrate a proof of concept for a multi-vendor open FME solution. Certified by the European Telecommunications Standard Institute, SC, this proof of concept demonstrates the service providers how NFV can reduce TCO while increasing service agility and network elasticity.
Our service business continues to produce, with 17% year-over-year revenue growth for the full fiscal year. New and renewed service maintenance contracts grow deferred revenue growth to 783 [ph] million this quarter, up 23% year-over-year, providing a solid foundation for continued service to grow. 
Our services strength also underscores how world-class, high-valued customer support drives product revenue growth. For example, in Q4, a U.S. Bank leveraged our professional services for a technology refresh project. We're seeing to expand their use of our application models to include an application security model and a DNS solution in a multimillion dollar deal. 
Our base of SDN, cloud, application provider, service provider and converge system technology partner is as strong as ever. I want to expand on one particular security partnership that we formed in Q4. We added Fire I, an industry leader in network security to help our customers defend against today's advanced cyber attacks. F5 and Fire I will offer customer segmentation and policy management, protocol performance, DDoS mitigation, SSL inspection and then [indiscernible], intrusion prevention, threat intelligence, forensics and analytics. Although we're just launching their partnerships, our joint security offerings have already resulted in a multi-million sale to a U.S. health product company. 
Let me spend a moment now on our leadership team. I'm pleased to report that the sales team transition under John Google has been smooth. John Google's sales and challenged spend and deep industry relationships combined with new FY '16 initiatives will enable F5 sales evolution and drive accelerated product revenue growth.
Secondly, I have asked Julian Ames to expand his responsibilities and centralize our support functions in global services, manufacturing, IT, program management and facilities under his leadership as our new Chief Operations Officer.
To reiterate my earlier comments, I believe our growth drivers for fiscal 2016 will be driven by our BIG-IP releases, security-specific offers, sales and channel productivity gains, cloud and [indiscernible] sales acceleration and a favorable product refresh cycle anticipated in the back end of this fiscal year.
As far as the Q1 outlook is concerned, Andy indicated that we expect revenues in the $480 million to $490 million range. We are taking measured view of our Q1 business in light of several macro economic uncertainties and the historical impact of seasonality on our Q1 order [indiscernible].
As Andy also mentioned, we expect to deliver sequential quarter-over-quarter growth through the rest of fiscal 2016, and we will continue to invest in activities that further extend our leadership position or help us to capture in capital opportunities as they arise.
As the market evolves, so too does our sides. By having an application as our focus, we have been able to grow and flex the new customer demands.
Kicking off our new fiscal year this month, we have a clear central purpose, expanding our core offerings in AC to the cloud; extending in strategic markets of security, F5 as a service via Silverline and the service provider and; driving a world-class customer experience from our global services organization. As I stated at the beginning of my commentary, I'm excited about the opportunities presented by our hybrid application services strategy. Our customers are moving beyond hybrid architectures, and our focus on software application service is clearly positioning us to capture new workloads and new markets.
The leadership team and I are looking forward to sharing these plans with you at our Annual Investor Meeting on November 12 in New York City.
In closing, I would like to thank the entire F5 team, our partners and customers for their support last quarter. We look forward to a great Q1. I will now open the call up for Q&A."

And when they go to off-prem, it will also be multi-cloud, not single cloud provider. So what we see that is a massive opportunity for us to be able to create a solution set across the environment that we allow application-to-application service portability out there. So that's a big -- a major driver for us. Honestly, above and beyond that, we're also making sure that our solution is in all the major cloud instances, so we're easy to find from a customer perspective.

And there's a number of areas that we address holistically with this. One of the big key ones, like Manny mentioned, is the ability to have this portability between clouds and the data center and consistent policies. And with consistent policies, what they mean by that is both security as well as access policies. And so as part of our latest release and kind of part of our product is doubly to to provide this accelerated access so that we can front that both public, private as well as kind of traditional data centers, including SaaS-based applications as well. The other components are things like the customers want to be able to have capacity augmentation with the cloud. To be able to do that, of course, you need to have kind of these consistent policies, and we provide that. Security services is a key area. You need to have auditability and the ability to have that consistency between what you're doing on-prem and off-prem to provide consistent services and all that. So there's a number of things that we do there. If you look at our it is release, in fact, we added a lot of other key features that made us operate much better in some of the biggest public clouds like Azure and AWS. And so we've been there for quite a while. So there's definitely an opportunity there, and we're innovating quickly working towards that because that's where our customers are taking us."

So what is causing this massive deceleration in the growth rate in a environment that should have been good for you given the competitive landscape and your product portfolio and et cetera?

The second thing we have seen is some of the lumpiness in service provider business, which [indiscernible] certain quarter had been very, very solid, but this last quarter was down relative to other quarters. So it hasn't been 1 specific thing. It's actually been a series of things throughout the year that's continued to create that deceleration. But there's no question that is there is also some pause I think in the market as these network transitions begin to occur, whether it be SDN and how SDN plays out in the enterprise, how cloud also plays out in the enterprise from a hybrid perspective and then the service provider arena, how things like NFV play out and whether how quickly they move in those arenas. And so I think some of these is just caution on the customers as they redesign the new architectures, but what we're not seeing is any significant losses. We've look at our win-loss that on an ongoing basis. So we think as we continue to further our technology solutions there, as the market continues to harden and out of those new architectures that we should see favorable second half of FY '16."

As I normally do on our Q4 call, I will first discuss our results for the fourth quarter and the fiscal year ended September 30; then I will provide guidance for the current quarter; and finally, outline our general planning assumptions and expectations for fiscal year 2016.
We ended fiscal 2015 with an annual revenue run rate of $2 billion and record earnings per share. Revenue of $501.3 million was up 8% compared to Q4 '14 and within our guided range of $500 million to $510 million. GAAP EPS was $1.36 per share, above our guidance of $1.26 to $1.29 per share. Non-GAAP EPS of $1.84 also exceeded our guidance of $1.72 to $1.75 per share.
Q4 product revenue of $257.7 million, up 4% from Q3 and 1% from the fourth quarter of last year represented 51% of revenue. Service revenue of $243.6 million increased 4% sequentially, 16% year-over-year and accounted for 49% of revenue.
On a regional basis, the Americas grew 7% year-over-year and represented 58% of revenue, with the strongest growth in the U.S., while a difficult macro environment slowed sales in Latin America and Canada. EMEA grew 11% year-over-year and accounted for 23% of overall revenue. APAC, which accounted for 15% of revenue, increased 12% year-over-year. And Japan, at 4% of revenue, was down 6% from a year ago. Enterprise customers represented 65% of total Q4 sales. Service providers accounted for 17%, and government sales were 17%, including 9% from U.S. Federal.
During the quarter, we have 3 greater-than-10% distributors. Westcon, which accounted for 17.2% of total revenue; Ingram Micro, which accounted for 15.6%; and Avnet at 14.3%. 
Continuing down the income statement. GAAP gross margin in Q4 was 83.1%. Non-GAAP gross margin was 84.4%. GAAP operating expenses of $269 million were at the low end of our $267 million to $276 million guided range. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $230.4 million.
Our GAAP operating margin in Q4 was 29.4%, and non-GAAP operating margin was 38.4%. Our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 35.1%, and our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 32.8%.
Turning to the balance sheet. In Q4, we generated $183 million in cash flow from operations, which contributed to cash and investments totaling $1.17 billion at year-end. DSO was 50 days. Inventory at the end of the quarter was $33.7 million. Deferred revenue increased 23% year-over-year to $783.3 million.
In Q4, we repurchased approximately 1.18 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $126.99 per share for a total of $150 million. Approximately $474 million remains authorized under the current share repurchase program.
During the quarter, we closed our test facility in Tomsk, Russia, eliminating approximately 65 positions. These will be reinvested in other locations over the first half of fiscal 2016. Across the rest of the company, we added a very strong 135 net employees.
For the full year, revenue for fiscal 2015 was $1.92 billion, up 11% from fiscal 2014. Product revenue of $991.5 million was up 6% from the prior year and accounted for 52% of total revenue. Service revenue of $928.3 million grew 17% during the year and represented 48% of the total. GAAP net income for fiscal 2015 was $365 million or $5.03 per share, and non-GAAP net income was $480.3 million or $6.62 per share. And for all of fiscal 2015, cash flow from operations totaled $685 million.
Moving onto our guidance for Q1 and our fiscal year '16 outlook. As we entered fiscal 2016, the growth of IP traffic and connected devices, the proliferation of applications and virtualized data centers in the cloud and the increase in the number and types and security threats all challenged the fast, secure and reliable delivery of applications to increasingly mobile users. Over the past several years, the pace of innovation at F5 has accelerated to deliver products and services that enable customers to meet these challenges by leveraging the cloud, SDN, NFV and other emerging technologies that are reshaping the industry. As a result of these efforts, our absolute focus on the application, continuing technology leadership of our full proxy architecture and our disciplined business model, I am confident that we will see a return to year-over-year product revenue growth and continued solid EPS growth in the coming year.
During the past 2 quarters, F5 has had several key management transitions, consisting of both new leadership and realignment of certain internal responsibilities. These moves have already resulted in positive changes to our organizational structure, product road map and sales motions that are designed to reaccelerate and drive product revenue growth in the current fiscal year and beyond.
As we enter our fiscal 2016, we are anticipating seasonal softness we typically experience in Q1. We also continue to be cautious due to budget uncertainty driven by foreign currency fluctuations and lingering macro issues. With this in mind, for the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we are targeting revenue in the range of $480 million to $490 million. We expect GAAP gross margins at or around 82.5%, including approximately $4 million of stock-based compensation expense and $2.7 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets. Non-GAAP gross margins are anticipated at or around 84%.
We estimate GAAP operating expense of $268 million to $277 million, including approximately $35 million of stock-based compensation expense and $0.7 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets. We anticipate a GAAP effective tax rate of 37.5% for the quarter and a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 34.5%.
Our Q1 GAAP earnings target is $1.13 to $1.16 per share. Our non-GAAP earnings target is $1.58 to $1.61 per share. We believe we will generate cash flow from operations in excess of $195 million, and we plan to increase our headcount by up to 100 employees during the quarter.
Looking out to the fiscal year ahead, our general planning assumptions and expectations for the year are as follows: From the base of Q1, we anticipate sequential revenue growth throughout the year, with a strong second half of the fiscal year. We anticipate that non-GAAP gross margins will remain in the 83.5% to 84.5% range. We expect non-GAAP operating margins in the mid-30s range for the first half of the year and increasing through the second half. Stock-based compensation is anticipated to be in the range of $160 million to $170 million for the year. Capital expenditures are expected to range from $15 million to $20 million per quarter for ongoing infrastructure investments and facilities expansions. And finally, assuming the R&D tax credit is not extended during fiscal 2016, we expect our effective tax rate to average approximately 37% to 38% on a GAAP basis and 34% to 35% on a non-GAAP basis for the year.
As John mentioned, our Analyst Investor meeting will be November 12 in New York. We hope you can join us as our executive team presents the company strategy and go-to-market plans for F5.
With that, I will turn the call over to Manny Rivelo."

I would like to thank everybody for joining F5's 2015 Q4 Earnings Conference Call.
Overall, I'm pleased with the performance this fiscal year. We closed FY '15 with a number of key milestones: Revenues of $1.9 billion with solid financial performance and record non-GAAP earnings per share of $6.62.
We continue to outpace our competition with our hybrid application services strategy. Year-to-date, we've increased our virtual ADC market share by 13 points and the overall ADC market share by 3 points for a total share of 49% as of the latest industry reports. And for the ninth year in a row, we remained the leader in the 2015 Gartner Magic Quadrant for ADC. We continue to diversify with more than 1/3 of our revenue coming from software sales, driven largely by the demand for security and the uptake of our ""Good, Better, Best"" licensing and continued strength with our virtualization sales. Approximately 41% of total product sales in FY '15 included one or more security products. This represents a 22% year-over-year growth, driven in large part by our wins in government, financial service and service providers.
Demonstrating the power of our programmable platform, we exceeded 223,000 members in our DevCentral user community, representing a 22% year-over-year growth. And lastly, we are approaching 4,200 global employees. 
It took us 15 years to reach $1 billion in sales. A mere 4 years later, in Q4, we exited the year at $501 million in sales, putting us at a $2 billion run rate. As you heard from Andy, we had a solid fourth quarter, meeting our revenue guidance and achieving record profitability. From a regional perspective, U.S. enterprise had a good quarter. However, overall Americas bookings were behind our internal expectations. We attribute this to the market volatility and the currency fluctuations in Latin America and Canada and some delays in project-driven service provider transactions.
In EMEA, we saw bookings in line with our internal expectations. Bookings at our Asia-Pac region exceeded our targets and showed strong year-over-year growth, while Japan sales was down year-over-year but in line with our internal projections.
In the core of our ADC market, we enjoyed a good quarter. In August, we released the traffic management operating system, TMOS version 12.0. This is a meaningful major release that allows customers to more easily transition workloads to the cloud and incorporate technologies like HTTP 2.0, while maintaining the same visibility, security and control of traditional infrastructures. 
Our programmable extensible architecture and growing ecosystem of technology partners make our application services an ideal fit for emerging IT trends such as software-defined networking, network function virtualization and the cloud. We see many emerging opportunities from new projects enabled by our hybrid application services. Our recent F5 global survey of over 3,000 customers showed that 81% plan to run the applications in a hybrid, a private-public cloud environment. We see this trend reflected in our virtualization sales, which were up 57% for the full fiscal year.
In Q4, we launched the F5 Ready program to verify F5 virtualization compatibility with a growing of public cloud service providers. This includes Amazon Web Services, Blue Lock, British Telecom, Cisco Intercloud, Datacom, Dimension Data, Microsoft Azure, Rackspace, Single Hop, Sky Tap and VMware and VCloud Air. The F5 Ready program makes it possible for our customers to run their applications and application services in the cloud environment of their choice. 
We still continue to see opportunities in Cisco ACE replacement. We also see opportunities in selling additional F5 modules to new ACE replacement customers. For example, in Q4, we won a competitive million dollar ACE replacement order at a Fortune 100 company, chiefly due to our strength in SDN. 
Hybrid deployments are driving security requirements for our customers' cloud adoption. Nearly half, 48% of the customers we surveyed cited consistent policy and audibility of on -- with on-premise as an important security factor for their cloud adoption. We see this trend reflected in our wins. 
In Q4, a global consulting firm replaced Juniper with F5's remote access in single sign-on solutions across their cloud and on-premise applications.
Because of our strategic point of control at many customers' networks, more and more of our accounts are implementing F5 hybrid security services to combat the increasing volume and sophistication of high-profile cybersecurity breaches. In April, we launched a new Silverline Web application firewall, a WAF as a service, and although it's early days, we are seeing solid interest from our customers and sale organization for our cloud-based offerings, tripling our Silverline customer base this past year.
This past quarter, based on our growing Silverline and Versafe customer demand, we opened a second security operations center in Poland. The team of highly specialized F5 security researchers and analysts in Warsaw will complement our existing facility here in Seattle. Monitoring and investigating global multilayer attacks, the center will maintain up-to-date information on the latest malware, 0-day and phishing attacks.
In the service provider industry, a recent survey shows that on a daily basis, an average Tier 1 operator experiences roughly 10 to 15 DDoS attacks and 2,000 application attacks which can result in leaked customer data, intercepted or blocked calls, roaming fraud as well as deterioration of network and service performance. These trends have increasingly driven growth of our security offerings within our service provider business.
In particular, we are enjoying rapid expansion in our U.S. carrier segment where our Gi LAN and anti-DDoS service capabilities as well as our firewall and application protection capabilities are helping us to secure competitive multimillion dollar repeat wins. 
As the demand for high bandwidth, low latency networks only increases, our NFE, TCP optimization and advanced traffic steering solutions are helping our service provider customers significantly increase their efficiency and ensure their peak network performance. We signed several multimillion dollar agreements in the past quarter that further evidenced our carrier freight capabilities.
In addition, we have increased our NFE partner ecosystem. In Q4, we announced a partnership with HP, Nuage and Telstra to demonstrate a proof of concept for a multi-vendor open NFE solution. Certified by the European Telecommunications Standard Institute, ETSI, this proof of concept demonstrates to service providers how NFE can reduce TCO while increasing service agility and network elasticity.
Our service business continues to produce with 17% year-over-year revenue growth for the full fiscal year. New and renewed service maintenance contracts grow with deferred revenue growth to 783 million this quarter, up 23% year-over-year, providing a solid foundation for continued services to grow. 
Our services strength also underscores how our world-class, high-valued customer support drives product revenue growth. For example, in Q4, a U.S. bank leveraged our professional services for a technology refresh project. We're seen to expand their use of our application models to include an application security module and a DNS solution in a multimillion dollar deal. 
Our base of SDN, cloud, application provider, service provider and converge system technology partners is as strong as ever. I want to expand on one particular security partnership that we formed in Q4. We added FireEye, an industry leader in network security, to help our customers defend against today's advanced cyber attacks. F5 and FireEye will offer customer network segmentation and policy management, protocol conformance, DDoS mitigation, SSL inspection, advanced threat protection, intrusion prevention, threat intelligence, forensics and analytics. Although we're just launching our partnership, our joint security offerings have already resulted in a multimillion sale to a U.S. health product company. 
Let me spend a moment now on our leadership team. I'm pleased to report that the sales team transition under John DiLullo has been smooth. John's global sales and channel experience and deep industry relationships combined with new FY '16 initiatives will enable F5 sales evolution and drive accelerated product revenue growth.
Secondly, I have asked Julian Eames to expand his responsibilities and centralize our support functions in global services, manufacturing, IT, program management and facilities under his leadership as our new Chief Operations Officer.
To reiterate my earlier comments, I believe our growth drivers for fiscal 2016 will be driven by our big IP releases, security-specific offers, sales and channel productivity gains, cloud and Silverline sales acceleration and a favorable product refresh cycle anticipated in the back end of this fiscal year.
As far as the Q1 outlook is concerned, Andy indicated that we expect revenues in the $480 million to $490 million range. We are taking measured view of our Q1 business in light of several macro economic uncertainties and the historical impact of seasonality on our Q1 order [indiscernible].
As Andy also mentioned, we expect to deliver sequential quarter-over-quarter growth through the rest of fiscal 2016, and we will continue to invest in activities that further extend our leadership position or help us to capture incremental opportunities as they arise.
As the market evolves, so too does F5. By having net application as our focus, we have been able to grow and flex the new customer demands.
Kicking off our new fiscal year this month, we have a clear sense of purpose, expanding our core offerings in ADC to the cloud, extending into strategic markets of security, F5 as a service via Silverline and the service provider and driving a world-class customer experience from our global services organization. As I stated at the beginning of my commentary, I'm excited about the opportunities presented by our hybrid application services strategy. Our customers are moving beyond hybrid architectures and our focus on software application service is clearly positioning us to capture new workloads and new markets.
The leadership team and I are looking forward to sharing these plans with you at our Annual Investor Meeting on November 12 in New York City.
In closing, I would like to thank the entire F5 team, our partners and customers for their support last quarter. We look forward to a great Q1. I will now open the call up for Q&A."

We made a commitment to refresh that approximately every 3 years, and we're at that turning point. We see that happening toward the later part of this year also, more into Q3, later Q4 timeframe. And then, from a sales initiatives perspective, I guess, what I'll comment on, and John, if you want to add to that afterwards, is really, we -- as we continue to expand into the new markets, whether it be security or service provider, we're continuing to specialize our sales organizations in those areas.

One is the hyper growth of cloud helping you. And the second one is the idea that you might have benefited a lot from like a weak competitive environment and that you've been growing faster than the market and that maybe now, it's going to be better for you to grow some. So my 2 questions would be on the cloud, when you see your clients moving to the cloud, is that a net benefit to you and are you very clearly seeing that? Although that means that people -- your clients are buying less on premises and there is a large amount of cannibalization. And then, the second one on the competitive landscape, you mentioned that you are gaining still a good traction on the [indiscernible] of Cisco.

And what that basically means is solutions that both enables on-prem and off-prem, and when they go off-prem, to also be multi-cloud, not single cloud provider. So we see that as a massive opportunity for us to be able to create a solution set across the environment that we allow application-to-application service portability out there. So that's the big -- a major driver for us. Obviously, above and beyond that, we're also making sure that our solution is in all of the major cloud instances so we're easy to find from a customer perspective.

There's 1 good data point here, by the way, it's Karl speaking, is that our software versions of our products are the fastest-growing part of our business right now, and that's what we're using to support effectively this hybrid cloud focus. And there's a number of areas that we address holistically with this. One of the big key ones, like Manny mentioned, is the ability to have this portability between clouds and the data center and consistent policies. And with consistent policies, what they mean by that is both security as well as access policies. And so as part of our latest release and kind of core to our products is the ability to provide this federated access so that we can front end both public, private as well as kind of traditional data centers, including SaaS-based applications as well. The other components are things like customers want to be able to have capacity augmentation with the cloud. To be able to do that, of course, you need to have kind of these consistent policies, and we provide that. Security services is a key area. You need to have audibility and the ability to have that consistency between what they're doing on-prem and off-prem and provide consistent services and all that. And so there's a number of things that we do there. If you look at our latest release, in fact, we added a lot of other key features that made us operate much better in some of the biggest public clouds like Azure and AWS. And so we've been there for quite a while. So there's definitely an opportunity there, and we're innovating and quickly working towards that because that's where our customers are taking us."

We just had our Americas QBR earlier this week and they came out up repeatedly from the sales leadership of good traction in the field and good engagement. So we anticipate it'll be material in FY '16 and then carryforward from a solution set perspective. We have very complementary set of technologies of the 2 companies with very little overlap. And as a result of that, that creates a very fluid and natural sales motion since our sales organizations can provide a better solution together, and there's no real conflict on where the revenue is going to come from."

The second thing we have seen is some of the lumpiness in service provider business, which on certain quarters had been very, very solid, but this last quarter was down relative to other quarters. So it hasn't been 1 specific thing. It's actually been a series of things throughout the year that's continued to create that deceleration. But there's no question that there is also some pause, I think, in the market as these network transitions begin to occur, whether it be SDN and how SDN plays out in the enterprise, how cloud also plays out in the enterprise from a hybrid perspective, and in the service provider arena, how things like NFV play out and whether how quickly they move in those arenas. So I think, some of this is just caution on the customers as they redesign their new architectures, but what we're not seeing is any significant losses. We've looked at our win-loss data on an ongoing basis. So we think as we continue to further our technology solutions there, as the market continues to harden and adopt those new architectures, that we should see favorable second half of FY '16."

Some of the things we've been able to do over the last year that we look at, we introduced Silverline and that came in the cost of some of the margins, we put that into the gross margin, so building up these socks that we build out. And we were able to do that and maintain our gross margin. And as we've long stated, our strategy is to leverage the gross margin to invest in the business where we think it will help drive revenue. If we go back 2 years ago, we said we wanted to make an investment in consulting, which we did. Now we were able to do that and maintain margin, and we see those consultants driving business for us. So that's kind of how we've executed and it's working for us and we want to continue that. And as always, with our disciplined and management approach, we'll watch it and adjust as we need to, but that's how we want to see it lay out."

On that one, we're still seeing -- we're seeing relatively modest revenue, to be honest.

As I normally do on our Q4 call, I will first discuss our results for the fourth quarter and the fiscal year ended September 30; then I will provide guidance for the current quarter; and finally, outline our general planning assumptions and expectations for fiscal year 2016.
We ended fiscal 2015 with an annual revenue run rate of $2 billion and record earnings per share. Revenue of $501.3 million was up 8% compared to Q4 '14 and within our guided range of $500 million to $510 million. GAAP EPS was $1.36 per share, above our guidance of $1.26 to $1.29 per share. Non-GAAP EPS of $1.84 also exceeded our guidance of $1.72 to $1.75 per share.
Q4 product revenue of $257.7 million, up 4% from Q3 and 1% from the fourth quarter of last year represented 51% of revenue. Service revenue of $243.6 million increased 4% sequentially, 16% year-over-year and accounted for 49% of revenue.
On a regional basis, the Americas grew 7% year-over-year and represented 58% of revenue, with the strongest growth in the U.S., while a difficult macro environment slowed sales in Latin America and Canada. EMEA grew 11% year-over-year and accounted for 23% of overall revenue. APAC, which accounted for 15% of revenue, increased 12% year-over-year. And Japan, at 4% of revenue, was down 6% from a year ago. Enterprise customers represented 65% of total Q4 sales. Service providers accounted for 17%, and government sales were 17%, including 9% from U.S. Federal.
During the quarter, we have 3 greater-than-10% distributors. Westcon, which accounted for 17.2% of total revenue; Ingram Micro, which accounted for 15.6%; and Avnet at 14.3%. 
Continuing down the income statement. GAAP gross margin in Q4 was 83.1%. Non-GAAP gross margin was 84.4%. GAAP operating expenses of $269 million were at the low end of our $267 million to $276 million guided range. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $230.4 million.
Our GAAP operating margin in Q4 was 29.4%, and non-GAAP operating margin was 38.4%. Our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 35.1%, and our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 32.8%.
Turning to the balance sheet. In Q4, we generated $183 million in cash flow from operations, which contributed to cash and investments totaling $1.17 billion at year-end. DSO was 50 days. Inventory at the end of the quarter was $33.7 million. Deferred revenue increased 23% year-over-year to $783.3 million.
In Q4, we repurchased approximately 1.18 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $126.99 per share for a total of $150 million. Approximately $474 million remains authorized under the current share repurchase program.
During the quarter, we closed our test facility in Tomsk, Russia, eliminating approximately 65 positions. These will be reinvested in other locations over the first half of fiscal 2016. Across the rest of the company, we added a very strong 135 net employees.
For the full year, revenue for fiscal 2015 was $1.92 billion, up 11% from fiscal 2014. Product revenue of $991.5 million was up 6% from the prior year and accounted for 52% of total revenue. Service revenue of $928.3 million grew 17% during the year and represented 48% of the total. GAAP net income for fiscal 2015 was $365 million or $5.03 per share, and non-GAAP net income was $480.3 million or $6.62 per share. And for all of fiscal 2015, cash flow from operations totaled $685 million.
Moving onto our guidance for Q1 and our fiscal year '16 outlook. As we entered fiscal 2016, the growth of IP traffic and connected devices, the proliferation of applications and virtualized data centers in the cloud and the increase in the number and types and security threats all challenged the fast, secure and reliable delivery of applications to increasingly mobile users. Over the past several years, the pace of innovation at F5 has accelerated to deliver products and services that enable customers to meet these challenges by leveraging the cloud, SDN, NFV and other emerging technologies that are reshaping the industry. As a result of these efforts, our absolute focus on the application, continuing technology leadership of our full proxy architecture and our disciplined business model, I am confident that we will see a return to year-over-year product revenue growth and continued solid EPS growth in the coming year.
During the past 2 quarters, F5 has had several key management transitions, consisting of both new leadership and realignment of certain internal responsibilities. These moves have already resulted in positive changes to our organizational structure, product road map and sales motions that are designed to reaccelerate and drive product revenue growth in the current fiscal year and beyond.
As we enter our fiscal 2016, we are anticipating seasonal softness we typically experience in Q1. We also continue to be cautious due to budget uncertainty driven by foreign currency fluctuations and lingering macro issues. With this in mind, for the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we are targeting revenue in the range of $480 million to $490 million. We expect GAAP gross margins at or around 82.5%, including approximately $4 million of stock-based compensation expense and $2.7 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets. Non-GAAP gross margins are anticipated at or around 84%.
We estimate GAAP operating expense of $268 million to $277 million, including approximately $35 million of stock-based compensation expense and $0.7 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets. We anticipate a GAAP effective tax rate of 37.5% for the quarter and a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 34.5%.
Our Q1 GAAP earnings target is $1.13 to $1.16 per share. Our non-GAAP earnings target is $1.58 to $1.61 per share. We believe we will generate cash flow from operations in excess of $195 million, and we plan to increase our headcount by up to 100 employees during the quarter.
Looking out to the fiscal year ahead, our general planning assumptions and expectations for the year are as follows: From the base of Q1, we anticipate sequential revenue growth throughout the year, with a strong second half of the fiscal year. We anticipate that non-GAAP gross margins will remain in the 83.5% to 84.5% range. We expect non-GAAP operating margins in the mid-30s range for the first half of the year and increasing through the second half. Stock-based compensation is anticipated to be in the range of $160 million to $170 million for the year. Capital expenditures are expected to range from $15 million to $20 million per quarter for ongoing infrastructure investments and facilities expansions. And finally, assuming the R&D tax credit is not extended during fiscal 2016, we expect our effective tax rate to average approximately 37% to 38% on a GAAP basis and 34% to 35% on a non-GAAP basis for the year.
As John mentioned, our Analyst Investor meeting will be November 12 in New York. We hope you can join us as our executive team presents the company strategy and go-to-market plans for F5.
With that, I will turn the call over to Manny Rivelo."

I would like to thank everybody for joining F5's 2015 Q4 Earnings Conference Call.
Overall, I'm pleased with the performance this fiscal year. We closed FY '15 with a number of key milestones: Revenues of $1.9 billion with solid financial performance and record non-GAAP earnings per share of $6.62.
We continue to outpace our competition with our hybrid application services strategy. Year-to-date, we've increased our virtual ADC market share by 13 points and the overall ADC market share by 3 points for a total share of 49% as of the latest industry reports. And for the ninth year in a row, we remained the leader in the 2015 Gartner Magic Quadrant for ADC. We continue to diversify with more than 1/3 of our revenue coming from software sales, driven largely by the demand for security and the uptake of our ""Good, Better, Best"" licensing and continued strength with our virtualization sales. Approximately 41% of total product sales in FY '15 included one or more security products. This represents a 22% year-over-year growth, driven in large part by our wins in government, financial service and service providers.
Demonstrating the power of our programmable platform, we exceeded 223,000 members in our DevCentral user community, representing a 22% year-over-year growth. And lastly, we are approaching 4,200 global employees. 
It took us 15 years to reach $1 billion in sales. A mere 4 years later, in Q4, we exited the year at $501 million in sales, putting us at a $2 billion run rate. As you heard from Andy, we had a solid fourth quarter, meeting our revenue guidance and achieving record profitability. From a regional perspective, U.S. enterprise had a good quarter. However, overall Americas bookings were behind our internal expectations. We attribute this to the market volatility and the currency fluctuations in Latin America and Canada and some delays in project-driven service provider transactions.
In EMEA, we saw bookings in line with our internal expectations. Bookings at our Asia-Pac region exceeded our targets and showed strong year-over-year growth, while Japan sales was down year-over-year but in line with our internal projections.
In the core of our ADC market, we enjoyed a good quarter. In August, we released the traffic management operating system, TMOS version 12.0. This is a meaningful major release that allows customers to more easily transition workloads to the cloud and incorporate technologies like HTTP 2.0, while maintaining the same visibility, security and control of traditional infrastructures. 
Our programmable extensible architecture and growing ecosystem of technology partners make our application services an ideal fit for emerging IT trends such as software-defined networking, network function virtualization and the cloud. We see many emerging opportunities from new projects enabled by our hybrid application services. Our recent F5 global survey of over 3,000 customers showed that 81% plan to run the applications in a hybrid, a private-public cloud environment. We see this trend reflected in our virtualization sales, which were up 57% for the full fiscal year.
In Q4, we launched the F5 Ready program to verify F5 virtual addition compatibility with a growing of public cloud service providers. This includes Amazon Web Services, Blue Lock, British Telecom, Cisco Intercloud, Datacom, Dimension Data, Microsoft Azure, Rackspace, Single Hop, Sky Tap and VMware and VCloud Air. The F5 Ready program makes it possible for our customers to run their applications and application services in the cloud environment of their choice. 
We still continue to see opportunities in Cisco ACE replacement. We also see opportunities in selling additional F5 modules to new ACE replacement customers. For example, in Q4, we won a competitive million dollar ACE replacement order at a Fortune 100 company, chiefly due to our strength in SDN. 
Hybrid deployments are driving security requirements for our customers' cloud adoption. Nearly half, 48% of the customers we surveyed cited consistent policy and audibility of on -- with on-premise as an important security factor for their cloud adoption. We see this trend reflected in our wins. 
In Q4, a global consulting firm replaced Juniper with F5's remote access in single sign-on solutions across their cloud and on-premise applications.
Because of our strategic point of control at many customers' networks, more and more of our accounts are implementing F5 hybrid security services to combat the increasing volume and sophistication of high-profile cybersecurity breaches. In April, we launched a new Silverline Web application firewall, a WAF as a service, and although it's early days, we are seeing solid interest from our customers and sale organization for our cloud-based offerings, tripling our Silverline customer base this past year.
This past quarter, based on our growing Silverline and Versafe customer demand, we opened a second security operations center in Poland. The team of highly specialized F5 security researchers and analysts in Warsaw will complement our existing facility here in Seattle. Monitoring and investigating global multilayer attacks, the center will maintain up-to-date information on the latest malware, 0-day and phishing attacks.
In the service provider industry, a recent survey shows that on a daily basis, an average Tier 1 operator experiences roughly 10 to 15 DDoS attacks and 2,000 application attacks which can result in leaked customer data, intercepted or blocked calls, roaming fraud as well as deterioration of network and service performance. These trends have increasingly driven growth of our security offerings within our service provider business.
In particular, we are enjoying rapid expansion in our U.S. carrier segment where our Gi LAN and anti-DDoS service capabilities as well as our firewall and application protection capabilities are helping us to secure competitive multimillion dollar repeat wins. 
As the demand for high bandwidth, low latency networks only increases, our NFE, TCP optimization and advanced traffic steering solutions are helping our service provider customers significantly increase their efficiency and ensure their peak network performance. We signed several multimillion dollar agreements in the past quarter that further evidenced our carrier freight capabilities.
In addition, we have increased our NFE partner ecosystem. In Q4, we announced a partnership with HP, Nuage and Telstra to demonstrate a proof of concept for a multi-vendor open NFE solution. Certified by the European Telecommunications Standard Institute, ETSI, this proof of concept demonstrates to service providers how NFE can reduce TCO while increasing service agility and network elasticity.
Our service business continues to produce with 17% year-over-year revenue growth for the full fiscal year. New and renewed service maintenance contracts grow with deferred revenue growth to 783 million this quarter, up 23% year-over-year, providing a solid foundation for continued services to grow. 
Our services strength also underscores how our world-class, high-valued customer support drives product revenue growth. For example, in Q4, a U.S. bank leveraged our professional services for a technology refresh project. We're seen to expand their use of our application models to include an application security module and a DNS solution in a multimillion dollar deal. 
Our base of SDN, cloud, application provider, service provider and converge system technology partners is as strong as ever. I want to expand on one particular security partnership that we formed in Q4. We added FireEye, an industry leader in network security, to help our customers defend against today's advanced cyber attacks. F5 and FireEye will offer customer network segmentation and policy management, protocol conformance, DDoS mitigation, SSL inspection, advanced threat protection, intrusion prevention, threat intelligence, forensics and analytics. Although we're just launching our partnership, our joint security offerings have already resulted in a multimillion sale to a U.S. health product company. 
Let me spend a moment now on our leadership team. I'm pleased to report that the sales team transition under John DiLullo has been smooth. John's global sales and channel experience and deep industry relationships combined with new FY '16 initiatives will enable F5 sales evolution and drive accelerated product revenue growth.
Secondly, I have asked Julian Eames to expand his responsibilities and centralize our support functions in global services, manufacturing, IT, program management and facilities under his leadership as our new Chief Operations Officer.
To reiterate my earlier comments, I believe our growth drivers for fiscal 2016 will be driven by our big IP releases, security-specific offers, sales and channel productivity gains, cloud and Silverline sales acceleration and a favorable product refresh cycle anticipated in the back end of this fiscal year.
As far as the Q1 outlook is concerned, Andy indicated that we expect revenues in the $480 million to $490 million range. We are taking measured view of our Q1 business in light of several macro economic uncertainties and the historical impact of seasonality on our Q1 order [indiscernible].
As Andy also mentioned, we expect to deliver sequential quarter-over-quarter growth through the rest of fiscal 2016, and we will continue to invest in activities that further extend our leadership position or help us to capture incremental opportunities as they arise.
As the market evolves, so too does F5. By having net application as our focus, we have been able to grow and flex the new customer demands.
Kicking off our new fiscal year this month, we have a clear sense of purpose, expanding our core offerings in ADC to the cloud, extending into strategic markets of security, F5 as a service via Silverline and the service provider and driving a world-class customer experience from our global services organization. As I stated at the beginning of my commentary, I'm excited about the opportunities presented by our hybrid application services strategy. Our customers are moving beyond hybrid architectures and our focus on software application service is clearly positioning us to capture new workloads and new markets.
The leadership team and I are looking forward to sharing these plans with you at our Annual Investor Meeting on November 12 in New York City.
In closing, I would like to thank the entire F5 team, our partners and customers for their support last quarter. We look forward to a great Q1. I will now open the call up for Q&A."

We made a commitment to refresh that approximately every 3 years, and we're at that turning point. We see that happening toward the later part of this year also, more into Q3, later Q4 timeframe. And then, from a sales initiatives perspective, I guess, what I'll comment on, and John, if you want to add to that afterwards, is really, we -- as we continue to expand into the new markets, whether it be security or service provider, we're continuing to specialize our sales organizations in those areas.

And the second one is the idea that you might have benefited a lot from like a weak competitive environment and that you've been growing faster than the market and that maybe now, it's going to be tougher for you to grow some. So my 2 questions would be on the cloud, when you see your clients moving to the cloud, is that a net benefit to you and are you very clearly seeing that? Although that means that people -- your clients are buying less on premises and there is a large amount of cannibalization. And then, the second one on the competitive landscape, you mentioned that you are gaining still a good traction on the [indiscernible] of Cisco.

I'll start with the cloud, and turn it over to Karl and then maybe we'll come back and talk about the competitive environment. So on the cloud, the key point is when we talk to our customers, they're looking for hybrid architectures. And what that basically means is solutions that both enables on-prem and off-prem, and when they go off-prem, to also be multi-cloud, not single cloud provider. So we see that as a massive opportunity for us to be able to create a solution set across the environment that we allow application-to-application service portability out there. So that's the big -- a major driver for us. Obviously, above and beyond that, we're also making sure that our solution is in all of the major cloud instances so we're easy to find from a customer perspective. I don't know if you want to add anything, Karl?"

There's 1 good data point here, by the way, it's Karl speaking, is that our software versions of our products are the fastest-growing part of our business right now, and that's what we're using to support effectively this hybrid cloud focus. And there's a number of areas that we address holistically with this. One of the big key ones, like Manny mentioned, is the ability to have this portability between clouds and the data center and consistent policies. And with consistent policies, what they mean by that is both security as well as access policies. And so as part of our latest release and kind of core to our products is the ability to provide this federated access so that we can front end both public, private as well as kind of traditional data centers, including SaaS-based applications as well. The other components are things like customers want to be able to have capacity augmentation with the cloud. To be able to do that, of course, you need to have kind of these consistent policies, and we provide that. Security services is a key area. You need to have audibility and the ability to have that consistency between what they're doing on-prem and off-prem and provide consistent services and all that. And so there's a number of things that we do there. If you look at our latest release, in fact, we added a lot of other key features that made us operate much better in some of the biggest public clouds like Azure and AWS. And so we've been there for quite a while. So there's definitely an opportunity there, and we're innovating and quickly working towards that because that's where our customers are taking us."

It's just it's not something that works well moving to a cloud-type environment for those customers. And then, also, as Manny mentioned earlier in his script, we're working very aggressively on the appliance refresh, which, again, later next year -- or later this year, excuse me, we expect to start seeing -- rolling those platforms out. And those will bring in, again, significant new performance and capabilities, including things like 2 to 3x performance improvements, 100 gig interfaces, 40 gig, everything down the line being able to support our FPGA-based architecture right down to the lowest cost platform.

Some of the things we've been able to do over the last year that we look at, we introduced Silverline and that came in the cost of some of the margins, we put that into the gross margin, so building up these socks that we build out. And we were able to do that and maintain our gross margin. And as we've long stated, our strategy is to leverage the gross margin to invest in the business where we think it will help drive revenue. If we go back 2 years ago, we said we wanted to make an investment in consulting, which we did. Now we were able to do that and maintain margin, and we see those consultants driving business for us. So that's kind of how we've executed and it's working for us and we want to continue that. And as always, with our disciplined and management approach, we'll watch it and adjust as we need to, but that's how we want to see it lay out."

As I normally do on our Q4 call, I will first discuss our results for the fourth quarter and the fiscal year ended September 30; then I will provide guidance for the current quarter; and finally, outline our general planning assumptions and expectations for fiscal year 2016.
We ended fiscal 2015 with an annual revenue run rate of $2 billion and record earnings per share. Revenue of $501.3 million was up 8% compared to Q4 '14 and within our guided range of $500 million to $510 million. GAAP EPS was $1.36 per share, above our guidance of $1.26 to $1.29 per share. Non-GAAP EPS of $1.84 also exceeded our guidance of $1.72 to $1.75 per share.
Q4 product revenue of $257.7 million, up 4% from Q3 and 1% from the fourth quarter of last year represented 51% of revenue. Service revenue of $243.6 million increased 4% sequentially, 16% year-over-year and accounted for 49% of revenue.
On a regional basis, the Americas grew 7% year-over-year and represented 58% of revenue, with the strongest growth in the U.S., while a difficult macro environment slowed sales in Latin America and Canada. EMEA grew 11% year-over-year and accounted for 23% of overall revenue. APAC, which accounted for 15% of revenue, increased 12% year-over-year. And Japan, at 4% of revenue, was down 6% from a year ago. Enterprise customers represented 65% of total Q4 sales. Service providers accounted for 17%, and government sales were 17%, including 9% from U.S. Federal.
During the quarter, we have 3 greater-than-10% distributors. Westcon, which accounted for 17.2% of total revenue; Ingram Micro, which accounted for 15.6%; and Avnet at 14.3%. 
Continuing down the income statement. GAAP gross margin in Q4 was 83.1%. Non-GAAP gross margin was 84.4%. GAAP operating expenses of $269 million were at the low end of our $267 million to $276 million guided range. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $230.4 million.
Our GAAP operating margin in Q4 was 29.4%, and non-GAAP operating margin was 38.4%. Our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 35.1%, and our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 32.8%.
Turning to the balance sheet. In Q4, we generated $183 million in cash flow from operations, which contributed to cash and investments totaling $1.17 billion at year-end. DSO was 50 days. Inventory at the end of the quarter was $33.7 million. Deferred revenue increased 23% year-over-year to $783.3 million.
In Q4, we repurchased approximately 1.18 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $126.99 per share for a total of $150 million. Approximately $474 million remains authorized under the current share repurchase program.
During the quarter, we closed our test facility in Tomsk, Russia, eliminating approximately 65 positions. These will be reinvested in other locations over the first half of fiscal 2016. Across the rest of the company, we added a very strong 135 net employees.
For the full year, revenue for fiscal 2015 was $1.92 billion, up 11% from fiscal 2014. Product revenue of $991.5 million was up 6% from the prior year and accounted for 52% of total revenue. Service revenue of $928.3 million grew 17% during the year and represented 48% of the total. GAAP net income for fiscal 2015 was $365 million or $5.03 per share, and non-GAAP net income was $480.3 million or $6.62 per share. And for all of fiscal 2015, cash flow from operations totaled $685 million.
Moving onto our guidance for Q1 and our fiscal year '16 outlook. As we entered fiscal 2016, the growth of IP traffic and connected devices, the proliferation of applications and virtualized data centers in the cloud and the increase in the number and types and security threats all challenged the fast, secure and reliable delivery of applications to increasingly mobile users. Over the past several years, the pace of innovation at F5 has accelerated to deliver products and services that enable customers to meet these challenges by leveraging the cloud, SDN, NFV and other emerging technologies that are reshaping the industry. As a result of these efforts, our absolute focus on the application, continuing technology leadership of our full proxy architecture and our disciplined business model, I am confident that we will see a return to year-over-year product revenue growth and continued solid EPS growth in the coming year.
During the past 2 quarters, F5 has had several key management transitions, consisting of both new leadership and realignment of certain internal responsibilities. These moves have already resulted in positive changes to our organizational structure, product road map and sales motions that are designed to reaccelerate and drive product revenue growth in the current fiscal year and beyond.
As we enter our fiscal 2016, we are anticipating seasonal softness we typically experience in Q1. We also continue to be cautious due to budget uncertainty driven by foreign currency fluctuations and lingering macro issues. With this in mind, for the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we are targeting revenue in the range of $480 million to $490 million. We expect GAAP gross margins at or around 82.5%, including approximately $4 million of stock-based compensation expense and $2.7 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets. Non-GAAP gross margins are anticipated at or around 84%.
We estimate GAAP operating expense of $268 million to $277 million, including approximately $35 million of stock-based compensation expense and $0.7 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets. We anticipate a GAAP effective tax rate of 37.5% for the quarter and a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 34.5%.
Our Q1 GAAP earnings target is $1.13 to $1.16 per share. Our non-GAAP earnings target is $1.58 to $1.61 per share. We believe we will generate cash flow from operations in excess of $195 million, and we plan to increase our headcount by up to 100 employees during the quarter.
Looking out to the fiscal year ahead, our general planning assumptions and expectations for the year are as follows: From the base of Q1, we anticipate sequential revenue growth throughout the year, with a strong second half of the fiscal year. We anticipate that non-GAAP gross margins will remain in the 83.5% to 84.5% range. We expect non-GAAP operating margins in the mid-30s range for the first half of the year and increasing through the second half. Stock-based compensation is anticipated to be in the range of $160 million to $170 million for the year. Capital expenditures are expected to range from $15 million to $20 million per quarter for ongoing infrastructure investments and facilities expansions. And finally, assuming the R&D tax credit is not extended during fiscal 2016, we expect our effective tax rate to average approximately 37% to 38% on a GAAP basis and 34% to 35% on a non-GAAP basis for the year.
As John mentioned, our Analyst Investor meeting will be November 12 in New York. We hope you can join us as our executive team presents the company strategy and go-to-market plans for F5.
With that, I will turn the call over to Manny Rivelo."

I would like to thank everybody for joining F5's 2015 Q4 Earnings Conference Call.
Overall, I'm pleased with the performance this fiscal year. We closed FY '15 with a number of key milestones: Revenues of $1.9 billion with solid financial performance and record non-GAAP earnings per share of $6.62.
We continue to outpace our competition with our hybrid application services strategy. Year-to-date, we've increased our virtual ADC market share by 13 points and the overall ADC market share by 3 points for a total share of 49% as of the latest industry reports. And for the ninth year in a row, we remained the leader in the 2015 Gartner Magic Quadrant for ADC. We continue to diversify with more than 1/3 of our revenue coming from software sales, driven largely by the demand for security and the uptake of our ""Good, Better, Best"" licensing and continued strength with our virtualization sales. Approximately 41% of total product sales in FY '15 included one or more security products. This represents a 22% year-over-year growth, driven in large part by our wins in government, financial service and service providers.
Demonstrating the power of our programmable platform, we exceeded 223,000 members in our DevCentral user community, representing a 22% year-over-year growth. And lastly, we are approaching 4,200 global employees. 
It took us 15 years to reach $1 billion in sales. A mere 4 years later, in Q4, we exited the year at $501 million in sales, putting us at a $2 billion run rate. As you heard from Andy, we had a solid fourth quarter, meeting our revenue guidance and achieving record profitability. From a regional perspective, U.S. enterprise had a good quarter. However, overall Americas bookings were behind our internal expectations. We attribute this to the market volatility and the currency fluctuations in Latin America and Canada and some delays in project-driven service provider transactions.
In EMEA, we saw bookings in line with our internal expectations. Bookings at our Asia-Pac region exceeded our targets and showed strong year-over-year growth, while Japan sales was down year-over-year but in line with our internal projections.
In the core of our ADC market, we enjoyed a good quarter. In August, we released the traffic management operating system, TMOS version 12.0. This is a meaningful major release that allows customers to more easily transition workloads to the cloud and incorporate technologies like HTTP 2.0, while maintaining the same visibility, security and control of traditional infrastructures. 
Our programmable extensible architecture and growing ecosystem of technology partners make our application services an ideal fit for emerging IT trends such as software-defined networking, network function virtualization and the cloud. We see many emerging opportunities from new projects enabled by our hybrid application services. Our recent F5 global survey of over 3,000 customers showed that 81% plan to run the applications in a hybrid, a private-public cloud environment. We see this trend reflected in our virtualization sales, which were up 57% for the full fiscal year.
In Q4, we launched the F5 Ready program to verify F5 virtual addition compatibility with a growing of public cloud service providers. This includes Amazon Web Services, Blue Lock, British Telecom, Cisco Intercloud, Datacom, Dimension Data, Microsoft Azure, Rackspace, Single Hop, Sky Tap and VMware and VCloud Air. The F5 Ready program makes it possible for our customers to run their applications and application services in the cloud environment of their choice. 
We still continue to see opportunities in Cisco ACE replacement. We also see opportunities in selling additional F5 modules to new ACE replacement customers. For example, in Q4, we won a competitive million dollar ACE replacement order at a Fortune 100 company, chiefly due to our strength in SDN. 
Hybrid deployments are driving security requirements for our customers' cloud adoption. Nearly half, 48% of the customers we surveyed cited consistent policy and audibility of on -- with on-premise as an important security factor for their cloud adoption. We see this trend reflected in our wins. 
In Q4, a global consulting firm replaced Juniper with F5's remote access in single sign-on solutions across their cloud and on-premise applications.
Because of our strategic point of control at many customers' networks, more and more of our accounts are implementing F5 hybrid security services to combat the increasing volume and sophistication of high-profile cybersecurity breaches. In April, we launched a new Silverline Web application firewall, a WAF as a service, and although it's early days, we are seeing solid interest from our customers and sale organization for our cloud-based offerings, tripling our Silverline customer base this past year.
This past quarter, based on our growing Silverline and Versafe customer demand, we opened a second security operations center in Poland. The team of highly specialized F5 security researchers and analysts in Warsaw will complement our existing facility here in Seattle. Monitoring and investigating global multilayer attacks, the center will maintain up-to-date information on the latest malware, 0-day and phishing attacks.
In the service provider industry, a recent survey shows that on a daily basis, an average Tier 1 operator experiences roughly 10 to 15 DDoS attacks and 2,000 application attacks which can result in leaked customer data, intercepted or blocked calls, roaming fraud as well as deterioration of network and service performance. These trends have increasingly driven growth of our security offerings within our service provider business.
In particular, we are enjoying rapid expansion in our U.S. carrier segment where our Gi LAN and anti-DDoS service capabilities as well as our firewall and application protection capabilities are helping us to secure competitive multimillion dollar repeat wins. 
As the demand for high bandwidth, low latency networks only increases, our NFE, TCP optimization and advanced traffic steering solutions are helping our service provider customers significantly increase their efficiency and ensure their peak network performance. We signed several multimillion dollar agreements in the past quarter that further evidenced our carrier freight capabilities.
In addition, we have increased our NFE partner ecosystem. In Q4, we announced a partnership with HP, Nuage and Telstra to demonstrate a proof of concept for a multi-vendor open NFE solution. Certified by the European Telecommunications Standard Institute, ETSI, this proof of concept demonstrates to service providers how NFE can reduce TCO while increasing service agility and network elasticity.
Our service business continues to produce with 17% year-over-year revenue growth for the full fiscal year. New and renewed service maintenance contracts grow with deferred revenue growth to 783 million this quarter, up 23% year-over-year, providing a solid foundation for continued services to grow. 
Our services strength also underscores how our world-class, high-valued customer support drives product revenue growth. For example, in Q4, a U.S. bank leveraged our professional services for a technology refresh project. We're seen to expand their use of our application models to include an application security module and a DNS solution in a multimillion dollar deal. 
Our base of SDN, cloud, application provider, service provider and converge system technology partners is as strong as ever. I want to expand on one particular security partnership that we formed in Q4. We added FireEye, an industry leader in network security, to help our customers defend against today's advanced cyber attacks. F5 and FireEye will offer customer network segmentation and policy management, protocol conformance, DDoS mitigation, SSL inspection, advanced threat protection, intrusion prevention, threat intelligence, forensics and analytics. Although we're just launching our partnership, our joint security offerings have already resulted in a multimillion sale to a U.S. health product company. 
Let me spend a moment now on our leadership team. I'm pleased to report that the sales team transition under John DiLullo has been smooth. John's global sales and channel experience and deep industry relationships combined with new FY '16 initiatives will enable F5 sales evolution and drive accelerated product revenue growth.
Secondly, I have asked Julian Eames to expand his responsibilities and centralize our support functions in global services, manufacturing, IT, program management and facilities under his leadership as our new Chief Operations Officer.
To reiterate my earlier comments, I believe our growth drivers for fiscal 2016 will be driven by our big IP releases, security-specific offers, sales and channel productivity gains, cloud and Silverline sales acceleration and a favorable product refresh cycle anticipated in the back end of this fiscal year.
As far as the Q1 outlook is concerned, Andy indicated that we expect revenues in the $480 million to $490 million range. We are taking measured view of our Q1 business in light of several macroeconomic uncertainties and the historical impact of seasonality on our Q1 order [indiscernible].
As Andy also mentioned, we expect to deliver sequential quarter-over-quarter growth through the rest of fiscal 2016, and we will continue to invest in activities that further extend our leadership position or help us to capture incremental opportunities as they arise.
As the market evolves, so too does F5. By having net application as our focus, we have been able to grow and flex the new customer demands.
Kicking off our new fiscal year this month, we have a clear sense of purpose, expanding our core offerings in ADC to the cloud, extending into strategic markets of security, F5 as a service via Silverline and the service provider and driving a world-class customer experience from our global services organization. As I stated at the beginning of my commentary, I'm excited about the opportunities presented by our hybrid application services strategy. Our customers are moving beyond hybrid architectures and our focus on software application service is clearly positioning us to capture new workloads and new markets.
The leadership team and I are looking forward to sharing these plans with you at our Annual Investor Meeting on November 12 in New York City.
In closing, I would like to thank the entire F5 team, our partners and customers for their support last quarter. We look forward to a great Q1. I will now open the call up for Q&A."

We made a commitment to refresh that approximately every 3 years, and we're at that turning point. We see that happening toward the later part of this year also, more into Q3, later Q4 timeframe. And then, from a sales initiatives perspective, I guess, what I'll comment on, and John, if you want to add to that afterwards, is really, we -- as we continue to expand into the new markets, whether it be security or service provider, we're continuing to specialize our sales organizations in those areas. So it's some of the initiatives of how we continue to specialize our sales teams as well as our channel organization to better capture the emerging opportunities there."

One is the hyper growth of cloud helping you. And the second one is the idea that you might have benefited a lot from like a weak competitive environment and that you've been growing faster than the market and that maybe now, it's going to be tougher for you to grow some. So my 2 questions would be on the cloud, when you see your clients moving to the cloud, is that a net benefit to you and are you very clearly seeing that? Although that means that people -- your clients are buying less on premises and there is a large amount of cannibalization. And then, the second one on the competitive landscape, you mentioned that you are gaining still a good traction on the [indiscernible] of Cisco. Do you see anything changing that would justify a slower growth going forward in your competitive landscape, be it on the net scale side of things? Are they getting more aggressive?

And what that basically means is solutions that both enables on-prem and off-prem, and when they go off-prem, to also be multi-cloud, not single cloud provider. So we see that as a massive opportunity for us to be able to create a solution set across the environment that we allow application-to-application service portability out there. So that's the big -- a major driver for us. Obviously, above and beyond that, we're also making sure that our solution is in all of the major cloud instances so we're easy to find from a customer perspective.

There's 1 good data point here, by the way, it's Karl speaking, is that our software versions of our products are the fastest-growing part of our business right now, and that's what we're using to support effectively this hybrid cloud focus. And there's a number of areas that we address holistically with this. One of the big key ones, like Manny mentioned, is the ability to have this portability between clouds and the data center and consistent policies. And with consistent policies, what they mean by that is both security as well as access policies. And so as part of our latest release and kind of core to our products is the ability to provide this federated access so that we can front end both public, private as well as kind of traditional data centers, including SaaS-based applications as well. The other components are things like customers want to be able to have capacity augmentation with the cloud. To be able to do that, of course, you need to have kind of these consistent policies, and we provide that. Security services is a key area. You need to have audibility and the ability to have that consistency between what they're doing on-prem and off-prem and provide consistent services and all that. And so there's a number of things that we do there. If you look at our latest release, in fact, we added a lot of other key features that made us operate much better in some of the biggest public clouds like Azure and AWS. And so we've been there for quite a while. So there's definitely an opportunity there, and we're innovating and quickly working towards that because that's where our customers are taking us."

The second thing we have seen is some of the lumpiness in service provider business, which on certain quarters had been very, very solid, but this last quarter was down relative to other quarters. So it hasn't been 1 specific thing. It's actually been a series of things throughout the year that's continued to create that deceleration. But there's no question that there is also some pause, I think, in the market as these network transitions begin to occur, whether it be SDN and how SDN plays out in the enterprise, how cloud also plays out in the enterprise from a hybrid perspective, and in the service provider arena, how things like NFV play out and whether how quickly they move in those arenas. So I think, some of this is just caution on the customers as they redesign their new architectures, but we're not seeing is any significant losses. We've looked at our win-loss data on an ongoing basis. So we think as we continue to further our technology solutions there, as the market continues to harden and adopt those new architectures, that we should see favorable second half of FY '16."
