On this call today is Joe Parsons, our Chief Financial and Chief Operating Officer. I will begin with an overview of our third quarter performance and provide an update on our long-term growth strategies, then I will turn it over to Joe for a discussion of our financial results and our outlook for the fourth quarter and full year. 
Our solid financial results in the third quarter speak to the strength of the Michael Kors brand. We delivered our 35th consecutive quarter of positive comparable store sales growth and drove approximately 30% growth in both retail -- in both revenue and net income with strong holiday season. During the quarter, we continue to see strong momentum across our operating segments and geographies led by a double-digit comp sales increase in our accessories category in both retail and wholesale. In North America, sales increased more than 20%, and we believe -- and we delivered solid comp gains on top of significant increases last year. Notably, we saw exceptional performance from our U.S. e-commerce site, which generated a sales increase of 73% as compared to the sales of the previous outsourced site, exceeding our expectations. In addition, sales in both Europe and Japan increased 72% for the quarter. 
We are also pleased to report that we repurchased approximately 5 million shares during the quarter, reflecting the confidence we have in our future growth potential and our commitment to enhancing shareholder value. Importantly, we continue to execute on our long-term strategies during the quarter, which are focused on first: Growing our retail presence through our new store openings and store expansions in key locations throughout the world; second, developing a global best-in-class e-commerce strategy with omni-channel capabilities beginning with the launch of our enhanced company-owned U.S. e-commerce website in September 2014, followed by the upcoming launch in Canada this year and Europe and Japan in 2016; third, driving increased comparable sales in our retail locations and our wholesale shop-in-shops by creating great fashion products and a unique in-store experience that embodies the Michael Kors luxury brand; fourth, continuing to convert department store doors globally into branded shop-in-shops creating a jet-set experienced within each store; fifth, expanding our business internationally through company-owned subsidiaries and regional partnerships; and sixth, expanding our market share across a number of categories, including women's ready-to-wear footwear, jewelry and men's wear. 
Turning to our segment performance for the quarter. We saw exceptional growth in our Retail business with net sale increasing 37% driven by 114 new store openings since the third quarter of last year. E-commerce sales from our recently launched U.S. e-commerce site and an 8.6% increase in global comparable store sales, which was led by a double-digit comp growth in our accessories categories. We believe that the shopping behavior of certain customers in North America is changing, and they are migrating their purchases to our e-commerce site at a greater rate than we had initially anticipated, which is impacting traffic and comps in our North American retail stores. 
Given the shift in volume patterns, we believe the comparable store sales, including our e-commerce business, is a more accurate reflection of our performance and the strength of our brand. Including e-commerce, comparable store sales for North America would have increased 380 basis points higher. In addition, we expanded 30 highly productive stores this fiscal year and excluded these locations from the comp store base as well. These stores have historically comped at a rate higher than our company average, and we believe that the exclusion of these stores impacted our comparable store sales results by approximately 70 basis points.  At the end of the quarter, we operated 509 company-owned retail stores and see potential for 700 stores worldwide long-term, not including men's locations. In addition, our licensing partners operated 194 Michael Kors stores around the world, bringing our overall presence to 703 locations worldwide. 
Momentum in our wholesale segment continued with 24% revenue growth, driven by accessories and footwear. During the quarter, we converted an additional 60 wholesale doors into shop-in-shops globally ending the quarter with approximately 2,030 accessories, footwear, women's wear and men's wear shops worldwide.  We are pleased that the new shop-in-shops continue to generate a significant sales lift, contributing to the increased penetration in this channel. We expect to convert approximately 700 department store doors globally across all categories in fiscal 2015. 
In our licensing segment, revenue grew 9% driven by jewelry as well as winter outerwear and watches. During the quarter, we opened 40 new watch and jewelry shop-in-shops, and ended the quarter with 230 shops. We continue to see opportunity for 500 watch and jewelry shops worldwide over the long term as we extend our offering with our wholesale partners as well as in our own retail stores. Additionally, our fragrance business also performed well in the quarter as we see continued sales increases of our Sporty Sexy Glam fragrance collection. 
Turning to our operations by region. In North America, revenue grew 23% to $1 billion driven by strong performance in our retail and wholesale segments, led by our accessories business. We increased our total square footage to store and shop-in-shop expansions in addition to new store openings. In our North American retail segment, we delivered strong net sales growth of 30%, driven by 17 new store openings, e-commerce sales and a comparable store sale increase of 6%, led by double-digit comp growth in our accessories category. We're very excited about the opening of our several flagship location on January 29th, which is our largest store to-date, spanning 3 retail floors and approximately 21,000 square feet. This flagship stores offers the largest assortment of women's ready-to-wear and shoes globally. That is the first Michael Kors store in North America to provide a complete offering of our men's collection. We will apply the insights we gained from this new store for future extended locations and for our men's retail business. We operated 337 stores at the end of the quarter and remain on track to open approximately 50 stores in the region during fiscal 2015, and continue to believe there's opportunity for 400 locations in North America, not including potential men's locations. 
As I said earlier, our e-commerce launch was highly successful and represent an exciting opportunity for us. E-commerce sales exceeded expectations with growth of 73% in the third quarter as compared to retail e-commerce sales at a previously outsourced site, and this channel now represents 7% of our retail sales in North America. As I mentioned earlier, we believe the migration of customer purchases to online channels impacted our retail store traffic and comp performance in North America. We saw a strong year-over-year increases in e-commerce traffic and conversion during the quarter. Importantly, the new site provides customers with an enhanced online shopping experience, a larger product selection that enables us to more fully engage on our site. Customer engagement continues to increase year-over-year across all our social media channels. During the quarter, our Facebook fans grew 55% to over 16 million. Our Instagram followers increased 109% to over 3 million. Our Twitter followers increased 50% to over 2 million, and our emerging base of Weebo followers has grown 142% to almost 0.5 million. We also continued to make progress on our omni-channel strategy and are very excited of the enhanced experience that we are providing to our customers. We are developing omni-channel capabilities that will enable our customers to seamlessly access our luxury products across all our retail channels. These capabilities will provide our customers with a truly best-in-class experience wherever she shops. We look forward to watching our e-commerce business in Canada within the next several months followed by Europe and Japan in calendar 2016. 
Our North American wholesale business remains strong with net sales of approximately -- increased approximately 20% in the quarter. In addition, comparable store sales grew at a greater rate than an increase in our retail stores. The growth was driven by strength in our accessories and footwear categories, in addition to the continued success of our shop-in-shop conversions. We continue to see multiple growth opportunities in our North American region across categories and channels. 
As the overall accessory market continues to grow, we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on this growth in our handbag and small goods business. In addition, women's apparel and footwear continued to perform well, and we see further growth potential as we extend our offering to new categories. We also remain excited about our men's opportunities, which is currently in the early stages of development, and we look forward to providing more insight as our strategy evolves. We are committed to growing our e-commerce business, which we believe can ultimately reach 20% of our North American retail sales. We will also continue to expand our retail footprint with new store openings of store expansions, and we will drive sales in our wholesale channel through shop-in-shop conversions and door penetration. Taken together, we believe that we can continue to generate double-digit sales growth in the North American region. 
Outside of North America, we further expanded our international presence and saw exceptional growth across Europe and the Far East. In Europe, revenue increased 72% to $241 million and comparable store sales grew 21.2%. We opened 14 stores during the quarter and remain on track to open approximately 50 European locations this fiscal 2015. We ended the quarter with 125 stores across Europe and continue to believe that this region can support 200 Michael Kors retail locations in total.  As we stated previously, we plan to launch our e-commerce strategy in Europe in calendar 2016, and we are very excited about the growth potential as we develop this channel. 
The strong momentum in our European wholesale business continued in both the department and specialty stores with revenue growth of 53%, led by our accessory and footwear categories. Comparable store sales in Europe were greater than our retail comp during the quarter. We continue to see great potential in Europe and view the region as an exciting part of our long-term growth strategy, ultimately generating approximately $1.5 billion in revenue. 
Turning to Japan. We saw outstanding performance during the quarter, and we continue making great progress creating a framework to support our ongoing growth in this market. Revenue increased 72% to $16 million, driven by comparable store sales growth of 35.4%. We opened 5 stores during the quarter with 47 locations and believe this market can ultimately have 100 stores. We are pleased to announce last month the planned opening of our new flagship store in Tokyo this fall in the renowned Ginza district. This 7,800-square-foot store will be the first in the world to offer all our categories and collections. We believe this store, in addition to the base in Japan, together with our 5,000 square-foot flagship duplex in Kobe scheduled to open mid-year and our recently opened flagship duplex in Fukuoka, serve to heighten our presence and enhance our brand image in this market. We also look forward to expanding our e-commerce business in Japan and plan to launch the site in calendar 2016. Long-term, we continue to believe that we can achieve revenue of $300 million in this region. 
The remainder of the Far East also experienced strong growth in the third quarter. Comparable store sales at retail stores operated by our licensed partners continue to increase at a double-digit rate, and we are pleased with the traction we are gaining in the Far East. We believe that the increase in tourism was an important contributing factor to our growth, as evidenced by the performance of our airport and duty-free shops in this region.  Looking ahead, we expect this trend to continue, and we are positioned to benefit from the increase in tourists, shoppers in the Far East. 
Our licensed partners operated -- opened 12 new stores in the third quarter, and we now have 128 locations in Greater China, Korea, Southeast Asia and Australia. We continue to see opportunity for 200 locations in the Far East. 
Finally, our travel business continues to perform well, and we believe this is a highly effective way to raise the visibility of Michael Kors luxury brand, given the increased number of tourists traveling the world. We ended the quarter with 79 locations at some of the finest travel destinations in the world, and believe there's potential for approximately 100 travel retail shops globally. 
In summary, we exceeded our overall financial objectives in the third quarter, including the better-than-expected performance in our e-commerce business. We believe that our results demonstrate the strength of the Michael Kors brand and the successful execution of our growth strategies. We remain confident in our long-term outlook and committed to enhancing value for our shareholders. I will now turn the call over to Joe for detailed discussion of our financial results."

We saw strong financial performance in our third quarter and delivered our 13th co",1826,"Thank you, John. Good morning. I will begin with a review of our fiscal 2015 third quarter financial results, followed by our outlook for the fourth quarter and full year.  We saw strong financial performance in our third quarter and delivered our 13th consecutive quarter of revenue growth, earnings growth and positive comp store sales since our IPO in 2011. Total revenue grew 29.9% to $1.3 billion as compared to $1.0 billion last year. We saw a significant foreign currency impact during the quarter on total revenues and comp store sales.  On a constant-currency basis, total revenues grew 32.6%. In North America, revenue increased 22.6%, and on a constant-currency basis, rose 23.1%. In Europe, revenue grew 72.1%, and on a constant-currency basis, increased 86.3%. In Japan, revenue rose 72.1%, and on a constant-currency basis, increased 96.3%. Retail net sales increased 37.0% to $689.4 million as compared to $503.4 million in the third quarter of last year, resulting from the opening of 114 net new stores since the third quarter of last year, e-commerce sales from our recently launched U.S. site and a comp store increase of 8.6%. On a constant-currency basis, retail net sales increased 40.5%, and comp store sales increased 10.6%. 
By region, comp store sales on a constant-currency basis grew 6.8% in North America, 29.8% in Europe and 54.4% in Japan. As John mentioned earlier, comp store sales do not include e-commerce business or the retail stores that were expanded. Given the shift in consumer purchasing to online channels, we believe that the comp store sales, including our e-commerce business, is a more accurate reflection of our performance and the strength of our brand. 
Including e-commerce, comp store sales for North America would have been 380 basis points higher. As John mentioned, our 30 expanded stores typically comped higher than our company average, and therefore, excluding these stores, negatively impact -- impacted our comp store sales results for the quarter by approximately 70 basis points. As we remain focused on building our e-commerce business, we expect sales to continue to migrate from our retail stores to the e-commerce channel and impact our comp performance.  Looking at our stores in e-commerce business combined, we expect sales to continue to grow at a healthy pace in our retail segment. 
Wholesale net sales grew 24.4% to $573.8 million in the third quarter compared to $461.4 [ph] million in the same period last year. On a constant-currency basis, wholesale sales grew 26.4%. The increase was led by the accessories and footwear categories as well as our continued conversion of wholesale doors to shop-in-shops and the expansion of our European operations. 
In our licensing segment, revenue grew 8.6% to $51.5 million for the quarter as compared to $47.4 million last year primarily driven by jewelry as well as winter outerwear and watches. As expected, our revenues in the third quarter were impacted by the transition of our eyewear license and we anticipate a similar impact on the fourth quarter. 
Gross profit grew 29.2% to $800.1 million as compared to $619.5 million last year -- last year's third quarter. Gross margin was 60.9%, ahead of our expectations, versus 61.2% for the same period last year. Total operating expense grew 38.2% to $381.7 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2015 as compared to $276.3 million last year. As a percent of total revenue, total operating expenses increased to 29.0% from 27.3%. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 35.2% to $344.2 million as compared to $254.6 million for the third quarter of last year. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses is primarily due to the higher retail occupancy and salary cost related to new store openings, cost related to corporate management additions as we continue to build the Michael Kors team to support global growth, higher fees related to our new customer call center and the relocation of our principal executive offices, and an increase in advertising and marketing expense primarily offset -- partially offset by lower distribution costs.  As a percent of total revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses were 26.2% compared to 25.2% for the third quarter of last year. 
Depreciation and amortization expense was $37.5 million for the third quarter as compared to $21.7 million last year primarily due to the build-outs of the new retail locations and the expansion of existing locations, new shop-in-shops, and increase in lease rights purchase for our new European stores, investment in our infrastructure to support our growth and accelerated depreciation related to expansion and relocation of retail stores and the renovation of our corporate offices. Depreciation and amortization increased to 2.9% to total revenue during the third quarter compared to 2.1% for the same quarter last year.  As we continue to strategically invest in our business, you should expect to see year-over-year increases in depreciation as a percentage of total revenue going forward. 
As a result of these factors, income from operations came in better than we anticipated at $418.5 million, or 31.8% of total revenue, as compared to $343.2 million, or 33.9% of total revenue in the same period last year. 
In the retail segment, operating margin declined 280 basis points. 240 basis points of the decline was due to an increase in general, corporate and operating cost and higher depreciation and amortization expense related to new stores, lease rights and including accelerated depreciation related to the expansion of retail stores. The remainder was due to a 40 basis point decline in gross margin. 
Wholesale operating margin declined 80 basis points primarily as a result of a 74 basis point decrease in gross profit margin primarily due to higher discounts and allowances. 
Finally, the licensing segment operating margin declined 170 basis points due to an increase in operating expense primarily higher advertising costs and professional fees. We anticipate lower operating margins for the year as the expense will be higher relative to the revenue increases in the licensing segment due to the eyewear license transition. 
Income taxes were $113.3 million in the third quarter as compared to $113.5 million last year. Our effective tax rate loss 27.2% as compared to 33.1% in the same period last year. The decrease in our effective tax rate was primarily due to the settlement of certain instruments in connection with the company's international income tax structure. Net income increased 32.2% to $303.7 million for the third quarter, and diluted earnings per share were $1.48 based upon 205.6 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding. Net income for the third quarter of last year was $229.6 million or $1.11 per diluted share based upon 206.1 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding. 
Turning to the balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, cash and cash equivalents were $949.8 million as compared to $828.3 million at the end of the third quarter last year. There were no outstanding borrowings under our credit facilities in either year. We are pleased to report that we have repurchased approximately 5.1 million shares, totaling $399.9 million under our $1 billion share repurchase program. This action reflects the board and management's confidence in our long-term growth outlook and free cash flow generation, and reinforces our commitment to returning value to our shareholders. 
For the quarter, inventory increased $105.9 million or 24.5% versus last year. Our inventory growth fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter, but we generally expect our inventory increase to outpace sales growth as we open and expand our retail stores, expand replenishment stock, convert shop-in-shops and rollout our e-commerce business. 
Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $125.3 million. These expenditures were related to global retail store expansion and renovation, construction and renovation of shop-in-shops, investment in our distribution facility and enhancement of our information system infrastructure. We opened 36 new stores in the quarter, 17 in North America, 14 in Europe and 5 in Japan, and ended the quarter with 509 retail stores, including concessions.  In addition, we converted 60 department store doors into shop-in-shops. 
Turning to our outlook. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, we expect total revenue to be between $1.05 billion and $1.08 billion, assuming a mid-single digit comp store increase. On a constant-currency basis, we expect a high single digit increase in comp store sales. We expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.89 to $0.92, assuming a tax rate of approximately 30% and 203 million shares outstanding. On a constant-currency basis, we anticipate diluted EPS to be $0.05 to $0.07 higher than the reported number. We expect gross profit margin to be approximately 59.5% and operating margin to be approximately 24.8%. Our consolidated operations are impacted by the relationship between our reporting currency, the U.S. dollar and those of our non-U.S. subsidiaries whose functional currencies are other than the U.S. dollar. We expect the continuance of foreign currency headwinds in our fourth quarter and into fiscal 2016 to impact our consolidated results, and have included the estimated impact in our guidance. 
I would also note that the port congestion on the West Coast continues to post a risk to incoming shipments. While we have not seen a material financial impact thus far, we have experienced an increase in delays, which are resulting in additional air freight cost and other transportation fees. While we have factored these increased expenses into our fourth quarter guidance, there is some risk of additional delays that could result in lower revenues and higher cost than what we have anticipated. 
For the fiscal year 2015, we now expect total revenue to be approximately $4.4 billion, assuming a comp store increase in the low double digits. On a constant-currency basis, we expect comps to be up in the low to mid-teens range. We now expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $4.27 to $4.30. The expected diluted earnings per share range assumes a tax rate of approximately 30% and 205.8 million shares outstanding. For the full year, we expect gross margins of approximately 61.0% and operating margins of approximately 29.0%. Capital expenditures are expected to total approximately $400 million for fiscal year 2015. The majority of these expected expenditures are related to new retail store openings planned for the year with the remainder being used for investments in connection with developing new shop-in-shops, build-out of our corporate offices and distribution centers and enhancing our information system infrastructure. We are on track to open approximately 50 stores in North America, 50 stores in Europe, and 10 stores in Japan, expand approximately 40 retail stores globally in select locations in key cities and convert approximately 700 shop-in-shops. 
In summary, we are very pleased with our strong top and bottom line performance in the third quarter and feel confident that we will deliver on our full year outlook. We will continue to invest strategically in our business to ensure that we maintain our leadership position within the global luxury market and drive shareholder value for the long-term. 
I will now turn the call back to John Idol."

And as you know, we commented a number of times during the script, even in our own retail stores during Q4, calendar Q4, but our Q3, we had double-digit comp store increase in accessories business. So clearly, the brand is resonating with the consumer. The consumers feel great about Michael Kors and our new styling. We introduced a new bag called Greenwich, which is exclusive in our own lifestyle stores, which had excellent sales results. So reflecting back, we feel very good about that. We also feel excellent about our footwear business. We had amazing results in our department store distribution. As you know, we rolled out a lot of shop-in-shops. We are quickly becoming one of the most important footwear brands in all of the -- not only domestic wholesale partners but internationally, shoe shops are going in as well and are seeing the same type of results. So we see the consumer responding incredibly positive way to the brand and the brand continuing to grow. So and when you look at North American growth of over 20% in the quarter, I don't think there's many companies who are putting on that kind of growth in this environment and doing it in the way that we did, which I think was really pristine in terms of how we produced inside the quarter.

Yes, there's a couple of things that are impacting the gross margin. First off, as our international subsidiaries come on and create more of a larger base to the business, that obviously impacts our gross margins. And as retail, in total, becomes a bigger piece of our business, that impacts our gross margins as well. And even though we did have -- we're a little bit more promotional during the third quarter, you could see our margins came up very, very strong. And when you look at this, this even includes FX headwinds as well. So once again, I think, that's just all pointing to the fact that consumer feels really good about our products which is holding yes, we're getting great sellthroughs continuously on most of our products. There are certain products that didn't perform as well for us. When you look at something like the Bucket Bag, which from a fashion standpoint, you have to be a part of, but unfortunately, from a retail standpoint, it's not getting the same type of resonation as we had liked and have ownership have represented. So you have to deal with a more aggressive in these things. But we're a fashion business, and we have to be a leader and Michael has always taken a position, with some great strategies for spring and summer and even in the fall on our leadership role, Michael has really said, we have to excite the customer, that's the business that we're in. And Michael and our design teams are just doing an outstanding job with that. And we're going to get it right, hopefully, most of the time.

Erinn, couple of things. We were impressed by what happened during the quarter because what was interesting is not only with our dollar sales up double-digit but unit in a slightly higher than that. As you know, the large handbags trend has kind of slowed down, and it's more about medium-sized handbags. So for us to achieve our results, given the fact that there could be up to a $50 move-in pricing, just because the way that the consumers responding, and this is globally, not just domestically, and then secondly, you have swing packs or cross bodies, which are a very, very hot fashion category today. And that reflects lower average price point. If you look at those categories and say, given the fact that some of the average in terms of the purchase was down for us to be able to deliver results that would, just outstanding performance. We think we're leaders in both of those. When you look at our Selma or come up on the traveler or some of these bags are in the more medium-sized, and you look at some of our cross body this is, things were market leaders in those database and again led by our Michael and the design team and to have that right for fashion for the third quarter. The watch business did not perform at the same levels for us in our own stores, and Erinn, that issue was one impacted by ourselves. Last year at this time, we have an enormous success with a watch, exclusive watch in our own stores around Watch Hunger Stop. If remember that's when we launch that charity program, which by the way, was hugely successful. We ended up donating a lot of money to the World Food Program, which we're very proud of that in terms of what we're able to raise for them. It was just shocking in terms of performance and how excited they were and the good that we did for people who go hungry today. And as you know, Michael says there's a lot of things we can cure in the world, but one things we can't stop is hunger. And that so much business for us, we were not able generation that total actual department stores performed better than we did in our own stores.

Everything from our continued store opening program to e-commerce, and what that's going to generate for us, to expansion of classifications, women's, footwear and men's wear. And then I might add, the brand is still organically growing very, very nicely. You heard me talk about our Facebook fans being up, our Twitter fans, Instagram. This is customers coming to look for the Michael Kors brand and how she can embrace the lifestyle. We're also extremely pleased, our fragrance business is doing really incredibly well.

So we think our international growth in fragrance also bodes well for us. And the last thing I just want to say is, Asia is starting to really come on. Asia is working. So you've heard me be a little bit more cautious in our previous call about that. Our results in China are really started to catch hold. That's become a sizable business. Our business in Japan is -- you can see the numbers, the attractions there, and we're going to open some amazing flagship stores. Watch out, we're going to be a real competitor in that marketplace. And then Southeast Asia is also performing at very high levels for us. So we see that as a marketplace. If you remember the waterfall, North America will eventually slow, we will talk about that. Europe is going to continue to grow very nicely, and Asia is the next big front for us, we're underdeveloped. And then lastly, men's wear will come on. So same strategy than we talk to you about since the IPO, and I think we're executing and firing on all cylinders on developing that strategy. So thanks very much, Matt."

We are already at depending on certain regions, over 20% of certain people in our penetration with e-commerce with the people, and that's not only here in the U.S., we're seeing very similar types of rates anywhere between 10% and 20% in the U.K., in particular, the balance of Europe is really out there yet. But we're seeing excellent penetration, whilst still achieving comp store growth at the same time, so similar to what you're seeing in our North American business. So you also have to remember that when we open a lifestyle store, those stores are highly profitable for us. And Joe mentioned that before. So even with the comp stores coming down from where they had historically been, we're still incredibly profitable inside of our own stores. And the last thing I just want to say is, from the day we went public, we told everyone that we would open 400 stores. That doesn't change. When you're opening a store and we don't have a store, for example, in Omaha, Nebraska today, we would have a store in Omaha, bit of a marketplace that the customer will enjoy having the Michael Kors product from us. And that's going to generate a lot of revenues, it's going to take a lot of customers happy, and we think that the company's strategy, but will stop at 400, so there won't be any more, and the same thing and certain other markets where we've given guidelines. One marketplace where we do think there's probably only more potential were still analyzing that is possibly Europe. But again, these are stores that are going to service marketplaces where the consumer today can't get Michael Kors. And I'll give you a good example in Europe, in Romania. We intend to opening in the marketplace for that customer, should as in travel quite as frequently as maybe customer who lives in word, or a customer who lives in Spain, et cetera, but there's beautiful locations for us to open in those marketplaces.

Good morning, and welcome to Michael Kors Third Quarter Fiscal 2015 Earnings Call.

Good morning, and welcome to Michael Kors Third Quarter Fiscal 2015 Earnings Call. On this call today is Joe Parsons, our Chief Financial and Chief Operating Officer.
I will begin with an overview of our third quarter performance and provide an update on our long-term growth strategies, then I will turn it over to Joe for a discussion of our financial results and our outlook for the fourth quarter and full year.
Our solid financial results in the third quarter speak to the strength of the Michael Kors brand. We delivered our 35th consecutive quarter of positive comparable store sales growth and drove approximately 30% growth in both retail -- in both revenue and net income with a strong holiday season. During the quarter, we continued to see strong momentum across our operating segments and geographies, led by a double-digit comp sales increase in our accessories category in both retail and wholesale. In North America, sales increased more than 20%, and we believe -- and we delivered solid comp gains on top of significant increases last year. Notably, we saw exceptional performance from our U.S. e-commerce site, which generated a sales increase of 73% as compared to the sales of the previous outsourced site, exceeding our expectations. In addition, sales in both Europe and Japan increased 72% for the quarter.
We are also pleased to report that we repurchased approximately 5 million shares during the quarter, reflecting the confidence we have in our future growth potential and our commitment to enhancing shareholder value. Importantly, we continued to execute on our long-term strategies during the quarter, which are focused on, first, growing our retail presence through our new store openings and store expansions in key locations throughout the world; second, developing a global best-in-class e-commerce strategy with omni-channel capabilities, beginning with the launch of our enhanced, company-owned U.S. e-commerce website in September 2014, followed by the upcoming launch in Canada this year and Europe and Japan in 2016; third, driving increased comparable store sales in our retail locations and our wholesale shop-in-shops by creating great fashion products and a unique in-store experience that embodies the Michael Kors luxury brand; fourth, continuing to convert department store doors globally into branded shop-in-shops, creating a jet-set experience within each store; fifth, expanding our business internationally through company-owned subsidiaries and regional partnerships; and sixth, expanding our market share across a number of categories, including women's ready-to-wear footwear, jewelry and men's wear.
Turning to our segment performance for the quarter. We saw exceptional growth in our Retail business, with net sale increasing 37%, driven by 114 new store openings since the third quarter of last year, e-commerce sales from our recently launched U.S. e-commerce site and an 8.6% increase in global comparable store sales, which was led by a double-digit comp growth in our accessories category. We believe that the shopping behavior of certain customers in North America is changing, and they are migrating their purchases to our e-commerce site at a greater rate than we had initially anticipated, which is impacting traffic and comps in our North American retail stores.
Given the shift in buying patterns, we believe the comparable store sales, including our e-commerce business, is a more accurate reflection of our performance and the strength of our brand. Including e-commerce, comparable store sales for North America would have increased 380 basis points higher. In addition, we expanded 30 highly productive stores this fiscal year and excluded these locations from the comp store base as well. These stores have historically comped at a rate higher than our company average, and we believe that the exclusion of these stores impacted our comparable store sales results by approximately 70 basis points. At the end of the quarter, we operated 509 company-owned retail stores and see potential for 700 stores worldwide long term, not including men's locations. In addition, our licensing partners operated 194 Michael Kors stores in and around the world, bringing our overall presence to 703 locations worldwide.
Momentum in our Wholesale segment continued, with 24% revenue growth, driven by accessories and footwear. During the quarter, we converted an additional 60 wholesale doors into shop-in-shops, globally ending the quarter with approximately 2,030 accessories, footwear, women's wear and men's wear shops worldwide. We are pleased that the new shop-in-shops continue to generate a significant sales lift, contributing to the increased penetration in this channel. We expect to convert approximately 700 department store doors globally across all categories in fiscal 2015.
In our Licensing segment, revenue grew 9%, driven by jewelry as well as winter outerwear and watches. During the quarter, we opened 40 new watch and jewelry shop-in-shops and ended the quarter with 230 shops. We continue to see opportunity for 500 watch and jewelry shops worldwide over the long term, as we expand our offering with our wholesale partners as well as in our own retail stores. Additionally, our fragrance business also performed well in the quarter, as we see continued sales increases of our Sporty, Sexy, Glam fragrance collection.
Turning to our operations by region. In North America, revenue grew 23% to $1 billion, driven by strong performance in our Retail and Wholesale segments, led by our accessories business. We increased our total square footage through store and shop-in-shop expansions, in addition to new store openings. In our North American Retail segment, we delivered strong net sales growth of 30%, driven by 17 new store openings, e-commerce sales and a comparable store sale increase of 6%, led by double-digit comp growth in our accessories category.
We are very excited about the opening of our several flagship location on January 29, which is our largest store to date, spanning 3 retail floors and approximately 21,000 square feet. This flagship stores offers the largest assortment of women's ready-to-wear and shoes globally. That is the first Michael Kors store in North America to provide a complete offering of our men's collection. We will apply the insights we gained from this new store for future expanded locations and for our men's retail business. We operated 337 stores at the end of the quarter and remain on track to open approximately 50 stores in the region during fiscal 2015 and continue to believe there is opportunity for 400 locations in North America, not including potential men's locations.
As I said earlier, our e-commerce launch was highly successful and represents an exciting opportunity for us. E-commerce sales exceeded expectations with growth of 73% in the third quarter as compared to retail e-commerce sales at a previously outsourced site. And this channel now represents 7% of our retail sales in North America. As I mentioned earlier, we believe the migration of customer purchases to online channels impacted our retail store traffic and comp performance in North America. We saw a strong year-over-year increases in e-commerce traffic and conversion during the quarter. Importantly, the new site provides customers with an enhanced online shopping experience, a larger product selection that enables us to more fully engage her on our site.
Customer engagement continues to increase year-over-year across all our social media channels. During the quarter, our Facebook fans grew 55% to over 16 million. Our Instagram followers increased 109% to over 3 million. Our Twitter followers increased 50% to over 2 million, and our emerging base of Weibo followers has grown 142% to almost 0.5 million. We also continued to make progress on our omni-channel strategy and are very excited about the enhanced experience that we are providing to our customers. We are developing omni-channel capabilities that will enable our customers to seamlessly access our luxury products across all our retail channels. These capabilities will provide our customers with a truly best-in-class experience wherever she shops. We look forward to watching our e-commerce business in Canada within the next several months, followed by Europe and Japan in calendar 2016.
Our North American wholesale business remains strong, with net sales of approximately -- increased approximately 20% in the quarter. In addition, comparable store sales grew at a greater rate than the increase in our retail stores. The growth was driven by strength in our accessories and footwear categories, in addition to the continued success of our shop-in-shop conversions. We continue to see multiple growth opportunities in our North American region across categories and channels.
As the overall accessory market continues to grow, we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on this growth in our handbag and small leather goods business. In addition, women's apparel and footwear continued to perform well, and we see further growth potential as we extend our offerings in these categories. We also remain excited about our men's opportunities, which is currently in the early stages of development, and we look forward to providing more insight as our strategy evolves. We are committed to growing our e-commerce business, which we believe can ultimately reach 20% of our North American retail sales. We will also continue to expand our retail footprint with new store openings and store expansions. And we will drive sales in our wholesale channel through shop-in-shop conversions and door penetration. Taken together, we believe that we can continue to generate double-digit sales growth in the North American region.
Outside of North America, we further expanded our international presence and saw exceptional growth across Europe and the Far East. In Europe, revenue increased 72% to $241 million, and comparable store sales grew 21.2%. We opened 14 stores during the quarter and remain on track to open approximately 50 European locations this fiscal 2015. We ended the quarter with 125 stores across Europe and continue to believe that this region can support 200 Michael Kors retail locations in total. As we stated previously, we plan to launch our e-commerce strategy in Europe in calendar 2016, and we are very excited about the growth potential as we develop this channel.
The strong momentum in our European wholesale business continued in both department and specialty stores, with revenue growth of 53%, led by our accessories and footwear categories. Comparable store sales in Europe were greater than our retail comp during the quarter. We continue to see great potential in Europe and view the region as an exciting part of our long-term growth strategy, ultimately generating approximately $1.5 billion in revenue.
Turning to Japan. We saw outstanding performance during the quarter, and we continue making great progress creating a framework to support our ongoing growth in this market. Revenue increased 72% to $16 million, driven by comparable store sales growth of 35.4%. We opened 5 stores during the quarter with 47 locations and believe this market can ultimately have 100 stores. We were pleased to announce last month the planned opening of our new flagship store in Tokyo this fall in the renowned Ginza district. This 7,800-square-foot store will be the first in the world to offer all our categories and collections. We believe this store, in addition to the base in Japan, together with our 5,000-square-foot flagship duplex in Kobe scheduled to open mid-year, and our recently opened flagship duplex in Fukuoka, serve to heighten our presence and enhance our brand image in this market. We also look forward to expanding our e-commerce business in Japan and plan to launch the site in calendar 2016. Long term, we continue to believe that we can achieve revenue of $300 million in this region.
The remainder of the Far East also experienced strong growth in the third quarter. Comparable store sales at retail stores operated by our licensed partners continue to increase at a double-digit rate, and we are pleased with the traction we are gaining in the Far East. We believe that the increase in tourism was an important contributing factor to our growth, as evidenced by the performance of our airport and duty-free shops in this region. Looking ahead, we expect this trend to continue, and we are positioned to benefit from the increase in tourists, shoppers in the Far East.
Our licensed partners operated -- opened 12 new stores in the third quarter, and we now have 128 locations in Greater China, Korea, Southeast Asia and Australia. We continue to see opportunity for 200 locations in the Far East.
Finally, our travel business continues to perform well, and we believe this is a highly effective way to raise the visibility of Michael Kors luxury brand, given the increased number of tourists traveling the world. We ended the quarter with 79 locations at some of the finest travel destinations in the world and believe there is potential for approximately 100 travel retail shops globally.
In summary, we exceeded our overall financial objectives in the third quarter, including the better-than-expected performance in our e-commerce business. We believe that our results demonstrate the strength of the Michael Kors brand and the successful execution of our growth strategies. We remain confident in our long-term outlook and committed to enhancing value for our shareholders.
I will now turn the call over to Joe for a detailed discussion of our financial results."

Good morning. I will begin with a review of our fiscal 2015 third quarter financial results, followed by our outlook for the fourth quarter and full year.
We saw strong financial performance in our third quarter and delivered our 13th consecutive quarter of revenue growth, earnings growth and positive comp store sales since our IPO in 2011. Total revenue grew 29.9% to $1.3 billion as compared to $1.0 billion last year. We saw a significant foreign currency impact during the quarter on total revenues and comp store sales.  On a constant-currency basis, total revenues grew 32.6%. In North America, revenue increased 22.6%, and on a constant-currency basis, rose 23.1%. In Europe, revenue grew 72.1%, and on a constant-currency basis, increased 86.3%. In Japan, revenue rose 72.1%, and on a constant-currency basis, increased 96.3%. Retail net sales increased 37.0% to $689.4 million as compared to $503.4 million in the third quarter of last year, resulting from the opening of 114 net new stores since the third quarter of last year, e-commerce sales from our recently launched U.S. site and a comp store increase of 8.6%. On a constant-currency basis, retail net sales increased 40.5%, and comp store sales increased 10.6%.
By region, comp store sales on a constant-currency basis grew 6.8% in North America, 29.8% in Europe and 54.4% in Japan. As John mentioned earlier, comp store sales do not include e-commerce business or the retail stores that were expanded. Given the shift in consumer purchasing to online channels, we believe that the comp store sales, including our e-commerce business, is a more accurate reflection of our performance and the strength of our brand.
Including e-commerce, comp store sales for North America would have been 380 basis points higher. As John mentioned, our 30 expanded stores typically comped higher than our company average, and therefore, excluding these stores, negatively impacted our comp store sales results for the quarter by approximately 70 basis points. As we remain focused on building our e-commerce business, we expect sales to continue to migrate from our retail stores to the e-commerce channel and impact our comp performance.  Looking at our stores in e-commerce business combined, we expect sales to continue to grow at a healthy pace in our retail segment.
Wholesale net sales grew 24.4% to $573.8 million in the third quarter compared to $461.4 million in the same period last year. On a constant-currency basis, wholesale sales grew 26.4%. The increase was led by the accessories and footwear categories as well as our continued conversion of wholesale doors to shop-in-shops and the expansion of our European operations.
In our Licensing segment, revenue grew 8.6% to $51.5 million for the quarter as compared to $47.4 million last year, primarily driven by jewelry as well as winter outerwear and watches. As expected, our revenues in the third quarter were impacted by the transition of our eyewear license, and we anticipate a similar impact on the fourth quarter.
Gross profit grew 29.2% to $800.1 million as compared to $619.5 million last year's third quarter. Gross margin was 60.9%, ahead of our expectations, versus 61.2% for the same period last year. Total operating expense grew 38.2% to $381.7 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2015 as compared to $276.3 million last year. As a percent of total revenue, total operating expenses increased to 29.0% from 27.3%.
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 35.2% to $344.2 million as compared to $254.6 million for the third quarter of last year. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses is primarily due to the higher retail occupancy and salary costs related to new store openings, costs related to corporate management additions as we continue to build the Michael Kors team to support global growth, higher fees related to our new customer call center and the relocation of our principal executive offices and an increase in advertising and marketing expense, primarily offset -- partially offset by lower distribution costs. As a percent of total revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses were 26.2% compared to 25.2% for the third quarter of last year.
Depreciation and amortization expense was $37.5 million for the third quarter as compared to $21.7 million last year, primarily due to the build-out of new retail locations and the expansion of existing locations, new shop-in-shops and increase in lease rights purchased for our new European stores, investments in our infrastructure to support our growth and accelerated depreciation related to expansion and relocation of retail stores and the renovation of our corporate offices. Depreciation and amortization increased to 2.9% of total revenue during the third quarter compared to 2.1% for the same quarter last year. As we continue to strategically invest in our business, you should expect to see year-over-year increases in depreciation as a percentage of total revenue going forward.
As a result of these factors, income from operations came in better than we anticipated at $418.5 million or 31.8% of total revenue as compared to $343.2 million or 33.9% of total revenue in the same period last year.
In the Retail segment, operating margin declined 280 basis points. 240 basis points of the decline was due to an increase in general, corporate and operating costs and higher depreciation and amortization expense related to new stores, lease rights and including accelerated depreciation related to the expansion of retail stores. The remainder was due to a 40 basis point decline in gross margin.
Wholesale operating margin declined 80 basis points primarily as a result of a 74 basis point decrease in gross profit margin, primarily due to higher discounts and allowances.
Finally, the Licensing segment operating margin declined 170 basis points due to an increase in operating expense, primarily higher advertising costs and professional fees. We anticipate lower operating margins for the year as the expense will be higher relative to the revenue increases in the Licensing segment due to the eyewear license transition.
Income taxes were $113.3 million in the third quarter as compared to $113.5 million last year. Our effective tax rate was 27.2% as compared to 33.1% in the same period last year. The decrease in our effective tax rate was primarily due to the settlement of certain instruments in connection with the company's international income tax structure.
Net income increased 32.2% to $303.7 million for the third quarter, and diluted earnings per share were $1.48 based upon 205.6 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding. Net income for the third quarter of last year was $229.6 million or $1.11 per diluted share based upon 206.1 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding.
Turning to the balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, cash and cash equivalents were $949.8 million as compared to $828.3 million at the end of the third quarter last year. There were no outstanding borrowings under our credit facilities in either year.
We are pleased to report that we have repurchased approximately 5.1 million shares, totaling $399.9 million under our $1 billion share repurchase program. This action reflects the board and management's confidence in our long-term growth outlook and free cash flow generation and reinforces our commitment to returning value to our shareholders.
For the quarter, inventory increased $105.9 million or 24.5% versus last year. Our inventory growth fluctuates from quarter-to-quarter, but we generally expect our inventory increase to outpace sales growth as we open and expand our retail stores, expand replenishment stock, convert shop-in-shops and roll out our e-commerce business.
Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $125.3 million. These expenditures were related to global retail store expansions and renovation, construction and renovation of shop-in-shops, investment on our distribution facility and enhancement of our information system infrastructure.
We opened 36 new stores in the quarter, 17 in North America, 14 in Europe and 5 in Japan, and ended the quarter with 509 retail stores, including concessions. In addition, we converted 60 department store doors into shop-in-shops.
Turning to our outlook. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, we expect total revenue to be between $1.05 billion and $1.08 billion, assuming a mid-single-digit comp store increase. On a constant-currency basis, we expect a high single-digit increase in comp store sales. We expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.89 to $0.92, assuming a tax rate of approximately 30% and 203 million shares outstanding. On a constant-currency basis, we anticipate diluted EPS to be $0.05 to $0.07 higher than the reported number. We expect gross profit margin to be approximately 59.5% and operating margin to be approximately 24.8%.
Our consolidated operations are impacted by the relationship between our reporting currency, the U.S. dollar and those of our non-U.S. subsidiaries whose functional currencies are other than the U.S. dollar. We expect the continuance of foreign currency headwinds in our fourth quarter and into fiscal 2016 to impact our consolidated results and have included the estimated impact in our guidance.
I would also note that the port congestion on the West Coast continues to post a risk to incoming shipments. While we have not seen a material financial impact thus far, we have experienced an increase in delays, which are resulting in additional air freight costs and other transportation fees. While we have factored these increased expenses into our fourth quarter guidance, there is some risk of additional delays that could result in lower revenues and higher costs than what we have anticipated.
For the fiscal year 2015, we now expect total revenue to be approximately $4.4 billion, assuming a comp store increase in the low double digits. On a constant-currency basis, we expect comps to be up in the low to mid-teens range. We now expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $4.27 to $4.30. The expected diluted earnings per share range assumes a tax rate of approximately 30% and 205.8 million shares outstanding. For the full year, we expect gross margins of approximately 61.0% and operating margins of approximately 29.0%. Capital expenditures are expected to total approximately $400 million for fiscal year 2015. The majority of these expected expenditures are related to new retail store openings planned for the year, with the remainder being used for investments in connection with developing new shop-in-shops, build-out of our corporate offices and distribution centers and enhancing our information system infrastructure.
We are on track to open approximately 50 stores in North America, 50 stores in Europe and 10 stores in Japan, expand approximately 40 retail stores globally in select locations in key cities and convert approximately 700 shop-in-shops.
In summary, we are very pleased with our strong top and bottom line performance in the third quarter and feel confident that we will deliver on our full year outlook. We will continue to invest strategically in our business to ensure that we maintain our leadership position within the global luxury market and drive shareholder value for the long term.
I will now turn the call back to John Idol."

So clearly, the brand is resonating with the consumer. The consumers feel great about Michael Kors and our new styling. We introduced a new bag called Greenwich, which is exclusive in our own lifestyle stores, which had excellent sales results. So reflecting back, we feel very good about that. We also feel excellent about our footwear business. We had amazing results in our department store distribution. As you know, we rolled out a lot of shop-in-shops. We are quickly becoming one of the most important footwear brands in all of the -- not only domestic wholesale partners but internationally, shoe shops are going in as well and seeing the same type of results. So we see the consumer responding in an incredibly positive way to the brand and the brand continuing to grow. So -- and when you look at North American growth of over 20% in the quarter, I don't think there's many companies who are putting on that kind of growth in this environment and doing it in the way that we did, which I think was really pristine in terms of how we produced inside the quarter.

There's a couple of things that are impacting the gross margin. First off, as our international subsidiaries come on and create more of a larger base to the business, that obviously impacts our gross margins. And as retail, in total, becomes a bigger piece of our business, that impacts our gross margins as well. And even though we did have a little -- we were a little bit more promotional during the third quarter, you can see our margins still came out very, very strong. And when you look at this, this even includes the FX headwinds as well. So once again, I think that's just all pointing to the fact that consumer feels really good about our products, she's voting yes. We're getting great sell-throughs continuously on most of our products. There are certain products that didn't perform as well for us. You look at something like the bucket bag, which, from a fashion standpoint, you have to be a part of, but unfortunately, from a retail standpoint, is not getting the same type of resonation as we had liked and our ownership had represented. So you have to deal a little bit more aggressive when those things don't work. But we're in a fashion business, and we have to be a leader. And Michael has always taken that position, with some great strategies for spring and summer and even in the fall on our leadership role. Michael has really said, we have to excite the customer, that's the business that we're in. And Michael and our design teams are just doing an outstanding job with that. And we're going to get it right, hopefully, most of the time. But every now and then you're going to get it wrong.

And we really didn't see any tremendous acceleration from ourselves promotionally in that category. Now that being said, you take something like boots, which did not -- I think the industry, in general, had a rugged time. So yes, we were more aggressive in that category to clear that inventory. So I think you have to kind of take it to perspective. We look at our comp store performance in our department store channel. And as we said in our prepared remarks, that actually was much stronger for us than it was even in our own stores.

First of all, good morning and thank you for your comments on the quarter. Erinn, a couple of things. We're very impressed by what happened during the quarter because what was interesting is our -- not only with our dollar sales up double digit, but our units are up, even slightly higher than that. As you know, the large handbag trend has kind of slowed down, and it's more about medium-sized handbag stakes. So for us to achieve our results, given the fact that there could be up to a $50 move in pricing, just because the way that the consumer is responding. And this is globally, this is not just domestically. And then secondly, you have swingpacks or crossbodies -- I'm sorry, crossbodies, which are a very, very hot fashion category today. And that reflects the lower average price points. We look at those categories and think, given the fact that some of the average in terms of the purchase was down, for us to be able to deliver the results, but we did, we just had outstanding performance. And again, we think we're leaders in both of those. When you look at our Selma or Hamilton Traveler or some of these bags that are in the more medium-sized, and then you look at some of our crossbody businesses, we think we were market leaders in those categories. And again, led by Michael and the design team, they may have it right for fashion for the third quarter. The watch business did not perform at the same levels for us in our own stores. And Erinn, that issue was one impacted by ourselves. Last year, at this time, we had an enormous success with a watch, exclusive watch, in our own stores around Watch Hunger Stop. If you remember, that's when we launched the charity program, which, by the way, was hugely successful. And we ended up donating a lot of money to the World Food Program, which I'm very proud of that in terms of what we were able to raise for them. It was just shocking in terms of performance and how excited they were and the good that we did for people who are -- go hungry today. And as you know, Michael says there's a lot of things we can cure in the world, but one thing we can't stop in life is hunger. And that watch did so much business for us last year. We were not able to anniversary that. So actually, department stores performed better than we did in our own stores. And that was one of the drags in our comp store performance, was how exciting and the performance we generated off of that watch for last holiday season."

But what I will tell you is that, again, we're anticipating that when we report our fourth quarter, you're going to see a significant number that will belong to this comp for e-commerce. And we see her shifting and shifting dramatically. One of the other things that happened in e-commerce, and I know some people are counting style on the website and what-not, you need to be careful because last year, Neiman Marcus did not have the size assortments that we have today. We have huge increases in assortments on our online, which we know is driving the customer there. We also have effected free shipping at all times basically on the sites, which also is driving a lot of people to perfectly purchase from the site. It's just easier and more convenient. So bigger assortments, convenience in terms of the way that we're offering shipping and the service is all going to, we think, continue to drive more business to e-commerce, and that will impact our comp store reporting."

What we want to make sure is that we have an ecosystem that our customer will believe in and think is a viable addition to, not only their fashion wardrobe, but also to how they live their life. We think luxury, and you've heard me talk about this before, is not just about the products, it's about a lifestyle. And Michael said this a number of times, it's how you feel, it's the way that you look, it's the way that you express yourself. And we think that technology is obviously going to continue to play a part in that, and we will be a part of that as well."

Obviously, we are studying those numbers, and we'll give you further visibility on that when we report in our fourth quarter. You've heard me say at the end of the closing comments that even with FX, we believe that we will continue to have double-digit revenue and double-digit earnings growth. So we were implying to -- we are not exactly in at this point. Obviously, that is going to be impacted by FX from where it was before. But we think we have a tremendous amount of initiatives. Everything from our continued store opening program to the e-commerce and what that's going to generate for us, to the expansion of classifications, women's, footwear and men's wear. And then I might add, the brand is still organically growing very, very nicely. You heard me talk about our Facebook fans being up, our Twitter fans, Instagram. This is customers coming to look for the Michael Kors brand and how she can embrace the lifestyle. We're also extremely pleased, our fragrance business is doing really incredibly well. We were one of the top performers in fragrance during the holiday season in the U.S. We're seeing similar types of results happening in Europe. And as a matter of fact, I expect mundane with 150 people from Estée Lauder, who are really driving his business in Europe, et cetera. So we think our international growth in fragrance also bodes well for us. And the last thing I just want to say is, Asia is starting to really come on. Asia is working. So you've heard me be a little bit more cautious in our previous calls about that. Our results in China are really starting to catch hold. That's becoming a sizable business. Our business in Japan is -- you can see the numbers, the tractions there, and we're going to open some amazing flagship stores. So watch out, we're going to be a real competitor in that marketplace. And then Southeast Asia is also performing at very high levels for us. So we see that as a marketplace. If you remember the waterfall, North America will eventually slow, we will talk about that. Europe is going to continue to grow very nicely, and Asia is the next big front for us, though underdeveloped. And then lastly, men's wear will come on. So same strategy that we talked to you about since the IPO, and I think we're executing and firing on all cylinders on developing that strategy. So thanks very much, Matt."

Paul, a couple of things. Number one, I want to add that not only is the shift in e-commerce happening more rapidly than we had anticipated in our own stores, but I'm sure you all are hearing the same thing from our department store partners. We are already at, depending on certain regions, over 20% of certain people in our penetration with e-commerce with people. And that's not only here in the U.S. We're seeing very similar types of rates anywhere between 10% and 20% in the U.K., in particular. The balance of Europe is really not there yet. But we're seeing excellent penetration whilst still achieving comp store growth at the same time, so similar to what you're seeing in our North American business. So you also have to remember that when we open a lifestyle store, those stores are highly profitable for us. And Joe mentioned that before. So even with the comp stores coming down from where they had historically been, we're still incredibly profitable inside of our own stores. And the last thing I just want to say is, from the day we went public, we told everyone that we would open 400 stores. That doesn't change. When you're opening a store, and we don't have a store, for example, in Omaha, Nebraska, today, we want to have a store in Omaha, Nebraska. We pick up the great marketplace that the customer will enjoy having the Michael Kors product from us. And that's going to generate a lot of revenues. It's going to make a lot of customers happy. And we think that's the continuous strategy. But we will stop at 400. So there won't be any more, and the same thing in certain other marketplaces where we've given some guidelines. But one marketplace where we do think there's probably a little more potential, and we're still analyzing that, is possibly Europe. But again, these are stores that are going to service marketplaces where the consumer today can't get Michael Kors. And I'll give you a good example of that. In Europe, in Romania, we intend an opening in that marketplace where that customer, she doesn't travel quite as frequently as maybe a customer who lives in France or a customer who lives in Spain, et cetera, but there's beautiful locations for us to open in those marketplaces. And we think that just adds more dynamic engagement with our customer. So thank you very much, Paul."

Good morning, and welcome to Michael Kors Third Quarter Fiscal 2015 Earnings Call. On this call today is Joe Parsons, our Chief Financial and Chief Operating Officer.
I will begin with an overview of our third quarter performance and provide an update on our long-term growth strategies, then I will turn it over to Joe for a discussion of our financial results and our outlook for the fourth quarter and full year.
Our solid financial results in the third quarter speak to the strength of the Michael Kors brand. We delivered our 35th consecutive quarter of positive comparable store sales growth and drove approximately 30% growth in both retail -- in both revenue and net income with a strong holiday season. During the quarter, we continued to see strong momentum across our operating segments and geographies, led by a double-digit comp sales increase in our accessories category in both retail and wholesale. In North America, sales increased more than 20%, and we believe -- and we delivered solid comp gains on top of significant increases last year. Notably, we saw exceptional performance from our U.S. e-commerce site, which generated a sales increase of 73% as compared to the sales of the previous outsourced site, exceeding our expectations. In addition, sales in both Europe and Japan increased 72% for the quarter.
We are also pleased to report that we repurchased approximately 5 million shares during the quarter, reflecting the confidence we have in our future growth potential and our commitment to enhancing shareholder value. Importantly, we continued to execute on our long-term strategies during the quarter, which are focused on, first, growing our retail presence through our new store openings and store expansions in key locations throughout the world; second, developing a global best-in-class e-commerce strategy with omni-channel capabilities, beginning with the launch of our enhanced, company-owned U.S. e-commerce website in September 2014, followed by the upcoming launch in Canada this year and Europe and Japan in 2016; third, driving increased comparable store sales in our retail locations and our wholesale shop-in-shops by creating great fashion products and a unique in-store experience that embodies the Michael Kors luxury brand; fourth, continuing to convert department store doors globally into branded shop-in-shops, creating a jet-set experience within each store; fifth, expanding our business internationally through company-owned subsidiaries and regional partnerships; and sixth, expanding our market share across a number of categories, including women's ready-to-wear footwear, jewelry and men's wear.
Turning to our segment performance for the quarter. We saw exceptional growth in our Retail business, with net sale increasing 37%, driven by 114 new store openings since the third quarter of last year, e-commerce sales from our recently launched U.S. e-commerce site and an 8.6% increase in global comparable store sales, which was led by a double-digit comp growth in our accessories category. We believe that the shopping behavior of certain customers in North America is changing, and they are migrating their purchases to our e-commerce site at a greater rate than we had initially anticipated, which is impacting traffic and comps in our North American retail stores.
Given the shift in buying patterns, we believe the comparable store sales, including our e-commerce business, is a more accurate reflection of our performance and the strength of our brand. Including e-commerce, comparable store sales for North America would have increased 380 basis points higher. In addition, we expanded 30 highly productive stores this fiscal year and excluded these locations from the comp store base as well. These stores have historically comped at a rate higher than our company average, and we believe that the exclusion of these stores impacted our comparable store sales results by approximately 70 basis points. At the end of the quarter, we operated 509 company-owned retail stores and see potential for 700 stores worldwide long term, not including men's locations. In addition, our licensing partners operated 194 Michael Kors stores around the world, bringing our overall presence to 703 locations worldwide.
Momentum in our Wholesale segment continued, with 24% revenue growth, driven by accessories and footwear. During the quarter, we converted an additional 60 wholesale doors into shop-in-shops, globally ending the quarter with approximately 2,030 accessories, footwear, women's wear and men's wear shops worldwide. We are pleased that the new shop-in-shops continue to generate a significant sales lift, contributing to the increased penetration in this channel. We expect to convert approximately 700 department store doors globally across all categories in fiscal 2015.
In our Licensing segment, revenue grew 9%, driven by jewelry as well as winter outerwear and watches. During the quarter, we opened 40 new watch and jewelry shop-in-shops and ended the quarter with 230 shops. We continue to see opportunity for 500 watch and jewelry shops worldwide over the long term, as we expand our offering with our wholesale partners as well as in our own retail stores. Additionally, our fragrance business also performed well in the quarter, as we see continued sales increases of our Sporty, Sexy, Glam fragrance collection.
Turning to our operations by region. In North America, revenue grew 23% to $1 billion, driven by strong performance in our Retail and Wholesale segments, led by our accessories business. We increased our total square footage through store and shop-in-shop expansions, in addition to new store openings. In our North American Retail segment, we delivered strong net sales growth of 30%, driven by 17 new store openings, e-commerce sales and a comparable store sale increase of 6%, led by double-digit comp growth in our accessories category.
We are very excited about the opening of our solo flagship location on January 29, which is our largest store to date, spanning 3 retail floors and approximately 21,000 square feet. This flagship stores offers the largest assortment of women's ready-to-wear and shoes globally and is the first Michael Kors store in North America to provide a complete offering of our men's collection. We will apply the insights we gained from this new store for future expanded locations and for our men's retail business. We operated 337 stores at the end of the quarter and remain on track to open approximately 50 stores in the region during fiscal 2015 and continue to believe there is opportunity for 400 locations in North America, not including potential men's locations.
As I said earlier, our e-commerce launch was highly successful and represents an exciting opportunity for us. E-commerce sales exceeded expectations with growth of 73% in the third quarter as compared to retail e-commerce sales at a previously outsourced site. And this channel now represents 7% of our retail sales in North America. As I mentioned earlier, we believe the migration of customer purchases to online channels impacted our retail store traffic and comp performance in North America. We saw a strong year-over-year increases in e-commerce traffic and conversion during the quarter. Importantly, the new site provides customers with an enhanced online shopping experience, a larger product selection that enables us to more fully engage her on our site.
Customer engagement continues to increase year-over-year across all our social media channels. During the quarter, our Facebook fans grew 55% to over 16 million. Our Instagram followers increased 109% to over 3 million. Our Twitter followers increased 50% to over 2 million, and our emerging base of Weibo followers has grown 142% to almost 0.5 million. We also continued to make progress on our omni-channel strategy and are very excited about the enhanced experience that we are providing to our customers. We are developing omni-channel capabilities that will enable our customers to seamlessly access our luxury products across all our retail channels. These capabilities will provide our customers with a truly best-in-class experience wherever she shops. We look forward to watching our e-commerce business in Canada within the next several months, followed by Europe and Japan in calendar 2016.
Our North American wholesale business remains strong, with net sales of approximately -- increase of approximately 20% in the quarter. In addition, comparable store sales grew at a greater rate than the increase in our retail stores. The growth was driven by strength in our accessories and footwear categories, in addition to the continued success of our shop-in-shop conversions. We continue to see multiple growth opportunities in our North American region across categories and channels.
As the overall accessory market continues to grow, we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on this growth in our handbag and small leather goods business. In addition, women's apparel and footwear continued to perform well, and we see further growth potential as we extend our offerings in these categories. We also remain excited about our men's opportunities, which is currently in the early stages of development, and we look forward to providing more insight as our strategy evolves. We are committed to growing our e-commerce business, which we believe can ultimately reach 20% of our North American retail sales. We will also continue to expand our retail footprint with new store openings and store expansions. And we will drive sales in our wholesale channel through shop-in-shop conversions and door penetration. Taken together, we believe that we can continue to generate double-digit sales growth in the North American region.
Outside of North America, we further expanded our international presence and saw exceptional growth across Europe and the Far East. In Europe, revenue increased 72% to $241 million, and comparable store sales grew 21.2%. We opened 14 stores during the quarter and remain on track to open approximately 50 European locations this fiscal 2015. We ended the quarter with 125 stores across Europe and continue to believe that this region can support 200 Michael Kors retail locations in total. As we stated previously, we plan to launch our e-commerce strategy in Europe in calendar 2016, and we are very excited about the growth potential as we develop this channel.
The strong momentum in our European wholesale business continued in both department and specialty stores, with revenue growth of 53%, led by our accessories and footwear categories. Comparable store sales in Europe were greater than our retail comp during the quarter. We continue to see great potential in Europe and view the region as an exciting part of our long-term growth strategy, ultimately generating approximately $1.5 billion in revenue.
Turning to Japan. We saw outstanding performance during the quarter, and we continue making great progress creating a framework to support our ongoing growth in this market. Revenue increased 72% to $16 million, driven by comparable store sales growth of 35.4%. We opened 5 stores during the quarter with 47 locations and believe this market can ultimately have 100 stores. We were pleased to announce last month the planned opening of our new flagship store in Tokyo this fall in the renowned Ginza district. This 7,800-square-foot store will be the first in the world to offer all our categories and collections. We believe this store, in addition to the base in Japan, together with our 5,000-square-foot flagship duplex in Kobe scheduled to open mid-year, and our recently opened flagship duplex in Fukuoka, serve to heighten our presence and enhance our brand image in this market. We also look forward to expanding our e-commerce business in Japan and plan to launch the site in calendar 2016. Long term, we continue to believe that we can achieve revenue of $300 million in this region.
The remainder of the Far East also experienced strong growth in the third quarter. Comparable store sales at retail stores operated by our licensed partners continue to increase at a double-digit rate, and we are pleased with the traction we are gaining in the Far East. We believe that the increase in tourism was an important contributing factor to our growth, as evidenced by the performance of our airport and duty-free shops in this region. Looking ahead, we expect this trend to continue, and we are positioned to benefit from the increase in tourist shoppers in the Far East.
Our licensed partners operated -- opened 12 new stores in the third quarter, and we now have 128 locations in Greater China, Korea, Southeast Asia and Australia. We continue to see opportunity for 200 locations in the Far East.
Finally, our travel business continues to perform well, and we believe this is a highly effective way to raise the visibility of Michael Kors luxury brand, given the increased number of tourists traveling the world. We ended the quarter with 79 locations at some of the finest travel destinations in the world and believe there is potential for approximately 100 travel retail shops globally.
In summary, we exceeded our overall financial objectives in the third quarter, including the better-than-expected performance in our e-commerce business. We believe that our results demonstrate the strength of the Michael Kors brand and the successful execution of our growth strategies. We remain confident in our long-term outlook and committed to enhancing value for our shareholders.
I will now turn the call over to Joe for a detailed discussion of our financial results."

I will begin with a review of our fiscal 2015 third quarter financial results, followed by our outlook for the fourth quarter and full year.We saw strong financial performance in our third quarter and delivered our 13th co",1819,"Thank you, John. Good morning. I will begin with a review of our fiscal 2015 third quarter financial results, followed by our outlook for the fourth quarter and full year.
We saw strong financial performance in our third quarter and delivered our 13th consecutive quarter of revenue growth, earnings growth and positive comp store sales since our IPO in 2011. Total revenue grew 29.9% to $1.3 billion as compared to $1.0 billion last year. We saw a significant foreign currency impact during the quarter on total revenues and comp store sales.  On a constant-currency basis, total revenues grew 32.6%. In North America, revenue increased 22.6%, and on a constant-currency basis, rose 23.1%. In Europe, revenue grew 72.1%, and on a constant-currency basis, increased 86.3%. In Japan, revenue rose 72.1%, and on a constant-currency basis, increased 96.3%. Retail net sales increased 37.0% to $689.4 million as compared to $503.4 million in the third quarter of last year, resulting from the opening of 114 net new stores since the third quarter of last year, e-commerce sales from our recently launched U.S. site and a comp store increase of 8.6%. On a constant-currency basis, retail net sales increased 40.5%, and comp store sales increased 10.6%.
By region, comp store sales on a constant-currency basis grew 6.8% in North America, 29.8% in Europe and 54.4% in Japan. As John mentioned earlier, comp store sales do not include e-commerce business or the retail stores that were expanded. Given the shift in consumer purchasing to online channels, we believe that the comp store sales, including our e-commerce business, is a more accurate reflection of our performance and the strength of our brand.
Including e-commerce, comp store sales for North America would have been 380 basis points higher. As John mentioned, our 30 expanded stores typically comped higher than our company average, and therefore, excluding these stores, negatively impacted our comp store sales results for the quarter by approximately 70 basis points. As we remain focused on building our e-commerce business, we expect sales to continue to migrate from our retail stores to the e-commerce channel and impact our comp performance.  Looking at our stores in e-commerce business combined, we expect sales to continue to grow at a healthy pace in our retail segment.
Wholesale net sales grew 24.4% to $573.8 million in the third quarter compared to $461.4 million in the same period last year. On a constant-currency basis, wholesale sales grew 26.4%. The increase was led by the accessories and footwear categories as well as our continued conversion of wholesale doors to shop-in-shops and the expansion of our European operations.
In our Licensing segment, revenue grew 8.6% to $51.5 million for the quarter as compared to $47.4 million last year, primarily driven by jewelry as well as winter outerwear and watches. As expected, our revenues in the third quarter were impacted by the transition of our eyewear license, and we anticipate a similar impact on the fourth quarter.
Gross profit grew 29.2% to $800.1 million as compared to $619.5 million last year's third quarter. Gross margin was 60.9%, ahead of our expectations, versus 61.2% for the same period last year. Total operating expense grew 38.2% to $381.7 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2015 as compared to $276.3 million last year. As a percent of total revenue, total operating expenses increased to 29.0% from 27.3%.
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 35.2% to $344.2 million as compared to $254.6 million for the third quarter of last year. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses is primarily due to the higher retail occupancy and salary costs related to new store openings, costs related to corporate management additions as we continue to build the Michael Kors team to support global growth, higher fees related to our new customer call center and the relocation of our principal executive offices and an increase in advertising and marketing expense, primarily offset -- partially offset by lower distribution costs. As a percent of total revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses were 26.2% compared to 25.2% for the third quarter of last year.
Depreciation and amortization expense was $37.5 million for the third quarter as compared to $21.7 million last year, primarily due to the build-out of new retail locations and the expansion of existing locations, new shop-in-shops and increase in lease rights purchased for our new European stores, investments in our infrastructure to support our growth and accelerated depreciation related to expansion and relocation of retail stores and the renovation of our corporate offices. Depreciation and amortization increased to 2.9% of total revenue during the third quarter compared to 2.1% for the same quarter last year. As we continue to strategically invest in our business, you should expect to see year-over-year increases in depreciation as a percentage of total revenue going forward.
As a result of these factors, income from operations came in better than we anticipated at $418.5 million or 31.8% of total revenue as compared to $343.2 million or 33.9% of total revenue in the same period last year.
In the Retail segment, operating margin declined 280 basis points. 240 basis points of the decline was due to an increase in general, corporate and operating costs and higher depreciation and amortization expense related to new stores, lease rights and including accelerated depreciation related to the expansion of retail stores. The remainder was due to a 40 basis point decline in gross margin.
Wholesale operating margin declined 80 basis points primarily as a result of a 74 basis point decrease in gross profit margin, primarily due to higher discounts and allowances.
Finally, the Licensing segment operating margin declined 170 basis points due to an increase in operating expense, primarily higher advertising costs and professional fees. We anticipate lower operating margins for the year as the expense will be higher relative to the revenue increases in the Licensing segment due to the eyewear license transition.
Income taxes were $113.3 million in the third quarter as compared to $113.5 million last year. Our effective tax rate was 27.2% as compared to 33.1% in the same period last year. The decrease in our effective tax rate was primarily due to the settlement of certain instruments in connection with the company's international income tax structure.
Net income increased 32.2% to $303.7 million for the third quarter, and diluted earnings per share were $1.48 based upon 205.6 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding. Net income for the third quarter of last year was $229.6 million or $1.11 per diluted share based upon 206.1 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding.
Turning to the balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, cash and cash equivalents were $949.8 million as compared to $828.3 million at the end of the third quarter last year. There were no outstanding borrowings under our credit facilities in either year.
We are pleased to report that we have repurchased approximately 5.1 million shares, totaling $399.9 million under our $1 billion share repurchase program. This action reflects the board and management's confidence in our long-term growth outlook and free cash flow generation and reinforces our commitment to returning value to our shareholders.
For the quarter, inventory increased $105.9 million or 24.5% versus last year. Our inventory growth fluctuates from quarter-to-quarter, but we generally expect our inventory increase to outpace sales growth as we open and expand our retail stores, expand replenishment stock, convert shop-in-shops and roll out our e-commerce business.
Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $125.3 million. These expenditures were related to global retail store expansions and renovation, construction and renovation of shop-in-shops, investment on our distribution facility and enhancement of our information system infrastructure.
We opened 36 new stores in the quarter, 17 in North America, 14 in Europe and 5 in Japan, and ended the quarter with 509 retail stores, including concessions. In addition, we converted 60 department store doors into shop-in-shops.
Turning to our outlook. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, we expect total revenue to be between $1.05 billion and $1.08 billion, assuming a mid-single-digit comp store increase. On a constant-currency basis, we expect a high single-digit increase in comp store sales. We expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.89 to $0.92, assuming a tax rate of approximately 30% and 203 million shares outstanding. On a constant-currency basis, we anticipate diluted EPS to be $0.05 to $0.07 higher than the reported number. We expect gross profit margin to be approximately 59.5% and operating margin to be approximately 24.8%.
Our consolidated operations are impacted by the relationship between our reporting currency, the U.S. dollar and those of our non-U.S. subsidiaries whose functional currencies are other than the U.S. dollar. We expect the continuance of foreign currency headwinds in our fourth quarter and into fiscal 2016 to impact our consolidated results and have included the estimated impact in our guidance.
I would also note that the port congestion on the West Coast continues to pose a risk to incoming shipments. While we have not seen a material financial impact thus far, we have experienced an increase in delays, which are resulting in additional air freight costs and other transportation fees. While we have factored these increased expenses into our fourth quarter guidance, there is some risk of additional delays that could result in lower revenues and higher costs than what we have anticipated.
For the fiscal year 2015, we now expect total revenue to be approximately $4.4 billion, assuming a comp store increase in the low double digits. On a constant-currency basis, we expect comps to be up in the low to mid-teens range. We now expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $4.27 to $4.30. The expected diluted earnings per share range assumes a tax rate of approximately 30% and 205.8 million shares outstanding. For the full year, we expect gross margins of approximately 61.0% and operating margins of approximately 29.0%. Capital expenditures are expected to total approximately $400 million for fiscal year 2015. The majority of these expected expenditures are related to new retail store openings planned for the year, with the remainder being used for investments in connection with developing new shop-in-shops, build-out of our corporate offices and distribution centers and enhancing our information system infrastructure.
We are on track to open approximately 50 stores in North America, 50 stores in Europe and 10 stores in Japan, expand approximately 40 retail stores globally in select locations in key cities and convert approximately 700 shop-in-shops.
In summary, we are very pleased with our strong top and bottom line performance in the third quarter and feel confident that we will deliver on our full year outlook. We will continue to invest strategically in our business to ensure that we maintain our leadership position within the global luxury market and drive shareholder value for the long term.
I will now turn the call back to John Idol."

So clearly, the brand is resonating with the consumer. The consumers feel great about Michael Kors and our new styling. We introduced a new bag called Greenwich, which is exclusive in our own lifestyle stores, which had excellent sales results. So reflecting back, we feel very good about that. We also feel excellent about our footwear business. We had amazing results in our department store distribution. As you know, we rolled out a lot of shop-in-shops. We are quickly becoming one of the most important footwear brands in all of the -- not only domestic wholesale partners but internationally, shoe shops are going in as well and seeing the same type of results. So we see the consumer responding in an incredibly positive way to the brand and the brand continuing to grow. So -- and when you look at North American growth of over 20% in the quarter, I don't think there's many companies who are putting on that kind of growth in this environment and doing it in the way that we did, which I think was really pristine in terms of how we produced inside the quarter.

There's a couple of things that are impacting the gross margin. First off, as our international subsidiaries come on and create more of a larger base to the business that obviously impacts our gross margins. And as retail, in total, becomes a bigger piece of our business, that impacts our gross margins as well. And even though we did have a little -- we were a little bit more promotional during the third quarter, you can see our margins still came out very, very strong. And when you look at this, this even includes the FX headwinds as well. So once again, I think that's just all pointing to the fact that consumer feels really good about our products, she's voting yes. We're getting great sell-throughs continuously on most of our products. There are certain products that didn't perform as well for us. You look at something like the bucket bag, which, from a fashion standpoint, you have to be a part of, but unfortunately, from a retail standpoint, is not getting the same type of resonation as we had liked and our ownership had represented. So you have to deal a little bit more aggressive when those things don't work. But we're in a fashion business, and we have to be a leader. And Michael has always taken that position, with some great strategies for spring and summer and even in the fall on our leadership role. Michael has really said we have to excite the customer, that's the business that we're in. And Michael and our design teams are just doing an outstanding job with that. And we're going to get it right, hopefully, most of the time. But every now and then you're going to get it wrong.

We look at those categories and think, given the fact that some of the average in terms of the purchase was down, for us to be able to deliver the results that we did, we just had outstanding performance. And again, we think we're leaders in both of those. When you look at our Selma or Hamilton Traveler or some of these bags that are in the more medium-sized, and then you look at some of our crossbody businesses, we think we were market leaders in those categories. And again, led by Michael and the design team, they had it right for fashion for the third quarter. The watch business did not perform at the same levels for us in our own stores. And Erinn, that issue was one impacted by ourselves. Last year, at this time, we had an enormous success with a watch, exclusive watch, in our own stores around Watch Hunger Stop. If you remember, that's when we launched the charity program, which, by the way, was hugely successful. And we ended up donating a lot of money to the World Food Program, which I'm very proud of that in terms of what we were able to raise for them. It was just shocking in terms of performance and how excited they were and the good that we did for people who are going hungry today. And as you know, Michael says there's a lot of things we can cure in the world, but one thing we can stop in life is hunger. And that watch did so much business for us last year. We were not able to anniversary that. So actually, department stores performed better than we did in our own stores. And that was one of the drags in our comp store performance, was how exciting and the performance we generated off of that watch for last holiday season."

But what I will tell you is that, again, we're anticipating that when we report our fourth quarter, you're going to see a significant number that will belong to this comp for e-commerce. And we see her shifting and shifting dramatically. One of the other things that happened in e-commerce, and I know some people are counting style on the website and what-not, you need to be careful because last year, Neiman Marcus did not have the size assortments that we have today. We have huge increases in assortments on our online, which we know is driving the customer there. We also have effected free shipping at all times basically on the sites, which also is driving a lot of people to, quite frankly, purchase from the site. It's just easier and more convenient. So bigger assortments, convenience in terms of the way that we're offering shipping and the service is all going to, we think, continue to drive more business to e-commerce, and that will impact our comp store reporting."

As the business gets bigger, and you know this, we've talked about it before, there are some normalization in some of the sales. The second thing in the wholesale, again, you're going to have to be careful as you look at this going forward, is as shoes and women's ready-to-wear and, ultimately, men's wear become bigger pieces of the business, that will reduce our gross margin in the North American market, in particular, in just -- they're lower-margin businesses. So will absolutely impact us on a go-forward basis. And we'll give you some flavor around that when we talk to you in our fourth quarter guidance. But I would tell you, overall, we felt really good about the way that the margins came out in the quarter and the way it performed, the niche and the channels and how we managed ourselves through the holiday season."

So we'll probably start talking about that a little bit more going forward in some percentages. The wearables category is something that we are working very diligently on. Fossil announced a few quarters ago, they're in multiple partnerships with different companies, Intel, Google, et cetera. We are obviously, if I might say, the lead on that with Fossil, and we expect to have some announcements toward the marketplace in the next few months about what our strategy is. We will be in wearables, so I will tell you that that is coming from Michael Kors. And we have a whole strategy around it. But what we're going to do is we're not interested in being the first one to rush to the race. What we want to make sure is that we have an ecosystem that our customer really believes in and think is a viable addition to, not only their fashion wardrobe, but also to how they live their life. We think luxury, and you've heard me talk about this before, is not just about products, it's about a lifestyle. And Michael said this a number of times, it's how you feel, it's the way that you look, it's the way that you express yourself.

Obviously, we are studying those numbers, and we'll give you further visibility on that when we report in our fourth quarter. You've heard me say at the end of the closing comments that even with FX, we believe that we will continue to have double-digit revenue and double-digit earnings growth. So we weren't implying to where that exactly is at this point. Obviously, that is going to be impacted by FX from where it was before. But we think we have a tremendous amount of initiatives. Everything from our continued store opening program to the e-commerce and what that's going to generate for us, to the expansion of classifications, women's, footwear and men's wear. And then I might add, the brand is still organically growing very, very nicely. You heard me talk about our Facebook fans being up, our Twitter fans, our Instagram. This is customers coming to look for the Michael Kors brand and how she can embrace the lifestyle. We're also extremely pleased, our fragrance business is doing really incredibly well. We were one of the top performers in fragrance during the holiday season in the U.S. We're seeing similar types of results happening in Europe. And as a matter of fact, I spent Monday with 150 people from Estée Lauder, who are really driving his business in Europe, et cetera. So we think our international growth in fragrance also bodes well for us. And the last thing I just want to say is, Asia is starting to really come on. Asia is working. So you've heard me be a little bit more cautious in our previous calls about that. Our results in China are really starting to catch hold. That's becoming a sizable business. Our business in Japan is -- you can see the numbers, the tractions there, and we're going to open some amazing flagship stores. So watch out, we're going to be a real competitor in that marketplace. And then Southeast Asia is also performing at very high levels for us. So we see that as a marketplace. If you remember the waterfall, North America will eventually slow, we've all talked about that. Europe is going to continue to grow very, very nicely, and Asia is the next big front for us, where we're underdeveloped. And then lastly, men's wear will come on. So same strategy that we talked to you about since the IPO, and I think we're executing and firing on all cylinders on developing that strategy. So thanks very much, Matt."

Paul, a couple of things. Number one, I want to add that not only is the shift in e-commerce happening more rapidly than we had anticipated in our own stores, but I'm sure you all are hearing the same thing from our department store partners. We are already at, depending on certain regions, over 20% of certain people in our penetration with e-commerce with people. And that's not only here in the U.S. We're seeing very similar types of rates anywhere between 10% and 20% in the U.K., in particular. The balance of Europe is really not there yet. But we're seeing excellent penetration whilst still achieving comp store growth at the same time, so similar to what you're seeing in our North American business. So you also have to remember that when we open a lifestyle store, those stores are highly profitable for us. And Joe mentioned that before. So even with the comp stores coming down from where they had historically been, we're still incredibly profitable inside of our own stores. And the last thing I just want to say is, from the day we went public, we told everyone that we would open 400 stores. That doesn't change. When you're opening a store, and we don't have a store, for example, in Omaha, Nebraska, today, we want to have a store in Omaha, Nebraska. We pick up the great marketplace that the customer will enjoy having the Michael Kors product from us. And that's going to generate a lot of revenues. It's going to make a lot of customers happy. And we think that's the continuous strategy. But we will stop at 400. So there won't be any more, and the same thing in certain other marketplaces where we've given some guidelines. But one marketplace where we do think there's probably a little more potential, and we're still analyzing that, is possibly Europe. But again, these are stores that are going to service marketplaces where the consumer today can't get Michael Kors. And I'll give you a good example of that. In Europe, in Romania, we intend on opening in that marketplace where that customer, she doesn't travel quite as frequently as maybe a customer who lives in France or a customer who lives in Spain, et cetera, but there's beautiful locations for us to open in those marketplaces. And we think that just adds more dynamic engagement with our customer. So thank you very much, Paul."

So we believe in investing. We certainly have the balance sheet and the cash flow to do that. And we think that's the right thing to do for our company. So that will impact the operating margin, and Joe will talk about that. We don't think there's going to be leverage in the next couple of years. That's not something actually we're trying to plan for. We think that -- and we had guided all year long, we've been telling people that 200 basis points is what we think is, for this year, the right operating margin decline.

We have a couple of other big stores that are coming on stream that will sit with 6, 7, 8 months without any revenue, so that will impact us. Also, next year, there's going to be an impact from the startup of the European and Japanese e-commerce businesses.

I will begin with a review of the fourth quarter and fiscal year followed by an update on various growth initiatives. I will then turn the call over to Joe for a detailed discussion of our fourth quarter financial results and our outlook for first quarter and full year 2016. 
During the fourth quarter, total revenue grew 18% and EPS increased 15%. Double-digit gains extended across our Retail, Wholesale and Licensing segments. While we were pleased with the continued momentum in our overall business, comparable store sales declined 1.7% on a constant-currency basis. We attribute this primarily to a continuation of weak traffic trends in North America, including a reduction in tourist traffic, a decline in North American watch business as well as a 90 basis point negative impact from shipping delays in our footwear, women's wear and small other goods products associated with the recent West Coast port issues.  Including e-commerce, our global comparable store sales would have been 160 basis points higher for the fourth quarter, and our expanded stores would have added another 40 basis points to our global comp. While we are certainly focused on taking steps to drive improved comparable store sale performance in our retail stores, there continues to be exceptional growth in our digital, e-commerce flagships, our wholesale business and in our international markets demonstrating overall strength of our brand. 
Reflecting on fiscal 2015. I'm pleased to report we delivered top and bottom line growth in excess of 30%, which was in line with our full year outlook. Global comparable store sales for the year increased 11.9% on a constant-currency basis. Including sales from our digital e-commerce flagship, our global comparable store sales would have been 120 basis points higher for the fiscal 2015, and our extended stores would have added another 60 basis points to our global comp. 
During the year, we saw strong growth across all our segments, our geographies and our product lines. Notably, revenue growth in both Europe and Japan exceeded 70%, while revenue in North America, our most developed market, grew more than 20%, demonstrating the continued demand for our luxury brand globally. In fact, the ongoing strength of Michael Kors brand is also illustrated in the growth of followers across social media sites worldwide. In the fourth quarter, on a year-over-year basis, Facebook followers increased 22%, Instagram followers increased 99%, Twitter followers increased 46% and Weibo followers increased 120% as consumers around the globe turn to Michael Kors for lifestyle and fashion inspiration. 
In addition, we made meaningful progress across multiple strategic initiatives as we continue to set the stage for sustainable long-term growth. In fiscal 2015, we successfully launched our global digital e-commerce flagship in the U.S. which continue to exceed our expectation with annual year-over-year sales growth of 63%. We expanded our global retail presence with the addition of 121 stores, including our largest flagship store to date in SoHo, which includes our first ever dedicated men's store ending the year with 728 Michael Kors stores worldwide, including licensed locations. We completed the expansion of 32 highly productive retail locations globally, contributing to top line growth. We increased global comparable store sales in our retail stores and our wholesale shop-in-shops. We continue to further penetrate our wholesale channel with the conversion of 570 wholesale stores to shop-in-shops globally. We expanded our market share in accessories, footwear, ready-to-wear and jewelry. We enhanced our technology infrastructure to support our global digital strategies and operations, and we continue to build a strong distribution center infrastructure worldwide to support our growth initiatives. 
As we look ahead, we remain intently focused on driving the business forward by further building brand awareness, expanding our product offering and growing in each of our regions. Let me discuss some of the key areas that we expect will drive the business this year. We see continued growth in North America in fiscal 2016. Retail momentum will be driven by our digital flagship strategies as well as new store growth with the addition of 30 locations. As you know, today, retail environment is quickly evolving. The lines between brick-and-mortar and online are increasingly become blurred, and brand interaction and commerce happens across all devices and platforms. In order to remain relevant, luxury brands must evolve in response to this channel shift from stores to online. We began our digital journey with the successful launch of our e-commerce flagship in the U.S. in 2014, and we are pleased to announce that we launched our new digital flagship in Canada last month, which not only showcases the widest assortment of our luxury products, but also offers the broadest and deepest brand experience. We continue to enhance functionalities and build an omni-channel strategy that connects our digital flagships with our in-store mobile and social presence, focusing on omni-channel fulfillment and product personalization with the launch of Kors concierge. As we introduced digital devices into our stores, our sales associates will be empowered with the most extensive collection of our luxury products, allowing them to become personal stylists and enabling them to drive customer engagement as well as elevate our customers' jet-set shopping experience. We expect our omni-channel initiatives, combined with retail expansion, to drive double-digit sales growth in our Retail segment in fiscal 2016. 
We anticipate continued strength in our North American wholesale business, and we'll capitalize on the success of our shop-in-shops with the conversion of an additional 500 doors across all categories. We anticipate single-digit growth in this channel in fiscal 2016 as we continue to develop our handbag, ready-to-wear and footwear categories as well as our men's business. In our Licensing segment, we anticipate continued deceleration in watch sales due to what we believe is a cycle shift to our jewelry category, where we expect to see continued strength this year. Our watch category continues to evolve, and we expect to further elevate our offering with the introduction of new collections for the calendar 2016 spring season. These new lines, which will comprise approximately 30% of the assortment, will reflect product innovation focused on new materials and metal treatments. In our fragrance business and our new eyewear collection, we saw strong performance in fiscal 2015, and we expect to see continued momentum in these categories in fiscal 2016. As we further develop our categories, we anticipate mid-single-digit growth in North American Licensing segment this fiscal year. 
In Europe, we expect to open 45 new retail stores and continue to prepare our digital flagship launch next year. On the wholesale side, we plan to expand distribution through shop-in-shops and specialty stores in existing countries as well as new markets. We are well positioned to increase our market share in the handbag category, where, today, we only hold a single-digit market share position. Footwear is quickly becoming an emerging growth story across Europe as we are seeing strong response to our collection across the region. In addition, we expect continued strength in our license categories as we see solid gains in watches, eyewear and jewelry. Although foreign currency rates will continue to be a headwind at this year, we believe our strategic initiatives in Europe will contribute to double-digit revenue growth on a constant-currency basis in fiscal 2016. 
Asia remains a tremendous growth opportunity for the company. We're very excited about the opening of our 5,000-square-foot flagship store in Kobe in April, and the planned opening of our 7,800-square-foot flagship in Ginza later this year. These stores will further heighten our presence in Japan and enhance our luxury brand positioning in this market. We plan to open a total of 10 stores in Japan in fiscal 2016 and drive revenue growth through our compelling luxury product offering and jet-set in-store experience. 
Moving to Korea. We are set to unlock the market opportunity in this region beginning with the transition of our Retail business in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. Our investments this year will center on building the right infrastructure and developing an expense strategy to position this business for long-term growth. 
In Hong Kong, we recently established local distribution where we now are able to provide a greater level of service to select Asian customers, which were previously serviced out of North America, and further capture growth in this region. 
Turning to our regional license business throughout the Far East. We were pleased with the strong performance in China and Southeast Asia, which saw strong double-digit comp growth in fiscal 2015. We believe that more consumers are now recognizing Michael Kors as a fashion leader and our luxury brand is quickly becoming a significant factor in this region. We will capitalize on our accelerating brand awareness in this market and expect to see continued growth this fiscal year with the opening of 40 locations as well as strong comp store sales increases. We believe that our travel retail stores are another effective way to raise brand awareness, and this business continues to perform well. We see opportunity to raise visibility of the Michael Kors brand to the luxury travel customers as we optimize our presence in premier travel destination around world. 
And finally, in our men's business. We are pleased to announce the addition of Marcel Ostwald as Senior Vice President of men's wear design, coming to us from Hugo Boss, where he was Senior Head of Creative Management and Concept Design for Boss Sportswear. We look forward to Marcel bringing his design talent and experience to Michael Kors. Working in collaboration with Michael, Marcel will be responsible for developing the product vision ultimately driving the men's business to global success. 
We have begun to make strides in our men's ready-to-wear and leather goods and have designed our fiscal 2016 marketing campaign to build brand awareness, to increase visibility in print ads, social media and outdoor marketing, all of which will showcase our product and offer a glimpse into the world of the Michael Kors man.  We are very excited to deliver another luxury fashion shopping experience to customers worldwide with the opening of 10 men's retail locations and approximately 90 shop-in-shops globally in fiscal 2016. 
Looking beyond fiscal '16. We see ample opportunity to drive double-digit top line growth through multiple initiatives. First, we will continue to drive our direct-to-consumer presence with the ongoing development of our digital flagship strategy in addition to growing our retail store base. We expect our North American digital flagship to generate strong double-digit gains and plan to expand our global digital presence with the launch of our flagships in Europe and Asia. The investments we're making in our digital strategy will ensure michaelkors.com is the most expensive expression of our luxury fashion brand and will support the growth of this channel, ultimately reaching 20% of our retail sales long-term. 
In addition to our digital growth, we continue to see potential for 700 stores globally, including 400 in North America, 200 in Europe and 100 in Japan, not including the men's stores or the Korea locations. We also see moderate level of comparable store sales growth contributing to our overall growth of our Retail segment, driven by newness across all product categories, enhanced marketing programs and an exceptional jet-set shopping experience all channels and platforms. Second, in our wholesale channel, we see continued momentum through comparable store sales increases and shop-in-shop conversions in North America and Europe. Third, to support our growth objectives across our segments and geographies, we will continue to invest in effective marketing programs, our digital flagships, along with our growing social media presence, will remain instrumental in maintaining our engagement with our customers as well as enabling us to broaden our consumer reach globally. In addition, we will continue to invest in national advertising direct marketing and our direct mail catalogs. Fourth, maintaining a strong assortment of luxury products will also enable us to drive sustainable growth. We expect global demand for our accessories products to remain strong, and we see additional opportunity to further build our footwear and women's ready-to-wear business. In addition, we are very excited about our men's business and continue to believe and view this as a billion dollar global opportunity. In our license product categories, we see exciting developments in wearable technology and believe that we can become a leading brand in connected fashion accessories. We will also increase our penetration in the jewelry, fragrance and eyewear to fully realize those product potentials. And lastly, we see significant opportunity in our international markets as we grow brand awareness, long-term digital flagships and execute our strategic initiatives. We continue to see Europe as a $1.5 billion market, Japan as a $300 million market, and Korea as a $100 million opportunity long-term. In addition, we see strength -- strengthening our presence across Asia through our regional licenses where we are seeing strong demand for Michael Kors products continue to rise. As we capitalize on our top line growth opportunities, begin to leverage strategic investments and continue to use our strong balance sheet to buy back shares, we remain confident that we will deliver double-digit top line and bottom line growth in fiscal 2017. 
I would now like to turn the call over to Joe Parsons to discuss the fourth quarter performance."

I am pleased to report that we continue to see double-digit top and bottom l",2738,"Thank you, John. Good morning. I will begin with a review of our fiscal 2015 fourth quarter financial results, followed by our outlook for the first quarter and full year 2016. 
I am pleased to report that we continue to see double-digit top and bottom line growth during the fourth quarter with strong performance across all of our segments, geographies and product lines. Total revenue grew 17.8% to $1.1 billion as compared to $917.5 million last year. On a constant-currency basis, total revenue grew 23.3%. The U.S. dollar further strengthened during -- since our last call, resulting in larger-than-anticipated impact on our sales. 
By region. In North America, revenue increased 13.7%, and on a constant-currency basis, rose 14.3%. In Europe, revenue grew 33.5%, and on a constant-currency basis, increased 59.5%. In Japan, revenue rose 42.7%, and on a constant-currency basis, increased 65.0%. 
By segment. Retail net sales increased 14.9% to $469.4 million, driven by the opening of 121 net new stores in the fourth quarter last year and 44% growth in our digital e-commerce flagship stores, partially offset by a comp store sales decrease of 5.8%. On a constant-currency basis, retail net sales increased 21.1%, and comp stores sales decreased 1.7%. 
By region. Comp store sales declined 6.7% in North America, declined 5.6% in Europe and grew 12.4% in Japan. On a constant-currency basis, comp store sales declined 5.8% in North America, increased 11.0% in Europe and grew 30.0% in Japan. 
While our North American comp store sales results for the quarter did not meet our expectations, performance was impacted by several factors. First, we saw a continuation of weak mall traffic trends in North America and weaker tourism traffic globally. In particular, we saw fewer tourists traveling to key U.S. cities in the Northeast and Southeast regions as well as fewer Middle Eastern and Russian travelers in Europe. Second, we saw a decline in sales in the watch category, particularly in North America, following many years of sequential growth due to what we believe is a category shift to our jewelry collection. That said, the AUR per jewelry is substantially lower than watches. Third, shipping delays for footwear, ready-to-wear and small leather goods associated with the West Coast port issues notably impacted our comp performance by approximately 90 basis points. Our U.S. digital e-commerce flagship performed exceptionally well with 44% sales growth during the quarter. Our sales on this channel were driven by strong growth in both traffic and conversion and performance was led by our handbags and small leather goods as well as our ready-to-wear and footwear categories. As you know, the e-commerce warehouse experienced severe weather-related damage, which prevented us from shipping goods for approximately 5 weeks. While we took steps to mitigate the impact by shipping goods from stores in other facilities, we believe this incident impacted our digital sales by approximately $7 million. Excluding this impact, e-commerce sales would have added 480 basis points to our North American comp and 380 basis points to our global comp. 
I would also note that we suspended our digital marketing efforts during this period. While we begin marketing once we resume shipping, we expect a residual impact going forward into the first quarter as it will take time to reengage our customers and to return to levels seem to prior to this event. 
Lastly, excluding the expanded our relocated stores from a comp base negatively impacted our global comp sales results by approximately 40 basis points. We opened 17 net new stores in the quarter, 6 in North America, 8 in Europe and 3 in Japan. In addition, we expanded or relocated 2 stores. We ended the year with 526 company-owned retail stores. In addition, our licensing partners operated 202 Michael Kors stores around the world, including 134 stores in the Far East, bringing our overall presence to 728 locations worldwide. 
Wholesale net sales grew 20.4% to $570.4 million for the fourth quarter, reflecting a continued demand for our brand globally. On a constant-currency basis, wholesale revenues increased 25.8%. The momentum was led by accessory categories as well as our continued conversion of wholesale doors to shop-in-shops and the expansion of our European operations. On a global basis, our accessories and footwear business -- businesses comped at a double-digit rate during the quarter, and we saw continued gains in women's ready-to-wear. We converted an additional 103 wholesale stores into shop-in-shops globally ending the year with 2,132 accessories, footwear, women's wear and men's wear shop-in-shops worldwide. 
As John noted earlier, we recently established distribution operations in Hong Kong for certain Asian customers. As a result of this change, approximately $100 million of sales previously recorded in North America wholesale will now be reflected in Asia's wholesale sales. 
In our Licensing segment. Revenue grew 16.5% to $41.3 million for the quarter. The growth was led by our jewelry category as well as eyewear, our North American watch business was softer during the quarter. We opened 31 new watch and jewelry shop-in-shops during the quarter and ended the year with 261 shop-in-shops globally. Gross profit grew 14.8% to $630.8 million. Gross margin was 58.4% versus 59.9% for the same period last year. The 150 basis points decline is attributable to additional markdowns and allowances as well as a 50 basis point foreign currency impact. Total operating expenses grew 23.4% to $374.7 million. As a percent of total revenue, total operating expenses increased to 34.7% from 33.1%. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 20.5% to $336.8 million. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was largely due to the higher retail occupancy and salary costs related to new store openings, cost related to corporate management additions as we continue to build the Michael Kors team to support global growth, higher cost related to our digital strategies, including our new customer call center, an increase in litigation costs and an increase in advertising and marketing expense. As a percent of total revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses were 31.2% compared with 30.5% for the fourth quarter of last year. Depreciation and amortization expense increased 58% to $37.9 million for the fourth quarter, primarily due to the build-out of new retail locations, the expansion of existing locations and our corporate New York offices, including accelerated depreciation relating to these expansions, new shop-in-shops, an increase in lease rights purchased for our new European stores and investments in our distribution and IT infrastructure. As a result of these factors, income from operations was $256.2 million or 23.7% of total revenue as compared to $245.9 million or 26.8% of total revenue in the same period last year. Operating margin for the Retail segment contracted 660 basis points. 380 basis points in the decline was due to an increase in general, corporate operating cost, including cost related to our digital flagship, higher litigation-related cost and higher retail occupancy and salary cost. 120 basis points is attributable to higher depreciation and amortization expenses related to new stores, expanded stores and lease rates. The remainder is due to 165 basis point decline in gross margin primarily due to higher level of markdowns and the impact of currency fluctuations on the cost of goods sold.  Wholesale operating margin decreased 30 basis points due to the 105 basis point decrease in gross profit margin, primarily due to higher discounts and allowances, partially offset by lower selling and distribution expenses. Finally, the Licensing segment operating margin decreased 380 basis points due to an increase in operating expense primarily higher advertising costs. 
Income taxes was $76.1 million in the quarter as compared to $85.0 million last year. Our effective tax rate was 29.4% as compared to 34.6% in the same period last year. The decrease in our effective tax rate was primarily due to the increase in taxable income in certain non-U.S. subsidiaries, which were subject to lower statutory tax rates. Net income increased 13.4% to $182.6 million for the fourth quarter, and diluted earnings per share were $0.90 based upon 203.2 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding. The unfavorable currency impact to EPS was $0.06 per diluted share. Net income for the fourth quarter of last year was $151.0 [ph] million or $0.78 per diluted share based upon 207.0 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding. 
Turning to the balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, cash and cash equivalents were $978.9 million as compared to $971.2 million at the end of last year. There were no outstanding borrowings under our credit facility in either year. 
We continue to use our strong balance sheet and cash flows to repurchase additional shares under our $1 billion share repurchase program. During the quarter, we repurchased 1.4 million shares, totaling $92 million, bringing our total repurchase to 6.8 million shares, totaling $491.9 million for fiscal 2015. We remain confident in our long-term growth outlook in free cash flow generation and are pleased to announce that the Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of an additional $500 million of the company's ordinary shares and has extended the program through May 2017. This increases the initial repurchase authorization to $1.5 billion, of which $1 billion is available to us for future repurchase over the next 2 years.  As we demonstrated this past year, we will continue to use the strength of our balance sheet and future cash flows to repurchase additional shares and drive value for shareholders. 
For the quarter, inventory increased 21.8% versus last year, and was in line with sales growth. As we stated previously, our inventory growth fluctuates from quarter-to-quarter, but we generally expect our inventory increase to outpace sales growth as we further develop our digital flagships, open and expand our retail stores, expand replenishment stocks and convert shop-in-shops. 
Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $73.5 million. These expenditures were related to global retail stores expansions and renovations, corporate office renovation, construction and renovation of shop-in-shops, investment in our distribution facilities and enhancement of our information system infrastructure. 
Turning to our outlook. We expect foreign currency to remain the headwind for fiscal 2016. In addition to the translation impact, we are exposed to transaction risk as our international businesses purchase goods and services in U.S. dollars. While we partially had purchases through forward contracts, many of our favorable contracts will be expiring in the early part of the fiscal year resulting in higher cost of goods. Our largest currency exposures are the euro, Canadian dollar and Japanese yen. Fiscal 2016 will be an investment year centered on infrastructure enhancements and new growth initiatives with the company as we remain focused on our long-term sustainable growth. We expect to see higher SG&A and depreciation expense driven by further development of our global digital flagships and omni-channel capabilities, infrastructure investment in the transition of the Korean business, infrastructure investment in the development of our men's business, occupancy and overhead costs related to our global retail store expansions, the build-out of our European distribution center as well as improvements to our existing distribution network, and continued corporate investment with the addition of key executives, expansion of our IT capabilities as well as additional corporate occupancy cost. While these investments will put near-term pressure on operating margins, particularly in the first quarter, we believe that they are critical in creating the foundation for continued double-digit top and bottom line growth. 
For the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we expect total revenue to be between $930 million and $950 [ph] million. On a constant-currency basis, total revenue is expected to increase in the high single digit range, assuming a $60 [ph] million impact from the change in foreign currency rate. We expect a low double-digit comp store decrease on a reported basis and a mid-single digit decrease in constant currency. Operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue is expected to increase 550 basis points to 600 basis points in the first quarter primarily due to the global investments I described earlier. We expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.74 to $0.78, assuming a tax rate of approximately 29% and 202.5 million shares outstanding. We expect foreign currency to impact net income by approximately $14 million and EPS by approximately $0.07 for the first quarter. We anticipate that revenue growth will accelerate in the second half of the year due to a number of factors on a reported basis. First, we believe that the FX headwinds will diminish during the year. The average euro to U.S. dollar rate last year for the first quarter was 1.37 weakening to 1.13 average in the fourth quarter. Second, we will have a full year effect of operating in the U.S. digital flagship and nearly a full year of the Canadian digital flagship as compared to fiscal 2015 when the U.S. digital flagship was operational for half a year and was affected by the warehouse disruption. Third, we plan to open new stores and shop-in-shops that will provide incremental sales during the year. Fourth, we are planning to add compelling new products to our assortment and create excitement in our marketing plans, which we believe will further drive sales. Finally, we anticipate that the 53rd week to add approximately $40 million of additional sales or approximately $0.03 per share. As a result, for fiscal 2016, we expect total revenue to be between $4.7 billion and $4.8 billion. On a constant-currency basis, total revenue is expected to increase in the low to mid-teens range, assuming a $200 million impact from change in foreign currency rates. We expect flat comp store sales on a reported basis, and a low single digit increase on a constant-currency basis. We believe that comp store sales will continue to be challenged by current trends in mall traffic, and the recent slowdown in tourism in addition to the deceleration in watch sales while we expect digital sales to provide a benefit in the second half of the year. 
Operating expense as a percent of total revenue is expected to increase 110 basis points to 140 basis points for the year due to the global investment I described earlier. We expect the increase in operating expense as a percent of total revenue to moderate in the second half of the year as the rate of spend slows and we begin to anniversary the investments that we made in 2015. We expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $4.40 to $4.50, assuming a tax rate of approximately 29% and 200 million shares outstanding. We expect foreign currency to impact net income by approximately $39 million, and EPS by approximately $0.20 for the year. 
I would note that going forward, we will be reporting comp store sales on a global basis, which better represents management's view of the company as an expanding global businesses. Our focus is on driving top and bottom line growth for the long-term. To that end, in addition to driving comp store sales, we have multiple levers in both the domestic and international markets such as our global digital flagships, expansion of underpenetrated categories such as footwear and men's, square footage expansion and capitalizing in the opportunities in our wholesale and licensing businesses. Overall, we take a global view on our business as we look at our long-term growth potential, focusing on the areas where we see the greatest opportunities. 
Capital expenditures are expected to total approximately $400 million in fiscal 2016 [ph]. The expenditures will focus on: Retail expansion with continuing investment in our digital -- in our global digital strategies; the opening of 85 stores globally as well as the transition and development of our Korean business; we expect 30 new stores in North America, 45 in Europe and 10 stores in Japan. The development of our men's business, the expansion of wholesale business with the conversion of 600 shop-in-shops globally, continued investment in our distribution infrastructure and the information system and the renovation of our New York corporate offices. In summary, we are very pleased with the advances we made on our strategic initiatives in fiscal 2015 despite the challenging macro environment and foreign currency headwinds, and we believe that we have multiple growth opportunities ahead of us. We will continue to strategically invest in our business this year to support our initiative and maintain our leadership position within the global luxury market, ultimately driving double-digit revenue and EPS growth in fiscal 2017. 
I will now turn the call back to John Idol."

I'm wondering if you can just talk about the drivers. Is it a function of easy comparisons or are there specific initiatives that you've got in order to drive better comps in the back half? And if you could just speak to the deleverage expected in SG&A in the first fiscal quarter. It sounds like it's expected to be the most deleveraged of the full year based on your annual guidance? And is that just a function of the June quarter being a lower revenue quarter, and therefore, the deleverage eases beyond that?

On the first, the back half of the year, one of the biggest contributors to that comp number is going to be the fact that we'll be reporting the e-commerce sales fully baked into our numbers. So that will improve in terms of the total. And again, if you look at our comp store sales even in this quarter, when you add back the e-commerce and some of our stores that we have upside and support issue, and on a constant-currency basis, we're basically cost flat in our comp stores. So while we did have difficulty North America, it really isn't as bad as it kind of was reflected when we're not reporting a total number with the comp stores, including our e-commerce business. And then secondly, we do have some what we think are some strategic and exciting initiatives for our fiscal third and fourth quarter. First, we will be launching Kors concierge in the third quarter, which will give all of our, not all but significant, amount of our selling associates technology that they will be able to create some significant up-sell inside our stores, and then secondly, we have a very, very strong program in the third quarter around gifting, which is an area, after doing consumer research, that we are finding our customer customers continuing to clamor for, for Michael Kors, especially in that holiday season. And we think we missed a fair amount of that last year. So we think those initiatives will help to really guide us to a more favorable comp store performance in third and fourth quarter, in particular."

I think we did bake some of that into the guidance, because I think we've reported 200 [ph] million shares for the year. But that being said, we believe, as a management team and as a company, that our stock price is significantly undervalued. We have, I think, the best performance of any company in the global luxury field today. And when we are reporting our earnings, I think it's very, very clean in terms of the way that we are performing, and clearly the marketplace has not responded to our performance. And while we are very concerned about that issue, we think that, that's only going to make it that much more interesting for us to continue to repurchase shares. And I would say, we'll probably do it aggressively because as much as the market continues to undervalue our company, myself and the management team and the board feels that's just the wrong perspective on the very, very successful and strong company that we've built globally. And I might also add that, while we are disappointed that we're not delivering a double-digit bottom line this year, when you really add back constant currency, take this to constant currency, our top line revenue would be about 14% and our bottom line revenue would be about 10%, so we will, once again, deliver a double-digit top line and bottom line, which we have originally forecasted, but unfortunately, the euro, in particular, and the yen deteriorated significantly from late January on. And I would also add one thing to that as well. That deterioration in the euro and the Canadian dollar is where we see the greatest impact to our North American comps. The 2 things that really impacted our North American comps were tourism, which New York City, the business is very difficult, certain parts of the southeast and Las Vegas where we've seen traditional very, very strong European traffic in particular, that affected us. And you can almost tie it right back to when the currency started declining, and of course, the watch sales, which would really did catch us off guard in terms of the amount of decline. So our handbag business is very strong. Our footwear business is excellent. All of our core businesses are quite strong. So then we think that bodes well for the future. And that gives our board and myself and the rest of the management team great confidence that we will use our balance sheet in a very significant way to take advantage of what we think is just an incorrect perception on the stock price."

Let me just start with the environment today. I would say that our wholesale business, I want to start with that because that is a very significant part of our business, and I know that most of the dialogue that we have is around our company-owned domestic stores, but we have a very, very large business in North American wholesale, which -- it continues to perform at very, very strong rates, and we are performing better than our competitors in that channel. And we really don't see that channel as being more promotional than it was the last 3 years, to be quite frank with you. There are few retailers who are doing some additional price matching of one another. But that really hasn't been something that has significantly increased our business or been a driver for the business, at least in terms of our perception. We do believe that certain of our competitors in the accessories business, while they state that they are reducing certain of their sale postures, we see tremendous amount of sale activities in their full-line stores. We see the continued use of flash sales, which we do not do. We see a lot of things to drive customers into the stores, that, as you know, we've taken a postures since we started this company that we wouldn't do. We take our markdowns on products, the same thing that we've been doing since we started the business. So we our, in our own full priced stores, have made the decision that is not a posture that we want to engage in. I do think that it's had some effect on our business, but I think the greater issue is that our handbag business continues to grow at very, very nice rates, and the fact that our footwear business is growing at very, very substantial rate as well. That is somewhat offset by our watch business, which you would have to refer to as a core business, and that business is definitely seeing a decline. In the North American market, we're not seeing that in the European and Asian market. Actually the business is accelerating at very, very nice pace. And we believe that part of that shifted the jewelry category where we, again, our jewelry business is very, very strong. The negative to that is that the transaction in jewelry is significantly lower. It's more than half less than the watch businesses. So we're very attuned to the fact that we're going to have to do something to reengage the customer in that classification. We are the leader of the fashion watch business in the United States and fast approaching that in other parts of the world. So we have an obligation to come up with really exciting compelling products, and we think we've got a pretty good handle on what we're going to do for that in Q4 of our fiscal year. And we also, as we look out to 2016, we see the wearable technology space as the place that we're going to be able to play and compete and offer great excitement for our customer."

On the other side, we see great growth opportunity in Europe. As we stated in the call, we have a single-digit market share in that marketplace, and we know that we could probably get ourselves to at least double-digit market share. So plenty of upside for us there, and some very significant market in terms of size. And then as you know, we're excited about our business in Asia, but we are in clearly early days of developing that marketplace. And many of our competitors can run 30% to 40% of their total business out of that market. So North America is going to grow more slowly, we know that, and we've said that since we went public.

We have seen some minor decline in Q3 in tourism, but we didn't think it's going to be as precipitous as what we saw happen. And kind of in January, things were okay. And then February, March, the business got extremely difficult. The other thing that happened, Randy, after remember, we shut the marketing off on online, and that drives a lot of people in the store and maybe that was the right decision, maybe that was the wrong decision, but we just didn't want to be frustrating the customers, sending out e-mails, sending out all kinds of communication. So those 2 things really impacted the business. And thirdly, the watch sales. Watch sales, again, our handbag business is healthy, our shoe business is healthy, our women's business is healthy, our watch business is not healthy, in North America, outside of North America, it is. And we did see shift in our business to jewelry. So whether that's something that's cyclical, whether that's something that's a trend, whether that's something that's driven around other entries into the category, we're not exactly 100% sure. We're going out and done a lot of consumer research around with the customer still saying, very, very positive things about the brand, and they intend to buy Michael Kors. And interestingly enough, some of that intent is shifting into other categories. One of the things that pop up in our consumer information was eyewear. And we're obviously in a very aggressive mode, we really good feedback from the customer. So I think that again, we have given guidance for Q1, given the fact that we are concerned about the trend that we saw coming out of Q4. And hopefully, that business trend will improve and hopefully, we got some initiatives that are based around some new and exciting product trends starting to happen for us that will help drive that. In terms of product and promotional stores, again we're not doing anything different, we're not doing friends and family, we're not doing taking additional 20 off with a coupon with whatever, we're not giving flash sales, we just don't think that's the right thing for us to do. And quite frankly, our competitors are doing it, and they're it doing on a regular basis and while they all claim that doing it less, they're still doing it. And I think that we're probably a competitive disadvantage, but we'd rather build a quality business with the consumer in terms of what the Michael Kors stands for them to go down the path that I think will be story for long-term because as your our competitors talking about, to doing everything they can to get out of this things, and that's not a conversation that want to be having with you."

And also, regarding the markdowns and allowances, which you have been speaking about for a while now, were there discernible differences between the channels in terms of wholesale versus retail? And is this kind of the evolution as you expand your product breadth and thinking about that. And then I just have a final question on digital."

We're still not the #1 market share in North America. I told you, we don't aspire to be the #1 market share. I would say our market share growth in North America will enhance accessories in particular, we'll grow very slowly on a go-forward basis because we think that the way that you would have to grow the market share additionally, in North America would be very promotionally driven, and we don't want to do that. And we're comfortable with that. So we have very solid steady business, going to grow in a steady basis. And we know the customers responding and saying very positive and several things about the brand in North America as well as outside North America. You feel that the footwear business, we are definitely underpenetrated in terms of market share. This is low, low, low single digits in North America, so it's a huge opportunity for footwear. And I would tell you that in terms of a volume, top line and a business that we feel comfortable, kind of putting our foot on the accelerator is definitely footwear, and we know the customer is saying yes to us really across the entire region here. And as we stated, in Europe, word quite strong as well. So I think that our thought process is, just be steady, keep the brand in the right place. And then in terms of allowances. The channel that had a little higher allowances was our own markdowns was our own freestanding stores. And then that's going to be bit natural, because for us to drive additional business in our own freestanding stores, we have to offer more fashion, we have to be a little newer, a little fresher, we have to take a few more chances, and we've got a couple of things that are really starting to cook for us in terms of new handbag groups. We're starting to see some bags emerge, we look at the new bag called Riley, which you're probably seen in the international ads and that ad is starting to really get some traction. So as we believe the fashion leader in accessible luxury, we've got to get out there and give new products to our customers. You're going see that watches, as I stated earlier, you're going to -- about 30 [ph] [indiscernible] 30% of our entire watch assortment for the spring season, and that's going to be focused on one of our real core strength, which is our mix materials are of them. As you know, are one of the only companies and really do that well, whether it's our are asked to be clear watches, which is really hot right now. And we did it probably focus on that as heavily as we had in the past with metals. So we're going to the shift our mix there. And so I think that's going to help drive our comp store growth. But that will come with a little bit of margin pressure, which I think we've given you guidance on, in particular our freestanding stores."

We believe that luxury companies have to embrace the digital circle as we view it. And we do it as really of 360-degree communication engagement and relationship with the customer. So first, we think as the single most important vision of the Michael Kors company and brand is through our digital flagship. And we also believe that's going to become 20% of our business globally over the next 3 to 5 years. So this is why we're making all this investment. And it's absolutely having some pretty significant impact on our SG&A, corporately and, in particular, in the operating income of our retail business. And what we think that not only do you have to create that experience online, but you have to create that experience in-store. Many people continue to say why do you open stores if digital is going to be so important, well, number one, it's 20%, it's not 100%. Number two, people still will go into a store and shop, but when you can only offer in your own stores, 30% or 40% of your entire assortment, that customer becomes disappointed. And now, with Kors Concierge being rolled out, by the way, it will be probably [indiscernible] full year throughout North America starting October, November in our own stores -- in about 35, 40 stores. And that rollout is about to change. Our sales associates are going to be able to engage the customer as a personal stylist, we think that is very big differentiator from having a sales associate on the floor. We already think our people have amazing training and are really excited to work with our clients. But this is going to the whole different level, they're going to become your personal stylist. And then lastly, omni is really going to change the game for all of us because -- in terms of being able to -- people want things quickly, and they want it they would if you're not going to deliver to them in that manner, then you're absolutely going to go somewhere else and get the experience and service from other retailer. And we want to be best-in-class. We did not want the simplest on this, we view ourselves as behind. And making a very significant effort to move forward on this platform. And hopefully, within the next 18 months, we will be up digitally with e-commerce platforms globally, probably, with the exception of China, and that will be by the way our unified platform inside the company, which we think will be a real advantage for our business as we grow going forward. All right, I'd like to thank everyone for joining us today. And look forward to updating you on our future progress at Michael Kors. Thank you very much."

Good morning, and welcome to Michael Kors' Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2015 Earnings Call.

Good morning, and welcome to Michael Kors' Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2015 Earnings Call. I will begin with a review of the fourth quarter and fiscal year followed by an update on various growth initiatives. I will then turn the call over to Joe for a detailed discussion of our fourth quarter financial results and our outlook for first quarter and full year 2016.  
During the fourth quarter, total revenue grew 18% and EPS increased 15%. Double-digit gains extended across our retail, wholesale and licensing segments. While we were pleased with the continued momentum in our overall business, comparable store sales declined 1.7% on a constant currency basis. We attribute this primarily to a continuation of weak traffic trends in North America, including a reduction in tourist traffic, a decline in North American watch business as well as a 90 basis point negative impact from shipping delays in our footwear, womenswear and small leather goods products associated with the recent West Coast port issues. 
Including e-commerce, our global comparable store sales would have been 160 basis points higher for the fourth quarter and our expanded stores would have added another 40 basis points to our global comp. While we are certainly focused on taking steps to drive improved comparable store sale performance in our retail stores, there continues to be exceptional growth in our digital e-commerce flagships, our wholesale business and in our international markets, demonstrating the overall strength of our brand.  
Reflecting on fiscal 2015. I'm pleased to report we delivered top and bottom line growth in excess of 30%, which was in line with our full year outlook. Global comparable store sales for the year increased 11.9% on a constant currency basis. Including sales from our digital e-commerce flagship, our global comparable store sales would have been 120 basis points higher for the fiscal 2015 and our expanded stores would have added another 60 basis points to our global comp.  
During the year, we saw strong growth across all our segments, our geographies and our product lines. Notably, revenue growth in both Europe and Japan exceeded 70% while revenue in North America, our most developed market, grew more than 20%, demonstrating the continued demand for our luxury brand globally. In fact, the ongoing strength of Michael Kors brand is also illustrated in the growth of followers across social media sites worldwide. In the fourth quarter on a year-over-year basis, Facebook followers increased 22%, Instagram followers increased 99%, Twitter followers increased 46% and Weibo followers increased 120% as consumers around the globe turned to Michael Kors for lifestyle and fashion inspiration.  
In addition, we made meaningful progress across multiple strategic initiatives as we continue to set the stage for sustainable long-term growth. In fiscal 2015, we successfully launched our global digital e-commerce flagship in the U.S., which continued to exceed our expectation with annual year-over-year sales growth of 63%. We expanded our global retail presence with the addition of 121 stores, including our largest flagship store to date in SoHo, which includes our first-ever dedicated men's floor, ending the year with 728 Michael Kors stores worldwide, including licensed locations. We completed the expansion of 32 highly productive retail locations globally, contributing to top line growth. 
We increased global comparable store sales in our retail stores and our wholesale shop-in-shops. We continued to further penetrate our wholesale channel with the conversion of 570 wholesale doors to shop-in-shops globally. We expanded our market share in accessories, footwear, ready-to-wear and jewelry. We enhanced our technology infrastructure to support our global digital strategies and operations. And we continued to build a strong distribution center infrastructure worldwide to support our growth initiatives. As we look ahead, we remain intently focused on driving the business forward by further building brand awareness, expanding our product offering and growing in each of our regions. 
Let me discuss some of the key areas that we expect will drive the business this year. We see continued growth in North America in fiscal 2016. Retail momentum will be driven by our digital flagship strategies as well as new store growth with the addition of 30 locations. As you know today, retail environment is quickly evolving. The lines between brick-and-mortar and online are increasingly become blurred. And brand interaction and commerce happens across all devices and platforms. In order to remain relevant, luxury brands must evolve in response to this channel shift from stores to online. 
We began our digital journey with the successful launch of our e-commerce flagship in the U.S. in 2014. And we are pleased to announce that we launched our new digital flagship in Canada last month, which not only showcases the widest assortment of our luxury products but also offers the broadest and deepest brand experience. We continue to enhance functionalities and build an omni-channel strategy that connects our digital flagships with our in-store, mobile and social presence, focusing on omni-channel fulfillment and product personalization with the launch of Kors Concierge. As we introduced digital devices into our stores, our sales associates will be empowered with the most extensive collection of our luxury products, allowing them to become personal stylists and enabling them to drive customer engagement as well as elevate our customers' jet-set shopping experience. We expect our omni-channel initiatives, combined with retail expansion, to drive double-digit sales growth in our retail segment in fiscal 2016.  
We anticipate continued strength in our North American wholesale business. And we'll capitalize on the success of our shop-in-shops with the conversion of an additional 500 doors across all categories. We anticipate single-digit growth in this channel in fiscal 2016 as we continue to develop our handbag, ready-to-wear and footwear categories as well as our men's business. In our licensing segment, we anticipate continued deceleration in watch sales due to what we believe is a cycle shift to our jewelry category, where we expect to see continued strength this year. Our watch category continues to evolve, and we expect to further elevate our offering with the introduction of new collections for the calendar 2016 spring season. These new lines, which will comprise approximately 30% of the assortment, will reflect product innovation focused on new materials and metal treatments. In our fragrance business and our new eyewear collection, we saw strong performance in fiscal 2015 and we expect to see continued momentum in these categories in fiscal 2016. As we further develop our categories, we anticipate mid-single-digit growth in North American licensing segment this fiscal year.  
In Europe, we expect to open 45 new retail stores and continue to prepare our digital flagship launch next year. On the wholesale side, we plan to expand distribution through shop-in-shops and specialty stores in existing countries as well as new markets. We are well positioned to increase our market share in the handbag category, where today, we only hold a single-digit market share position. Footwear is quickly becoming an emerging growth story across Europe as we are seeing strong response to our collection across the region. In addition, we expect continued strength in our licensed categories as we see solid gains in watches, eyewear and jewelry. Although foreign currency rates will continue to be a headwind this year, we believe our strategic initiatives in Europe will contribute to double-digit revenue growth on a constant currency basis in fiscal 2016.  
Asia remains a tremendous growth opportunity for the company. We're very excited about the opening of our 5,000-square-foot flagship store in Kobe in April and the planned opening of our 7,800-square-foot flagship in Ginza later this year. These stores will further heighten our presence in Japan and enhance our luxury brand positioning in this market. We plan to open a total of 10 stores in Japan in fiscal 2016 and drive revenue growth through our compelling luxury product offering and jet-set in-store experience. Moving to Korea, we are set to unlock the market opportunity in this region beginning with the transition of our retail business in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. Our investments this year will center on building the right infrastructure and developing an expansive strategy to position this business for long-term growth. In Hong Kong, we recently established local distribution, where we now are able to provide a greater level of service to select Asian customers, which were previously serviced out of North America, and further capture growth in this region.  
Turning to our regional licensed business throughout the Far East. We were pleased with the strong performance in China and Southeast Asia, which saw strong double-digit comp growth in fiscal 2015. We believe that more consumers are now recognizing Michael Kors as a fashion leader and our luxury brand is quickly becoming a significant factor in this region. We will capitalize on our accelerating brand awareness in this market and expect to see continued growth this fiscal year with the opening of 40 locations as well as strong comp store sales increases. We believe that our travel retail stores are another effective way to raise brand awareness and this business continues to perform well. We see opportunity to raise visibility of the Michael Kors brand to the luxury travel customers as we optimize our presence in premier travel destination around world.  
And finally, in our men's business, we are pleased to announce the addition of Marcel Ostwald as Senior Vice President of Menswear Design, coming to us from Hugo Boss, where he was Senior Head of Creative Management and Concept Design for BOSS Sportswear. We look forward to Marcel bringing his design talent and experience to Michael Kors. Working in collaboration with Michael, Marcel will be responsible for developing the product vision ultimately driving the men's business to global success.  
We have begun to make strides in our men's ready-to-wear and leather goods and have designed our fiscal 2016 marketing campaign to build brand awareness through increased visibility in print ads, social media and outdoor marketing, all of which will showcase our product and offer a glimpse into the world of the Michael Kors man. We are very excited to deliver another luxury fashion shopping experience to customers worldwide with the opening of 10 men's retail locations and approximately 90 shop-in-shops globally in fiscal 2016.  
Looking beyond fiscal '16. We see ample opportunity to drive double-digit top line growth through multiple initiatives. First, we will continue to drive our direct-to-consumer presence with the ongoing development of our digital flagship strategy in addition to growing our retail store base. We expect our North American digital flagship to generate strong double-digit gains and plan to expand our global digital presence with the launch of our flagships in Europe and Asia. The investments we're making in our digital strategy will ensure michaelkors.com is the most expansive expression of our luxury fashion brand and will support the growth of this channel, ultimately reaching 20% of our retail sales long term. In addition to our digital growth, we continue to see potential for 700 stores globally, including 400 in North America, 200 in Europe and 100 in Japan, not including the men's stores or the Korea locations. We also see moderate level of comparable store sales growth contributing to our overall growth of our retail segment, driven by newness across all product categories, enhanced marketing programs and an exceptional jet-set shopping experience all channels and platforms. 
Second, in our wholesale channel, we see continued momentum through comparable store sales increases and shop-in-shop conversions in North America and Europe. Third, to support our growth objectives across our segments and geographies, we will continue to invest in effective marketing programs. Our digital flagships, along with our growing social media presence, will remain instrumental in maintaining our engagement with our customers as well as enabling us to broaden our consumer reach globally. In addition, we will continue to invest in national advertising, direct marketing and our direct mail catalogs. Fourth, maintaining a strong assortment of luxury products will also enable us to drive sustainable growth. We expect global demand for our accessories products to remain strong and we see additional opportunity to further build our footwear and women's ready-to-wear business. In addition, we are very excited about our men's business and continue to believe and view this as a billion-dollar global opportunity. In our licensed product categories, we see exciting developments in wearable technology and believe that we can become a leading brand in connected fashion accessories. We will also increase our penetration in jewelry, fragrance and eyewear to fully realize those product potentials. 
And lastly, we see significant opportunity in our international markets as we grow brand awareness, launch our digital flagships and execute our strategic initiatives. We continue to see Europe as a $1.5 billion market, Japan as a $300 million market and Korea as $100 million opportunity long term. In addition, we see strength -- strengthening our presence across Asia through our regional licenses, where we are seeing strong demand for Michael Kors products continue to rise. As we capitalize on our top line growth opportunities, begin to leverage strategic investments and continue to use our strong balance sheet to buy back shares, we remain confident that we will deliver double-digit top line and bottom line growth in fiscal 2017.  
I'd now like to turn the call over to Joe Parsons to discuss the fourth quarter performance."

I will begin with a review of our fiscal 2015 fourth quarter financial results, followed by our outlook for the first quarter and full year 2016. I am pleased to report that we continue to see double-digit top and bottom line growth during the fourth quarter with strong performance across all of our segments, geographies and product lines. 
Total revenue grew 17.8% to $1.1 billion as compared to $917.5 million last year. On a constant currency basis, total revenue grew 23.3%. The U.S. dollar further strengthened during -- since our last call, resulting in larger-than-anticipated impact on our sales. By region, in North America, revenue increased 13.7% and on a constant currency basis, rose 14.3%. In Europe, revenue grew 33.5% and on a constant currency basis, increased 59.5%. In Japan, revenue rose 42.7% and on a constant currency basis, increased 65.0%.  
By segment, retail net sales increased 14.9% to $469.4 million, driven by the opening of 121 net new stores since the fourth quarter last year and 44% growth in our digital e-commerce flagship stores, partially offset by a comp store sales decrease of 5.8%. On a constant currency basis, retail net sales increased 21.1% and comp stores sales decreased 1.7%. By region, comp store sales declined 6.7% in North America, declined 5.6% in Europe and grew 12.4% in Japan. On a constant currency basis, comp store sales declined 5.8% in North America, increased 11.0% in Europe and grew 30.0% in Japan.  
While our North American comp store sales results for the quarter did not meet our expectations, performance was impacted by several factors. First, we saw a continuation of weak mall traffic trends in North America and weaker tourism traffic globally. In particular, we saw fewer tourists traveling to key U.S. cities in the Northeast and Southeast regions as well as fewer Middle Eastern and Russian travelers in Europe. Second, we saw a decline in sales in the watch category, particularly in North America, following many years of sequential growth due to what we believe is a category shift to our jewelry collection. That said, the AUR for jewelry is substantially lower than watches. Third, shipping delays for footwear, ready-to-wear and small leather goods associated with the West Coast port issues negatively impacted our comp performance by approximately 90 basis points. 
Our U.S. digital e-commerce flagship performed exceptionally well with 44% sales growth during the quarter. Our sales in this channel were driven by strong growth in both traffic and conversion and performance was led by our handbags and small leather goods as well as our ready-to-wear and footwear categories. As you know, the e-commerce warehouse experienced severe weather-related damage, which prevented us from shipping goods for approximately 5 weeks. While we took steps to mitigate the impact by shipping goods from stores in other facilities, we believe this incident impacted our digital sales by approximately $7 million. Excluding this impact, e-commerce sales would have added 480 basis points to our North American comp and 380 basis points to our global comp. I would also note that we suspended our digital marketing efforts during this period. While we began marketing once we resumed shipping, we expect a residual impact going forward into the first quarter as it will take time to reengage our customers and for trends to return to levels seen to prior to this event. 
Lastly, excluding the expanded or relocated stores from a comp base negatively impacted our global comp sales results by approximately 40 basis points. We opened 17 net new stores in the quarter, 6 in North America, 8 in Europe and 3 in Japan. In addition, we expanded or relocated 2 stores. We ended the year with 526 company-owned retail stores. In addition, our licensing partners operated 202 Michael Kors stores around the world, including 134 stores in the Far East, bringing our overall presence to 728 locations worldwide. 
Wholesale net sales grew 20.4% to $570.4 million for the fourth quarter, reflecting a continued demand for our brand globally. On a constant currency basis, wholesale revenues increased 25.8%. The momentum was led by accessory categories as well as our continued conversion of wholesale doors to shop-in-shops and the expansion of our European operations. On a global basis, our accessories and footwear businesses comped at a double-digit rate during the quarter and we saw continued gains in women's ready-to-wear. We converted an additional 103 wholesale doors into shop-in-shops globally, ending the year with 2,132 accessories, footwear, womenswear and menswear shop-in-shops worldwide. As John noted earlier, we recently established distribution operations in Hong Kong for certain Asian customers. As a result of this change, approximately $100 million of sales previously recorded in North America wholesale will now be reflected in Asia's wholesale sales. In our licensing segment, revenue grew 16.5% to $41.3 million for the quarter. The growth was led by our jewelry category as well as eyewear. Our North American watch business was softer during the quarter. We opened 31 new watch and jewelry shop-in-shops during the quarter and ended the year with 261 shop-in-shops globally. 
Gross profit grew 14.8% to $630.8 million. Gross margin was 58.4% versus 59.9% for the same period last year. The 150 basis point decline is attributable to additional markdowns and allowances as well as a 50 basis point foreign currency impact. Total operating expenses grew 23.4% to $374.7 million. As a percent of total revenue, total operating expenses increased to 34.7% from 33.1%. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 20.5% to $336.8 million. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was largely due to the higher retail occupancy and salary costs related to new store openings; costs related to corporate management additions as we continue to build the Michael Kors team to support global growth; higher costs related to our digital strategies, including our new customer call center; an increase in litigation cost; and an increase in advertising and marketing expense. As a percent of total revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses were 31.2% compared with 30.5% for the fourth quarter of last year. 
Depreciation and amortization expense increased 58% to $37.9 million for the fourth quarter, primarily due to the build-out of new retail locations, the expansion of existing locations and our corporate New York offices, including accelerated depreciation relating to these expansions, new shop-in-shops, an increase in lease rights purchased for our new European stores and investments in our distribution and IT infrastructure. As a result of these factors, income from operations was $256.2 million or 23.7% of total revenue as compared to $245.9 million or 26.8% of total revenue in the same period last year. 
Operating margin for the retail segment contracted 660 basis points. 380 basis points of the decline was due to an increase in general corporate operating costs, including cost related to our digital flagship, higher litigation-related costs and higher retail occupancy and salary costs. 120 basis points is attributable to higher depreciation and amortization expenses related to new stores, expanded stores and lease rights. The remainder is due to 165 basis point decline in gross margin primarily due to higher level of markdowns and the impact of currency fluctuations on the cost of goods sold. Wholesale operating margin decreased 30 basis points due to the 105 basis point decrease in gross profit margin primarily due to higher discounts and allowances, partially offset by lower selling and distribution expenses. Finally, the licensing segment operating margin decreased 380 basis points due to an increase in operating expense, primarily higher advertising costs.  
Income taxes were $76.1 million in the quarter as compared to $85.0 million last year. Our effective tax rate was 29.4% as compared to 34.6% in the same period last year. The decrease in our effective tax rate was primarily due to the increase of taxable income in certain non-U.S. subsidiaries, which were subject to lower statutory tax rates. Net income increased 13.4% to $182.6 million for the fourth quarter and diluted earnings per share were $0.90 based upon 203.2 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding. The unfavorable currency impact to EPS was $0.06 per share. Net income for the fourth quarter of last year was $151.0 million or $0.78 per diluted share based upon 207.0 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding. 
Turning to the balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, cash and cash equivalents were $978.9 million as compared to $971.2 million at the end of last year. There were no outstanding borrowings under our credit facility in either year. We continue to use our strong balance sheet and cash flow to repurchase additional shares under our $1 billion share repurchase program. During the quarter, we repurchased 1.4 million shares, totaling $92 million, bringing our total repurchase to 6.8 million shares, totaling $491.9 million for fiscal 2015. We remain confident in our long-term growth outlook in free cash flow generation and are pleased to announce that the Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of an additional $500 million of the company's ordinary shares and has extended the program through May 2017. This increases the initial repurchase authorization to $1.5 billion, of which $1 billion is available to us for future repurchase over the next 2 years. As we demonstrated this past year, we will continue to use the strength of our balance sheet and future cash flows to repurchase additional shares and drive value for shareholders. 
For the quarter, inventory increased 21.8% versus last year and was in line with sales growth. As we stated previously, our inventory growth fluctuates from quarter-to-quarter, but we generally expect our inventory increase to outpace sales growth as we further develop our digital flagships, open and expand our retail stores, expand replenishment stocks and convert shop-in-shops. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $73.5 million. These expenditures were related to global retail store expansions and renovations, corporate office renovation, construction and renovation of shop-in-shops, investment in our distribution facilities and enhancement of our information system infrastructure.  
Turning to our outlook. We expect foreign currency to remain a headwind for fiscal 2016. In addition to the translation impact, we are exposed to transaction risk as our international businesses purchase goods and services in U.S. dollars. While we partially had purchases through forward contracts, many of our favorable contracts will be expiring in the early part of the fiscal year resulting in higher cost of goods. Our largest currency exposures are the euro, Canadian dollar and Japanese yen. Fiscal 2016 will be an investment year centered on infrastructure enhancements and new growth initiatives with the company as we remain focused on our long-term sustainable growth. We expect to see higher SG&A and depreciation expense driven by further development of our global digital flagships and omni-channel capabilities, infrastructure investment in the transition of our Korean business, infrastructure investment in the development of our men's business, occupancy and overhead costs related to our global retail store expansions, the build-out of our European distribution center as well as improvements to our existing distribution network and continued corporate investment with the addition of key executives, expansion of our IT capabilities as well as additional corporate occupancy costs. While these investments will put near-term pressure on operating margins, particularly in the first quarter, we believe that they are critical in creating the foundation for continued double-digit top and bottom line growth.  
For the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we expect total revenue to be between $930 million and $950 million. On a constant currency basis, total revenue is expected to increase in the high single-digit range, assuming a $60 million impact from the change in foreign currency rates. We expect a low double-digit comp store decrease on a reported basis and a mid-single-digit decrease in constant currency. Operating expense as a percentage of total revenue is expected to increase 550 basis points to 600 basis points in the first quarter primarily due to the global investments I described earlier. We expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.74 to $0.78, assuming a tax rate of approximately 29% and 202.5 million shares outstanding. We expect foreign currency to impact net income by approximately $14 million and EPS by approximately $0.07 for the first quarter. 
We anticipate that revenue growth will accelerate in the second half of the year due to a number of factors on a reported basis. First, we believe that the FX headwinds will diminish during the year. The average euro to U.S. dollar rate last year for the first quarter was 1.37, weakening to 1.13 average in the fourth quarter. Second, we will have a full year effect of operating the U.S. digital flagship and nearly a full year of the Canadian digital flagship as compared to fiscal 2015, when the U.S. digital flagship was operational for 0.5 year and was affected by the warehouse disruption. Third, we plan to open new stores and shop-in-shops that will provide incremental sales during the year. Fourth, we are planning to add compelling new products to our assortment and create excitement in our marketing plans, which we believe will further drive sales. Finally, we anticipate that the 53rd week to add approximately $40 million of additional sales or approximately $0.03 per share. 
As a result, for fiscal 2016, we expect total revenue to be between $4.7 billion and $4.8 billion. On a constant currency basis, total revenue is expected to increase in the low- to mid-teens range, assuming a $200 million impact from the change in foreign currency rates. We expect flat comp store sales on a reported basis, and a low single-digit increase on a constant currency basis. We believe that comp store sales will continue to be challenged by current trends in mall traffic and the recent slowdown in tourism, in addition to the deceleration in watch sales while we expect digital sales to provide a benefit in the second half of the year.  
Operating expense as a percent of total revenue is expected to increase 110 basis points to 140 basis points for the year due to the global investments I described earlier. We expect the increase in operating expense as a percent of total revenue to moderate in the second half of the year as the rate of spend slows and we begin to anniversary the investments that we made in 2015. We expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $4.40 to $4.50, assuming a tax rate of approximately 29% and 200 million shares outstanding. We expect foreign currency to impact net income by approximately $39 million and EPS by approximately $0.20 for the year.  
I would note that going forward, we will be reporting comp store sales on a global basis, which better represents management's view of our company as an expanding global businesses. Our focus is on driving top and bottom line growth for the long term. To that end, in addition to driving comp store sales, we have multiple levers in both the domestic and international markets, such as our global digital flagships, expansion of our underpenetrated categories, such as footwear and men's, square footage expansion and capitalizing in the opportunities in our wholesale and licensing businesses. Overall, we take a global view on our business as we look at our long-term growth potential, focusing on the areas where we see the greatest opportunities. 
Capital expenditures are expected to total approximately $400 million in fiscal 2016. The expenditures will focus on retail expansion with continuing investment in our digital -- in our global digital strategies; the opening of 85 stores globally as well as the transition and development of our Korean business; we expect 30 new stores in North America, 45 in Europe and 10 stores in Japan; the development of our men's business; the expansion of wholesale business with the conversion of 600 shop-in-shops globally; continued investment in our distribution infrastructure and the information system; and the renovation of our New York corporate offices. 
In summary, we were very pleased with the advances we made on our strategic initiatives in fiscal 2015 despite the challenging macro environment and foreign currency headwinds. And we believe that we have multiple growth opportunities ahead of us. We will continue to strategically invest in our business this year to support our initiatives and maintain our leadership position within the global luxury market, ultimately driving double-digit revenue and EPS growth in fiscal 2017.  
I will now turn the call back to John Idol."

I'm wondering if you can just talk about the drivers. Is it a function of easy comparisons? Or are there specific initiatives that you've got in order to drive better comps in the back half? And if you could just speak to the deleverage expected in SG&A in the first fiscal quarter, it sounds like it's expected to be the most deleverage of the full year based on your annual guidance. And is that just a function of the June quarter being a lower revenue quarter, and therefore, the deleverage eases beyond that? If you could just give us some color around that, that would be great."

I'll take the first question, and I'll let Joe handle the second one. On the first, the back half of the year, one of the biggest contributors to that comp number is going to be the fact that we'll be reporting the e-commerce sales fully baked into our numbers. So that will improve in terms of the total. And again, if you look at our comp store sales even in this quarter, when you add back the e-commerce and some of our stores that we had upsized and sadly the port issue, we were -- and on a constant currency basis, we're basically close to flat in our comp stores. So while we did have difficulty in North America, it really isn't as bad as it kind of was reflected when we're not reporting a total number with the comp stores, including our e-commerce business. And then secondly, we do have some -- what we think are some strategic and exciting initiatives for our fiscal third and fourth quarter. First, we will be launching Kors Concierge in the third quarter, which will give all of our -- or not all but a significant amount of our selling associates technology that they will be able to, we think, create some significant up-sell inside our stores. And then secondly, we have a very, very strong program in the third quarter around gifting, which is an area, after doing consumer research, that we're finding our customer is continuing to clamor for, for Michael Kors, especially in that holiday season. And we think we missed a fair amount of that last year. So we think those initiatives will help to really guide us to a more favorable comp store performance in third and fourth quarter, in particular."

I think we did bake some of that into the guidance because I think we've reported 200 million shares for the year. But that being said, we believe as a management team and as a company that our stock price is significantly undervalued. We have, I think, the best performance of any company in the global luxury field today. And when we're reporting our earnings, I think it's very, very clean in terms of the way that we are performing. And clearly, the marketplace has not responded to our performance. And while we are very concerned about that issue, we think that, that's only going to make it that much more interesting for us to continue to repurchase shares. And I would say we'll probably do it aggressively because as much as the market continues to undervalue our company, myself and the management team and the board feel that, that's just the wrong perspective on the very, very successful and strong company that we've built globally. And I might also add that while we are disappointed that we're not delivering a double-digit bottom line this year, when you really add back constant currency -- take this to constant currency, our top line revenue would be about 14% and our bottom line revenue would be about 10%. So we will once again deliver a double-digit top line and bottom line, which we had originally forecasted, but unfortunately, the euro, in particular, and the yen deteriorated significantly from late January on. And I would also add one thing to that as well. That deterioration in euro and the Canadian dollar is where we see the greatest impact to our North American comps. The 2 things that really impacted our North American comps were tourism, which New York City, the business is very difficult, certain parts of the Southeast and Las Vegas, where we've seen traditional very, very strong European traffic in particular, that affected us. And you can almost tie it right back to when the currency started declining, and then of course, the watch sales, which really did catch us off guard in terms of the amount of decline. So our handbag business is very strong. Our footwear business is excellent. All of our core businesses are quite strong. So again, we think that bodes well for the future. And that gives our board and myself and the rest of the management team great confidence that we will use our balance sheet in a very significant way to take advantage of what we think is just an incorrect perception on the stock price."

I would say that our wholesale business -- I want to start with that because that is a very significant part of our business. And I know that most of the dialogue that we have is around our company-owned domestic stores. But we have a very, very large business in North American wholesale, which continues to perform at very, very strong rates. And we are performing better than our competitors in that channel. And we really don't see that channel as being more promotional than it was the last 3 years, to be quite frank with you. There are a few retailers who are doing some additional price-matching of one another. But that really hasn't been something that has significantly increased our business or been a driver for the business, at least in terms of our perception. We do believe that certain of our competitors in the accessories business, while they state that they are reducing certain of their sale postures, we see tremendous amount of sale activities in their full-line stores. We see the continued use of flash sales, which we do not do. We see a lot of things to drive customers into the stores that, as you know, we've taken a posture since we started this company that we wouldn't do. We take our markdowns on products, the same thing that we've been doing since we started the business. So we, in our own full-price stores, have made the decision that is not a posture that we want to engage in. I do think that it's had some effect on our business. But I think the greater issue is that our handbag business continues to grow at very, very nice rates and the fact that our footwear business is growing at very, very substantial rates as well. Now that's somewhat offset by our watch business, which you would have to refer to as a core business. And that business is definitely seeing a decline in the North American market. We're not seeing that in the European and Asian market. Actually, the business is accelerating at a very, very nice pace. And we believe part of that is a shift to the jewelry category, where again our jewelry business is very, very strong. The negative to that is that the transaction in jewelry is significantly lower. It's more than half less than the watch businesses. So we're very attuned to the fact that we're going to have to do something to reengage the customer in that classification. We are the leader of the fashion watch business in the United States and fast approaching that in other parts of the world. So we have an obligation to come up with really exciting and compelling products and we think we've got a pretty good handle on what we're going to do for that in Q4 of our fiscal year. And we also, as we look out to 2016, we see the wearable technology space as a place that we're going to be able to play and compete and offer great excitement for our customer."

On the other side, we see great growth opportunity in Europe. As we stated in the call, we have a single-digit market share in that marketplace, and we know that we could probably get ourselves to at least double-digit market share. So plenty of upside for us there and some very significant market in terms of size. And then as you know, we're excited about our business in Asia, but we are in early, early days of developing that marketplace. And many of our competitors can run 30% to 40% of their total business out of that market. So look, North America is going to grow more slowly, we know that and we've said that since we went public. And then we have these 2 other phenomenal marketplaces, which are Europe and Asia, to continue to grow our handbag business, our footwear business, our women's accessories business and our really exciting business based around men's that, we think long term, is going to be a great growth opportunity for us."

We had seen some minor decline in Q3 in tourism, but we didn't think it was going to be as precipitous as what we saw happen. And kind of in January, things were okay. And then February, March, business got extremely difficult. The other thing that happened, Randy, you have to remember, we shut the marketing off on online. And that drives a lot of people into stores. Now maybe that was the right decision, maybe that was the wrong decision. But we just didn't want to be frustrating the customers, sending out emails, sending out all kinds of communication. So those 2 things really impacted the business. And then thirdly, the watch sales. Watch sales -- again our handbag business is healthy, our shoe business is healthy, our women's ready business is healthy, our watch business is not healthy in North America. Outside of North America, it is. And we did see a shift in our business to jewelry. So whether that's something that's cyclical, whether that's something that's a trend, whether that's something that's driven around other entries into the category, we're not exactly 100% sure. We've gone out and done a lot of consumer research around it. The customer is still saying very, very positive things about the brand and their intent to buy Michael Kors. And interestingly enough, some of that intent is shifting into other categories. One of the things that popped up in our consumer information was eyewear. And we're obviously in a very aggressive mode with Luxottica launching eyewear. And we've got really good feedback from the customer. So I think that again we have given guidance for Q1, given the fact that we are concerned about the trend that we saw coming out of Q4. And hopefully, that business trend will improve and hopefully, we've got some initiatives that are based around some new and exciting product trends that are starting to happen for us that will help drive that. In terms of product and promotion of the stores, again we're not doing anything different. We're not doing friends and family, we're not doing taking additional 20% off with a coupon with whatever, we're not doing flash sales. We just don't think that's the right thing for us to do. And quite frankly, our competitors are doing it and they're it doing on a regular basis. And while they all claim that they're doing it less, they're still doing it. And I think that we're probably at a competitive disadvantage. But we'd rather build a quality business with the consumer in terms of what the Michael Kors brand stands for than to go down a path that I think we will be sorry for long term because as you hear our competitors talking about they're doing everything they can to get out of those things, and that's not a conversation that we want to be having with you."

We know the locations, we know the developers, we know the street names. And none of that's changed at all. And when you really look at that on a global basis, it's the right number given our profile of business. And in 90% of the cases, we're sitting next to really fantastic retailers who are in the luxury category. So we feel good about that. Our store size isn't really going to change that much. We upsized about 30 stores, 30, 35 stores this past year. And we're going to do about the same this coming-up year. And we're doing that in certain strategic locations. And one that we're very excited about is we're going to be upsizing Regent Street this year, a store that's way overproductive for its space. And so that's a good example of the type of store that we'll do. And we've upsized certain very high-end luxury mall locations as well. And we're pleased with the results of that. I wouldn't say that, that's what we're going to do chain-wide that's -- actually, I will say that's not what we're going to do chain-wide. And so still, the average lifestyle store is around 2,500 square feet. And we did start to implement some of these larger stores, so we could show footwear and women's ready-to-wear in a better format. And those stores are around 5,000 square feet. And again, in the right marketplaces, we'll look at that. But it is not a strategy that we have said we're going to go chain-wide and start to upsize stores on a global basis."

And again, unlike our competitors who have a lot more stores than we do, we'll be finished and complete with that. And in Europe, it's significantly less. So today, if you look at our global footprint, we have 373 full-price stores and 153 outlet stores. And long term, the full-price number will get a lot larger. And there's only a handful of additional locations that we feel appropriate for an outlet store for us. And again, we're very careful. We do not want to turn our business -- we run a full-price retail business very successfully, very profitably. And we will continue to stay focused on that as our key strategy. And we will use the outlets for clearances of merchandise. In a marketplace like Europe, it's really important for us because we don't have certain of the other channels of selling off our excess inventories the way that we do here in the United States.

So our market share in North America is we're somewhere in the #2, #3 range, we estimate today. We're still not the #1 market share in North America. And I've told you we don't aspire to be the #1 market share. I would say our market share growth in North America will -- in accessories in particular, will grow very slowly on a go-forward basis because we think that if the way that you would have to grow the market share additionally in North America would be very promotionally driven, we don't want to do that. And we're comfortable with that. So we have a very solid, steady business that's going to grow in a steady basis. And we know the customer is responding and saying very positive and favorable things about the brand in North America as well as outside North America. We feel that the footwear business, we are definitely underpenetrated in terms of market share. This is low, low, low single digits in North America, so there's a huge opportunity for footwear. And I would tell you that in terms of a volume, a top line and a business that we feel comfortable kind of putting our foot on the accelerator a bit more on is definitely footwear. And we know the customer is saying yes to us really across the entire region here. And as we stated, in Europe, it's starting to come on quite strong as well. So I think that our thought process is just be steady, keep the brand in the right place. And then in terms of allowances, the channel that had a little higher allowances was our own free -- or markdowns was our own freestanding stores. And that's going to be a bit natural because for us to drive additional business in our own freestanding stores, we have to offer more fashion. We have to be a little newer, a little fresher, we have to take a few more chances and we've got a couple of things that are really starting to cook for us in terms of new handbag groups. We're starting to see soft bags emerge, we've got a new bag out called Riley, which you've probably been seeing international ads. And that bag is starting to really get some traction. So as we believe the fashion leader in accessible luxury, we've got to get out there and give new product to our customers. And you're going see that in watches. As I stated earlier, we're going to -- about 30 -- we're going to change 30% of our entire watch assortment for the spring season. And that's going to be focused on one of our real core strengths, which is our mixed materials program. As you know, we're one of the only companies in the world that really do that well, whether it's our tortoise or our acetate clear watches, which are really hot right now. And we didn't probably focus on that as heavily as we had in the past with metals. So we're going to really shift our mix there. And so I think that's going to help drive our comp store growth. But that will come with a little bit of margin pressure, which I think we've given you guidance on, in particular our own freestanding stores."

We believe that luxury companies have to embrace the digital circle as we view it. And we view it as really a 360-degree communication, engagement and relationship with the customer. So first, we think that the single most important vision of the Michael Kors company and brand is through our digital flagship. And we also believe that's going to become 20% of our business globally over the next 3 to 5 years. So this is why we're making all this investment, and it's absolutely having some pretty significant impact on our SG&A, corporately and in particular, in the operating income of our retail business. And what we think is not only do you have to create that experience online, but you have to create that experience in stores. Many people continue to say, ""Well, why do you open stores if digital is going to be so important?"" Well, number one, it's 20%, it's not 100%. Number two, people still will go into a store and shop. But when you can only offer in your own store 30% or 40% of your entire assortment, that customer becomes disappointed. And now with Kors Concierge being rolled out -- by the way, it will be probably -- it will take us probably about a full year to roll out all of North America starting in October, November in our own stores -- in about 35, 40 stores. And then we'll roll out the balance of the chain. Our sales associates are going to be able to engage the customer as a personal stylist. We think that is a very big differentiator from having a sales associate on the floor. We already think our people have amazing training and are really excited to work with our clients. But this is going to be on a whole different level. They're going to become your personal stylist. And then lastly, omni has really -- is going to change the game for all of us in terms of being able to -- people want things quickly and they want it when they want it. And if you're not going to be able to deliver it to them in that manner, then they're absolutely going to go somewhere else and get the experience and the service from another retailer. And we want to be best-in-class. We do not view ourselves as best-in-class on this. We view ourselves as behind but making a very significant effort to move forward on this platform. And hopefully, within the next 18 months, we will be up digitally with e-commerce platforms globally, probably with the exception of China. And that will be, by the way, on a unified platform inside the company, which we think will be a real advantage for our business as we grow going forward. All right. I'd like to thank everyone for joining us today and look forward to updating you on our future progress at Michael Kors. Thank you very much."

Good morning, and welcome to Michael Kors' Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2015 Earnings Call. I will begin with a review of the fourth quarter and fiscal year followed by an update on various growth initiatives. I will then turn the call over to Joe for a detailed discussion of our fourth quarter financial results and our outlook for first quarter and full year 2016.  
During the fourth quarter, total revenue grew 18% and EPS increased 15%. Double-digit gains extended across our retail, wholesale and licensing segments. While we were pleased with the continued momentum in our overall business, comparable store sales declined 1.7% on a constant-currency basis. We attribute this primarily to a continuation of weak traffic trends in North America, including a reduction in tourist traffic, a decline in North American watch business, as well as a 90 basis point negative impact from shipping delays in our footwear, womenswear and small leather goods products associated with the recent West Coast port issues. 
Including e-commerce, our global comparable store sales would have been 160 basis points higher for the fourth quarter and our expanded stores would have added another 40 basis points to our global comp. While we are certainly focused on taking steps to drive improved comparable store sales performance in our retail stores, there continues to be exceptional growth in our digital e-commerce flagships, our wholesale business and in our international markets, demonstrating the overall strength of our brand.  
Reflecting on fiscal 2015. I'm pleased to report we delivered top and bottom line growth in excess of 30%, which was in line with our full year outlook. Global comparable store sales for the year increased 11.9% on a constant-currency basis. Including sales from our digital e-commerce flagship, our global comparable store sales would have been 120 basis points higher for the fiscal 2015 and our expanded stores would have added another 60 basis points to our global comp.  
During the year, we saw strong growth across all our segments, our geographies and our product lines. Notably, revenue growth in both Europe and Japan exceeded 70%, while revenue in North America, our most developed market, grew more than 20%, demonstrating the continued demand for our luxury brand globally. In fact, the ongoing strength of Michael Kors brand is also illustrated in the growth of followers across social media sites worldwide. In the fourth quarter on a year-over-year basis, Facebook followers increased 22%, Instagram followers increased 99%, Twitter followers increased 46% and Weibo followers increased 120% as consumers around the globe turned to Michael Kors for lifestyle and fashion inspiration.  
In addition, we made meaningful progress across multiple strategic initiatives as we continue to set the stage for sustainable long-term growth. In fiscal 2015, we successfully launched our global digital e-commerce flagship in the U.S., which continued to exceed our expectation with annual year-over-year sales growth of 63%. We expanded our global retail presence with the addition of 121 stores, including our largest flagship store to date in SoHo, which includes our first-ever dedicated men's floor, ending the year with 728 Michael Kors stores worldwide, including licensed locations. We completed the expansion of 32 highly productive retail locations globally, contributing to top line growth. 
We increased global comparable store sales in our retail stores and our wholesale shop-in-shops. We continued to further penetrate our wholesale channel with the conversion of 570 wholesale doors to shop-in-shops globally. We expanded our market share in accessories, footwear, ready-to-wear and jewelry. We enhanced our technology infrastructure to support our global digital strategies and operations. And we continued to build a strong distribution center infrastructure worldwide to support our growth initiatives. As we look ahead, we remain intently focused on driving the business forward by further building brand awareness, expanding our product offering and growing in each of our regions. 
Let me discuss some of the key areas that we expect will drive the business this year. We see continued growth in North America in fiscal 2016. Retail momentum will be driven by our digital flagship strategies as well as new store growth with the addition of 30 locations. As you know today, retail environment is quickly evolving. The lines between brick-and-mortar and online are increasingly becoming blurred. And brand interaction and commerce happens across all devices and platforms. In order to remain relevant, luxury brands must evolve in response to this channel shift from stores to online. 
We began our digital journey with the successful launch of our e-commerce flagship in the U.S. in 2014. And we are pleased to announce that we launched our new digital flagship in Canada last month, which not only showcases the widest assortment of our luxury products, but also offers the broadest and deepest brand experience. We continue to enhance functionalities and build an omni-channel strategy that connects our digital flagships with our in-store, mobile and social presence, focusing on omni-channel fulfillment and product personalization with the launch of Kors Concierge. As we introduce digital devices into our stores, our sales associates will be empowered with the most extensive collection of our luxury products, allowing them to become personal stylists and enabling them to drive customer engagement as well as elevate our customers' jet-set shopping experience. We expect our omni-channel initiatives, combined with retail expansion, to drive double-digit sales growth in our retail segment in fiscal 2016.  
We anticipate continued strength in our North American wholesale business. And we'll capitalize on the success of our shop-in-shops with the conversion of an additional 500 doors across all categories. We anticipate single-digit growth in this channel in fiscal 2016 as we continue to develop our handbag, ready-to-wear and footwear categories, as well as our men's business. In our licensing segment, we anticipate continued deceleration in watch sales due to what we believe is a cycle shift to our jewelry category, where we expect to see continued strength this year. Our watch category continues to evolve, and we expect to further elevate our offering with the introduction of new collections for the calendar 2016 spring season. These new lines, which will comprise approximately 30% of the assortment, will reflect product innovation focused on new materials and metal treatments. In our fragrance business and our new eyewear collection, we saw strong performance in fiscal 2015 and we expect to see continued momentum in these categories in fiscal 2016. As we further develop our categories, we anticipate mid-single digit growth in North American licensing segment this fiscal year.  
In Europe, we expect to open 45 new retail stores and continue to prepare our digital flagship launch next year. On the wholesale side, we plan to expand distribution through shop-in-shops and specialty stores in existing countries as well as new markets. We are well positioned to increase our market share in the handbag category, where today, we only hold a single-digit market share position. Footwear is quickly becoming an emerging growth story across Europe as we are seeing strong response to our collection across the region. In addition, we expect continued strength in our licensed categories as we see solid gains in watches, eyewear and jewelry. Although foreign currency rates will continue to be a headwind this year, we believe our strategic initiatives in Europe will contribute to double-digit revenue growth on a constant-currency basis in fiscal 2016.  
Asia remains a tremendous growth opportunity for the company. We're very excited about the opening of our 5,000-square-foot flagship store in Kobe in April and the planned opening of our 7,800-square-foot flagship in Ginza later this year. These stores will further heighten our presence in Japan and enhance our luxury brand positioning in this market. We plan to open a total of 10 stores in Japan in fiscal 2016 and drive revenue growth through our compelling luxury product offering and jet-set in-store experience. Moving to Korea, we are set to unlock the market opportunity in this region beginning with the transition of our retail business in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. Our investments this year will center on building the right infrastructure and developing an expansion strategy to position this business for long-term growth. In Hong Kong, we recently established local distribution, where we now are able to provide a greater level of service to select Asian customers, which were previously serviced out of North America, and further capture growth in this region.  
Turning to our regional licensed business. Throughout the Far East, we were pleased with the strong performance in China and Southeast Asia, which saw strong double-digit comp growth in fiscal 2015. We believe that more consumers are now recognizing Michael Kors as a fashion leader and our luxury brand is quickly becoming a significant factor in this region. We will capitalize on our accelerating brand awareness in this market and expect to see continued growth this fiscal year with the opening of 40 locations, as well as strong comp store sales increases. We believe that our travel retail stores are another effective way to raise brand awareness and this business continues to perform well. We see opportunity to raise visibility of the Michael Kors brand to the luxury travel customer as we optimize our presence in premier travel destination around the world.  
And finally, in our men's business, we are pleased to announce the addition of Marcel Ostwald as Senior Vice President of Menswear Design, coming to us from Hugo Boss, where he was Senior Head of Creative Management and Concept Design for BOSS Sportswear. We look forward to Marcel bringing his design talent and experience to Michael Kors. Working in collaboration with Michael, Marcel will be responsible for developing the product vision ultimately driving the men's business to global success.  
We have begun to make strides in our men's ready-to-wear and leather goods and have designed our fiscal 2016 marketing campaign to build brand awareness through increased visibility in print ads, social media and outdoor marketing, all of which will showcase our product and offer a glimpse into the world of the Michael Kors man. We are very excited to deliver another luxury fashion shopping experience to customers worldwide with the opening of 10 men's retail locations and approximately 90 shop-in-shops globally in fiscal 2016.  
Looking beyond fiscal '16. We see ample opportunity to drive double-digit top line growth through multiple initiatives. First, we will continue to drive our direct-to-consumer presence with the ongoing development of our digital flagship strategy in addition to growing our retail store base. We expect our North American digital flagship to generate strong double-digit gains and plan to expand our global digital presence with the launch of our flagships in Europe and Asia. The investments we're making in our digital strategy will ensure michaelkors.com is the most expansive expression of our luxury fashion brand and will support the growth of this channel, ultimately reaching 20% of our retail sales long term. 
In addition to our digital growth, we continue to see potential for 700 stores globally, including 400 in North America, 200 in Europe and 100 in Japan, not including the men's stores or the Korea locations. We also see moderate level of comparable store sales growth contributing to our overall growth of our retail segment, driven by newness across all product categories, enhanced marketing programs and an exceptional jet-set shopping experience all channels and platforms. 
Second, in our wholesale channel, we see continued momentum through comparable store sales increases and shop-in-shop conversions in North America and Europe. 
Third, to support our growth objectives across our segments and geographies, we will continue to invest in effective marketing programs. Our digital flagships, along with our growing social media presence, will remain instrumental in maintaining our engagement with our customers as well as enabling us to broaden our consumer reach globally. In addition, we will continue to invest in national advertising, direct marketing and our direct mail catalogs. 
Fourth, maintaining a strong assortment of luxury products will also enable us to drive sustainable growth. We expect global demand for our accessories products to remain strong and we see additional opportunity to further build our footwear and women's ready-to-wear business. In addition, we are very excited about our men's business and continue to believe and view this as a billion-dollar global opportunity. In our licensed product categories, we see exciting developments in wearable technology and believe that we can become a leading brand in connected fashion accessories. We will also increase our penetration in jewelry, fragrance and eyewear to fully realize those product potentials. 
And lastly, we see significant opportunity in our international markets as we grow brand awareness, launch our digital flagships and execute our strategic initiatives. We continue to see Europe as a $1.5 billion market, Japan as a $300 million market and Korea as a $100 million opportunity long term. In addition, we see strength -- strengthening our presence across Asia through our regional licenses, where we are seeing strong demand for Michael Kors products continue to rise. As we capitalize on our top line growth opportunities, begin to leverage strategic investments and continue to use our strong balance sheet to buy back shares, we remain confident that we will deliver double-digit top line and bottom line growth in fiscal 2017.  
I'd now like to turn the call over to Joe Parsons to discuss the fourth quarter performance."

I am pleased to report that we continue to see double-digit top and bottom lin",2731,"Thank you, John. Good morning. I will begin with a review of our fiscal 2015 fourth quarter financial results, followed by our outlook for the first quarter and full year 2016. I am pleased to report that we continue to see double-digit top and bottom line growth during the fourth quarter with strong performance across all of our segments, geographies and product lines. 
Total revenue grew 17.8% to $1.1 billion as compared to $917.5 million last year. On a constant-currency basis, total revenue grew 23.3%. The U.S. dollar further strengthened during -- since our last call, resulting in larger-than-anticipated impact on our sales. By region, in North America, revenue increased 13.7% and on a constant-currency basis, rose 14.3%. In Europe, revenue grew 33.5% and on a constant-currency basis, increased 59.5%. In Japan, revenue rose 42.7% and on a constant-currency basis, increased 65.0%.  
By segment, retail net sales increased 14.9% to $469.4 million, driven by the opening of 121 net new stores since the fourth quarter of last year and 44% growth in our digital e-commerce flagship stores, partially offset by a comp store sales decrease of 5.8%. On a constant-currency basis, retail net sales increased 21.1% and comp store sales decreased 1.7%. By region, comp store sales declined 6.7% in North America, declined 5.6% in Europe and grew 12.4% in Japan. On a constant-currency basis, comp store sales declined 5.8% in North America, increased 11.0% in Europe and grew 30.0% in Japan.  
While our North American comp store sales results for the quarter did not meet our expectations, performance was impacted by several factors. First, we saw a continuation of weak mall traffic trends in North America and weaker tourism traffic globally. In particular, we saw fewer tourists traveling to key U.S. cities in the Northeast and Southeast regions as well as fewer Middle Eastern and Russian travelers in Europe. 
Second, we saw a decline in sales in the watch category, particularly in North America, following many years of sequential growth due to what we believe is a category shift to our jewelry collection. That said, the AUR for jewelry is substantially lower than watches. 
Third, shipping delays for footwear, ready-to-wear and small leather goods associated with the West Coast port issues negatively impacted our comp performance by approximately 90 basis points. 
Our U.S. digital e-commerce flagship performed exceptionally well, with 44% sales growth during the quarter. Our sales in this channel were driven by strong growth in both traffic and conversion and performance was led by our handbags and small leather goods as well as our ready-to-wear and footwear categories. As you know, the e-commerce warehouse experienced severe weather-related damage, which prevented us from shipping goods for approximately 5 weeks. While we took steps to mitigate the impact by shipping goods from stores and other facilities, we believe this incident impacted our digital sales by approximately $7 million. Excluding this impact, e-commerce sales would have added 480 basis points to our North American comp and 380 basis points to our global comp. I would also note that we suspended our digital marketing efforts during this period. While we began marketing once we resumed shipping, we expect a residual impact going forward into the first quarter as it will take time to reengage our customers and for trends to return to levels seen to prior to this event. 
Lastly, excluding the expanded or relocated stores from a comp base negatively impacted our global comp sales results by approximately 40 basis points. We opened 17 net new stores in the quarter, 6 in North America, 8 in Europe and 3 in Japan. In addition, we expanded or relocated 2 stores. We ended the year with 526 company-owned retail stores. In addition, our licensing partners operated 202 Michael Kors stores around the world, including 134 stores in the Far East, bringing our overall presence to 728 locations worldwide. 
Wholesale net sales grew 20.4% to $570.4 million for the fourth quarter, reflecting the continued demand for our brand globally. On a constant-currency basis, wholesale revenues increased 25.8%. The momentum was led by accessory categories as well as our continued conversion of wholesale doors to shop-in-shops and the expansion of our European operations. On a global basis, our accessories and footwear businesses comp-ed at a double-digit rate during the quarter and we saw continued gains in women's ready-to-wear. We converted an additional 103 wholesale doors into shop-in-shops globally, ending the year with 2,132 accessories, footwear, womenswear and menswear shop-in-shops worldwide. As John noted earlier, we recently established distribution operations in Hong Kong for certain Asian customers. As a result of this change, approximately $100 million of sales previously recorded in North America wholesale will now be reflected in Asia's wholesale sales. 
In our licensing segment, revenue grew 16.5% to $41.3 million for the quarter. The growth was led by our jewelry category, as well as eyewear. Our North American watch business was softer during the quarter. We opened 31 new watch and jewelry shop-in-shops during the quarter and ended the year with 261 shop-in-shops globally. 
Gross profit grew 14.8% to $630.8 million. Gross margin was 58.4% versus 59.9% for the same period last year. The 150 basis point decline is attributable to additional markdowns and allowances as well as a 50 basis point foreign currency impact. 
Total operating expenses grew 23.4% to $374.7 million. As a percent of total revenue, total operating expenses increased to 34.7% from 33.1%. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 20.5% to $336.8 million. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was largely due to the higher retail occupancy and salary costs related to new store openings; costs related to corporate management additions as we continue to build the Michael Kors team to support global growth; higher costs related to our digital strategies, including our new customer call center; an increase in litigation cost; and an increase in advertising and marketing expense. As a percent of total revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses were 31.2% compared with 30.5% for the fourth quarter of last year. 
Depreciation and amortization expense increased 58% to $37.9 million for the fourth quarter, primarily due to the build-out of new retail locations, the expansion of existing locations and our corporate New York offices, including accelerated depreciation relating to these expansions, new shop-in-shops, an increase in lease rights purchased for our new European stores and investments in our distribution and IT infrastructure. As a result of these factors, income from operations was $256.2 million or 23.7% of total revenue as compared to $245.9 million or 26.8% of total revenue in the same period last year. 
Operating margin for the retail segment contracted 660 basis points. 380 basis points of the decline was due to an increase in general corporate operating costs, including costs related to our digital flagship, higher litigation-related costs and higher retail occupancy and salary costs. 120 basis points is attributable to higher depreciation and amortization expenses related to new stores, expanded stores and lease rights. The remainder is due to a 165 basis point decline in gross margin primarily due to higher level of markdowns and the impact of currency fluctuations on the cost of goods sold. 
Wholesale operating margin decreased 30 basis points due to the 105 basis point decrease in gross profit margin primarily due to higher discounts and allowances, partially offset by lower selling and distribution expenses. 
Finally, the licensing segment operating margin decreased 380 basis points due to an increase in operating expense, primarily higher advertising cost.  
Income taxes were $76.1 million in the quarter as compared to $85.0 million last year. Our effective tax rate was 29.4% as compared to 34.6% in the same period last year. The decrease in our effective tax rate was primarily due to the increase of taxable income in certain non-U.S. subsidiaries, which are subject to lower statutory tax rates. 
Net income increased 13.4% to $182.6 million for the fourth quarter and diluted earnings per share were $0.90 based upon 203.2 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding. The unfavorable currency impact to EPS was $0.06 per share. Net income for the fourth quarter of last year was $161.0 million or $0.78 per diluted share based upon 207.0 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding. 
Turning to the balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, cash and cash equivalents were $978.9 million as compared to $971.2 million at the end of last year. There were no outstanding borrowings under our credit facility in either year. 
We continue to use our strong balance sheet and cash flow to repurchase additional shares under our $1 billion share repurchase program. During the quarter, we repurchased 1.4 million shares, totaling $92 million, bringing our total repurchase to 6.8 million shares, totaling $491.9 million for fiscal 2015. 
We remain confident in our long-term growth outlook in free cash flow generation and are pleased to announce that the Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of an additional $500 million of the company's ordinary shares and has extended the program through May 2017. This increases the initial repurchase authorization to $1.5 billion, of which $1 billion is available to us for future repurchase over the next 2 years. As we demonstrated this past year, we will continue to use the strength of our balance sheet and future cash flows to repurchase additional shares and drive value for shareholders. 
For the quarter, inventory increased 21.8% versus last year and was in line with sales growth. As we stated previously, our inventory growth fluctuates from quarter-to-quarter, but we generally expect our inventory increase to outpace sales growth as we further develop our digital flagships, open and expand our retail stores, expand replenishment stock and convert shop-in-shops. 
Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $73.5 million. These expenditures were related to global retail store expansions and renovations, corporate office renovation, construction and renovation of shop-in-shops, investment in our distribution facilities and enhancement of our information system infrastructure.  
Turning to our outlook. We expect foreign currency to remain a headwind for fiscal 2016. In addition to the translation impact, we are exposed to transaction risk as our international businesses purchase goods and services in U.S. dollars. While we partially had purchases through forward contracts, many of our favorable contracts will be expiring in the early part of the fiscal year resulting in higher cost of goods. Our largest currency exposures are the euro, Canadian dollar and Japanese yen. 
Fiscal 2016 will be an investment year centered on infrastructure enhancements and new growth initiatives with the company as we remain focused on our long-term sustainable growth. We expect to see higher SG&A and depreciation expense driven by: Further development of our global digital flagships and omni-channel capabilities; infrastructure investment in the transition of our Korean business; infrastructure investment in the development of our men's business; occupancy and overhead costs related to our global retail store expansions; the build-out of our European distribution center, as well as improvements to our existing distribution network; and continued corporate investment with the addition of key executives, expansion of our IT capabilities as well as additional corporate occupancy costs. While these investments will put near-term pressure on operating margins, particularly in the first quarter, we believe that they are critical in creating the foundation for continued double-digit top and bottom line growth.  
For the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we expect total revenue to be between $930 million and $950 million. On a constant-currency basis, total revenue is expected to increase in the high-single digit range, assuming a $60 million impact from the change in foreign currency rates. We expect a low-double digit comp store decrease on a reported basis and a mid-single digit decrease in constant currency. 
Operating expense as a percentage of total revenue is expected to increase 550 basis points to 600 basis points in the first quarter primarily due to the global investments I described earlier. 
We expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.74 to $0.78, assuming a tax rate of approximately 29% and 202.5 million shares outstanding. 
We expect foreign currency to impact net income by approximately $14 million and EPS by approximately $0.07 for the first quarter. 
We anticipate that revenue growth will accelerate in the second half of the year due to a number of factors on a reported basis. First, we believe that the FX headwinds will diminish during the year. The average euro to U.S. dollar rate last year for the first quarter was 1.37, weakening to 1.13 average in the fourth quarter. 
Second, we will have a full year effect of operating the U.S. digital flagship and nearly a full year of the Canadian digital flagship as compared to fiscal 2015, when the U.S. digital flagship was operational for 0.5 year and was affected by the warehouse disruption. 
Third, we plan to open new stores and shop-in-shops that will provide incremental sales during the year. 
Fourth, we are planning to add compelling new products to our assortment and create excitement in our marketing plans, which we believe will further drive sales. 
Finally, we anticipate that the 53rd week to add approximately $40 million of additional sales or approximately $0.03 per share. 
As a result, for fiscal 2016, we expect total revenue to be between $4.7 billion and $4.8 billion. On a constant-currency basis, total revenue is expected to increase in the low- to mid-teens range, assuming a $200 million impact from the change in foreign currency rates. 
We expect flat comp store sales on a reported basis, and a low single-digit increase on a constant-currency basis. We believe that comp store sales will continue to be challenged by current trends in mall traffic and the recent slowdown in tourism, in addition to the deceleration in watch sales, while we expect digital sales to provide a benefit in the second half of the year.  
Operating expense as a percent of total revenue is expected to increase 110 basis points to 140 basis points for the year due to the global investments I described earlier. We expect the increase in operating expense as a percent of total revenue to moderate in the second half of the year as the rate of spend slows and we begin to anniversary the investments that we made in 2015. 
We expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $4.40 to $4.50, assuming a tax rate of approximately 29% and 200 million shares outstanding. 
We expect foreign currency to impact net income by approximately $39 million and EPS by approximately $0.20 for the year.  
I would note that going forward, we will be reporting comp store sales on a global basis, which better represents management's view of our company as an expanding global businesses. Our focus is on driving top and bottom line growth for the long term. 
To that end, in addition to driving comp store sales, we have multiple levers in both the domestic and international markets, such as our global digital flagships, expansion of our underpenetrated categories, such as footwear and men's, square footage expansion and capitalizing in the opportunities in our wholesale and licensing businesses. Overall, we take a global view on our business as we look at our long-term growth potential, focusing on the areas where we see the greatest opportunities. 
Capital expenditures are expected to total approximately $400 million in fiscal 2016. The expenditures will focus on: Retail expansion with continuing investment in our digital -- in our global digital strategies; the opening of 85 stores globally, as well as the transition and development of our Korean business; we expect 30 new stores in North America, 45 in Europe and 10 stores in Japan; the development of our men's business; the expansion of wholesale business with the conversion of 600 shop-in-shops globally; continued investment in our distribution infrastructure and information systems; and the renovation of our New York corporate offices. 
In summary, we were very pleased with the advances we made on our strategic initiatives in fiscal 2015 despite the challenging macro environment and foreign currency headwinds. And we believe that we have multiple growth opportunities ahead of us. 
We will continue to strategically invest in our business this year to support our initiatives and maintain our leadership position within the global luxury market, ultimately driving double-digit revenue and EPS growth in fiscal 2017.  
I will now turn the call back to John Idol."

And if you could just speak to the deleverage expected in SG&A in the first fiscal quarter. It sounds like it's expected to be the most deleverage of the full year based on your annual guidance. And is that just a function of the June quarter being a low revenue quarter, and therefore, the deleverage eases beyond that? If you could just give us some color around that, that would be great."

Kimberly, I'll take the first question, and I'll let Joe handle the second one. On the first, the back half of the year, one of the biggest contributors to that comp number is going to be the fact that we'll be reporting the e-commerce sales fully baked into our numbers. So that will improve in terms of the total. And again, if you look at our comp store sales even in this quarter, when you add back the e-commerce and some of our stores that we had upsized and sadly the port issue, we were -- and on a constant-currency basis, we're basically close to flat in our comp stores. So while we did have difficulty in North America, it really isn't as bad as it kind of was reflected when we're not reporting a total number with the comp stores, including our e-commerce business. And then secondly, we do have some -- what we think are some strategic and exciting initiatives for our fiscal third and fourth quarter. First, we will be launching Kors Concierge in the third quarter, which will give all of our -- or not all but a significant amount of our selling associates technology that they will be able to, we think, create some significant upsell inside our stores. And then secondly, we have a very, very strong program in the third quarter around gifting, which is an area, after doing consumer research, that we're finding our customer is continuing to clamor for, for Michael Kors, especially in that holiday season. And we think we missed a fair amount of that last year. So we think those initiatives will help to really guide us to a more favorable comp store performance in third and fourth quarter, in particular."

I think we did bake some of that into the guidance because I think we've reported 200 million shares for the year. But that being said, we believe as a management team and as a company that our stock price is significantly undervalued. We have, I think, the best performance of any company in the global luxury field today. And when we're reporting our earnings, I think it's very, very clean in terms of the way that we are performing. And clearly, the marketplace has not responded to our performance. And while we are very concerned about that issue, we think that that's only going to make it that much more interesting for us to continue to repurchase shares. And I would say we'll probably do it aggressively because as much as the market continues to undervalue our company, myself and the management team and the board feel that that's just the wrong perspective on the very, very successful and strong company that we've built globally. And I might also add that while we are disappointed that we're not delivering a double-digit bottom line this year, when you really add back constant currency -- take this to constant currency, our top line revenue would be about 14% and our bottom line revenue would be about 10%. So we will once again deliver a double-digit top line and bottom line, which we had originally forecasted, but unfortunately, the euro, in particular, and the yen deteriorated significantly from late January on. And I would also add one thing to that as well. That deterioration in euro and the Canadian dollar is where we see the greatest impact to our North American comps. The 2 things that really impacted our North American comps were tourism, which New York City, the business is very difficult, certain parts of the Southeast and Las Vegas, where we've seen traditional very, very strong European traffic in particular, that affected us. And you can almost tie it right back to when the currency started declining, and then of course, the watch sales, which really did catch us off guard in terms of the amount of decline. So our handbag business is very strong. Our footwear business is excellent. All of our core businesses are quite strong. So again, we think that bodes well for the future. And that gives our board and myself and the rest of the management team great confidence that we will use our balance sheet in a very significant way to take advantage of what we think is just an incorrect perception on the stock price."

I would say that our wholesale business -- I want to start with that because that is a very significant part of our business. And I know that most of the dialogue that we have is around our company-owned domestic stores. But we have a very, very large business in North American wholesale, which continues to perform at very, very strong rates. And we are performing better than our competitors in that channel. And we really don't see that channel as being more promotional than it was the last 3 years, to be quite frank with you. There are a few retailers who are doing some additional price-matching of one another. But that really hasn't been something that has significantly increased our business or been a driver for the business, at least in terms of our perception. We do believe that certain of our competitors in the accessories business, while they state that they are reducing certain of their sale postures, we see tremendous amount of sale activities in their full-line stores. We see the continued use of flash sales, which we do not do. We see a lot of things to drive customers into the stores that, as you know, we've taken a posture since we started this company that we wouldn't do. We take our markdowns on products, the same thing that we've been doing since we started the business. So we, in our own full-price stores, have made the decision that is not a posture that we want to engage in. I do think that it's had some effect on our business. But I think the greater issue is that our handbag business continues to grow at very, very nice rates and the fact that our footwear business is growing at very, very substantial rates as well. Now that's somewhat offset by our watch business, which you would have to refer to as a core business. And that business is definitely seeing a decline in the North American market. We're not seeing that in the European and Asian market. Actually, the business is accelerating at a very, very nice pace. And we believe part of that's a shift to the jewelry category, where again our jewelry business is very, very strong. The negative to that is that the transaction in jewelry is significantly lower. It's more than half less than the watch businesses. So we're very attuned to the fact that we're going to have to do something to reengage the customer in that classification. We are the leader of the fashion watch business in the United States and fast approaching that in other parts of the world. So we have an obligation to come up with really exciting and compelling product and we think we've got a pretty good handle on what we're going to do for that in Q4 of our fiscal year. And we also, as we look out to 2016, we see the wearable technology space as a place that we're going to be able to play and compete and offer great excitement for our customer."

And I don't see anything that's going to wildly accelerate that. The category is growing, but it's definitely growing more slowly than it grew in the past, probably 5 or 6 years on that side. On the other side, we see great growth opportunity in Europe. As we stated in the call, we have a single-digit market share in that marketplace, and we know that we could probably get ourselves to at least double-digit market share, so plenty of upside for us there and some very significant market in terms of size. And then, as you know, we're excited about our business in Asia, but we are in early, early days of developing that marketplace. And many of our competitors can run 30% to 40% of their total business out of that market. So look, North America is going to grow more slowly, we know that and we've said that since we went public. And then we have these 2 other phenomenal marketplaces, which are Europe and Asia, to continue to grow our handbag business, our footwear business, our women's accessories business and our really exciting business based around men's that we think long term is going to be a great growth opportunity for us."

As I said a few minutes ago, you can almost trace it back to when the euro started its precipitous decline. All of a sudden, the tourism really dropped for us. We had seen some minor declines in Q3 in tourism, but we didn't think it was going to be as precipitous as what we saw happen. And kind of in January, things were okay. And then February, March, business got extremely difficult. The other thing that happened, Randy, you have to remember, we shut the marketing off on online. And that drives a lot of people into stores. Now maybe that was the right decision; maybe that was the wrong decision. But we just didn't want to be frustrating the customers, sending out emails, sending out all kinds of communication. So those 2 things really impacted the business. And then thirdly, the watch sales. Watch sales -- again our handbag business is healthy, our shoe business is healthy, our women's ready business is healthy, our watch business is not healthy in North America. Outside of North America, it is. And we did see a shift in our business to jewelry. So whether that's something that's cyclical, whether that's something that's a trend, whether that's something that's driven around other entries into the category, we're not exactly 100% sure. We've gone out and done a lot of consumer research around it. The customer is still saying very, very positive things about the brand and their intent to buy Michael Kors. And interestingly enough, some of that intent is shifting into other categories. One of the things that popped up in our consumer information was eyewear. And we're obviously in a very aggressive mode with Luxottica launching eyewear. And we've got really good feedback from the customer. So I think that, again, we have given guidance for Q1, given the fact that we are concerned about the trend that we saw coming out of Q4. And hopefully, that business trend will improve and hopefully, we've got some initiatives that are based around some new and exciting product trends that are starting to happen for us that will help drive that. In terms of product and promotion of the stores, again, we're not doing anything different. We're not doing friends and family, we're not doing take an additional 20% off with a coupon, with a whatever, we're not doing flash sales. We just don't think that's the right thing for us to do. And quite frankly, our competitors are doing it and they're doing it doing on a regular basis. And while they all claim that they're doing it less, they're still doing it. So -- and I think that we're probably at a competitive disadvantage. But we'd rather build a quality business with the consumer in terms of what the Michael Kors brand stands for than to go down a path that I think we will be sorry for long term because as you hear our competitors talking about, they're doing everything they can to get out of those things, and that's not a conversation that we want to be having with you."

And when you really look at that on a global basis, it's the right number given our profile of business. And in 90% of the cases, we're sitting next to really fantastic retailers who are in the luxury category. So we feel good about that. Our store size isn't really going to change that much. We upsized about 30 stores, 30, 35 stores this past year and we're going to do about the same this coming-up year. And we're doing that in certain strategic locations. One that we're very excited about is we're going to be upsizing Regent Street this year, a store that's way over-productive for its space. And so that's a good example of the type of store that we'll do. And we've upsized certain very high-end luxury mall locations as well. And we're pleased with the results of that. I wouldn't say that that's what we're going to do chain-wide that's -- actually, I will say that's not what we're going to do chain-wide. And so still, the average lifestyle store is around 2,500 square feet. And we did start to implement some of these larger stores so we could show footwear and women's ready-to-wear in a better format. And those stores are around 5,000 square feet.

And there's only a handful of additional locations that we feel appropriate for an outlet store for us. And again, we're very careful. We do not want to turn our business -- we run a full-price retail business very successfully, very profitably. And we will continue to stay focused on that as our key strategy.

So our market share in North America is we're somewhere in the #2, #3 range, we estimate today. We're still not the #1 market share in North America. And I've told you we don't aspire to be the #1 market share. I would say our market share growth in North America will -- in accessories in particular, will grow very slowly on a go-forward basis because we think that if the way that you would have to grow the market share additionally in North America would be very promotionally driven, we don't want to do that. And we're comfortable with that. So we have a very solid, steady business that's going to grow in a steady basis. And we know the customer is responding and saying very positive and favorable things about the brand in North America as well as outside North America. We feel that the footwear business, we are definitely underpenetrated in terms of market share. This is low, low, low-single digits in North America, so there's a huge opportunity for footwear. And I would tell you that in terms of a volume, top line and a business that we feel comfortable kind of putting our foot on the accelerator a bit more on is definitely footwear. And we know the customer is saying yes to us really across the entire region here. And as we stated, in Europe, it's starting to come on quite strong as well. So I think that our thought process is just be steady, keep the brand in the right place. And then in terms of allowances, the channel that had a little higher allowances was our own free -- or markdowns was our own freestanding stores. And that's going to be a bit natural because for us to drive additional business in our own freestanding stores, we have to offer more fashion. We have to be a little newer, a little fresher, we have to take a few more chances and we've got a couple of things that are really starting to cook for us in terms of new handbag groups. We're starting to see soft bags emerge. We've got a new bag out called Riley, which you've probably been seeing in our national ads. And that bag is starting to really get some traction. So as we believe the fashion leader in accessible luxury, we've got to get out there and give new product to our customers. And you're going see that in watches. As I stated earlier, we're going to -- about 30 -- we're going to change 30% of our entire watch assortment for the spring season. And that's going to be focused on one of our real core strengths, which is our mixed materials program. As you know, we're one of the only companies in the world that really do that well, whether it's our tortoise or our acetate clear watches, which are really hot right now. And we didn't probably focus on that as heavily as we had in the past with metals. So we're going to really shift our mix there. And so I think that's going to help drive our comp store growth. But that will come with a little bit of margin pressure, which I think we've given you guidance on, in particular our own freestanding stores."

We believe that luxury companies have to embrace the digital circle as we view it. And we view it as really a 360-degree communication, engagement and relationship with the customer. So first, we think that the single most important vision of the Michael Kors company and brand is through our digital flagship. And we also believe it's going to become 20% of our business globally over the next 3 to 5 years. So this is why we're making all this investment, and it's absolutely having some pretty significant impact on our SG&A, corporately and in particular, in the operating income of our retail business. And what we think is not only do you have to create that experience online, but you have to create that experience in stores. Many people continue to say, ""Well, why do you open stores if digital is going to be so important?"" Well, number one, it's 20%, it's not 100%. Number two, people still will go into a store and shop. But when you can only offer in your own store 30% or 40% of your entire assortment, that customer becomes disappointed. And now with Kors Concierge being rolled out -- and by the way, it will be probably -- it will take us probably about a full year to roll out all of North America starting in October, November in our own stores -- in about 35, 40 stores. And then we'll roll out the balance of the chain. Our sales associates are going to be able to engage the customer as a personal stylist. We think that is a very big differentiator from having a sales associate on the floor. We already think our people have amazing training and are really excited to work with our clients. But this is going to be on a whole different level. They're going to become your personal stylist. And then lastly, omni has really -- is going to change the game for all of us in terms of being able to -- people want things quickly and they want it when they want it. And if you're not going to be able to deliver it to them in that manner, then they're absolutely going to go somewhere else and get the experience and the service from another retailer. And we want to be best-in-class. We do not view ourselves as best-in-class on this. We view ourselves as behind but making a very significant effort to move forward on this platform. And hopefully, within the next 18 months, we will be up digitally with e-commerce platforms globally, probably with the exception of China. And that will be, by the way, on a unified platform inside the company, which we think will be a real advantage for our business as we grow going forward. 
All right. I'd like to thank everyone for joining us today and look forward to updating you on our future progress at Michael Kors. Thank you very much."

I'll begin with a quick review of the quarter and then provide an update on some of our growth initiatives.I'm pleased to report that our luxury bra",1475,"Thank you, Krystyna. Good morning, and welcome to Michael Kors' First Quarter Fiscal 2016 Earnings Call. I'll begin with a quick review of the quarter and then provide an update on some of our growth initiatives.
I'm pleased to report that our luxury brand continues to achieve global growth. Total revenue increased 7% or 13% on a constant currency basis for the first quarter of fiscal 2016. In constant currency, we saw a revenue growth of approximately 2% in North America, 42% in Europe and 57% in Japan. Although we are at different stages of development in each of our regions, we continue to drive top line growth and believe consumers view Michael Kors as a leading luxury fashion brand.
Our first quarter financial results exceeded expectations, driven by better-than-anticipated performance in both our retail and wholesale segments. The increase in retail net sales was attributable to new stores and accelerated growth in our North American digital flagships, which experienced 102% year-over-year increase.
Global comparable store sales declined 9.5%, or 5% on a constant currency basis, slightly better than we had expected. We saw continued momentum in our international markets with mid-single-digit comp growth in Europe and strong double-digit increase in Japan in constant currency. In North America, we experienced a high single-digit comp decline, reflecting a channel shift to online purchases and the continuation of reduced mall traffic. In addition, the continued decline in watch sales had a meaningful impact in the quarter as expected, and we saw a continued shift toward smaller-sized handbags along with increased demand for cross bodies and small leather goods, which is resulting in an overall lower average unit retail. If we include our U.S. digital flagship sales in our comp base, our North American comparable store sales would have decreased in the mid-single-digit range. 
Global Wholesale growth was led by continued strength in our accessories and Ready to Wear categories. Notably, when looking at our company-owned stores sales combined with department store sales on a retail basis, our accessories business grew at a low double-digit rate globally and a high single-digit rate in North America. We believe this represents a higher growth rate than the category as a whole, suggesting that we continue to take market share and demonstrate the strength of the Michael Kors brand.
Lastly, the increase in our licensing revenue in the first quarter was related to sales of eyewear, jewelry and watches.
Earnings per share results were better than expected at $0.87 for the quarter, including the unfavorable impact from foreign currency of $0.06 per share.
Turning to some highlights on our key growth initiatives. First, we are driving our direct to consumer business worldwide through the development of our digital flagships as well as expanding our footprint across North America, Europe and Asia. We expect our omnichannel initiatives, combined with our retail expansion, to drive double-digit sales growth in this segment this fiscal year as we continue to provide a jet set shopping experience to our customers.
We are increasing our retail store openings from 85 to 100 locations this year, with the addition of 8 locations in North America, 5  in Europe and 2 in Japan. We are also excited about the expansion of our men's in the retail channel and continue to believe there's the potential for as many as 500 men's locations worldwide. In addition, we look forward to driving growth in our Korean business as we transition these stores in-house by the end of the year.
Second, in our wholesale business. We see low single-digit growth this year stemming from both increased penetration across product categories as well as through the conversion of department store doors into shop-in-shops globally. We expect sales increases in our accessories business across regions, including in North America, to be driven by overall category growth as well as through increased penetration in both Europe and Asia as we gain market share in these regions. We also see growth in our womenswear, footwear and men's categories as we further develop these businesses and evolve as a lifestyle brand. Our shop-in-shop conversions are expected to generate incremental sales as consumers continue to respond favorably to the Michael Kors branded environment and love having a jet set experience with their favorite department stores. We are on track for the conversion of approximately 600 shop in shop locations globally this year, including 90 men's shops.
Third, in our licensing business, we anticipate a low double-digit growth rate this fiscal year. We see the biggest opportunity in fragrance and eyewear as consumer response to these collections has been very favorable, and we are excited about the potential for distribution expansion in addition to increased penetration in these categories. In watches, we expect the introduction of our new styles in calendar 2016 to drive improved performance in our fiscal fourth quarter. In addition, we are focused on adopting the exciting developments in wearable technology into the luxury fashion products that consumers expect from Michael Kors. Over time, we believe that we can become a leading brand in connected fashion accessories.
Finally, we plan to expand our international presence as we further develop our regional licenses. We are pleased with the strength in China and Southeast Asia, with double-digit comp growth in the first quarter reflecting the strong consumer response to our luxury fashion products and Michael Kors lifestyle brands. We are continuing to build momentum through strategic marketing events, key store openings and, of course, great product offerings. Brand awareness in these markets is accelerating, and we are more excited than ever about the opportunity in this region.
We look forward to continuing to execute on numerous growth initiatives that are currently underway. Near-term, we expect continued pressure from macroeconomic headwinds, including currency fluctuation, lower store traffic due to channel shift, reduced tourism in select markets and geopolitical issues. While these factors are expected to have an impact on our business, we continue to believe we have many growth opportunities that lay ahead for Michael Kors.
In the second half, we have a new national advertising campaign plan that transports our customers to jet set travel destinations and captures inspirational moments of the Michael Kors women. The campaign will engage her in all aspects of life with ads depicting glamorous backdrops appearing all communication channels, including print, catalog, billboards, social media and our own website. In fact, our digital flagship will lead our marketing efforts, offering her the most expansive expression of the Michael Kors brand and providing her with numerous opportunities to engage not only with our fashion brand but with Michael himself through our Destination Kors features, including Michael Edits and Travel Diaries. Importantly, it will allow us to continue to expand our social media presence across all platforms and connect more and more customers with our luxury brand.
I am also very proud of the philanthropic work that continues to be a cornerstone of Michael Kors' culture. You may have already seen that actress Kate Hudson recently teamed up with Michael to support our Watch Hunger Stop campaign treat. She will help us launch 2 new limited edition styles of the Bradshaw watch. And every sale of these special styles named the Bradshaw 100 will enable 100 children in need to receive a nutritious meal. Since launching in 2013, Watch Hunger Stop has helped deliver over 10 million meals to children in need, and we will continue working to build on a world without hunger.
As we look at our product for holiday, we are excited about our compelling gift offering focused on our current fashion trends such as backpacks, cross bodies and small leather goods, active footwear and watches featuring assorted leather bands. We expect this injection of newness and excitement to drive growth during the holiday selling season.
For spring 2016, we are introducing our largest assortment of new handbag groups as well as new watch styles that represents the most extensive presentation of innovative and new materials we have introduced to date. It's all about fashion, and we remain focused on offering our customers compelling on-trend product each season.
Overall, our brand remains strong driven by a powerful business model. We are focused on driving our direct-to-consumer business both through our digital flagships and our retail stores and building our wholesale presence through shop-in-shops. Our growth is rooted in our design leadership, and we will continue to expand our fashion offerings and deliver exceptional luxury products across all lifestyle categories. We will also continue to leverage our innovative marketing strategy to enhance our brand awareness worldwide. Looking ahead, we continue to believe that there's ample room to further build our business, and we remain on track to achieve our long-term growth initiatives. 
Now let me turn it over to Joe for a detailed review of our first quarter financial results and our updated outlook."
143971118,306947845,850557,"Michael Kors Holdings Limited, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 06, 2015",2015-08-06,"Earnings Calls","Capri Holdings Limited","Executives","Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Our financial results exceeded our guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2016. Total revenue grew 7.3% to $986.0 million as compared to $919.2 million last year.

Total revenue grew 7.3% to $986.0 million as compared to $919.2 million last year. As expected, foreign currency headwinds continued to impact our results this quarter. On a constant currency basis, total revenue grew 13.4%. 
By region, North American revenue increased 1.9%, Europe revenue increased 42.2% and Japan revenue increased 57.4%.
In our retail segment, net sales increased 9.0% to $523.3 million on a reported basis and increased 16.0% on a constant currency basis. Sales were driven by the opening of 107 net new stores since the first quarter of last year and a 101.6% increase in our North American digital flagship sales.
Comp store sales declined 9.5% on a reported basis and decreased 5.0% on a constant currency basis due to lower comp sales in North America, partially offset by an increase in comp sales in both Europe and Japan.
Our U.S. digital sales would have increased our global comp store sales by a low single-digit percentage on a constant currency basis.
We opened 24 new stores in the first quarter, 11 in North America, 10 in Europe and 3 in Japan. In addition, we expanded or relocated 11 stores. We ended the quarter with 550 company-owned retail stores, including concessions, and 774 stores overall, including our licensed locations.
Wholesale net sales grew 4.2% to $424.0 million for the first quarter. On a constant currency basis, wholesale sales increased 9.7%. The increase was driven by our accessories and womenswear categories, partially offset by lower footwear sales. Wholesale growth was also attributed to the expansion of our European operations. During the first quarter, we converted an additional 128 wholesale doors into shop-in-shops globally.
In our licensing segment, revenue grew 20.5% to $38.7 million for the quarter, led by our eyewear, jewelry and watch categories. We opened 33 new watch and jewelry shop-in-shops during the quarter and ended the quarter with 294 shop-in-shops globally.
Gross profit grew 5.6% to $603.6 million. Gross margin declined 100 basis points to 61.2%, which includes a 63 basis point foreign currency impact. The decline in gross margin was due to a 170 basis point decline in retail gross margins due to higher markdowns in our North American retail business, partially offset by higher full price sellthroughs in our European retail business, a 120 basis point decline in wholesale gross margin due to additional wholesale allowance in inventory reserves, partially offset by geographic mix. The retail and wholesale gross margin declines were partially offset by higher licensing gross margin dollars.
Total operating expense grew 20.4% to $355.0 million. The increase is attributable to our global investments, including our digital flagship initiatives, infrastructure and investment for Korea in the men's business, the buildout of our European distribution center and the continued investment in corporate systems and infrastructure. As a percent of total revenue, total operating expenses increased 390 basis points to 36.0%. This was below the 550 to 600 basis points of deleverage in our guidance as sales exceeded our expectations and depreciation expense was lower than anticipated.
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 17.9% to $313.5 million. The increase in SG&A expense was largely due to higher retail occupancy and salary costs related to new store openings, an increase in corporate employee-related expense primarily due to an increase in our corporate staff to support our global growth as well as other corporate operations-related costs. As a percent of total revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses were 31.8% compared to 28.9% for the first quarter of last year.
Depreciation and amortization expense increased 43.3% to $41.6 million for the first quarter, primarily due to new retail stores, new shop-in-shops, an increase in lease rates related to our new European stores and investments in our corporate facilities and IT infrastructure.
As a result of these factors, income from operations was $248.6 million or 25.2% of total revenue as compared to 30.1% of total revenue in the same period last year.
Retail operating margin declined 660 basis points, primarily due to a 490 basis point increase in operating expense attributable to higher store-related costs, corporate-allocated expenses and depreciation and amortization.
Wholesale operating margin declined 380 basis points, primarily due to 260 basis points increase in operating expenses attributable to higher corporate-allocated expenses and depreciation and amortization.
Licensing operating margin increased 420 basis points, primarily due to lower advertising costs, partially offset by higher costs related to protection of our intellectual property.
Income taxes were $72.7 million in the quarter, and our effective tax rate was 29.4% as compared to 32.0% in the same period last year. The decrease in our effective tax rate was primarily due to the increase of taxable income in certain non-U.S. subsidiaries, which are subject to lower statutory tax rates.
Net income was $174.4 million for the first quarter, and diluted earnings per share were $0.87 based upon 200.1 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding. The unfavorable currency impact to EPS was $0.06 per share.
Turning to the balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, cash and cash equivalents were $808.5 million as compared to $1.1 billion last year. There were no outstanding borrowings under our credit facility in either year.
During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 7 million shares totaling $350 million, bringing our total repurchase to date to approximately 13.8 million shares, totaling $841.9 million of our $1.5 billion authorization. These repurchases reflect the strength of our balance sheet and confidence in our ability to generate strong free cash flow. Our first priority will continue to be the strategic investment in our luxury brand to fully maximize our global growth opportunities. That said, given our strong balance sheet, we are confident that we will have the financial flexibility to continue with our share repurchase program.
Inventory increased 15.0% versus last year. Approximately 1/3 of the increase was related to early shipments of fall merchandise versus the prior year as we wanted to mitigate potential risks related to the West Coast port delay. Excluding these early shipments, inventory would have increased slightly ahead of our sales increase.
Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $106.0 million. These expenditures were related to the buildout of our new retail stores and shop-in-shops as well as investments in our information technology, distribution system enhancements and other infrastructure improvements. 
Before discussing guidance, I would note that subsequent to the first quarter, we obtained controlling interest in our Latin American joint venture, MK Panama Holdings, and we'll be consolidating MK Panama into our operations beginning with the second quarter. We are currently in the process of finalizing the new ownership structure and accounting, and while we may record fair value adjustments, we do not expect a material impact on our ongoing operating results. The impacts of these adjustments have not been included in our guidance.
Turning to our outlook. Our second quarter and full year guidance reflects our expectation that the retail environment will remain challenging and foreign currency will continue to be a headwind. For the second quarter, we expect total revenues to be between $1.06 billion and $1.08 billion. On a constant currency basis, total revenue is expected to increase in the high single-digit range, assuming a $60 million impact from the change in foreign currency rates. We expect a high single-digit comp store decrease on a reported basis and a low single-digit decrease on a constant currency.
Operating expenses as a percent of total revenue is expected to increase 440 to 490 basis points in the second quarter due to our global investment. We expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.86 to $0.90, assuming a tax rate of approximately 29.5% and 194 million shares outstanding.
We expect foreign currency to impact net income by approximately $11 million and EPS by approximately $0.06 for the second quarter.
For the full fiscal year, we continue to expect total revenue of between $4.7 billion and $4.8 billion. On a constant currency basis, total revenue is expected to increase in the low double-digit range, assuming a $192 million impact from the change in foreign currency rates. We expect low single-digit decline in comp store sales on a reported basis and flat comps on a constant currency basis.
We expect a sequential improvement in our comp store sales in the third and fourth quarters, driven by the inclusion of the U.S. e-commerce sales in the comp base, the rollout of Kors Concierge in our stores, the launch of our new national advertising campaign, the introduction of new innovative product offerings for holiday and spring 2016, diminished FX headwinds and easier year-over-year comps. Our overall top line will benefit from outperformance we saw in the first quarter, the increase in our digital flagship sale, the rollout of additional year retail locations and continued shop-in-shop conversions. As we stated in our last call, we anticipate the 53rd week to add approximately $40 million of additional sales in this fiscal year.
International gross margin will remain pressured in the second half as the favorable hedging contracts we entered into last year begin to expire. Operating expense as a percent of total revenue is expected to increase 140 to 180 basis points for the year. We expect the increase in operating expense as a percent of total revenue to moderate in the second half of the year as the rate of expense flows and we begin to anniversary the investments we made in 2015.
We continue to expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $4.40 to $4.50, assuming a tax rate of approximately 29% and 195 million shares outstanding. We expect foreign currency to impact net income by approximately $41 million and EPS by approximately $0.21 for the year.

What we said was that if you take our retail sales in our own stores and our department stores, we had growth in North America. So -- and that was high single digits in North America. So we believe that we are in fact growing market share in North America. We grew at a higher rate than we believe that the category did. And then I would also add that internationally, we -- when you add domestic and international together, we grew at double-digit rate. So again we believe that the category in North America is growing in low single-digit rate today. And we think that we are outpacing that growth by a fairly significant amount, again showing the health of our brand. And most importantly, really it's kudos to our design teams. We also mentioned to you that we're really excited about the fact that we're going to introduce the largest amount of new handbag groups this company has ever introduced. And we're doing that purposely. We think that there's an excitement level that we can generate with our customers. We've got probably one of the finest store fleets in the world in terms of locations. We have got such a great customer engagement going on today. We grew our social media channels by over 25% in the quarter. So she's responding, she's engaging. Newness is, without a question, what is driving her interest. And I just might add on that point, if you look at what's happening, there's some really good things starting to happen in the handbag business. Backpacks are starting to trend, and I think we're a leader in that category. I think we've caught it pretty early on. There's a very big shift towards smaller handbags and then cross bodies and small leather goods, particularly the millennial customer. It's the way that she's shopping, it's that way that she's wearing the product. You're going to see some very significant presentations from us on those categories. A little negative in the fact that when you're selling a smaller handbag or crossbody, it drives a little bit of your AUR down. And I think that's one of the things that you're seeing show up a little bit in some of the comp. But otherwise than that, the handbag business appears to be robust although not at the same level it grew at the past few years. And we like where we are positioned and the amount of market share that we continue to gain. So thank you very much, Kimberly."

We certainly see mall traffic continue to remain challenged. And our point of view on that is that there is absolutely a channel shift going on. Because when you look at our acceleration of our digital business growing at over 100% last quarter, and that's quite frankly with some -- still some issues with inside the distribution center, I might add that we have moved our Ohio distribution center into our California distribution center in Whittier as of last week. So we've done that to consolidate so that we can really take and have much better graft [ph] on the demand that's happening there and the further acceleration we think is going to continue out of that facility. And what you have is you have a customer who's able to shop no matter where they are just from a mobile device or from a desktop. And we think as at that continues, traffic inside the shopping centers are going to remain challenged. That being said, one of the categories that really impacted our comp store sales was watches, and that's we think a cyclical issue. Although there are some product challenges there that we think we can really go after. But you'll start to see a little bit in our third quarter but mostly in our fourth quarter. So we are encouraged by the concept that this new product is going to be flowing into our stores starting third quarter and then heavily in the fourth quarter first. Secondly, we're going to start to go up against the initial declines in the watch business, so that will become a little easier for us to comp against. If you remember, Q1 and Q2 were huge comps that we're up against from last year. The comps that we're up against in Q3 and Q4 are a little easier. And we also start to some of the FX tailwinds or headwinds start to burn off a little bit hopefully let's pray that, that continues, the dollar and the euro, in particular stay stabilized. So we'll get some of the benefits of that. And then with omnichannel coming on board for us in our third quarter and Kors Concierge being launched, we think we're going to have a real opportunity in our stores to be able to maximize sales with better inventory management in terms of point of location and distribution. And we just also think that we're going to have a much more comprehensive engagement with our customer on how we are going to be selling to them having all of our sales associates armed with digital information on the broadest assortment. When you look at 2,500 square-foot store for us on average, and they can maybe show 40% or 50% of our assortment. And now the sales associates will have access and a selling tool to show close to 100% of our assortment.

We did say that last quarter, we did get a little more promotional, and really that's just clearing some merchandise through our stores as we had normalization, and our comps slowed down a little quicker than we had anticipated. I think we've got a fairly good grasp on that. But we are anticipating the gross margin on a year-on-year basis to be down about 1 point for the company, and I think we still feel that's really where it is. Part of that is going to be impacted by foreign currency, and part of that is going to be impacted by the addition of some markdowns and some additional allowances in the wholesale channel. So I think we feel pretty good about the vision on that. In terms of the watch, we really don't quantify the breakdowns of that. I want to mention that the watch issues for us are North American issue, and we have not seen that same deceleration in Europe or in Asia in the category. So if you saw in our actual a licensing, we said that one of the reasons why our licensing revenues were up was because of watches. So we're getting positive growth outside the United States. Now that is being impacted by constant currency though, unfortunately, or FX headwinds. So we're -- we're achieving very nice gains in Europe, some of that's just being counteracted by the currency translation. And in jewelry, jewelry continues to be a category that we believe in, that we think can offer great success long-term for the company. We've got some pretty interesting initiatives that we're going to I think talk to you about on the next call where we think we can accelerate that category with a few things that we're working on there. So all in all, again, the bigger piece of our comp decline is -- was caused by watches."

And we made the decision a little over 2 years ago to build out a very significant and sustainable infrastructure to support our growth in terms of warehousing distribution. We'll be finished with those projects mid-calendar next year. So that really will be up and running, and we think we're going to start to see benefits from those initiatives that we put in place. We're already beginning, after extensive renovation of our Whittier facility, we are starting to see our ability to drive cost down in that facility as well. And then both of these facilities, the one in Europe Benlow and then Whittier, what we're excited about is they'll be fully integrated facilities that will handle our retail, wholesale and our growing e-commerce business. And really, it's going to give us the ability to access inventory very, very quickly, in particular, for this e-commerce business, which is just growing at breakneck speed. So we think that those investments, some of them might look a bit painful right now are actually great investments for this company in the long-term. Secondly, we're building out our corporate offices here. We have added a lot of square footage, because while I know there's a lot of commentary about how Michael Kors is struggling. In fact we grew 30% last year. This year we're going to do close to $4.7 billion, $4.8 billion. We've had to add a lot of people, we had to put some office space to add those people. And we're proud of that, and we are building a world class facility for those people to work in because of the company we made the decision we want to be able to hire not just for our industry but from some of the best tech companies in the world and really draw  the talent that can help drive this company for the future. And the last part of our expense initiatives has been talent, and we're really bringing some world-class people to help build and run this business. A great example of that is the men's, where we just hired part sell who headed up design for Hugo Boss and we hired Mark. So we say we're going to build the men's business, we're building in bringing world class people to build businesses and we're putting resources behind them to be successful. So that's a long-winded way of saying, those investments we're really not going to have that kind of step up investment in fiscal 2017. We anticipate CapEx to start to come down as a trend also in 2017. So we're going to start to get some real leverage on our SG&A as we go forward. Lastly, in terms of outlet versus full price, both channels, we're seeing mall traffic decline in the outlet channel is very, very small. But -- and I think other people have discussed it in the most traffic in the United States, you can check that from shopper track, is about -- it's kind of high single digits, mid to high single-digit decline in terms of the traffic. We see that from the information that they're providing, and we're tracking in that same kind of range."

And when you're the size of company that we are and you have the position in the marketplace that we do, we believe, in America, Michael is the #1 leading American designer in the world. And that's taking that position. We have to offer exciting new product. And we want to take a little bit further stab at make sure the customer understands that's what we stand for. And the great news is some of the things that we've been doing are really getting some good traction. Our newness sellthroughs are really performing at probably the best levels that we've had in 3 years. So we are terribly excited about that. And in the watch category, I would tell you that we believe that we've probably not had enough newness in that category. And so as we talked about earlier, the platforms that you're going to see introduced there in terms of new metal materials, in terms of new acetates, and we're going to continue on this leather band program, which we think is a very important initiative for us. We think it's going to drive a lot of interest and a lot of engagement with our customer to continue to look at Michael Kors as their fashion wardrobe and resource. The last thing I'll just add to you is wearables is something, as you know, our company and Fossil are really dedicated to. And we've been cautious, and we've taken our time to make sure that when we introduce our program, which will be coming for fall of 2016, that it is robust and it is something that is well thought out and that our customer will understand how it fits into her lifestyle and his lifestyle. And we are excited. And I would tell you that we think that, that entire category is something that we think will begin to revolutionize the fashion watch business as people look for more technology inside of the watch that they buy. And as you know, today, we view watches as a fashion accessory, not just a watch. So this will really kind of almost take it back to its original roots that it will do more for you than being just a fashion accessory. And then I'm gong to say one thing and then turn it over to Joe on a free cash flow. As we've said on our previous 2 calls, we -- the management of this company and our Board of Directors feel very strongly about the value in terms of repurchasing stock, in particular at what we consider to be a price level that is not where our company belongs. And given that, you saw how aggressive we were during the last quarter been buying back shares. We will continue to be aggressive as long as there's displacement in terms of what we think is the appropriate value for the company and the share price. I'll turn it over to Joe in terms of what that means for the cash flow."

So -- I don't think we said that we were underlevered. We believe that having a company that operates with a strong balance sheet is the right way to build a luxury company. Other companies don't run their businesses that way, but I think the luxury company should be one with a strong balance sheet, of which we've done from the date that we really went public. And in terms of our priorities, as Joe said, number one, we're going to do continue to invest in the company. The good news is that has to be made these big investment, the buildout of our corporate offices, we built a lot of retail stores and shop-in-shops over the last 5 years. And many of those initiatives are going to start to burn down over the next 24 months, which will give us even more free cash flow as we move forward. So our second priority then is going to be to continue to buy back stock and at these levels, we find it incredibly attractive, and we'll continue to be aggressive about doing that. And thirdly, we've said before that when certain licenses become available to us, and we're doing 2 right now, we're doing Korea, and we are doing a majority ownership of our Panama South America, and they're either strategically correct for us to look at or they're going to create positive earnings for us, we will look at buying those. So as Joe said before, we want dry powder to be able to do that. And there might be other things that we would look at as an organization as well. But we'll take a look at that as we get further down the road We have great infrastructure. We could leverage other things off of this infrastructure. So we think we've got a very clear vision. But we don't think adding a lot of debt to the company would be something that would be of interest to running a luxury at this company at this point in time. And before we would entertain dividend, we want to make sure that we had looked at all the other initiatives which would generate profitability and be accretive for the company.

Joan, first thing, just so you know, we mentioned in our fourth quarter call there is about $100 million on an annual basis that will move out of North American wholesale into our international Asia category because we are shipping and servicing certain of our retail accounts out of that facility now. We have a warehouse, we have an operation in Hong Kong led by Ted, who is a former Senior Vice President of Tiffany Asia. And so that's DFS and some of our licensed businesses are all serviced out of there, so you just know that for the future. Secondly, if you look at our wholesale business in North America, as I said before, our accessories business was up high single digit. Our footwear business was actually up very strong double-digit. But as Joe mentioned before, the footwear shipments were flat to slightly down. And the reason for that is, remember, we're going up against in footwear an example installing a lot of shops last year. So a lot of that gets into a pipeline. And then secondly, as we see the department store channel in North America slowing down because you know that, you know that the Department stores here are not posting robust results, we've decided to reduce the amount of inventory that we are starting to put into that channel because we don't want to have a lot of markdowns showing up inside the channel. So I would say we still believe, obviously, in growth in the North American wholesale channel. And it will be in the kind of single-digity type range for us because, a, the channel is not quite robust right now; and b, we have dominant market share in many of those channels. And as you know no, it's no secret, in handbag, we're the #1 in that channel. In watches, we're the #1 in that channel. In footwear today, in most accounts, we're the #1 in that channel. So as that channel goes a little bit is how we're going to go. I might add though that on the flip side, the e-commerce portion of the department store business in North America is really robust. You're talking very, very strong double-digit growth at all of our department store partners. So while you'll see us begin to end the shop-in-shop installation in the United States over the next 12 to 18 months and that's again as planned as when we went public and we had talked about with the exclusion of men's, which still be robust rollout, we're going to growth in the Department stores and most of that is going to come from the e-commerce portion and then obviously some comp store growth inside there -- inside of our shop-in-shops that we put in as well. So hopefully that gives you an answer to the North American wholesale business."

So there are some funny stuff going on over there. We also are being a little bit hurt by -- we have a very big business in the U.K. And the strength of the pound to the euro is hurting a little bit some of the business in the marketplace. So was that normalizes as well, we're feeling good about Europe for Q2 and for the back half of the year. Still see good strength there. We still see an opportunity to expand the marketplace. And again, we grew on reported on a constant currency basis 47% in that marketplace. That is a lot of growth, and we still have a long way to go in terms of increasing the brand awareness. So we feel pretty good about Europe. And just on the international note, Asia is really strong for the company. What we're seeing happening for us in China and in Southeast Asia and in Japan is really breathtaking. Same thing we said on this call many years ago and told you that we were going to invest in Japan and lost money there for years, we are now making money. The comps look great.

We've said that North America, we're going to open 400 stores and we're going to have 200 stores in Europe and 100 stores in Japan, et cetera. And when we set those targets, we're way below what other competitors are in terms of their distribution. And I also might add that we also set those targets with a very clear eye to how many full price and how many outlet stores we've had and we've had that with the very clear target about how many Department stores we've had. So all of that has been a really deeply thought-out by city, by location, et cetera. And then of course over the last 2 years, we've seen e-commerce take on a much bigger role in I think everyone's projection in terms of what that will be of their total retail business. And we believe that, that's going to be approximately 20% of our sales over the next few years. That all being said, we make a lot of money in our retail stores. We have a handful of stores that we don't make money on. Some of those are flagships that we want from standpoint in the city. Some of those are just stores that may be producing at the level that we want to. But we don't open stores unless they're profitable. So even if e-commerce becomes 20% of our overall revenues, 80% -- retail revenues, I apologize, retail revenues, 80% is still going to come from freestanding stores. So we still believe that if you live in Arkansas, you live in Omaha, or you live in New York, you should have the ability to be able to go into a store and shop that store with Michael Kors product. And I think we're very careful about where we distribute our product, and I think we're very proud of the shopping centers that we are in, street locations and where we've positioned the brand up against our luxury or with our luxury competitors and/or with some of our U.S. neighbors as well. So we're still feeling good about our rollout. And again, that rollout is going to come to an end here pretty shortly, particularly in North America. It would be over with in the next 24 months and then there we'll really be looking at all of our growth coming out of comp from a retail standpoint.
I'd like to say thank you to everyone for joining us today and look forward to keeping you updated on the growth and the progress that we're making on our growth initiatives in our next call. Have a great day."

I'll begin with a quick review of the quarter and then provide an update on some of our growth initiatives.I'm pleased to report that our luxury bra",1465,"Thank you, Krystyna. Good morning, and welcome to Michael Kors' First Quarter Fiscal 2016 Earnings Call. I'll begin with a quick review of the quarter and then provide an update on some of our growth initiatives.
I'm pleased to report that our luxury brand continues to achieve global growth. Total revenue increased 7% or 13% on a constant-currency basis for the first quarter of fiscal 2016. In constant currency, we saw a revenue growth of approximately 2% in North America, 42% in Europe and 57% in Japan. Although we are at different stages of development in each of our regions, we continue to drive top line growth and believe consumers view Michael Kors as a leading luxury fashion brand.
Our first quarter financial results exceeded expectations, driven by better-than-anticipated performance in both our retail and wholesale segments. The increase in retail net sales was attributable to new stores and accelerated growth in our North American digital flagships, which experienced 102% year-over-year increase.
Global comparable store sales declined 9.5%, or 5% on a constant-currency basis, slightly better than we had expected. We saw continued momentum in our international markets with mid-single-digit comp growth in Europe and strong double-digit increase in Japan in constant currency. In North America, we experienced a high single-digit comp decline, reflecting a channel shift to online purchases and the continuation of reduced mall traffic. In addition, the continued decline in watch sales had a meaningful impact in the quarter as expected, and we saw a continued shift toward smaller-sized handbags along with increased demand for crossbodies and small leather goods, which is resulting in an overall lower average unit retail. If we include our U.S. digital flagship sales in our comp base, our North American comparable store sales would have decreased in the mid-single-digit range. 
Global wholesale growth was led by continued strength in our accessories and ready to wear categories. Notably, when looking at our company-owned stores sales combined with department store sales, on a retail basis, our accessories business grew at a low double-digit rate globally and a high single-digit rate in North America. We believe this represents a higher growth rate than the category as a whole, suggesting that we continue to take market share and demonstrate the strength of the Michael Kors brand.
Lastly, the increase in our licensing revenue in the first quarter was related to sales of eyewear, jewelry and watches.
Earnings per share results were better than expected at $0.87 for the quarter, including the unfavorable impact from foreign currency of $0.06 per share.
Turning to some highlights on our key growth initiatives. First, we are driving our direct-to-consumer business worldwide through the development of our digital flagships as well as expanding our footprints across North America, Europe and Asia. We expect our omnichannel initiatives, combined with our retail expansion, to drive double-digit sales growth in this segment this fiscal year as we continue to provide a jet-set shopping experience to our customers.
We are increasing our retail store openings from 85 to 100 locations this year, with the addition of 8 locations in North America, 5 in Europe and 2 in Japan. We are also excited about the expansion of our men's in the retail channel and continue to believe there is a potential for as many as 500 men's locations worldwide. In addition, we look forward to driving growth in our Korean business as we transition these stores in-house by the end of the year.
Second, in our wholesale business. We see low single-digit growth this year, stemming from both increased penetration across product categories as well as through the conversion of department store doors into shop-in-shops globally. We expect sales increases in our accessories business across regions, including in North America, to be driven by overall category growth as well as through increased penetration in both Europe and Asia as we gain market share in these regions.
We also see growth in our womenswear, footwear and men's categories as we further develop these businesses and evolve as a lifestyle brand. Our shop-in-shop conversions are expected to generate incremental sales as consumers continue to respond favorably to the Michael Kors branded environment and love having a jet-set experience with their favorite department stores. We are on track for the conversion of approximately 600 shop-in-shop locations globally this year, including 90 men's shops.
Third, in our licensing business, we anticipate a low double-digit growth rate this fiscal year. We see the biggest opportunity in fragrance and eyewear as consumer response to these collections has been very favorable, and we are excited about the potential for distribution expansion in addition to increased penetration in these categories.
In watches, we expect the introduction of our new styles in calendar 2016 to drive improved performance in our fiscal fourth quarter. In addition, we are focused on adapting the exciting developments in wearable technology into the luxury fashion products that consumers expect from Michael Kors. Over time, we believe that we can become a leading brand in connected fashion accessories.
Finally, we plan to expand our international presence as we further develop our regional licenses. We are pleased with the strength in China and Southeast Asia, with double-digit comp growth in the first quarter reflecting the strong consumer response to our luxury fashion products and Michael Kors lifestyle brand. We are continuing to build momentum through strategic marketing events, key store openings and, of course, great product offerings. Brand awareness in these markets is accelerating, and we are more excited than ever about the opportunity in this region.
We look forward to continuing to execute on numerous growth initiatives that are currently underway. Near term, we expect continued pressure from macroeconomic headwinds, including currency fluctuation, lower store traffic due to channel shift, reduced tourism in select markets and geopolitical issues. While these factors are expected to have an impact on our business, we continue to believe we have many growth opportunities that lay ahead for Michael Kors.
In the second half, we have a new national advertising campaign plan that transports our customers to jet-set travel destination and captures inspirational moments of the Michael Kors women. The campaign will engage her in all aspects of life with ads depicting glamorous backdrops appearing across all communication channels, including print, catalog, billboards, social media and our own website. In fact, our digital flagship will lead our marketing efforts, offering her the most expansive expression of the Michael Kors brand and providing her with numerous opportunities to engage not only with our fashion brand but with Michael himself through our Destination Kors features, including Michael's Edits and Travel Diaries. Importantly, it will allow us to continue to expand our social media presence across all platforms and connect more and more customers with our luxury brand.
I am also very proud of the philanthropic work that continues to be a cornerstone of Michael Kors' culture. You may have already seen that actress Kate Hudson recently teamed up with Michael to support our Watch Hunger Stop campaign. She will help us launch 2 new limited-edition styles of the Bradshaw watch. And every sale of these special styles named the Bradshaw 100 will enable 100 children in need to receive a nutritious meal. Since launching in 2013, Watch Hunger Stop has helped deliver over 10 million meals to children in need, and we will continue working to build on a world without hunger.
As we look at our product for holiday, we are excited about our compelling gift offering focused on our current fashion trends such as backpacks, crossbodies and small leather goods, active footwear and watches featuring assorted leather bands. We expect this injection of newness and excitement to drive growth during the holiday selling season.
For spring 2016, we are introducing our largest assortment of new handbag groups as well as new watch styles that represents the most extensive presentation of innovative and new materials we have introduced to date. It's all about fashion, and we remain focused on offering our customers compelling on-trend product each season.
Overall, our brand remains strong, driven by a powerful business model. We are focused on driving our direct-to-consumer business both through our digital flagships and our retail stores and building our wholesale presence through shop-in-shops.
Our growth is rooted in our design leadership, and we will continue to expand our fashion offerings and deliver exceptional luxury products across all lifestyle categories. We will also continue to leverage our innovative marketing strategy to enhance our brand awareness worldwide. Looking ahead, we continue to believe that there's ample room to further build our business, and we remain on track to achieve our long-term growth initiatives.
Now let me turn it over to Joe for a detailed review of our first quarter financial results and our updated outlook."

Total revenue grew 7.3% to $986.0 million as compared to $919.2 million last year. As expected, foreign currency headwinds continued to impact our results this quarter. On a constant-currency basis, total revenue grew 13.4%.
By region, North American revenue increased 1.9%, Europe revenue increased 42.2% and Japan revenue increased 57.4%.
In our retail segment, net sales increased 9.0% to $523.3 million on a reported basis and increased 16.0% on a constant-currency basis. Sales were driven by the opening of 107 net new stores since the first quarter of last year and a 101.6% increase in our North American digital flagship sales.
Comp store sales declined 9.5% on a reported basis and decreased 5.0% on a constant-currency basis due to lower comp sales in North America, partially offset by an increase in comp sales in both Europe and Japan.
Our U.S. digital sales would have increased our global comp store sales by a low single-digit percentage on a constant-currency basis.
We opened 24 new stores in the first quarter: 11 in North America, 10 in Europe and 3 in Japan. In addition, we expanded or relocated 11 stores. We ended the quarter with 550 company-owned retail stores, including concessions, and 774 stores overall, including our licensed locations.
Wholesale net sales grew 4.2% to $424.0 million for the first quarter. On a constant-currency basis, wholesale sales increased 9.7%. The increase was driven by our accessories and womenswear categories, partially offset by lower footwear sales. Wholesale growth was also attributed to the expansion of our European operations. During the first quarter, we converted an additional 128 wholesale doors into shop-in-shops globally.
In our licensing segment, revenue grew 20.5% to $38.7 million for the quarter, led by our eyewear, jewelry and watch categories. We opened 33 new watch and jewelry shop-in-shops during the quarter and ended the quarter with 294 shop-in-shops globally.
Gross profit grew 5.6% to $603.6 million. Gross margin declined 100 basis points to 61.2%, which includes a 63 basis point foreign currency impact. The decline in gross margin was due to a 170 basis point decline in retail gross margins due to higher markdowns in our North American retail business, partially offset by higher full-price sell-throughs in our European retail business, a 120 basis point decline in wholesale gross margin due to additional wholesale allowance in inventory reserves, partially offset by geographic mix. The retail and wholesale gross margin declines were partially offset by higher licensing gross margin dollars.
Total operating expense grew 20.4% to $355.0 million. The increase is attributable to our global investments, including our digital flagship initiatives, infrastructure and investment for Korea in the men's business, the buildout of our European distribution center and the continued investment in corporate systems and infrastructure. As a percent of total revenue, total operating expenses increased 390 basis points to 36.0%. This was below the 550 to 600 basis points of deleverage in our guidance as sales exceeded our expectation and depreciation expense was lower than anticipated.
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 17.9% to $313.5 million. The increase in SG&A expense was largely due to higher retail occupancy and salary costs related to new store openings, an increase in corporate employee-related expense primarily due to an increase in our corporate staff to support our global growth as well as other corporate operations-related costs. As a percent of total revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses were 31.8%, compared to 28.9% for the first quarter of last year.
Depreciation and amortization expense increased 43.3% to $41.6 million for the first quarter, primarily due to new retail stores, new shop-in-shops, an increase in lease rates related to our new European stores and investments in our corporate facilities and IT infrastructure.
As a result of these factors, income from operations was $248.6 million or 25.2% of total revenue as compared to 30.1% of total revenue in the same period last year.
Retail operating margin declined 660 basis points, primarily due to a 490 basis point increase in operating expense attributable to higher store-related costs, corporate-allocated expenses and depreciation and amortization.
Wholesale operating margin declined 380 basis points, primarily due to 260 basis point increase in operating expenses attributable to higher corporate-allocated expenses and depreciation and amortization.
Licensing operating margin increased 420 basis points, primarily due to lower advertising costs, partially offset by higher costs related to protection of our intellectual property.
Income taxes were $72.7 million in the quarter, and our effective tax rate was 29.4% as compared to 32.0% in the same period last year. The decrease in our effective tax rate was primarily due to the increase of taxable income in certain non-U.S. subsidiaries, which are subject to lower statutory tax rates.
Net income was $174.4 million for the first quarter, and diluted earnings per share were $0.87 based upon 200.1 million weighted-average diluted shares outstanding. The unfavorable currency impact to EPS was $0.06 per share.
Turning to the balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, cash and cash equivalents were $808.5 million as compared to $1.1 billion last year. There were no outstanding borrowings under our credit facility in either year.
During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 7 million shares, totaling $350 million, bringing our total repurchase to date to approximately 13.8 million shares, totaling $841.9 million of our $1.5 billion authorization. These repurchases reflect the strength of our balance sheet and confidence in our ability to generate strong free cash flow. Our first priority will continue to be the strategic investment in our luxury brand to fully maximize our global growth opportunities. That said, given our strong balance sheet, we are confident that we will have the financial flexibility to continue with our share repurchase program.
Inventory increased 15.0% versus last year. Approximately 1/3 of the increase was related to early shipments of fall merchandise versus the prior year as we wanted to mitigate potential risks related to the West Coast port delay. Excluding these early shipments, inventory would have increased slightly ahead of our sales increase.
Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $106.0 million. These expenditures were related to the buildout of our new retail stores and shop-in-shops as well as investments in our information technology, distribution system enhancements and other infrastructure improvements.
Before discussing guidance, I would note that subsequent to the first quarter, we obtained controlling interest in our Latin American joint venture, MK Panama Holdings, and we'll be consolidating MK Panama into our operations beginning with the second quarter. We are currently in the process of finalizing the new ownership structure and accounting, and while we may record fair value adjustments, we do not expect a material impact on our ongoing operating results. The impacts of these adjustments have not been included in our guidance.
Turning to our outlook. Our second quarter and full year guidance reflects our expectation that the retail environment will remain challenging and foreign currency will continue to be a headwind. For the second quarter, we expect total revenues to be between $1.06 billion and $1.08 billion. On a constant-currency basis, total revenue is expected to increase in the high single-digit range, assuming a $60 million impact from the change in foreign currency rates. We expect a high single-digit comp store decrease on a reported basis and a low single-digit decrease on a constant currency.
Operating expenses as a percent of total revenue is expected to increase 440 to 490 basis points in the second quarter due to our global investments. We expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.86 to $0.90, assuming a tax rate of approximately 29.5% and 194 million shares outstanding.
We expect foreign currency to impact net income by approximately $11 million and EPS by approximately $0.06 for the second quarter.
For the full fiscal year, we continue to expect total revenue of between $4.7 billion and $4.8 billion. On a constant-currency basis, total revenue is expected to increase in the low double-digit range, assuming a $192 million impact from the change in foreign currency rates. We expect low single-digit decline in comp store sales on a reported basis and flat comps on a constant-currency basis.
We expect a sequential improvement in our comp store sales in the third and fourth quarters, driven by the inclusion of the U.S. e-commerce sales in the comp base, the rollout of Kors Concierge in our stores, the launch of our new national advertising campaign, the introduction of new innovative product offerings for holiday and spring 2016, diminished FX headwinds and easier year-over-year comps.
Our overall top line will benefit from the outperformance we saw in the first quarter, the increase in our digital flagship sales, the rollout of additional retail locations and continued shop-in-shop conversions. As we stated in our last call, we anticipate the 53rd week to add approximately $40 million of additional sales in this fiscal year.
International gross margin will remain pressured in the second half as the favorable hedging contracts we entered into last year begin to expire. Operating expense as a percent of total revenue is expected to increase 140 to 180 basis points for the year. We expect the increase in operating expense as a percent of total revenue to moderate in the second half of the year as the rate of expense flows and we'll begin to anniversary the investments we made in 2015.
We continue to expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $4.40 to $4.50, assuming a tax rate of approximately 29% and 195 million shares outstanding. We expect foreign currency to impact net income by approximately $41 million and EPS by approximately $0.21 for the year.
I will now turn the call back to John for closing remarks."

So we believe that we are, in fact, growing market share in North America. We grew at a higher rate than we believe that the category did. And then I would also add that, internationally, we -- when you add both domestic and international together, we grew at double-digit rate. So again, we believe that the category in North America is growing in low single-digit rate today. And we think that we are outpacing that growth by a fairly significant amount, again showing the health of our brand. And most importantly, really it's kudos to our design teams. We also mentioned to you that we're really excited about the fact that we're going to introduce the largest amount of new handbag groups this company has ever introduced. And we're doing that purposely. We think that there's an excitement level that we can generate with our customers. We've got probably one of the finest store fleets in the world in terms of locations. We have got such a great customer engagement going on today. We grew our social media channels by over 25% in the quarter. So she's responding, she's engaging. Newness is, without a question, what is driving her interest. And I just might add on that point, if you look at what's happening, there's really good things starting to happen in the handbag business. Backpacks are starting to trend, and I think we're a leader in that category. I think we've caught it pretty early on. There's a very big shift towards smaller handbags and then crossbodies and small leather goods, particularly the millennial customer. It's the way that she's shopping, it's that way that she's wearing the product. You're going to see some very significant presentations from us on those categories. A little negative in the fact that, when you're selling a smaller handbag or crossbody, it drives a little bit of your AUR down. And I think that's one of the things that you're seeing show up a little bit in some of the comp. But otherwise than that, the handbag business appears to be robust, although not at the same level it grew at, at the past few years. And we like where we're positioned and the amount of market share that we continue to gain. So thank you very much, Kimberly."

And our point of view on that is that there is absolutely a channel shift going on because when you look at our acceleration of our digital business growing at over 100% last quarter, and that's, quite frankly, with still some issues with inside the distribution center, I might add that we, by the way, have moved our Ohio distribution center into our California distribution center in Whittier as of last week. So we've done that to consolidate so that we can really take and have much better grasp on the demand that's happening there, and the further acceleration, we think, that's going to continue out of that facility. And what you have is you have a customer who's able to shop no matter where they are, just from a mobile device or from a desktop. And we think, as at that continues, traffic inside the shopping centers are going to remain challenged. That being said, one of the categories that really impacted our comp store sales was watches, and that's, we think, a cyclical issue. Although there are some product challenges there that we think we can really go after, that you'll start to see a little bit in our third quarter, but mostly in our fourth quarter. So we're encouraged by the concept that this new product is going to be flowing into our stores starting third quarter and then heavily in the fourth quarter first. Secondly, we're going to start to go up against the initial declines in the watch business, so that will become a little easier for us to comp against. If you remember, Q1 and Q2 were huge comps that we're up against from last year. The comps that we're up against in Q3 and Q4 are a little easier. And we also start to -- some of the FX tailwinds or headwinds start to burn off a little bit, hopefully. Let's pray that, that continues to, the dollar and the euro in particular, stay stabilized. So we'll get some of the benefits of that. And then with omnichannel coming on board for us in our third quarter and Kors Concierge being launched, we think we're going to have a real opportunity in our stores to be able to maximize sales with better inventory management in terms of point of location and distribution. And we just also think that we're going to have a much more comprehensive engagement with our customer on how we're going to be selling to them, having all of our sales associates armed with digital information on the broadest assortment. You look at a 2,500 square-foot store for us on average, and there's -- they can maybe show 40% or 50% of our assortment. And now, the sales associates will have access and a selling tool to show close to 100% of our assortment. We think that's going to add up to some significant improvement in sales inside of our own stores. Thank you, Omar."

The gross margin impact, we have said consistently that we really haven't changed our promotional cadence almost since we started the company. We did say that last quarter, we did get a little more promotional, and really that's just clearing some merchandise through our stores as we had normalization, and our comps slowed down a little quicker than we had anticipated. I think we've got a fairly good grasp on that. But we're anticipating the gross margin, on a year-on-year basis, to be down about 1 point for the company, and I think we still feel that's really where it is. Part of that is going to be impacted by foreign currency, and part of that is going to be impacted by the addition of some markdowns and some additional allowances in the wholesale channel. So I think we feel pretty good about the vision on that. In terms of the watch, we really don't quantify the breakdowns of that. I want to mention that the watch issues for us are North American issue, and we have not seen that same deceleration in Europe or in Asia in the category. So if you saw in our actual licensing, we said that one of the reasons why our licensing revenues were up was because of watches. So we're getting positive growth outside the United States. Now that is being impacted by constant currency, though, unfortunately, or FX headwinds. So we're -- in Fossil, we're achieving some very nice gains in Europe, some of that's just being counteracted by the currency translation. And in jewelry, jewelry continues to be a category that we believe in, that we think can offer great success, long term, for the company. We've got some pretty interesting initiatives that we're going to I think talk to you about on the next call where we think we can accelerate that category with a few things that we're working on there. So all in all, again, the bigger piece of our comp decline did -- was caused, though, by watches."

And we made a decision a little over 2 years ago to build out a very significant and sustainable infrastructure to support our growth in terms of warehouse and distribution. We'll be finished with those projects mid-calendar next year. So that really will be up and running, and we think we're going to start to see benefits from those initiatives that we put in place. We're already beginning -- after extensive renovation of our Whittier facility, we're starting to see our ability to drive cost down in that facility as well. And then both of these facilities, the one in Europe, Benlow, and then Whittier, what we're excited about is they'll be fully integrated facilities that will handle our retail, wholesale and our growing e-commerce business. And really, it's going to give us the ability to access inventory very, very quickly. In particular, for this e-commerce business, which is just growing at breakneck speed. So we think that those investments, some of them might look a bit painful right now, are actually great investments for this company in the long term. Secondly, we're building out our corporate offices here. We have a lot of square footage because, while I know there's a lot of commentary about how Michael Kors is struggling, in fact we grew 30% last year. This year, we're going to do close to $4.7 billion, $4.8 billion. We've had to add a lot of people, we had to put some office space to add those people. And we're proud of that, and we are building a world class facility for those people to work and because, as a company, we made a decision we want to be able to hire not just for our industry but from some of the best tech companies in the world and really draw  the talent that's going to help drive this company for the future. And the last part of our expense initiatives has been talent, and we're really bringing in some world-class people to help build and run this business. A great example of that is the men's, where we just hired Marcel Oswalt, who headed up design for Hugo Boss, and we hired Mark Brashear. So we say we're going to build the men's business, we're building in bringing world class people to build businesses and we're putting resources behind them to be successful. So that's a long-winded way of saying, those investments we're really not going to have that kind of step up investment in fiscal 2017. We anticipate CapEx to start to come down as a trend also in 2017. So we're going to start to get some real leverage on our SG&A as we go forward. Lastly, in terms of outlet versus full price, both channels we're seeing mall traffic decline in the outlet channel is very, very small. But the -- and I think it's -- our other people have discussed it. The mall traffic in the United States, you can check that from shopper track, is about -- it's kind of high single digits, mid to high single-digit decline in terms of the traffic. We see that from the information that they're providing, and we're tracking in that same kind of range."

Our design teams have just come up with some fabulous new products, and I might say, it's in handbags, it's in our women's ready-to-wear and in our footwear categories. And when you're the size of company that we are and you have the position in the marketplace that we do, we believe, in America, Michael is the #1 leading American designer in the world. And as to taking that position, we have to offer exciting new products. And we want to take a little bit further stab at making sure the customer understands that's what we stand for. And the great news is that some of the things that we've been doing are really getting some good traction. Our newness sell-throughs are really performing at probably the best levels that we've had in 3 years, so we're terribly excited about that. And in the watch category, I would tell you that we believe that we've probably not had enough newness in that category. And so as we talked about earlier, the platforms that you're going to see introduced there in terms of new metal materials, in terms of new acetates, and we're going to continue on this leather band program, which we think is a very important initiative for us. We think it's going to drive a lot of interest and a lot of engagement with our customer to continue to look at Michael Kors as their fashion wardrobe and resource. The last thing I'll just add to you is wearables is something, as you know, our company and Fossil are really dedicated to. And we've been cautious and we've taken our time to make sure that when we introduce our program, which will be coming for fall of 2016, that it is robust and it is something that's well thought out and that our customer will understand how it fits into her lifestyle and his lifestyle. And we're excited, and I would tell you that we think that, that entire category is something that we think will begin to revolutionize the fashion watch business as people look for more technology inside of the watch that they buy. And as you know, today, we view watches as a fashion accessory, not just a watch. So this will really kind of almost take it back to its original roots that it will do more for you than being just a fashion accessory. And then I'm gong to say one thing and then it over to Joe on a free cash flow. As we've said on our previous 2 calls, we -- the management of this company and our Board of Directors feel very strongly about the value in terms of repurchasing stock, in particular, at what we consider to be a price level that is not where our company belongs. And given that, you saw how aggressive we were during the last quarter in buying back shares. We will continue to be aggressive as long as there is displacement in terms of what we think is the appropriate value for the company and the share price. I'll turn it over to Joe in terms of what that means to the cash flows."

Why not pursue an alternative capital structure if the company is underlevered? And I guess, 2 other questions related to that is, from a cash-use perspective, what about thinking about a dividend? And how should we be thinking about it, it sounds like you said something about you bought in Panama. How should we be thinking about the Far East Holdings Limited business? How should we be thinking about that part?"

So we -- I don't think we said that we were underlevered. We believe that having a company that operates with a strong balance sheet is the right way to build a luxury company. Other companies don't run their businesses that way, but we think a luxury company should be run with a strong balance sheet, of which we've done from the date that we really went public. And in terms of our priorities, as Joe said, number one, we're going to continue to invest in the company. The good news is, is we've made these big investments, the buildout of Venlo, the buildout of our corporate offices. We've built a lot of retail stores and shop-in-shops over the last 5 years. And many of those initiatives are going to start to burn down over the next 24 months, which will give us even more free cash flow as we move forward. So our second priority then is going to be to continue to buy back stock and, at these levels, we find it incredibly attractive, and we'll continue to be aggressive about doing that. And thirdly, we've said before that when certain licenses become available to us, and we're doing 2 right now, we're doing Korea and we are doing a majority ownership of our Panama South America, and they're either strategically correct for us to look at or they're going to create positive earnings for us, we will look at buying those. So as Joe said before, we want dry powder to be able to do that. And there might be other things that we would look at as an organization as well. But we'll take a look at that as we get further down the road. We have great infrastructure. We could leverage other things off of this infrastructure. So we think we've got a very clear vision. But we don't think adding a lot of debt to the company would be something that would be of interest to running a luxury goods company at this point in time. And before we would entertain a dividend, we'd want to make sure we have looked at all the other initiatives which would generate profitability and be accretive for the company. So Joe, do you have anything to add to that?"

Joan, first thing, just so you know, we mentioned in our fourth quarter call there's about $100 million on an annual basis that will move out of North American wholesale into our international Asia category because we are shipping and servicing certain of our retail accounts out of that facility now. We have a warehouse, we have an operation in Hong Kong led by Stephane Lafay, who is a former Senior Vice President of Tiffany Asia. And so that's DFS and some of our licensed businesses are all serviced out of there, so you just know that for the future. Secondly, if you look at our wholesale business in North America, as I said before, our accessories business was up high single digit. Our footwear business was actually up very strong double digit. But as Joe mentioned before, the footwear shipments were flat to slightly down. And the reason for that is, remember, we're going up against, in footwear as an example, installing a lot of shops last year. So a lot of that gets into the pipeline filling. And then secondly, as we see the department store channel in North America slowing down because you know that, you know department stores here are not posting robust results, we've decided to reduce the amount of inventory that we're starting to put into that channel because we don't want to have a lot of markdowns showing up inside the channel. So I would say we still believe, obviously, in growth in the North American wholesale channel. And it will be in the kind of single-digity type range for us because, a, the channel is not quite robust right now; and, b, we have dominant market share in many of those channels. And as you know, it's no secret, in handbags, we're the #1 in that channel. In watches, we're the #1 in that channel. In footwear today, in most accounts, we're the #1 in that channel. So as that channel goes a little bit is how we're going to go. I might add, though, at the end -- on the flip side, the e-commerce portion of the department store business in North America is really robust. You're talking very, very strong double-digit growth at all of our department store partners. So while you'll see us begin to end the shop-in-shop installation in the United States over the next 12 to 18 months, and that's again just as planned as when we went public, and we had talked about with the exclusion of men's, which will still be a robust rollout, we're going to still get growth in the department stores, and most of that is going to come from the e-commerce portion. And then obviously, some comp store growth inside there -- inside of our shop-in-shops that we've put in as well. So hopefully, that gives you an answer to the North American wholesale business."

So as that normalizes as well -- we're feeling good about Europe for Q2 and for the back half of the year. Still see good strength there. We still see an opportunity to expand the marketplace. And again, we grew on a -- reported on a constant-currency basis, 47% in that marketplace. That is a lot of growth, and we still have a long way to go in terms of increasing the brand awareness. So we feel pretty good about Europe. And just on the international note, Asia is really strong for the company. What we're seeing happening for us in China and in Southeast Asia and in Japan is really breathtaking. Same thing we said on this call many years ago and told you that we were going to invest in Japan and lost money there for years, we're now making money. The comps look great. The business growth is great. We did the same thing in Europe. It took us years to invest and build there. South America is going to be a similar thing. We're going to invest for the long term. So I think these things are going to continue to pay off. So I will turn it over to Joe on the operating part."

We've said that, in North America, we're going to open 400 stores, and we're going to have 200 stores in Europe and 100 stores in Japan, et cetera. And we've -- when we set those targets, we're way below what other competitors are in terms of their distribution. And I also might add that we also set those targets with a very clear eye to how many full price and how many outlet stores we've had. And we've had that with a very clear target about how many department stores we've had. So all of that has been really deeply thought-out by city, by location, et cetera. And then, of course, over the last 2 years, we've seen e-commerce take on a much bigger role in, I think, everyone's projection in terms of what that will be of their total retail business. And we believe that, that's going to be approximately 20% of our sales over the next few years. That all being said, we make a lot of money in our retail stores. We have a handful of stores that we don't make money on. Some of those are flagships that we want, from an impression standpoint, in the city. Some of those are just stores that may be producing at the level that we want to. But we don't open stores unless they're profitable. So even if e-commerce becomes 20% of our overall revenues, 80% -- I'm sorry, retail revenues, I apologize. Retail revenues, 80% is still going to come from freestanding stores. So we still believe that, if you live in Arkansas or you live in Omaha or you live in New York, you should have the ability to be able to go into a store and shop that store with Michael Kors product. And I think we're very careful about where we distribute our product. And I think we're very proud of the shopping centers that we're in, the street locations and where we've positioned the brand up against our luxury -- or with our luxury competitors and/or with some of our U.S. neighbors as well. So we're still feeling good about our rollout. And again, that rollout is going to come to an end here pretty shortly, particularly in North America. It will be over within the next 24 months, and then there we'll really be looking at all of our growth coming out of comp from a retail standpoint.
I'd like to say thank you to everyone for joining us today, and look forward to keeping you updated on growth and the progress that we're making on our growth initiatives in our next call. Have a great day."

Good morning, and welcome to Michael Kors' First Quarter Fiscal 2016 Earnings Call. I'll begin with a quick review of the quarter and then provide an update on some of our growth initiatives.
I'm pleased to report that our luxury brand continues to achieve global growth. Total revenue increased 7% or 13% on a constant-currency basis for the first quarter of fiscal 2016. In constant currency, we saw a revenue growth of approximately 2% in North America, 42% in Europe and 57% in Japan. Although we are at different stages of development in each of our regions, we continue to drive top line growth and believe consumers view Michael Kors as a leading luxury fashion brand.
Our first quarter financial results exceeded expectations, driven by better-than-anticipated performance in both our retail and wholesale segments. The increase in retail net sales was attributable to new stores and accelerated growth in our North American digital flagships, which experienced 102% year-over-year increase.
Global comparable store sales declined 9.5%, or 5% on a constant-currency basis, slightly better than we had expected. We saw continued momentum in our international markets with mid-single-digit comp growth in Europe and strong double-digit increase in Japan in constant currency. In North America, we experienced a high single-digit comp decline, reflecting a channel shift to online purchases and the continuation of reduced mall traffic. In addition, the continued decline in watch sales had a meaningful impact in the quarter as expected, and we saw a continued shift toward smaller-sized handbags along with increased demand for crossbodies and small leather goods, which is resulting in an overall lower average unit retail. If we include our U.S. digital flagship sales in our comp base, our North American comparable store sales would have decreased in the mid-single-digit range. 
Global wholesale growth was led by continued strength in our accessories and ready to wear categories. Notably, when looking at our company-owned stores sales combined with department store sales, on a retail basis, our accessories business grew at a low double-digit rate globally and a high single-digit rate in North America. We believe this represents a higher growth rate than the category as a whole, suggesting that we continue to take market share and demonstrate the strength of the Michael Kors brand.
Lastly, the increase in our licensing revenue in the first quarter was related to sales of eyewear, jewelry and watches.
Earnings per share results were better than expected at $0.87 for the quarter, including the unfavorable impact from foreign currency of $0.06 per share.
Turning to some highlights on our key growth initiatives. First, we are driving our direct-to-consumer business worldwide through the development of our digital flagships as well as expanding our footprints across North America, Europe and Asia. We expect our omnichannel initiatives, combined with our retail expansion, to drive double-digit sales growth in this segment this fiscal year as we continue to provide a jet-set shopping experience to our customers.
We are increasing our retail store openings from 85 to 100 locations this year, with the addition of 8 locations in North America, 5 in Europe and 2 in Japan. We are also excited about the expansion of our men's in the retail channel and continue to believe there is a potential for as many as 500 men's locations worldwide. In addition, we look forward to driving growth in our Korean business as we transition these stores in-house by the end of the year.
Second, in our wholesale business. We see low single-digit growth this year, stemming from both increased penetration across product categories as well as through the conversion of department store doors into shop-in-shops globally. We expect sales increases in our accessories business across regions, including in North America, to be driven by overall category growth as well as through increased penetration in both Europe and Asia as we gain market share in these regions.
We also see growth in our womenswear, footwear and men's categories as we further develop these businesses and evolve as a lifestyle brand. Our shop-in-shop conversions are expected to generate incremental sales as consumers continue to respond favorably to the Michael Kors branded environment and love having a jet-set experience with their favorite department stores. We are on track for the conversion of approximately 600 shop-in-shop locations globally this year, including 90 men's shops.
Third, in our licensing business, we anticipate a low double-digit growth rate this fiscal year. We see the biggest opportunity in fragrance and eyewear as consumer response to these collections has been very favorable, and we are excited about the potential for distribution expansion in addition to increased penetration in these categories.
In watches, we expect the introduction of our new styles in calendar 2016 to drive improved performance in our fiscal fourth quarter. In addition, we are focused on adapting the exciting developments in wearable technology into the luxury fashion products that consumers expect from Michael Kors. Over time, we believe that we can become a leading brand in connected fashion accessories.
Finally, we plan to expand our international presence as we further develop our regional licenses. We are pleased with the strength in China and Southeast Asia, with double-digit comp growth in the first quarter reflecting the strong consumer response to our luxury fashion products and Michael Kors lifestyle brand. We are continuing to build momentum through strategic marketing events, key store openings and, of course, great product offerings. Brand awareness in these markets is accelerating, and we are more excited than ever about the opportunity in this region.
We look forward to continuing to execute on numerous growth initiatives that are currently underway. Near term, we expect continued pressure from macroeconomic headwinds, including currency fluctuation, lower store traffic due to channel shift, reduced tourism in select markets and geopolitical issues. While these factors are expected to have an impact on our business, we continue to believe we have many growth opportunities that lay ahead for Michael Kors.
In the second half, we have a new national advertising campaign planned that transports our customers to jet-set travel destinations and captures inspirational moments of the Michael Kors women. The campaign will engage her in all aspects of life with ads depicting glamorous backdrops appearing across all communication channels, including print, catalog, billboards, social media and our own website. In fact, our digital flagship will lead our marketing efforts, offering her the most expansive expression of the Michael Kors brand and providing her with numerous opportunities to engage not only with our fashion brand but with Michael himself through our Destination Kors features, including Michael's Edits and Travel Diaries. Importantly, it will allow us to continue to expand our social media presence across all platforms and connect more and more customers with our luxury brand.
I am also very proud of the philanthropic work that continues to be a cornerstone of Michael Kors culture. You may have already seen that actress Kate Hudson recently teamed up with Michael to support our Watch Hunger Stop campaign. She will help us launch 2 new limited-edition styles of the Bradshaw watch. And every sale of these special styles named the Bradshaw 100 will enable 100 children in need to receive a nutritious meal. Since launching in 2013, Watch Hunger Stop has helped deliver over 10 million meals to children in need, and we will continue working to build on a world without hunger.
As we look at our product for holiday, we are excited about our compelling gift offering focused on our current fashion trends such as backpacks, crossbodies and small leather goods, active footwear and watches featuring assorted leather bands. We expect this injection of newness and excitement to drive growth during the holiday selling season.
For spring 2016, we are introducing our largest assortment of new handbag groups as well as new watch styles that represents the most extensive presentation of innovative and new materials we have introduced to date. It's all about fashion, and we remain focused on offering our customers compelling on-trend product each season.
Overall, our brand remains strong, driven by a powerful business model. We are focused on driving our direct-to-consumer business both through our digital flagships and our retail stores and building our wholesale presence through shop-in-shops.
Our growth is rooted in our design leadership, and we will continue to expand our fashion offerings and deliver exceptional luxury products across all lifestyle categories. We will also continue to leverage our innovative marketing strategy to enhance our brand awareness worldwide. Looking ahead, we continue to believe that there's ample room to further build our business, and we remain on track to achieve our long-term growth initiatives.
Now let me turn it over to Joe for a detailed review of our first quarter financial results and our updated outlook."
143971118,306947845,851365,"Michael Kors Holdings Limited, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 06, 2015",2015-08-06,"Earnings Calls","Capri Holdings Limited","Executives","Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone.

Total revenue grew 7.3% to $986.0 million as compared to $919.2 million last year. As expected, foreign currency headwinds continued to impact our results this quarter. On a constant-currency basis, total revenue grew 13.4%.
By region, North American revenue increased 1.9%, Europe revenue increased 42.2% and Japan revenue increased 57.4%.
In our retail segment, net sales increased 9.0% to $523.3 million on a reported basis and increased 16.0% on a constant-currency basis. Sales were driven by the opening of 107 net new stores since the first quarter of last year and a 101.6% increase in our North American digital flagship sales.
Comp store sales declined 9.5% on a reported basis and decreased 5.0% on a constant-currency basis due to lower comp sales in North America, partially offset by an increase in comp sales in both Europe and Japan.
Our U.S. digital sales would have increased our global comp store sales by a low single-digit percentage on a constant currency basis.
We opened 24 new stores in the first quarter: 11 in North America, 10 in Europe and 3 in Japan. In addition, we expanded or relocated 11 stores. We ended the quarter with 550 company-owned retail stores, including concessions, and 774 stores overall, including our licensed locations.
Wholesale net sales grew 4.2% to $424.0 million for the first quarter. On a constant currency basis, wholesale sales increased 9.7%. The increase was driven by our accessories and womenswear categories, partially offset by lower footwear sales. Wholesale growth was also attributed to the expansion of our European operations. During the first quarter, we converted an additional 128 wholesale doors into shop-in-shops globally.
In our licensing segment, revenue grew 20.5% to $38.7 million for the quarter, led by our eyewear, jewelry and watch categories. We opened 33 new watch and jewelry shop-in-shops during the quarter and ended the quarter with 294 shop-in-shops globally.
Gross profit grew 5.6% to $603.6 million. Gross margin declined 100 basis points to 61.2%, which includes a 63 basis point foreign currency impact. The decline in gross margin was due to a 170 basis point decline in retail gross margins due to higher markdowns in our North American retail business, partially offset by higher full-price sell-throughs in our European retail business, a 120 basis point decline in wholesale gross margin due to additional wholesale allowance in inventory reserves, partially offset by geographic mix. The retail and wholesale gross margin declines were partially offset by higher licensing gross margin dollars.
Total operating expense grew 20.4% to $355.0 million. The increase is attributable to our global investments, including our digital flagship initiatives, infrastructure and investment for Korea in the men's business, the buildout of our European distribution center and the continued investment in corporate systems and infrastructure. As a percent of total revenue, total operating expenses increased 390 basis points to 36.0%. This was below the 550 to 600 basis points of deleverage in our guidance as sales exceeded our expectation and depreciation expense was lower than anticipated.
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 17.9% to $313.5 million. The increase in SG&A expense was largely due to higher retail occupancy and salary costs related to new store openings, an increase in corporate employee-related expense primarily due to an increase in our corporate staff to support our global growth as well as other corporate operations-related costs. As a percent of total revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses were 31.8%, compared to 28.9% for the first quarter of last year.
Depreciation and amortization expense increased 43.3% to $41.6 million for the first quarter, primarily due to new retail stores, new shop-in-shops, an increase in lease rights related to our new European stores and investments in our corporate facilities and IT infrastructure.
As a result of these factors, income from operations was $248.6 million or 25.2% of total revenue as compared to 30.1% of total revenue in the same period last year.
Retail operating margin declined 660 basis points, primarily due to a 490 basis point increase in operating expense attributable to higher store-related costs, corporate-allocated expenses and depreciation and amortization.
Wholesale operating margin declined 380 basis points, primarily due to 260 basis point increase in operating expenses attributable to higher corporate-allocated expenses and depreciation and amortization.
Licensing operating margin increased 420 basis points, primarily due to lower advertising costs, partially offset by higher costs related to protection of our intellectual property.
Income taxes were $72.7 million in the quarter, and our effective tax rate was 29.4% as compared to 32.0% in the same period last year. The decrease in our effective tax rate was primarily due to the increase of taxable income in certain non-U.S. subsidiaries, which are subject to lower statutory tax rates.
Net income was $174.4 million for the first quarter, and diluted earnings per share were $0.87 based upon 200.1 million weighted-average diluted shares outstanding. The unfavorable currency impact to EPS was $0.06 per share.
Turning to the balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, cash and cash equivalents were $808.5 million as compared to $1.1 billion last year. There were no outstanding borrowings under our credit facility in either year.
During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 7 million shares, totaling $350 million, bringing our total repurchase to date to approximately 13.8 million shares, totaling $841.9 million of our $1.5 billion authorization. These repurchases reflect the strength of our balance sheet and confidence in our ability to generate strong free cash flow. Our first priority will continue to be the strategic investment in our luxury brand to fully maximize our global growth opportunities. That said, given our strong balance sheet, we are confident that we will have the financial flexibility to continue with our share repurchase program.
Inventory increased 15.0% versus last year. Approximately 1/3 of the increase was related to early shipments of fall merchandise versus the prior year as we wanted to mitigate potential risks related to the West Coast port delays. Excluding these early shipments, inventory would have increased slightly ahead of our sales increase.
Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $106.0 million. These expenditures were related to the buildout of our new retail stores and shop-in-shops as well as investments in our information technology, distribution system enhancements and other infrastructure improvements.
Before discussing guidance, I would note that subsequent to the first quarter, we obtained controlling interest in our Latin American joint venture, MK Panama Holdings, and we'll be consolidating MK Panama into our operations beginning with the second quarter. We are currently in the process of finalizing the new ownership structure and accounting, and while we may record fair value adjustments, we do not expect a material impact on our ongoing operating results. The impacts of these adjustments have not been included in our guidance.
Turning to our outlook. Our second quarter and full year guidance reflects our expectation that the retail environment will remain challenging and foreign currency will continue to be a headwind. For the second quarter, we expect total revenues to be between $1.06 billion and $1.08 billion. On a constant currency basis, total revenue is expected to increase in the high single-digit range, assuming a $60 million impact from the change in foreign currency rates. We expect a high single-digit comp store decrease on a reported basis and a low single-digit decrease on a constant currency.
Operating expenses as a percent of total revenue is expected to increase 440 to 490 basis points in the second quarter due to our global investments. We expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.86 to $0.90, assuming a tax rate of approximately 29.5% and 194 million shares outstanding.
We expect foreign currency to impact net income by approximately $11 million and EPS by approximately $0.06 for the second quarter.
For the full fiscal year, we continue to expect total revenue of between $4.7 billion and $4.8 billion. On a constant currency basis, total revenue is expected to increase in the low double-digit range, assuming a $192 million impact from the change in foreign currency rates. We expect low single-digit decline in comp store sales on a reported basis and flat comps on a constant currency basis.
We expect a sequential improvement in our comp store sales in the third and fourth quarters, driven by the inclusion of the U.S. e-commerce sales in the comp base, the rollout of Kors Concierge in our stores, the launch of our new national advertising campaign, the introduction of new innovative product offerings for holiday and spring 2016, diminished FX headwinds and easier year-over-year comps.
Our overall top line will benefit from the outperformance we saw in the first quarter, the increase in our digital flagship sales, the rollout of additional retail locations and continued shop-in-shop conversions. As we stated in our last call, we anticipate the 53rd week to add approximately $40 million of additional sales in this fiscal year.
International gross margin will remain pressured in the second half as the favorable hedging contracts we entered into last year begin to expire. Operating expense as a percent of total revenue is expected to increase 140 to 180 basis points for the year. We expect the increase in operating expense as a percent of total revenue to moderate in the second half of the year as the rate of spends flows and we begin to anniversary the investments we made in 2015.
We continue to expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $4.40 to $4.50, assuming a tax rate of approximately 29% and 195 million shares outstanding. We expect foreign currency to impact net income by approximately $41 million and EPS by approximately $0.21 for the year.

What we said was that if you take our retail sales in our own stores and our department stores, we had growth in North America. So -- and that was high single digits in North America. So we believe that we are, in fact, growing market share in North America. We grew at a higher rate than we believe that the category did. And then I would also add that, internationally, we -- when you add both domestic and international together, we grew at double-digit rate. So again, we believe that the category in North America is growing in low single-digit rate today. And we think that we are outpacing that growth by a fairly significant amount, again showing the health of our brand. And most importantly, really it's kudos to our design teams. We also mentioned to you that we're really excited about the fact that we're going to introduce the largest amount of new handbag groups that the company has ever introduced. And we're doing that purposely. We think that there's an excitement level that we can generate with our customers. We've got probably one of the finest store fleets in the world in terms of locations. We have got such a great customer engagement going on today. We grew our social media channels by over 25% in the quarter. So she's responding, she's engaging. Newness is, without a question, what is driving her interest. And I just might add on that point, if you look at what's happening, there's some really good things starting to happen in the handbag business. Backpacks are starting to trend, and I think we're a leader in that category. I think we've caught it pretty early on. There's a very big shift towards smaller handbags and then crossbodies and small leather goods, particularly the millennial customer. It's the way that she's shopping, it's the way that she's wearing the product. You're going to see some very significant presentations from us on those categories. A little negative in the fact that, when you're selling a smaller handbag or crossbody, it drives a little bit of your AUR down. And I think that's one of the things that you're seeing show up a little bit in some of the comp. But otherwise than that, the handbag business appears to be robust, although not at the same levels it grew at, at the past few years. And we like where we're positioned and the amount of market share that we continue to gain. So thank you very much, Kimberly."

I would say the following. We certainly see mall traffic continue to remain challenged. And our point of view on that is that there is absolutely a channel shift going on because when you look at our acceleration of our digital business growing at over 100% last quarter, and that's, quite frankly, with still some issues with inside the distribution center, I might add that we, by the way, have moved our Ohio distribution center into our California distribution center in Whittier as of last week. So we've done that to consolidate so that we can really take and have much better grasp on the demand that's happening there, and the further acceleration, we think, that's going to continue out of that facility. And what you have is, you have a customer who's able to shop no matter where they are, just from a mobile device or from a desktop. And we think, as at that continues, traffic inside the shopping centers are going to remain challenged. That being said, one of the categories that really impacted our comp store sales was watches, and that's, we think, a cyclical issue. Although there are some product challenges there that we think we can really go after, that you'll start to see a little bit in our third quarter, but mostly in our fourth quarter. So we're encouraged by the concept that this new product is going to be flowing into our stores starting third quarter and then heavily in the fourth quarter first. Secondly, we're going to start to go up against the initial declines in the watch business, so that will become a little easier for us to comp against. If you remember, Q1 and Q2 were huge comps that we're up against from last year. The comps that we're up against in Q3 and Q4 are a little easier. And we also start to -- some of the FX tailwinds or headwinds start to burn off a little bit, hopefully. Let's pray that, that continues to, the dollar and the euro in particular, stay stabilized. So we'll get some of the benefits of that. And then with omnichannel coming on board for us in our third quarter and Kors Concierge being launched, we think we're going to have a real opportunity in our stores to be able to maximize sales with better inventory management in terms of point of location and distribution. And we just also think that we're going to have a much more comprehensive engagement with our customer on how we're going to be selling to them, having all of our sales associates armed with digital information on the broadest assortment. You look at a 2,500 square-foot store for us on average, and there's -- they can maybe show 40% or 50% of our assortment. And now, the sales associate will have access and a selling tool to show close to 100% of our assortment. We think that's going to add up to some significant improvement in sales inside of our own stores. Thank you, Omar."

The gross margin impact, we have said consistently that we really haven't changed our promotional cadence almost since we started the company. We did say that last quarter, we did get a little more promotional, and really that's just clearing some merchandise through our stores as we had normalization, and our comps slowed down a little quicker than we had anticipated. I think we've got a fairly good grasp on that. But we're anticipating the gross margin, on a year-on-year basis, to be down about 1 point for the company, and I think we still feel that, that's really where it is. Part of that is going to be impacted by foreign currency, and part of that is going to be impacted by the addition of some markdowns and some additional allowances in the wholesale channel. So I think we feel pretty good about the vision on that. In terms of the watch, we really don't quantify the breakdowns of that. I want to mention that the watch issues for us are North American issue, and we have not seen that same deceleration in Europe or in Asia in the category. So if you saw in our actual licensing, we said that one of the reasons why our licensing revenues were up was because of watches. So we're getting positive growth outside the United States. Now that is being impacted by constant currency, though, unfortunately, or FX headwinds. So we're -- in Fossil, we're achieving some very nice gains in Europe, some of that's just being counteracted by the currency translation. And in jewelry, jewelry continues to be a category that we believe in, that we think can offer great success, long term, for the company. We've got some pretty interesting initiatives that we're going to I think talk to you about on the next call where we think we can accelerate that category with a few things that we're working on there. So all in all, again, the bigger piece of our comp decline did -- was caused, though, by watches."

And we made a decision a little over 2 years ago to build out a very significant and sustainable infrastructure to support our growth in terms of warehouse and distribution. We'll be finished with those projects mid-calendar next year. So that really will be up and running, and we think we're going to start to see benefits from those initiatives that we put in place. We're already beginning -- after an extensive renovation of our Whittier facility, we're starting to see our ability to drive costs down in that facility as well. And then both of these facilities, the one in Europe, Venlo, and then Whittier, what we're excited about is they'll be fully integrated facilities that will handle our retail, wholesale and our growing e-commerce business. And really, it's going to give us the ability to access inventory very, very quickly. In particular, for this e-commerce business, which is just growing at breakneck speed. So we think that those investments, while some of them might look a bit painful right now, are actually great investments for this company in the long term. Secondly, we're building out our corporate offices here. We've had to add a lot of square footage because, while I know there's a lot of commentary about how Michael Kors is struggling, in fact we grew 30% last year. This year, we're going to do close to $4.7 billion, $4.8 billion. We've had to add a lot of people, we had to put some office space to add those people. And we're proud of that, and we are building a world-class facility for those people to work in because, as a company, we've made the decision we want to be able to hire not just from our industry but from some of the best tech companies in the world and really draw the talent that's going to help drive this company for the future. And the last part of our expense initiatives has been talent, and we're really bringing in some world-class people to help build and run this business. A great example of that is the men's, where we've just hired Marcel Oswalt, who headed up design for Hugo Boss, and we hired Mark Brashear. So we say we're going to build a men's business, we're building in -- bringing in world-class people to build businesses and we're putting the resources behind them to be successful. So that's a long-winded way of saying, those investments -- we're really not going to have that kind of stepped up investment in fiscal 2017. We anticipate CapEx to start to come down as a trend also in 2017. So we're going to start to get some real leverage on our SG&A as we go forward. Lastly, in terms of outlet versus full price, both channels we're seeing mall traffic decline in the outlet channel is very, very small. But the -- and I think it's -- our other people have discussed it. And the mall traffic in the United States, you can check that from ShopperTrak, is about -- it's kind of high single digits, mid- to high single-digit decline in terms of the traffic. We see that from the information that they're providing, and we're tracking in that same kind of range."

Our design teams have just come up with some fabulous new product, and I might say, it's in handbags, it's in our women's ready to wear and in our footwear categories. And when you're the size company that we are and you have the position in the marketplace that we do, we believe, in America, Michael is the #1 leading American designer in the world. And as to taking that position, we have to offer exciting new product. And we want to take a little bit further stab at making sure the customer understands that's what we stand for. And the great news is that some of the things that we've been doing are really getting some good traction. Our newness sell-throughs are really performing at probably the best levels that we've had in 3 years, so we're terribly excited about that. And in the watch category, I would tell you that we believe that we've probably not had enough newness in that category. And so as we talked about earlier, the platforms that you're going to see introduced there in terms of new metal materials, in terms of new acetates, and we're going to continue on this leather band program, which we think is a very important initiative for us. We think it's going to drive a lot of interest and a lot of engagement with our customer to continue to look at Michael Kors as their fashion wardrobing resource. The last thing I'll just add to you is wearables is something, as you know, our company and Fossil are really dedicated to. And we've been cautious and we've taken our time to make sure that when we introduce our program, which will be coming for fall of 2016, that it is robust and that it is something that's well thought out and that our customer will understand how it fits into her lifestyle and his lifestyle. And we're excited, and I would tell you that we think that, that entire category is something that we think will begin to revolutionize the fashion watch business as people look for more technology inside of the watch that they buy. And as you know, today, we view watches as a fashion accessory, not just a watch. So this will really kind of almost take it back to its original roots that it will do more for you than being just a fashion accessory. And then I'm going to say one thing and then it over to Joe on the free cash flow. As we've said on our previous 2 calls, we -- the management of this company and our Board of Directors feel very strongly about the value in terms of repurchasing stock, in particular, at what we consider to be a price level that is not where our company belongs. And given that, you saw how aggressive we were during the last quarter in buying back shares. We will continue to be aggressive as long as there is a displacement in terms of what we think is the appropriate value for the company and the share price. I'll turn it over to Joe in terms of what that means to the cash flows."

Why not pursue an alternative capital structure if the company is underlevered? And I guess, 2 other questions related to that is, from a cash-use perspective, what about thinking about a dividend? And how should we be thinking about it, it sounds like you said something about you bought in Panama. How should we be thinking about the Far East Holdings Limited business? How should we be thinking about that part?"

So we -- I don't think we said that we were underlevered. We believe that having a company that operates with a strong balance sheet is the right way to build a luxury company. Other companies don't run their businesses that way, but we think a luxury company should be run with a strong balance sheet, of which we've done from the date that we really went public. And in terms of our priorities, as Joe said, number one, we're going to continue to invest in the company. The good news is, is we've made these big investments, the buildout of Venlo, the buildout of our corporate offices. We've built a lot of retail stores and shop-in-shops over the last 5 years. And many of those initiatives are going to start to burn down over the next 24 months, which will give us even more free cash flow as we move forward. So our second priority then is going to be to continue to buy back stock and, at these levels, we find it incredibly attractive, and we'll continue to be aggressive about doing that. And thirdly, we've said before that when certain licenses become available to us, and we're doing 2 right now, we're doing Korea and we are doing a majority ownership of our Panama South America, and as they're either strategically correct for us to look at or they're going to create positive earnings for us, we will look at buying those. So as Joe said before, we want dry powder to be able to do that. And there might be other things that we would look at as an organization as well. But we'll take a look at that as we get further down the road. We have great infrastructure. We could leverage other things off of this infrastructure. So we think we've got a very clear vision. But we don't think adding a lot of debt to the company would be something that would be of interest to running a luxury goods company at this point in time. And before we would entertain a dividend, we'd want to make sure we had looked at all the other initiatives which would generate profitability and be accretive for the company. So Joe, do you have anything to add to that?"

Joan, first thing, just so you know, we mentioned it in our fourth quarter call, there's about $100 million on an annual basis that will move out of North American wholesale into our international Asia category because we are shipping and servicing",486,"Sure. Joan, first thing, just so you know, we mentioned it in our fourth quarter call, there's about $100 million on an annual basis that will move out of North American wholesale into our international Asia category because we are shipping and servicing certain of our retail accounts out of that facility now. We have a warehouse, we have an operation in Hong Kong led by Stephane Lafay, who is a former Senior Vice President of Tiffany Asia. And so that's DFS and some of our licensed businesses are all serviced out of there, so you just know that for the future. Secondly, if you look at our wholesale business in North America, as I said before, our accessories business was up high single digit. Our footwear business was actually up very strong double digit. But as Joe mentioned before, the footwear shipments were flat to slightly down. And the reason for that is, remember, we're going up against, in footwear as an example, installing a lot of shops last year. So a lot of that gets into the pipeline filling. And then secondly, as we see the department store channel in North America slowing down because you know that, you know department stores here are not posting robust results, we've decided to reduce the amount of inventory that we're starting to put into that channel because we don't want to have a lot of markdowns showing up inside the channel. So I would say we still believe, obviously, in growth in the North American wholesale channel. And it will be in the kind of single-digity type range for us because, a, the channel is not quite robust right now; and, b, we have dominant market share in many of those channels. And as you know, it's no secret, in handbags, we're the #1 in that channel. In watches, we're the #1 in that channel. In footwear today, in most accounts, we're the #1 in that channel. So as that channel goes a little bit is how we're going to go. I might add, though, at the end -- on the flip side, the e-commerce portion of the department store business in North America is really robust. You're talking very, very strong double-digit growth at all of our department store partners. So while you'll see us begin to end the shop-in-shop installation in the United States over the next 12 to 18 months, and that's again just as planned as when we went public, and we had talked about with the exclusion of men's, which will still be a robust rollout, we're going to still get growth in the department stores, and most of that is going to come from the e-commerce portion. And then obviously, some comp store growth inside there -- inside of our shop-in-shops that we've put in as well. So hopefully, that gives you an answer to the North American wholesale business."

The comps in Europe, I think, are going to be in that, on a constant currency basis, somewhere to the high single to mid-single digits. It's just going to depend on what different things happen over there. It's so funny because, while Greece doesn't mean anything, while that was going on, all of the sudden business softened up. And the minute that, that kind of got past whatever was in the consumer's mind, our business in this quarter has really accelerated. So it's just there's some funny stuff going on over there. We also are being a little bit hurt by -- we have a very big business in the U.K. And the strength of the pound to the euro is hurting a little bit some of the business in the marketplace. So as that normalizes as well -- we're feeling good about Europe for Q2 and for the back half of the year. Still see good strength there. We still see an opportunity to expand the marketplace. And again, we grew on a -- reported on a constant currency basis, 47% in that marketplace. That is a lot of growth, and we still have a long way to go in terms of increasing the brand awareness. So we feel pretty good about Europe. And just on the international note, Asia is really strong for the company. What we're seeing happening for us in China and in Southeast Asia and in Japan is really breathtaking. Same thing we said on this call many years ago and told you that we were going to invest in Japan and lost money there for years, we're now making money. The comps look great. The business growth is great. We did the same thing in Europe. It took us years to invest and build there. South America is going to be a similar thing. We're going to invest for the long term. So I think these things are going to continue to pay off. So I will turn it over to Joe on the operating part."

We've said that, in North America, we're going to open 400 stores, and we're going to have 200 stores in Europe and 100 stores in Japan, et cetera. And we've -- when we set those targets, we're way below what other competitors are in terms of their distribution. And I also might add that we also set those targets with a very clear eye to how many full price and how many outlet stores we've had. And we've had that with a very clear target about how many department stores we've had. So all of that has been really deeply thought out by city, by location, et cetera. And then, of course, over the last 2 years, we've seen e-commerce take on a much bigger role in, I think, everyone's projection in terms of what that will be of their total retail business. And we believe that, that's going to be approximately 20% of our sales over the next few years. That all being said, we make a lot of money in our retail stores. We have a handful of stores that we don't make money on. Some of those are flagships that we want, from an impression standpoint in a city. Some of those are just stores that maybe aren't producing at the level that we want to. But we don't open stores unless they're profitable. So even if e-commerce becomes 20% of our overall revenues, 80% -- I'm sorry, retail revenues, I apologize. Retail revenues, 80% is still going to come from freestanding stores. So we still believe that, if you live in Arkansas or you live in Omaha or you live in New York, you should have the ability to be able to go into a store and shop that store with Michael Kors product. And I think we're very careful about where we distribute our product. And I think we're very proud of the shopping centers that we're in, the street locations and where we've positioned the brand up against our luxury -- or with our luxury competitors and/or with some of our U.S. neighbors as well. So we're still feeling good about our rollout. And again, that rollout is going to come to an end here pretty shortly, particularly in North America. It will be over within the next 24 months, and then we'll really be looking at all of our growth coming out of comp from a retail standpoint.
I'd like to say thank you to everyone for joining us today, and look forward to keeping you updated on the growth and the progress that we're making on our growth initiatives in our next call. Have a great day."

I'll begin with a review of the quarter and then provide an update on some of our growth initiatives. I'm pleased to report that our financial results for the second quarter exceeded expectations as we continue to expand the Michael Kors luxury brand worldwide. Total revenue increased 7% on a reported basis, and on a constant-currency basis, total revenue increased 12% driven by increases in both our Retail and Wholesale segments across geographies. We saw a revenue growth of approximately 6% in the Americas, 21% in Europe and 61% in Japan on a constant-currency basis. Our EPS of $1.01, which included a $0.06 impact from foreign currency, was also better than anticipated for the quarter. Our retail sales grew 8%, and in constant currency, our Retail business grew 15% driven by new store openings, strength in our North American digital flagships and the continued momentum in Europe and Japan. Global comparable store sales decreased 8.5% or 3.4% on a constant-currency basis, in line with expectations and reflecting sequential improvement as compared to the first quarter. North American digital sales more than doubled compared to last year as consumers continued to ship purchases to online and mobile channels. On a constant-currency basis, we delivered a high single digit comp increase in Europe and strong double-digit growth in Japan. In our North American retail stores, comps declined in high single digits as we continue to see the impact from lower mall traffic and a shift to the online channel. If we included our U.S. digital flagship sales in our comp base, our North American comparable store sales would have declined in the mid-single digit range. Wholesale sales grew 8% in the second quarter, and in constant currency, wholesale sales increased 12%, led by continued strength in our accessories categories. In addition, our wholesale business expanded across geographies with mid-single-digit growth in both the Americas and Europe in constant currency as well as further growth in the Mid Asia market. Licensing revenue in the quarter declined due to lower sales of watches as we saw continued softness in this category. Revenue increased in a number of other areas of our licensing business in the second quarter, including fragrance, jewelry and eyewear categories. 
Turning to our product category. The accessories business in North America grew at a mid-single-digit rate with a double-digit increase in units sold, demonstrating continued growth of this category and the demand for the Michael Kors luxury brand. However, dollar growth was impacted by lower AUR due to increased demand for smaller-sized handbags, crossbodies and small leather goods, which carry lower price points. We saw accelerated growth in footwear, although the warm weather tempered boot sales in the quarter. The watch business continues to remain under pressure in retail and wholesale. But we are excited by the introduction of several new watch styles, including a broader assortment of watches with leather bands and watches with new platings in navy and sabled, which we believe is creating renewed desire for the category. 
Now turning to some highlights of our strategic initiatives. We remain focused on growing our business globally through both retail and wholesale expansion as well as our licensing partnerships. 
On the retail side. We are driving growth through the continued development of our digital flagship worldwide as well as the expansion of our store footprint in the Americas, Europe and Asia. As I mentioned earlier, our North America digital business is growing rapidly. Desktop and mobile traffic has increased at a double-digit rate and converging rates are strong, proving that our customers love the convenience of shopping and connecting with Michael Kors' online and on-the-go. We are seeing accessories and footwear emerge as dominant e-commerce categories demonstrating the brand strength of these core luxury product lines. We believe the transition to online and mobile purchasing will continue worldwide, and we are poised to capitalize on this shift with the development of our digital platform to provide a global, multilanguage, multicurrency e-commerce experience for our customers. The rollout of our digital flagships across Europe is expected to begin in fall of 2016 followed by Asia thereafter. In men's, we are encouraged by the early growth rates and acceptance of our products as we begin to build a world-class men's brand. Our men's collection was initially introduced into the retail channel with the opening of our SoHo flagship store nearly a year ago, providing the first dedicated jet-set luxury experience for the Michael Kors man. We are pleased to announce the upcoming opening of 3 additional men's location in Scottsdale, Fashion Square in Arizona; Garden Safe Plaza in word, New Jersey; and San Francisco Center in California. In Europe, we've begun to sell our men's product in our recently opened Stockholm flagship and Amsterdam flagship locations, and we're pleased with the favorable response. And looking forward, we have already identified several additional prime locations in Roseville Field, New York, Memorial City in  Houston Texas, World Trade Center in New York City as well as London, Tokyo, Singapore and Taiwan. We remain excited about the long-term opportunity for this business with the potential for up to 500 freestanding stores or combined format locations worldwide. 
Lastly, we are set to unlock the opportunity for Michael Kors in Korea as we transition this business in-house by the end of the year. We are well on our way to building the right infrastructure and developing an expansion strategy to position this business for long-term growth. 
In wholesale, we, like many others, have seen the department store channel slowing and we will be monitoring this business carefully and managing our inventory to protect our brand and margins. However, our brand strength and compelling luxury products offering have enabled us to maintain our leadership position in this space. We expect continued growth in accessories business globally as well as in our womenswear, footwear and men's categories as we further develop these businesses and extend our lifestyle presence. We also continue to benefit from the conversion of existing department store doors into shop-in-shop locations across product categories, capturing incremental sales as customers respond favorably to Michael Kors' branded environments. We are on track to convert 600 shop-in-shops this year across all categories and are particularly excited that open a new flagship men's shop within Macy's Harold Square presenting our broadest product assortment in one of the most historic, well-recognized department store location in the world. 
In our licensing business, we're excited about the recent launch of our new gold fragrance collection featuring a scent for every women ranging from feminine and seductive to sparkling and sensuous. Our men's fragrance offering as well as the expansion of key EMEA markets are contributing to the growth we've seen this year in this category. 
In eyewear, we are pleased with our partnership with Luxottica and the customer's response we're seeing to our new eyewear collections, particularly with our iconic aviator styles. Both of these categories offer consumers a number of great gifting items for this holiday season. We also see opportunity for long-term growth in fragrance and eyewear through both expanded distribution and increased penetration. 
Another category that we are excited about is our new connected fashion accessories line, which will launch in fall 2016. There's a great opportunity to build a significant position in this growing category and become a fashion leader in the emerging tech space. In addition, given the strong acceptance we have seen across international markets, we remain focused on expanding the Michael Kors luxury brand through our licensing partners. The Asia region continues to represent a significant growth opportunity for our company. We continue to see strong results in the Greater China business with double-digit comp store growth in the second quarter. Consumer response to our luxury product offering has been favorable, and we are excited to see our footwear business start to gain tractor in this marketplace. We attribute the growth in part to our increasing brand awareness in the region, which we now believe is at approximately 50% in large cities. Our strategic marketing efforts in the region are one of the key drivers of brand awareness. We're excited to be hosting a star-studded event in November with Vogue called Young China to celebrate the opening of our largest flagship location in Waimau, Beijing, totaling 9,000 square feet. This media event will be attended by Michael himself as well as key influencers from China's movie industry, and will spotlight our luxury fashion and amplify the glamor of Michael Kors' jet-set luxury lifestyle. The development and success of our China business is increasing demand from the Michael Kors brand throughout Asia and Europe as Chinese consumers travel the globe, and 50% to 60% of their purchases are outside of Mainland China. 
As we look to the second half of the year, we believe we are well positioned for the upcoming holiday season. Michael and our design teams continue to create on-trend fashion products that embody the Michael Kors luxury brand. Our recent merchandise assortments truly reflect Michael's leadership in driving the latest fashion trends. Our rich wave saddlebags, mini bucket bags and quilted bag emerged as top-selling items this past quarter, word with the hit in all departments. Watches with leather bands and new metal plating's in Navy and Sable were met with great response, and our active footwear and backpack capitalized on the sports lux trend. The positive response we are seeing from our customers give us confidence that our new product introductions are taking hold. To celebrate this season with effortless glamor and style, our holiday gifting collections will continue to emphasize our on-trend fashion products. 
To highlight our new holiday merchandise, we are excited to be launching the Michael Kors Just Because marketing campaign to connect our customers with the special gift that's just right. As we look ahead to spring 2016, we will continue to offer compelling on-trend fashion with the introduction of our largest assortment of new handbag groups as well as new watch offerings reflecting the most expensive presentation of innovative materials we've used to date. In addition, our strong marketing program enables us to further engage customers with the brand, immerse them in the luxury lifestyle and encourage them to shop our sites and stores. 
As we mentioned last quarter, we are excited about our new national advertising campaign that transports our customers to global cities, which represent the jet-set world of Michael Kors. Our integrated positioning through our content-rich website, compelling social media, global advertising, brand marketing and media events and traditional print and outdoor advertising are designed to speak to our customers globally in an authentic voice, always emphasizing our luxury DNA, ultimately marrying brand equity and awareness and translating that into conversion. 
In summary, we are pleased with the success we achieved in the second quarter with revenue growth of 7% on a reported basis and 12% on a constant-currency basis. Our digital flagship business in North America more than doubled. We drove sequential improvement in comp store sales. We continued to increase brand awareness in international markets, and we are seeing the acceptance of our newest handbag groups and watch styles, and we are capitalizing on our leadership position in the luxury market. While we expect the macro headwinds to continue in the near term, the Michael Kors brand remains incredibly strong and we are focused on continuing to execute our strategic initiatives to drive long-term growth. 
Now let me turn it over to Joe for a detailed review of our second quarter financial results and an update on our outlook."
143971118,314056254,891438,"Michael Kors Holdings Limited, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2015",2015-11-04,"Earnings Calls","Capri Holdings Limited","Executives","Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Our financial results exceeded our guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2016. Total revenue grew 6.9% to $1.1 billion. As expected, foreign currency headwinds continued to impact our results this quarter.",1900,"Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Our financial results exceeded our guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2016. Total revenue grew 6.9% to $1.1 billion. As expected, foreign currency headwinds continued to impact our results this quarter. On a constant-currency basis, total revenue grew 12.3%. By region, in constant currency, revenue in the Americas increased 5.6%, Europe revenue increased 20.6%, and Japan revenue increased 60.7%. In our Retail segment, net sales increased 7.5% to $532.8 million. In constant currencies, net sales increased 14.7% driven by the opening of 116 net new stores since the second quarter of last year and an increase in our North American digital flagship sales. Notably, we saw exceptional performance from our digital flagships, which generated a sales increase of 136% as compared to the sales of our previous outsourced site. Comp store sales declined 8.5% on a reported basis. On a constant-currency basis, comp store sales declined 3.4% reflecting a sequential improvement in the first quarter. The decline is attributable to lower comp store sales in North America, partially offset by an increase in comp sales in both Europe and Japan. If we included our U.S. digital flagship sales on our comp base, our global comp store sales would have decreased in the low single digit range on a constant-currency basis. We added 39 new stores in the second quarter: 23 in Americas, which included 18 previously opened stores from our Panama joint venture, which was consolidated for the first time this quarter; 12 in Europe; and 4 in the Japan. In addition, we expanded or relocated 13 stores. We ended the quarter with 589 company-owned stores, including concessions, and 804 stores overall, including our licensed locations. 
Wholesale net sales grew 7.8% to $554.0 million for the second quarter. On a constant-currency basis, wholesale sales increased 11.8%, driven by our accessories categories and growth across our regions. During the second quarter, we converted 223 wholesale doors into shop-in-shops globally. 
In our Licensing segment, revenue decreased 8.1% to $43.2 million for the quarter due to lower licensing revenue related to sales of watches, somewhat offset by a revenue increase related to sales of outerwear, jewelry and eyewear. We continue to open new watch and jewelry shop-in-shops during the quarter and ended the quarter with 310 shop-in-shops globally. 
Gross profit grew 3.0% to $664.4 million. Gross margin declined 220 basis points to 58.8%, which includes an 189 basis point foreign currency impact. The decline in gross margin reflects a 280 basis point decline in retail gross margins due to additional promotional activity in our North American retail business, a 130 basis point decline in wholesale gross margin due to additional wholesale allowances partially offset by a geographic mix and lower licensing gross margin dollars. Total operating expenses grew 15.3% to $391.3 million. This increase was attributable to our global investments, including our retail expansion, our digital flagship initiatives, infrastructure, investment in Korea in the men's business, the build-out of our European distribution center and the continued investment in corporate systems and infrastructure. As a percent of total revenue, total operating expenses increased 250 basis points to 34.6%. This was below the 440 to 490 basis points of deleverage in our guidance as sales exceeded our expectation and depreciation expense and SG&A were somewhat lower than anticipated. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 13.0% to $345.2 million. The increase in SG&A expenses was largely due to the higher retail occupancy and salary costs related to new store openings, an increase in corporate employee-related expense, primarily due to an increase in our corporate staff to support our global growth as well as other corporate occupancy and operations-related cost. As a percent of total revenue, SG&A expenses were 30.5% compared to 28.9% for the second quarter last year. 
Depreciation and amortization expense increased 35.5% to $46.2 million for the second quarter, primarily due to new retail stores, new shop-in-shops, an increase in lease rights related to our new European stores and investments in our corporate facilities and IT infrastructure. As a result of these factors, income from operations were $273.1 million or 24.2% of total revenue as compared to 28.9% of total revenue in the same period last year. 
Retail operating margin declined 690 basis points due to a 410 basis point increase in operating expenses attributable to higher store-related costs, corporate-allocated expenses as well as higher depreciation and amortization expense primarily attributable to new store openings as well as a decline in retail gross margin, as discussed earlier. Retail operating margin was also impacted by the growth of digital sales as the e-commerce business carried a lower operating margin rate than retail stores. As the e-commerce business reaches scale, we do expect e-commerce margins to be more in line with that of a brick-and-mortar business. 
Wholesale operating margin declined 220 basis points due to the decline in the wholesale gross margin as discussed earlier, and an 80 basis points increase in operating expense attributable to higher depreciation expense. Licensing operating margin decreased 820 basis points, primarily due to higher advertising costs, corporate-allocated expenses and selling expenses relative to lower revenues. Income taxes were $78.4 million in the quarter, and our effective tax rate was 28.9% as compared to 31.9% in the same period last year. The decrease in our effective tax rate was primarily due to the increase of taxable income in certain non-U.S. subsidiaries, which are subject to lower statutory tax rates as well as state tax benefits. 
Net income was $193.1 million for the second quarter, and diluted earnings per share were $1.01 based upon 191.5 million weighted-average diluted shares outstanding. The unfavorable currency impact to EPS was $0.06 per share.  As we noted last quarter, we obtained a 75% controlling interest in our Latin American joint venture and are now consolidating MK Panama into our operations beginning this quarter. You can find the details of the acquisition described in Note 3 of our 10-Q, which is scheduled to be filed tomorrow. For the second quarter, the impact of the consolidation to our sales and earnings results was not material. Going forward, we do expect MK Panama's operating results to have a meaningful impact on our consolidated financials. We are continuing to evaluate the required assets, and there may be future adjustments taken against this business, which have not been included in our guidance. 
Turning to the balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, cash and cash equivalents were $431.5 million as compared to $1.0 billion last year. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 9.4 million shares, totaling $400 million under our share repurchase authorization. To date, our buybacks totaled approximately 23.2 million shares and $1.2 billion. We remain confident in our long-term growth outlook and free cash flow generation, and are pleased to announce that the Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of an additional $500 million of the company's ordinary shares. This increases our initial repurchase authorization to $2 billion, of which $758 million is available to us for future repurchases through March 2018. 
X MK Panama, there were no outstanding borrowings under our credit facility in either year. I am pleased to report that we have entered into an amended and restated credit facility on October 29, 2015, increasing the size to $1 billion and extending the maturity to October 2020. We believe this facility provides us with more flexibility to pursue our long-term operational and financial growth objectives, and may be used for general corporate purposes, share repurchases and acquisition of licenses or fashion brands. 
Inventory increased 15.2% compared to last year. Approximately $14 million of the increase related to our European inventory, which was valued 19% higher than the prior year due to the year-over-year currency exchange rate differential. Approximately $10 million were due to acceleration of holiday merchandises resulting in higher in-transit inventory, and approximately $14 million  was related to the consolidation of MK Panama. The remainder is attributable to normal growth of our business as we continued to open stores, open shop-in-shops, expand e-commerce and our omnichannel capabilities and the increase replenishment programs. As we look forward, we anticipate that the exchange rate differential in the MK Panama consolidation will continue into the third quarter, and that our inventory will increase at a rate higher than the sales increase. 
Capital expenditures for the quarter were $87.5 million, and were related to the build-out of our new retail stores and shop-in-shops as well as investments in our information-technology, distribution system enhancements, our corporate offices and other infrastructure improvements. 
Turning to our outlook. For the third quarter, we expect total revenues to be between $1.33 billion and $1.35 billion. On a constant-currency basis, total revenue is expected to increase in the mid-single digit range, assuming a $42 million impact from the change in foreign currency rates. We expect a mid-single-digit comp store decrease on a reported basis and a low single digit decrease in constant currency. 
Operating expenses as a percent to total revenue is expected to increase 200 to 240 basis points in the third quarter due to our global investments. We expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.44 to $1.48, assuming a tax rate of approximately 28.5% and 187.0 million shares outstanding. We expect foreign currency to impact net income by approximately $11 million and EPS by approximately $0.06 for the third quarter.  For the full fiscal year, we now expect revenue of $4.6 billion to $4.65 billion. On a constant-currency basis, total revenue is expected to increase in the low double-digit range, assuming a $164 million impact from the change in foreign currency rates. We expect a mid-single-digit comp store decrease on a reported basis and a low single digit decrease in constant currency. 
Our revised revenue expectation reflects our tempered outlook for the second half of the year. While we believe our product and marketing efforts will benefit our business longer term, we are taking a more prudent stance in the second half. We expect the sequential improvement in comp store sales in the third or fourth quarter to be driven by the inclusion of U.S. digital sales from the comp base, the rollout of Kors Concierge in our stores, the launch of our new national advertising campaign, the introduction of new innovative product offerings for holiday and spring 2016, diminished FX headwinds and easier year-over-year comparisons. 
As we stated previously, we anticipate the 53rd week to add approximately $40 million of additional sales this fiscal year. We expect international gross margin to remain under pressure in the third and fourth quarters as favorable hedging contracts we entered into last year expire. Operating expenses as a percent of total revenues is expected to increase 200 to 220 basis points for the year. We expect the increase in operating expense as a percent of total revenue to continue to moderate as compared to the first half of the year as the rate of spends flows, and we begin to anniversary the investments we made in 2015. We now expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $4.38 to $4.42 for the year, assuming a tax rate of approximately 29% and 191.5 million shares outstanding. We expect foreign currency to impact net income by approximately $36 million and EPS by approximately $0.19 for the year. 
I will now turn the call back to John for the closing remarks."

I think you mentioned that it grew 136% in the quarter. I believe you've set the clock in house early September last year, so I would assume the growth in the quarter was distorted to July and August since you're sort of anniversary-ing the big pick up that you have you seen in September. But maybe you can just help us out with that. And then I'm wondering on the wholesale channel. It sounds like a very prudent move to pull back on the inventory there. I'm wondering if you can talk about the pacing of how you sort of hold the inventory back a bit in the wholesale channel? And is it -- are you doing it both in the North American market and Europe, or is it virtually concentrated in North America?"

I mean, obviously, the numbers are very strong in terms of the growth rates and the conversion rates as well. And what we're re",796,"Great. Thank you, Kimberly. We are very pleased with what's happening with our e-commerce business since we bought it in-house. I mean, obviously, the numbers are very strong in terms of the growth rates and the conversion rates as well. And what we're really seeing is the engagement of the customer. And I have to be frank with you, we're I think, at the very early stages of what we're going to be able to achieve with this platform. We're operationally in great shape, I think the site itself is quite exciting. We're going to do a lot of things over the next 6 months or so to improve our mobile experience. We don't think that's where we really need to be. And secondly, what we're going to be able to do through our analytics and CRM with truly presenting our styling capabilities and Michael's messaging with the various communications vehicles that we're developing to tailor the experience for our customer. We think the opportunity is, quite frankly, very, very large for us. So I think that basically it's all systems go in terms of what we're seeing, I don't say North America and Canada, both platforms are operating at very, very high productivity rate. And as we said in the call, we're bringing on Europe in the fall, and we will actually bring up Korea and Japan not too far after that. So we will be, I think, in a very, very strong position. We told you 2 years ago that we were going to make a very big investment in systems, people and in the distribution facilities to be able to handle all this, and we're there, and we consider ourselves to be a company who will ultimately be a best-in-class in this category. Secondly, on the inventory side. The pull back on inventory is predominantly in North America. The department store business in North America is suffering some of the same channels -- challenges that we've seen in terms of the traffic in shopping malls. So that's got us taking a more prudent approach to how much inventory we actually have sitting in the stores. That being said, our e-commerce business with all of our department store partners is really quite extraordinary. And I think we're all just learning how we can turn these inventories faster and supply the customer with a very strong experience, both online and in store. Again, that being said, we find the environment to be a little more promotional than we would like. So that being said, we'd like to have less inventory in the stores and have less of our brand appearing on sale, in particular, in that channel distribution. So you'll see that pullback happen kind of between now, start to see it in Q3 or Q4, will more normalize itself by June or July, which we think is the right thing for us to do given the climate and what we want to do to keeping the health of the brand. Kimberly, I want to mention one last thing. I made a highlight of it on the call, and I think it's an important issue. We continue to outperform in our categories, whether that's accessories, footwear or women's ready-to-wear, we're outperforming our competitors in the department store channel be a fairly significant amount. And we're quite proud of that. That is under the whole cloud of the fact that we said that we grew the North American handbag business in the low single digits that retail, both on stores and department stores. But high double-digits in terms of units. So the idea that people are not buying handbags, I do not believe is a correct concept. They happen to be the fashion trend of smaller bags. So if we were selling ex percent of $350, $400 and $500 handbags at this time last year, we are selling less of those because we are selling a lot more, in particular, of cross bodies and large wallets. And that is what the consumer, in particular, the millennial, is viewing as a fashion trend. So that has an impact on AUR. And so therefore, we're selling a lot of Michael Kors products to people. Young people think they have bought a handbag. It's not that we're not selling handbags, in fact, we're selling out lot more handbags. So I think there is really a misnomer about what is happening in the marketplace. We believe that the handbag market in North America is, again, growing at low single digit. But very, very high numbers in terms of units. So I think as you all are looking at the business, you should do some analysis on that, and we can share any insights that we have with you as well."

Omar, first up, we're kind of pleased with what's happening with the sequential performance of our comp store trend. In fact, our comp stores through October are getting better again, from what we just reported. So we're pleased with what's happening with the trend in the marketplace. It's 2 things in North America. It is, without a question, smaller handbags, as I said, I want to really hit home on this point so you all understand. We're selling high double digits in terms of additional units, that means the people are buying a lot more Michael Kors products and the same thing may be happening in some of our competitors. But just trend. So we're losing actual performance in the stores just because a customer thinks that they bought a handbag. So that's the first thing. And the second thing is the moderation from our previous guidance also reflects the continuation of what we think is impacting us as the tourist traffic. Both of the department stores and in the retail channel, we have huge doors, whether it's in New York, whether it's in Southern Florida area, all of our being impacted in Texas because of oil prices there, that's a little bit less tourist. But some of it's related to the Mexicans shopping cross-border with the peso to the dollar. So these are things that we just don't see going away so quickly even though we'll be lapsing the change in currency, which will happen probably to its large effect Q4, the tail end of that. That's just something we think we're going to be a little bit more prudent about. And again, both in retail or wholesale, we just like to have a lot less markdown inventory in the stores, we don't think that's good for the long-term. And we can still achieve our financial targets. As you can see, our newer range annually still puts us kind of, if you take the middle of that range, at the low end of our previous guidance. So we're still going to achieve our financial objectives and we're going to do it in a prudent way that's going to protect the health of the brand and be respectful of what's happening in the environment."

As I said in the call, saddlebags are -- we're probably going to run out before even before the holiday season. Merlot, we'll probably going to run out before the fashion season. We've got some great new handbag styles for the hit. They're really getting some excellent traction. And the whole crossbody piece of the business, I want to tell you, we're excited about. We're less excited about the lower transaction value, but we are on trend, and all the consumer research that we're doing, our customers says we love Michael Kors, we want to buy Michael Kors, and they are actually buying more Michael Kors. They're just buying small units, smaller average price point unit for us, so we're seeing that happen. The biggest piece of that is going to hit for the spring season where we've got 22 new handbag groups that we're introducing. Obviously, all of those won't be at retail. But you're going to see a major change in the way that the product works in the store. And that's not just because of the comp store trends, I want to be clear. That's because that's what's happening in the handbag and the fashion business. Our luxury competitors around the world are doing a great job of certain of them and really updating products and making it exciting and compelling for the customer. And that's what the customer wants to be. When we're delivering newness, they get excited. And I wanted to say, we're seeing that in the watch business. in A business that is clearly challenged and the customer has voted a little bit more for the iPhone or in a little bit less for the watch, all of a sudden, Michael was the one who really drove it, let's go one after the leather watchband business in a big way, regarding, and we're getting excellent sell-throughs on that. Our new platings, sable and navy, excellent sell-throughs on that. So just saying to us, she wants -- she's ready to shop, but we better be a fashion leader and on trend to inspire her. So we like what we see in the stores, and I want to leave you with this call that we're kind of excited about what we see in what's happening out there right now. Thanks, Omar."

Erin, I remember about 3 or 4 years ago when the conversations of sequential deceleration came up. This is going -- our business is going to sequentially decline, whether it's North America or Europe in the quarters just because we're getting bigger. We're doing over $1 billion in Europe, which is incredibly impressive to have built that in basically 6 years. And we have high brand awareness, great customer loyalty. We're looking at our newest kind of developed market that we went after this year, Italy, business is literally on fire running strong double-digit comp growth there. So I would tell you that our business in Europe is very, very strong. There are -- FX headwinds out of just a second. There are a couple of factors that are impacting the business in Europe. And that is, first and foremost, the Russian tourists who was a very large piece of our business, has not been traveling as you well know. The second piece is there's a Middle Eastern terrorist issue that they're not traveling as much as they did, we had very nice business for them. So both of those individual markets, if you're going to look at our Middle Eastern market and our Russian market, are doing exceptional double-digit comp store growth in both of those markets. Because customers not coming into Europe, they're shopping in those markets. So we picked some of that up through our wholesale channel. But they tend to spend a little bit more when they're traveling and a little bit less fluidly when they're in their country. And there is some challenge in the U.K., and that's more of a pound to the euro situation, where, again, the tourists are traveling a little less into the U.K. because of the strength of the pound, i.e., the U.S. dollar. So we again, we really like what we see going on in Europe. And some of our department store businesses, in particular, word, Lafayette,  I mean just fantastic, word, fantastic. I can go through the areas. But we are going to, over the years, we're probably today the largest accessible luxury handbag company in Europe, and we told you we would get there about 3 years ago and we're probably there today. So as we have either the #1 or the #2 position in the marketplace, we will grow, but it just won't be at the same growth rates that we've seen before. But overall, we really like the response that we're still having with the brand in the markets, and especially as we enter some of these new markets, customers responding with great enthusiasm."

North America, yes, we said we will be at 400. That will actually probably change just slightly because of -- North American women's, and the Americas will change slightly because you'll see the South American numbers reported in the Americas numbers, so just so you know. But no, we have no intent of kind of going beyond that, and we're close to it. We'll open a few more stores, and that rollout will be complete. And again, as we've said to you many times, because you've all questioned us regularly, I might say, on why do you open more stores, well, we're profitable when we open more stores, and people, while online shopping, is absolutely a trend that is going to move the needle for the company, people will still go out and shop in a store. That won't -- at least, while I'm alive, won't have evaporated. So we'll be in the right cities and the right locations and feel good about that. And then in terms of men's, I would say that we're going to open these 6 or 7 stores in North America. We've got about 3 fresh 4 on the docket in Europe and then a handful in Asia. And then we've got about 75 shop-in-shops going into North America, and I don't remember the exact number in Europe. I would say, we'll get these all in place, and then we'll kind of hold a little bit, just to make sure we understand what the performances are, productivities, how we're going to go about doing this. We're really exerted, I can't wait to show you guys the new fall line is coming with Marcel Ostwald joining us. And as you know, he had a sportswear design for Hugo Boss. So we're really exited about what's coming product-wise. We got a whole new marketing campaign that Michael has developed that will include some significant television advertising for men because men, it's not a traditional magazine-driven communication market. So what we're going to do digitally and on TV with men's, well, I think you'll be quite impressed with. So we're deadly serious about the men's business. You've heard me say before it's a $1 billion opportunity. Of that $1 billion, we save $300 million of it is in leather goods, and if you go down to Macy's Health Square, you can see all the leather good shop there, you're going to see quite a few more opening as we move forward. So this is an area of business, going to take us a couple of years to grow it, but once it gets going, this will be a very nice additional growth vehicle for the company. Thank you, Erinn."

So that is driven,  I would say, about 60% of that is driven by smaller handbags. And I'd say the balance of that is driven by additional promotional activity inside the stores. We see that starting to stabilize, in particular, in the third and fourth quarter because remember we're lapping some of the stuff starting to happen. They all got a little more promotional less holiday season. Got really promotional into Q1 -- or our Q4, calendar Q1. And then the small handbags started around that time. So we see in our Retail business in North America, in particular, we think margins are going to start to stabilize in Q3 and Q4. You've seen kind of a sequential 1% to 2% decline in gross margins in the Retail business, and we think that's going to stabilize for us. We feel pretty good about that. And we think this AUR situation, we'll be lapping it as well. The other thing I might add that also impacted -- again, I don't want to sound defensive, but a lot of people are writing about our comp store decline, and it's all about the handbags. The watches are having an enormous impact on our comp store decline. So our handbag business is relatively healthy. And I think the industry is relatively healthy, it's not growing at the high single digit rate it used to. But when you look at the amount of bags that is being purchased, the interest by the customer, we feel good about all that. We'll start to lapse the comp store decline in watches also coming soon. And remember, our average watch sale was between $200 and $225. So that actually impacts our average transaction inside of our stores. So once we start to lap some of that, again, we feel pretty good about that situation as well. And your second question was? Or was that it?."

At one point, the traffic decline was higher than the comp decline, and the comp decline got higher than the traffic decline, and that was driven by AUR. Now as I said to you, that's why you're hearing me feel positive. It's kind of you getting out our conversion rates are up, which is up significantly by the way, I have to take my hat off, I want to complement our 7,000 employees out selling around the world, these people are doing a great job, and that's one of our, I think, incredible strengths. You may remember from the IPO, our jet-set training, the way that we really work with our teams and we've announced the Course Concierge which will be piloted starting really this week, it's going to be an incredible tool for these people to really act as a brand ambassador, but really to be a styling consultant. And again, we'll show this to you, guys, because I think you'll be quite impressed with what the technology gives our sales associates from not only a product point of view, but also information about who the customer is, what they bought previously, et cetera, all at their fingertips. And I think that is going to help us with comps because traffic is going to continue to decline. We know that, although I think moderated at certain point. And if we can continue to keep our transaction and conversion levels up, which we've been able to do or get our transaction level stabilized and get our conversion rates up, which we've been able to do that, I think, that's where you're going to see the comps turn for us. And so again, we feel pretty excited about that along with the launches of new products. Asia, or let me start -- Asia, in general, is doing great for us. So I'll just make that as an overall statement. You saw the comps in Japan. We reported that we have strong double-digit comps in China. And then in Southeast Asia, pretty much similar strong double-digit comps, 1 or 2 markets are high single digit comps. So the whole region for us is fantastic. And what's interesting is, in China, Hong Kong and Macau are not exactly flourishing, as we speak. But when we look at our China comps, we're running strong double-digit comp, even with Macau and Hong Kong suffering from lower tourist traffic. As it relates to the repurchase, we've always said, we'll look at it when the business reaches scale and profitability levels that will be accretive to the company. I will tell you that the business is, obviously, growing very rapidly. We report in the Q this size every quarter because we report the royalties earned and the wholesale that we ship. So you can see the growth of the business. We're going to be a significant player in China and really excited about the new word 9,000 square foot store that we're opening. And Michael will be there in November, and the events that we're putting on, the team that we have on the ground, it just further gives us great confidence that this region potentially over the next few years will probably be larger even in Europe for us."

But I would say to you that the gross margin in retail, we believe, is going to stabilize. I said that to you -- we're feeling pretty good about that. We think we've got a pretty clear picture on that. We are going to take some price increases on some of our small leather goods because we've been actually slightly underpriced compared to some of the large luxury competitors and also on some of our crossbodies. So we think that will get us some margin improvement there. And as I said, we're kind of lapsing the promotional environment. So I'd say that, that's going to remain in a pretty good place. And we'll probably have a little sequential decline in wholesale gross margin and as a result of higher allowances to Department stores. But again, we think that will be not highly significant as we look out, and especially as we begin to pull back some of the inventories. And that's really more of a North American thing. We don't see that as a European or we have a very sizable business in Asia now, growing up to our license partners and through the Duty Free operating channels as well. So I'd like to thank everyone for joining us on the call today. I think you can sense a lot of enthusiasm from us here at Michael Kors. And that's based around, I want to first start with the incredible product that Michael and the design teams have been putting forth. And what we're feeling good about is the fact that, that product is resonating. We're both delivering great new fashion innovation, and we're delivering trend. So those are 2 things that are important to being successful, and Michael and our design teams have done that. Secondly, we're really excited about our execution at what's happening in the digital world for us. And I also want to layer on to that what's going to come with Kors Concierge and given our already 7,000 amazing employees around the world who are selling everyday of the week to our fashion customers an outstanding tool to help deliver a better jet-set experience. And third, I want to say that we believe that we'll be lapping some of the headwinds that we've seen over the past 12 months. And that, therefore, we will have slightly easier comparisons, and additionally, we think we'll have a little bit more of a platform to begin to launch off of. So with those things resonating in front of us and the growth of our international business, Michael Kors is going to be an exciting company to watch, and we're looking forward to reporting to you on the next quarter and delivering another outstanding set of results. Thank you very much."

Good morning, and welcome to Michael Kors' second quarter fiscal 2016 earnings call. I'll begin with a review of the quarter and then provide an update on some of our growth initiatives.
I'm pleased to report that our financial results for the second quarter exceeded expectations as we continued to expand the Michael Kors luxury brand worldwide. Total revenue increased 7% on a reported basis, and on a constant-currency basis, total revenue increased 12%, driven by increases in both our retail and wholesale segments across geographies. We saw revenue growth of approximately 6% in the Americas, 21% in Europe and 61% in Japan on a constant-currency basis. Our EPS of $1.01, which included a $0.06 impact from foreign currency, was also better than anticipated for the quarter. Our retail sales grew 8%, and in constant currency, our retail business grew 15%, driven by new store openings, strength in our North American digital flagships and continued momentum in Europe and Japan.
Global comparable store sales decreased 8.5% or 3.4% on a constant-currency basis, in line with expectations and reflecting sequential improvement as compared to the first quarter. North American digital sales more than doubled compared to last year as consumers continued to ship purchases through online and mobile channels. On a constant-currency basis, we delivered a high single-digit comp increase in Europe and strong double-digit growth in Japan.
In our North American retail stores, comps declined in high single digits as we continue to see the impact from lower mall traffic and a shift to the online channel. If we included our U.S. digital flagship sales in our comp base, our North American comparable store sales would have declined in the mid-single-digit range. Wholesale sales grew 8% in the second quarter, and in constant currency, wholesale sales increased 12%, led by continued strength in our accessories category. In addition, our wholesale business expanded across geographies with mid-single-digit growth in both the Americas and Europe in constant currency as well as further growth in the Asian market. Licensing revenue in the quarter declined due to lower sales of watches as we saw continued softness in this category. Revenue increased in a number of other areas of our licensing business in the second quarter, including fragrance, jewelry and eyewear categories.
Turning to our product categories. The accessories business in North America grew at a mid-single-digit rate with a double-digit increase in units sold, demonstrating continued growth of this category and the demand for the Michael Kors luxury brand. However, dollar growth was impacted by lower AUR due to increased demand for smaller-sized handbags, crossbodies and small leather goods, which carry lower price points. We saw accelerated growth in footwear, although the warm weather tempered boot sales in the quarter. The watch business continues to remain under pressure in retail and wholesale. But we are excited by the introduction of several new watch styles, including a broader assortment of watches with leather bands and watches with new platings in navy and sable, which we believe is creating renewed desire for the category.
Now turning to some highlights of our strategic initiatives. We remain focused on growing our business globally through both retail and wholesale expansion as well as our licensing partnerships.
On the retail side. We are driving growth through the continued development of our digital flagships worldwide as well as the expansion of our store footprint in the Americas, Europe and Asia. As I mentioned earlier, our North America digital business is growing rapidly. Desktop and mobile traffic has increased at a double-digit rate and converging rates are strong, proving that our customers love the convenience of shopping and connecting with Michael Kors online and on-the-go.
We are seeing accessories and footwear emerge as dominant e-commerce categories, demonstrating the brand strength of these core luxury product lines. We believe the transition to online and mobile purchasing will continue worldwide, and we are poised to capitalize on this shift with the development of our digital platform to provide a global, multi-language, multicurrency e-commerce experience for our customers. The rollout of our digital flagships across Europe is expected to begin in fall of 2016, followed by Asia thereafter.
In men's, we are encouraged by the early growth rates and acceptance of our products as we begin to build a world-class men's brand. Our men's collection was initially introduced into the retail channel with the opening of our SoHo flagship store nearly a year ago, providing the first dedicated jet-set luxury experience for the Michael Kors man. We are pleased to announce the upcoming opening of 3 additional men's location in Scottsdale Fashion Square in Arizona; Garden State Plaza in Paramus, New Jersey; and San Francisco Center in California.
In Europe, we've begun to sell our men's product in our recently opened Stockholm flagship and Amsterdam flagship locations, and we're pleased with the favorable response. And looking forward, we have already identified several additional prime locations in Roseville Field, New York, Memorial City in Houston Texas, World Trade Center in New York City as well as London, Tokyo, Singapore and Taiwan. We remain excited about the long-term opportunity for this business with the potential for up to 500 freestanding stores or combined format locations worldwide.
Lastly, we are set to unlock the opportunity for Michael Kors in Korea as we transition this business in-house by the end of the year. We are well on our way to building the right infrastructure and developing an expansion strategy to position this business for long-term growth.
In wholesale, we, like many others, have seen the department store channel slowing, and we will be monitoring this business carefully and managing our inventory to protect our brand and margins. However, our brand strength and compelling luxury product offerings have enabled us to maintain our leadership position in this space. We expect continued growth in accessories business globally as well as in our womenswear, footwear and men's categories as we further develop these businesses and extend our lifestyle presence.
We also continue to benefit from the conversion of existing department store doors into shop-in-shop locations across product categories, capturing incremental sales as customers respond favorably to Michael Kors' branded environments.
We are on track to convert 600 shop-in-shops this year across all categories and are particularly excited to have opened a new flagship men's shop within Macy's Herald Square presenting our broadest product assortment in one of the most historic, well-recognized department store locations in the world.
In our licensing business, we're excited about the recent launch of our new Gold Fragrance Collection, featuring a scent for every women ranging from feminine and seductive to sparkling and sensuous. Our men's fragrance offering as well as the expansion of key EMEA markets are contributing to the growth we've seen this year in this category.
In eyewear, we are pleased with our partnership with Luxottica, and the customers' response we're seeing to our new eyewear collection, particularly with our iconic aviator styles. Both of these categories offer consumers a number of great gifting items for this holiday season. We also see opportunity for long-term growth in fragrance and eyewear through both expanded distribution and increased penetration.
Another category that we are excited about is our new connected fashion accessories line, which will launch in fall 2016. There's a great opportunity to build a significant position in this growing category and become a fashion leader in the emerging tech space. In addition, given the strong acceptance we have seen across international markets, we remain focused on expanding the Michael Kors luxury brand through our licensing partners. The Asia region continues to represent a significant growth opportunity for our company. We continue to see strong results in the Greater China business with double-digit comp store growth in the second quarter. Consumer response to our luxury product offering has been favorable, and we are excited to see our footwear business start to gain tractor in this marketplace.
We attribute the growth in part to our increasing brand awareness in the region, which we now believe is at approximately 50% in large cities. Our strategic marketing effort in the region are one of the key drivers of brand awareness. We're excited to be hosting a star-studded event in November with Vogue, called Young China [ph], to celebrate the opening of our largest flagship location in Huamao, Beijing, totaling 9,000 square feet. This media event will be attended by Michael himself as well as key influencers from China's movie industry, and will spotlight our luxury fashion and amplify the glamor of Michael Kors' jet-set luxury lifestyle. The development and success of our China business is increasing demand to Michael Kors brand throughout Asia and Europe as Chinese consumers travel the globe, and 50% to 60% of their purchases are outside of Mainland China.
As we look to the second half of the year, we believe we are well-positioned for the upcoming holiday season. Michael and our design teams continue to create on-trend fashion products that embody the Michael Kors luxury brand. Our recent merchandise assortments truly reflect Michael's leadership in driving the latest fashion trend. Our rich suede saddle bags, mini bucket bags and quilted bags emerged as top-selling items this past quarter. 
Merlot was a hit in all departments. Watches with leather bands and new metal platings in navy and sable were met with great response, and our active footwear and backpack capitalized on the sports lux trend. The positive response we are seeing from our customers gives us confidence that our new product introductions are taking hold. To celebrate this season with effortless glamor and style, our holiday gifting collections will continue to emphasize our on-trend fashion products.
To highlight our new holiday merchandise, we are excited to be launching the Michael Kors ""just because"" [ph] marketing campaign to connect our customers with that special gift that's just right. As we look ahead to spring 2016, we will continue to offer compelling on-trend fashion with the introduction of our largest assortment of new handbag groups as well as new watch offerings, reflecting the most expensive presentation of innovative materials we've used to date. In addition, our strong marketing program enables us to further engage customers with the brand, immerse them in the luxury lifestyle and encourage them to shop our sites and stores.
As we mentioned last quarter, we are excited about our new national advertising campaign that transport our customers to global cities, which represent the jet-set world of Michael Kors. Our integrated positioning through our content-rich website, compelling social media, global advertising, brand marketing and media events and traditional print and outdoor advertising are designed to speak to our customers globally in an authentic voice, always emphasizing our luxury DNA, ultimately marrying brand equity and awareness and translating that into conversion.
In summary, we are pleased with the success we achieved in the second quarter, with revenue growth of 7% on a reported basis and 12% on a constant-currency basis.
Our digital flagship business in North America more than doubled. We drove sequential improvement in comp store sales. We continued to increase brand awareness in international markets, and we are seeing the acceptance of our newest handbag groups and watch styles, and we are capitalizing on our leadership position in the luxury market. While we expect the macro headwinds to continue in the near term, the Michael Kors brand remains incredibly strong, and we are focused on continuing to execute our strategic initiatives to drive long-term growth.
Now let me turn it over to Joe for a detailed review of our second quarter financial results and an update on our outlook."

Our financial results exceeded our guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2016. Total revenue grew 6.9% to $1.1 billion. As expected, foreign currency headwinds continued to impact our results this quarter.",1896,"Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Our financial results exceeded our guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2016. Total revenue grew 6.9% to $1.1 billion. As expected, foreign currency headwinds continued to impact our results this quarter. On a constant-currency basis, total revenue grew 12.3%. By region, in constant currency, revenue in the Americas increased 5.6%, Europe revenue increased 20.6%, and Japan revenue increased 60.7%. In our retail segment, net sales increased 7.5% to $532.8 million. In constant currencies, net sales increased 14.7%, driven by the opening of 116 net new stores since the second quarter of last year and an increase in our North American digital flagship sales.
Notably, we saw exceptional performance from our digital flagships, which generated a sales increase of 136% as compared to the sales of our previous outsourced site. Comp store sales declined 8.5% on a reported basis. On a constant-currency basis, comp store sales declined 3.4%, reflecting a sequential improvement in the first quarter. The decline is attributable to lower comp store sales in North America, partially offset by an increase in comp sales in both Europe and Japan. If we included our U.S. digital flagship sales on our comp base, our global comp store sales would have decreased in the low single-digit range on a constant-currency basis. We added 39 new stores in the second quarter: 23 in Americas, which included 18 previously opened stores from our Panama joint venture, which was consolidated for the first time this quarter; 12 in Europe; and 4 in Japan. In addition, we expanded or relocated 13 stores. We ended the quarter with 589 company-owned stores, including concessions, and 804 stores overall, including our licensed locations.
Wholesale net sales grew 7.8% to $554.0 million for the second quarter. On a constant-currency basis, wholesale sales increased 11.8%, driven by our accessories category and growth across our regions. During the second quarter, we converted 223 wholesale doors into shop-in-shops globally.
In our licensing segment, revenue decreased 8.1% to $43.2 million for the quarter due to lower licensing revenue related to sales of watches, somewhat offset by a revenue increase related to sales of outerwear, jewelry and eyewear. We continue to open new watch and jewelry shop-in-shops during the quarter and ended the quarter with 310 shop-in-shops globally.
Gross profit grew 3.0% to $664.4 million. Gross margin declined 220 basis points to 58.8%, which includes an 89 basis point foreign currency impact. The decline in gross margin reflects a 280 basis point decline in retail gross margins due to additional promotional activity in our North American retail business, a 130 basis point decline in wholesale gross margin due to additional wholesale allowances, partially offset by geographic mix and lower licensing gross margin dollars.
Total operating expenses grew 15.3% to $391.3 million. This increase was attributable to our global investments, including our retail expansion, our digital flagship initiatives, infrastructure investment in Korea in the men's business, the build-out of our European distribution center and the continued investment in corporate systems and infrastructure. As a percent of total revenue, total operating expenses increased 250 basis points to 34.6%. This was below the 440 to 490 basis points of deleverage in our guidance as sales exceeded our expectation, and depreciation expense and SG&A were somewhat lower than anticipated.
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 13.0% to $345.2 million. The increase in SG&A expenses was largely due to the higher retail occupancy and salary costs related to new store openings, an increase in corporate employee-related expenses primarily due to an increase in our corporate staff to support our global growth as well as other corporate occupancy and operations-related costs. As a percent of total revenue, SG&A expenses were 30.5%, compared to 28.9% for the second quarter last year.
Depreciation and amortization expense increased 35.5% to $46.2 million for the second quarter, primarily due to new retail stores, new shop-in-shops, an increase in lease rights related to our new European stores and investments in our corporate facilities and IT infrastructure. As a result of these factors, income from operations were $273.1 million or 24.2% of total revenue, as compared to 28.9% of total revenue in the same period last year.
Retail operating margin declined 690 basis points due to a 410 basis point increase in operating expenses attributable to higher store-related costs, corporate-allocated expense as well as higher depreciation and amortization expense primarily attributable to new store openings as well as a decline in retail gross margin, as discussed earlier. Retail operating margin was also impacted by the growth of digital sales as the e-commerce business carries a lower operating margin rate than retail stores. As the e-commerce business reaches scale, we do expect e-commerce margins to be more in line with that of a brick-and-mortar business.
Wholesale operating margin declined 220 basis points due to the decline in the wholesale gross margin, as discussed earlier, and an 80 basis point increase in operating expense attributable to higher depreciation expense. Licensing operating margin decreased 820 basis points, primarily due to higher advertising costs, corporate-allocated expenses and selling expenses relative to lower revenues. Income taxes were $78.4 million in the quarter, and our effective tax rate was 28.9% as compared to 31.9% in the same period last year. The decrease in our effective tax rate was primarily due to the increase of taxable income in certain non-U.S. subsidiaries, which are subject to lower statutory tax rates as well as state tax benefits.
Net income was $193.1 million for the second quarter, and diluted earnings per share were $1.01 based upon 191.5 million weighted-average diluted shares outstanding. The unfavorable currency impact to EPS was $0.06 per share.
As we noted last quarter, we obtained a 75% controlling interest in our Latin American joint venture and are now consolidating MK Panama into our operations beginning this quarter. You can find the details of the acquisition described in Note 3 of our 10-Q, which is scheduled to be filed tomorrow.
For the second quarter, the impact of the consolidation to our sales and earnings results was not material. Going forward, we do not expect MK Panama's operating results to have a meaningful impact on our consolidated financials. We are continuing to evaluate the required assets, and there may be future adjustments taken against this business, which have not been included in our guidance.
Turning to the balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, cash and cash equivalents were $431.5 million as compared to $1.0 billion last year. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 9.4 million shares, totaling $400 million under our share repurchase authorization. To date, our buybacks totaled approximately 23.2 million shares and $1.2 billion. We remain confident in our long-term growth outlook and free cash flow generation, and are pleased to announce that the Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of an additional $500 million of the company's ordinary shares. This increases our initial repurchase authorization to $2 billion, of which $758 million is available to us for future repurchases through March 2018.
X MK Panama, there were no outstanding borrowings under our credit facility in either year. I am pleased to report that we have entered into an amended and restated credit facility on October 29, 2015, increasing the size to $1 billion and extending the maturity to October 2020. We believe this facility provides us with more flexibility to pursue our long-term operational and financial growth objectives, and may be used for general corporate purposes, share repurchases and acquisition of licenses or fashion brands.
Inventory increased 15.2% compared to last year. Approximately $14 million of the increase related to our European inventory, which was valued 19% higher than the prior year due to the year-over-year currency exchange rate differential. Approximately $10 million were due to acceleration of holiday merchandises resulting in higher in-transit inventory, and approximately $14 million was related to the consolidation of MK Panama. The remainder is attributable to normal growth of our business as we continued to open stores, open shop-in-shops, expand e-commerce and our omnichannel capabilities and the increase replenishment program.
As we look forward, we anticipate that the exchange rate differential in the MK Panama consolidation will continue into the third quarter, and that our inventory will increase at a rate higher than the sales increase.
Capital expenditures for the quarter were $87.5 million, and were related to the build-out of our new retail stores and shop-in-shops as well as investments in our information technology, distribution system enhancements, our corporate offices and other infrastructure improvements.
Turning to our outlook. For the third quarter, we expect total revenues to be between $1.33 billion and $1.35 billion. On a constant-currency basis, total revenue is expected to increase in the mid-single-digit range, assuming a $42 million impact from the change in foreign currency rates. We expect a mid-single-digit comp store decrease on a reported basis and a low single-digit decrease in constant currency.
Operating expense as a percent of total revenue is expected to increase 200 to 240 basis points in the third quarter due to our global investments. We expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.44 to $1.48, assuming a tax rate of approximately 28.5% and 187.0 million shares outstanding. We expect foreign currency to impact net income by approximately $11 million and EPS by approximately $0.06 for the third quarter. For the full fiscal year, we now expect revenue of $4.6 billion to $4.65 billion. On a constant-currency basis, total revenue is expected to increase in the low double-digit range, assuming a $164 million impact from the change in foreign currency rates. We expect a mid-single-digit comp store decrease on a reported basis and a low single-digit decrease in constant currency.
Our revised revenue expectation reflects our tempered outlook for the second half of the year. While we believe our product and marketing efforts will benefit our business longer term, we are taking a more prudent stance in the second half. We expect the sequential improvement in comp store sales in the third or fourth quarter to be driven by the inclusion of U.S. digital sales from the comp base, the rollout of Kors Concierge in our stores, the launch of our new national advertising campaign, the introduction of new innovative product offerings for holiday and spring 2016, diminished FX headwinds and easier year-over-year comparisons.
As we stated previously, we anticipate the 53rd week to add approximately $40 million of additional sales this fiscal year. We expect international gross margin to remain under pressure in the third and fourth quarters as favorable hedging contracts we entered into last year expire. Operating expense as a percent of total revenue is expected to increase 200 to 220 basis points for the year. We expect the increase in operating expense as a percent of total revenue to continue to moderate as compared to the first half of the year as the rate of spends flows and we begin to anniversary the investments we made in 2015. We now expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $4.38 to $4.42 for the year, assuming a tax rate of approximately 29% and 191.5 million shares outstanding. We expect foreign currency to impact net income by approximately $36 million and EPS by approximately $0.19 for the year.
I will now turn the call back to John for the closing remarks."

I'm wondering if you can talk about e-commerce, John. I think you mentioned that it grew 136% in the quarter. I believe you've set the platform in-house early September last year, so I would assume the growth in the quarter was distorted to July and August since you're sort of anniversarying the big pick up that you had seen in September. But maybe you can just help us out with that. And then I'm wondering, on the wholesale channel, it sounds like a very prudent move to pull back on the inventory there. I'm wondering if you can talk about the pacing of how you sort of hold the inventory back a bit in the wholesale channel, and is it -- are you doing it both in the North America market and Europe? Or is it largely concentrated in North America?"

I mean, obviously, the numbers are very strong in terms of the growth rates and the conversion rates as well. And what we're re",811,"Great. Thank you, Kimberly. We're very pleased with what's happening with our e-commerce business since we brought it in-house. I mean, obviously, the numbers are very strong in terms of the growth rates and the conversion rates as well. And what we're really seeing is the engagement of the customer. And I have to be frank with you, we're I think at the very early stages of what we're going to be able to achieve with this platform. We're operationally, I think, in great shape, I think the site itself is quite exciting. We're going to do a lot of things over the next 6 months or so to improve our mobile experience. We don't think that's where it really needs to be. And secondly, what we're going to be able to do through our analytics and CRM with truly presenting our styling capabilities and Michael's messaging with the various communication vehicles that we're developing to tailor the experience for our customer. We think the opportunity is, quite frankly, very, very large for us. So I think that, basically, it's all systems go in terms of what we're seeing both in North America -- I'll say [ph] America and Canada, both platforms are operating at a very, very high productivity rate. And as we said in the call, we're bringing on Europe in the fall, and we will actually bring up Korea and Japan not too far after that. So we will be, I think, in a very, very strong position. We told you 2 years ago that we were going to make a very big investment in systems, people and in the distribution facilities to be able to handle all this, and we're there, and we consider ourselves to be a company who will ultimately be best-in-class in this category. Secondly, on the inventory side. The pull back on inventory is predominantly in North America. The department store business in North America is suffering some of the same channels -- challenges that we've seen in terms of the traffic in shopping malls. So that's got us taking a more prudent approach to how much inventory we actually have sitting in the stores. That being said, our e-commerce business, with all of our department store partners, is really quite extraordinary. And I think we're all just learning how we can turn these inventories faster and supply the customer with a very strong experience, both online and in store. Again, that being said, we find the environment to be a little more promotional than we would like. So that being said, we'd like to have less inventory in the stores and have less of our brand appearing on sale, in particular, in that channel distribution. So you'll see that pullback happen kind of between now, you'll start to see a little bit of it in Q3 or Q4, and it will more normalize itself by June or July, which we think is the right thing for us to do, given the climate and what we want to do in terms of keeping the health of the brand. Kimberly, I want to mention one last thing. I made a highlight of it in the call, and I think it's an important issue. We continue to outperform in our categories, whether that's accessories, footwear or women's ready-to-wear, we're outperforming our competitors in the department store channel by a fairly significant amount, and we're quite proud of that. That is under the whole cloud of the fact that we said that we grew the North American handbag business in the low single digits that retail, both in our stores and department stores, but high double digits in terms of units. So the idea that people are not buying handbags, I do not believe is a correct concept. They happen to be the fashion trend of smaller bags. So if we were selling x% of $350, $400 and $500 handbags at this time last year, we are selling less of those because we are selling a lot more, in particular, of crossbodies and large wallets. And that is what the consumer, in particular, the millennial, is viewing as a fashion trend. So that has an impact on AUR. And so therefore, we're selling a lot of Michael Kors product to people. Young people think they have bought a handbag. It's not that we're not selling handbags, in fact, we're selling a lot more handbags. So I think there is really a misnomer about what is happening in the marketplace. We believe that the handbag market in North America is, again, growing at the low single digit, but very, very high numbers in terms of units. So I think as you all are looking at the business, you should do some analysis on that, and we can share any insights that we have with you as well."

Omar, first of, we're kind of pleased with what's happening with the sequential performance of our comp store trend. In fact, our comp stores through October are getting better again, from what we just reported. So we're pleased with what's happening with the trend in the marketplace. It's two things in North America. It is, without question, smaller handbags. Again, I want to really hit home on this point, so you all understand. We're selling high double digits in terms of additional units, that means that people are buying a lot more Michael Kors product and the same thing may be happening to some of our other competitors. That's just trend. So we're losing actual performance in the stores just because a customer thinks that they bought a handbag. So that's the first thing. And the second thing is the moderation from our previous guidance also reflects the continuation of what we think is impacting us is the tourist traffic. Both in the department stores and in the retail channel, we have huge doors, whether it's in New York, whether it's in Southern Florida area, all of us are now being impacted in parts of Texas because of oil prices there, that's a little bit less tourist. But some of it is related to the Mexicans shopping cross-border with the peso to the dollar. So these are things that we just don't see going away so quickly, even though we'll be lapsing the change in currency, which will happen, probably to its largest effect, Q4, the tail end of that. That's just something we think we're going to be a little bit more prudent about. And again, both in retail or wholesale, we just like to have a lot less markdown inventory in the stores. We don't think that's good for the brand, long term. And we can still achieve our financial targets. As you can see, our new range annually still puts us kind of, if you take the middle of that range, at the low end of our previous guidance. So we're still going to achieve our financial objectives, and we're going to do it in a prudent way that's going to protect the health of the brand and be respectful of what's happening in the environment."

As I said in the call, saddle bags are -- we're probably going to run out before even before the holiday season. Merlot, we're probably going to run out before the fashion season. We've got some great new handbag styles that have hit. They're really getting some excellent traction. And the whole crossbody piece of the business, I want to tell you, we're excited about. We're less excited about the lower transaction value, but we are on trend, and all the consumer research that we're doing, our customer says, ""We love Michael Kors"", ""We want to buy Michael Kors"", and they are actually buying more Michael Kors. They're just buying small units, a smaller average price point unit for us. So we're seeing that happen. The biggest piece of that is going to hit for the spring season, where we've got 22 new handbag groups that we're introducing. Obviously, all of those won't be at retail. But you're going to see a major change in the way that the product works in the stores. And that's not just because of comp store trend, I want to be clear. That's because that's what's happening in the handbag and the fashion business. Our luxury competitors around the world are doing a great job, a certain of them, in really updating product and making it exciting and compelling for the customer, and that's what the customer wants today. When we're delivering newness, they get excited. And I wanted to say, we're seeing that in the watch business, in a business that is clearly challenged and the customer has voted a little bit more for the iPhone and a little bit less for the watch, all of a sudden, when Michael was the one who really drove it and said, ""Let's go after the leather watchband business in a big way."" We're getting excellent sell-throughs on that. Our new platings, sable and navy, excellent sell-throughs on that. So just saying to us, she wants -- she's ready to shop, but we better be a fashion leader and on trend to inspire her. So we like what we see in the stores, and I want to leave you with this call that we're kind of excited about what we see what's happening out there right now. Thanks, Omar."

Thanks, Erinn. Erinn, I remember, about 3 or 4 years ago, when the conversation of sequential deceleration came up, this is going -- our business is going to sequentially decline, whether it's North America or Europe, in the quarter just because we're getting bigger. We're doing over $1 billion in Europe, which is incredibly impressive to have built that in, basically, 6 years. And we have high brand awareness, great customer loyalty. We're looking at our newest kind of developed market that we went after this year, Italy, business is literally on fire, running strong double-digit comp growth there. So I would tell you that our business in Europe is very, very strong. There are -- leave the FX headwinds out just a second. There are a couple of factors that are impacting the business in Europe. And that is, first and foremost, the Russian tourists who was a very large piece of our business, has not been traveling as you well know. The second piece is there's a Middle Eastern tourist issue that they are not traveling as much as they did, we had very nice business with them. So both of those individual markets, if I'm going to look at our Middle East market and our Russia market, are doing exceptional double-digit comp store growth in both of those markets because customers not coming into Europe, they're shopping it in those markets. So we picked some of that up through our wholesale channel. But they tend to spend a little bit more when they're traveling, and a little bit less fluidly when they're in their country. And then there is some challenge in the U.K., and that's more of a pound-to-the-euro situation, where, again, the tourists are traveling a little less into the U.K. because of the strength of the pound, i.e., the U.S. dollar. So we -- again, we really like what we see going on in Europe. And some of our department store businesses, in particular, Daimaru, Lafayette, I mean just fantastic, [indiscernible], fantastic. I can go through the areas. But we are going to, over the years, we're probably today the largest accessible luxury handbag company in Europe, and we told you we would get there about 3 years ago, and we're probably there today. So as we have either the #1 or #2 position in the marketplace, we will grow, but it just won't be at the same growth rates that we've seen before. But overall, we really like the response that we're still having with the brand in the markets, and especially as we enter some of these new markets, customers responding with great enthusiasm."

That will actually probably change just slightly because of -- North American women's, and the Americas will change slightly because you'll see the South American numbers reported in the Americas number",451,"Sure. North America, yes, we've said we'd be at 400. That will actually probably change just slightly because of -- North American women's, and the Americas will change slightly because you'll see the South American numbers reported in the Americas numbers, so just so you know. But no, we have no intent of kind of going beyond that, and we're close to it. We'll open a few more stores, and then that rollout will be complete. And again, as we've said to you many times, because you've all questioned us regularly, I might say, on why do you open more stores, well, we're profitable when we open more stores, and people, while online shopping is absolutely a trend that is going to move the needle for the company, people will still go out and shop in a store. That won't -- at least while I'm alive, won't have evaporated. So we'll be in the right cities, in the right locations and feel good about that. And then in terms of men's, I would say to you that we're going to open these 6 or 7 stores in North America. We've got about 3/4 on the docket in Europe, and then a handful in Asia. And then we've got about 75 shop-in-shops going into North America, and I don't remember the exact number in Europe. I would say we'll get these all in place, and then we'll kind of hold a little bit, just to make sure we understand what the performances are, productivities, how we're going to go about doing this. We're really excited, I can't wait to show you guys the new fall line that's coming, with Marcel Ostwald joining us. And as you know, he had a sportswear design for Hugo Boss. So we're really exited about what's coming product-wise. We've got a whole new marketing campaign that Michael has developed that will include some significant television advertising for men, because men, it's not a traditional magazine-driven communication market. So what we're going to do digitally and on TV with men's, I think you'll be quite impressed with. So we're deadly serious about the men's business. You've heard me say before it's a $1 billion opportunity. Of that $1 billion, we think $300 million of it is in leather goods, and if you go down to Macy's Herald Square, you can see our leather goods shop there, you're going to see quite a few more opening as we move forward. So this is an area of business, it's going to take us a couple of years to grow it, but once it gets going, this will be a very nice additional growth vehicle for the company. Thank you, Erinn."

So that is driven -- I would say about 60% of that is driven by smaller handbags. And I'd say the balance of that is driven by additional promotional activity inside the stores. We see that starting to stabilize, in particular, in the third and fourth quarter because, remember, we're lapping some of the stuff starting to happen. They all got a little more promotional less holiday season. Got really promotional into Q1 -- or our Q4, calendar Q1. And then the small handbags has been started around that time. So we see in our retail business in North America, in particular, we think margins are going to start to stabilize in Q3 and Q4. You've seen kind of a sequential 1% to 2% decline in gross margins in the retail business, and we think that's going to stabilize for us. We feel pretty good about that. And we think this AUR situation, we'll be lapping it as well. The other thing I might add that also impacted -- again, I don't want to sound defensive, but a lot of people are writing about our comp store decline, and it's all about the handbags. The watches are having an enormous impact on our comp store decline. So our handbag business is relatively healthy. And I think the industry is relatively healthy, it's not growing at the high single-digit rate it used to. But when you look at the amount of bags that are being purchased, the interest by the customer, we feel good about all that. We'll start to lapse the comp store decline in watches also coming soon. And remember, our average watch sale was between $200 and $225. So that actually impacts our average transaction inside of our stores. So that once we start to lapse some of that, again, we feel pretty good about that situation as well. And your second question was? Or was that it? That was it."

But I would tell you that the traffic in outlets has also seen a sequential decline, although modest. It's been very, very small. So the larger decline in traffic is in full price shopping malls, and the smaller piece of it is in outlets. And what's interesting now is the kind of the traffic decline and the comps are starting to marry up a little bit. At one point, the traffic decline was higher than the comp decline, and the comp decline got higher than the traffic decline, and that was driven by AUR. Now it's, as I said to you, that's why you're hearing me feel positive, it's kind of evening out. Our conversion rates are up, which is up significantly by the way, I have to take my hat off, I want to compliment our 7,000 employees out selling around the world, these people are doing a great job. And that's one of our, I think, incredible strengths. You may remember from the IPO, our jet-set training, the way that we really work with our teams and we've announced the Kors Concierge, which will be piloted starting really this week, it's going to be an incredible tool for these people to really act as not only a brand ambassador, but really to be a styling consultant. And again, we'll show this to you, guys, because I think you'll be quite impressed with what the technology gives our sales associates from not only a product point of view, but also information about who the customer is, what they bought previously, et cetera, all at their fingertips. And I think that is going to help us with comps because traffic is going to continue to decline. We know that, although I think moderated at certain point. And if we can continue to keep our transaction and conversion levels up, which we've been able to do -- or get our transaction level stabilized and get our conversion rates up, which we've been able to do that, I think, that's where you're going to see the comps turn for us. And so again, we feel pretty excited about that, along with the launching of new products. Asia, or let me start -- Asia, in general, is doing great for us. So I'll just make that as an overall statement. You saw the comps in Japan. We reported that we have strong double-digit comps in China. And then in Southeast Asia, pretty much similar strong double-digit comps, 1 or 2 markets are high single-digit comps. So the whole region for us is fantastic. And what's interesting is, in China, Hong Kong and Macau are not exactly flourishing, as we speak. But when we look at our China comps, we're running strong double-digit comp, even with Macau and Hong Kong suffering from lower tourist traffic. As it relates to the repurchase, we've always said we'll look at it when the business reaches scale and profitability level that will be accretive to the company. I will tell you that the business is obviously growing very rapidly. We report in the Q the size every quarter because we report the royalties earned and the wholesale that we ship. So you can see the growth of the business. We're going to be a significant player in China, and really excited about the new Huamao 9,000 square foot store that we're opening, and Michael will be there in November. And the events that we're putting on, the team that we have on the ground, it just further gives us great confidence that this region, potentially over the next few years, will probably be larger even in Europe for us."

I said that to you that we're feeling pretty good about that. We think we've got a pretty clear picture on that. We are going to take some price increases on some of our small leather goods because we've been actually slightly underpriced compared to some of our large luxury competitors, and also on some of our crossbodies. So we think that'll get us some margin improvement there. And as I said, we're kind of lapsing the promotional environment. So I'd say that, that's going to remain in a pretty good place. And we'll probably have a little sequential decline in wholesale gross margin, and as a result of higher allowances in department stores. But again, we think that will be not highly significant as we look out, and especially as we begin to pull back some of the inventories. And that's really more of a North American thing. We don't see that as a European or -- we have a very sizable business in Asia now growing through our license partners and through the Duty Free operating channels as well.
So I'd like to thank everyone for joining us on the call today. I think you can sense a lot of enthusiasm from us here at Michael Kors. And that's based around, I want to first start with the incredible product that Michael and the design teams have been putting forth. And what we're feeling good about is the fact that, that product is resonating. We're both delivering great new fashion innovation, and we're delivering trend. So those are 2 things that are important to being successful, and Michael and our design teams have done that. Secondly, we're really excited about our execution at what's happening in the digital world for us. And I also want to layer on to that what's going to come with Kors Concierge and give our already 7,000 amazing employees around the world who are selling every day of the week to our fashion customers an outstanding tool to help deliver a better jet-set experience. And third, I want to say that we believe that we'll be lapping some of the headwinds that we've seen over the past 12 months. And that, therefore, we will have slightly easier comparisons, and additionally, we think we'll have a little bit more of a platform to begin to launch off of.
So with those things resonating in front of us and the growth of our international business, Michael Kors is going to be an exciting company to watch, and we're looking forward to reporting to you on the next quarter and delivering another outstanding set of results. Thank you very much."

Good morning, and welcome to Michael Kors' second quarter fiscal 2016 earnings call. I'll begin with a review of the quarter and then provide an update on some of our growth initiatives.
I'm pleased to report that our financial results for the second quarter exceeded expectations as we continued to expand the Michael Kors luxury brand worldwide. Total revenue increased 7% on a reported basis, and on a constant-currency basis, total revenue increased 12%, driven by increases in both our retail and wholesale segments across geographies. We saw revenue growth of approximately 6% in the Americas, 21% in Europe and 61% in Japan on a constant-currency basis. Our EPS of $1.01, which included a $0.06 impact from foreign currency, was also better than anticipated for the quarter. Our retail sales grew 8%, and in constant currency, our retail business grew 15%, driven by new store openings, strength in our North American digital flagships and continued momentum in Europe and Japan.
Global comparable store sales decreased 8.5% or 3.4% on a constant-currency basis, in line with expectations and reflecting sequential improvement as compared to the first quarter. North American digital sales more than doubled compared to last year as consumers continued to shift purchases to online and mobile channels. On a constant-currency basis, we delivered a high single-digit comp increase in Europe and strong double-digit growth in Japan.
In our North American retail stores, comps declined in high single digits as we continued to see the impact from lower mall traffic and a shift to the online channel. If we included our U.S. digital flagship sales in our comp base, our North American comparable store sales would have declined in the mid-single-digit range. Wholesale sales grew 8% in the second quarter, and in constant currency, wholesale sales increased 12%, led by continued strength in our accessories category. In addition, our wholesale business expanded across geographies with mid-single-digit growth in both the Americas and Europe in constant currency as well as further growth in the Asian market. Licensing revenue in the quarter declined due to lower sales of watches as we saw continued softness in this category. Revenue increased in a number of other areas of our licensing business in the second quarter, including fragrance, jewelry and eyewear categories.
Turning to our product categories. The accessories business in North America grew at a mid-single-digit rate with a double-digit increase in units sold, demonstrating continued growth of this category and the demand for the Michael Kors luxury brand. However, dollar growth was impacted by lower AUR due to increased demand for smaller-sized handbags, crossbodies and small leather goods, which carry lower price points. We saw accelerated growth in footwear, although the warm weather tempered boot sales in the quarter. The watch business continues to remain under pressure in retail and wholesale. But we are excited by the introduction of several new watch styles, including a broader assortment of watches with leather bands and watches with new platings in navy and sable, which we believe is creating renewed desire for the category.
Now turning to some highlights of our strategic initiatives. We remain focused on growing our business globally through both retail and wholesale expansion as well as our licensing partnerships.
On the retail side. We are driving growth through the continued development of our digital flagships worldwide as well as the expansion of our store footprint in the Americas, Europe and Asia. As I mentioned earlier, our North America digital business is growing rapidly. Desktop and mobile traffic has increased at a double-digit rate and conversion rates are strong, proving that our customers love the convenience of shopping and connecting with Michael Kors online and on-the-go.
We are seeing accessories and footwear emerge as dominant e-commerce categories, demonstrating the brand strength of these core luxury product lines. We believe the transition to online and mobile purchasing will continue worldwide, and we are poised to capitalize on this shift with the development of our digital platform to provide a global, multi-language, multicurrency e-commerce experience for our customers. The rollout of our digital flagships across Europe is expected to begin in fall of 2016, followed by Asia thereafter.
In men's, we are encouraged by the early growth rates and acceptance of our products as we begin to build a world-class men's brand. Our men's collection was initially introduced into the retail channel with the opening of our SoHo flagship store nearly a year ago, providing the first dedicated jet-set luxury experience for the Michael Kors man. We are pleased to announce the upcoming opening of 3 additional men's locations in Scottsdale Fashion Square in Arizona, Garden State Plaza in Paramus, New Jersey and San Francisco Centre in California.
In Europe, we've begun to sell our men's product in our recently opened Stockholm flagship and Amsterdam flagship locations, and we're pleased with the favorable response. And looking forward, we have already identified several additional prime locations in Roosevelt Field, New York, Memorial City in Houston Texas, World Trade Center in New York City as well as London, Tokyo, Singapore and Taiwan. We remain excited about the long-term opportunity for this business with the potential for up to 500 freestanding stores or combined format locations worldwide.
Lastly, we are set to unlock the opportunity for Michael Kors in Korea as we transition this business in-house by the end of the year. We are well on our way to building the right infrastructure and developing an expansion strategy to position this business for long-term growth.
In wholesale, we, like many others, have seen the department store channel slowing, and we will be monitoring this business carefully and managing our inventory to protect our brand and margins. However, our brand strength and compelling luxury product offerings have enabled us to maintain our leadership position in this space. We expect continued growth in accessories business globally as well as in our womenswear, footwear and men's categories as we further develop these businesses and extend our lifestyle presence.
We also continue to benefit from the conversion of existing department store doors into shop-in-shop locations across product categories, capturing incremental sales as customers respond favorably to Michael Kors' branded environments.
We are on track to convert 600 shop-in-shops this year across all categories and are particularly excited to have opened a new flagship men's shop within Macy's Herald Square, presenting our broadest product assortment in one of the most historic, well-recognized department store locations in the world.
In our licensing business, we're excited about the recent launch of our new Gold Fragrance Collection, featuring a scent for every women ranging from feminine and seductive to sparkling and sensuous. Our men's fragrance offering as well as the expansion of key EMEA markets are contributing to the growth we've seen this year in this category.
In eyewear, we are pleased with our partnership with Luxottica, and the customers' response we're seeing to our new eyewear collection, particularly with our iconic aviator styles. Both of these categories offer consumers a number of great gifting items for this holiday season. We also see opportunity for long-term growth in fragrance and eyewear through both expanded distribution and increased penetration.
Another category that we are excited about is our new connected fashion accessories line, which will launch in fall 2016. There's a great opportunity to build a significant position in this growing category and become a fashion leader in the emerging tech space. In addition, given the strong acceptance we have seen across international markets, we remain focused on expanding the Michael Kors luxury brand through our licensing partners. The Asia region continues to represent a significant growth opportunity for our company. We continue to see strong results in the Greater China business with double-digit comp store growth in the second quarter. Consumer response to our luxury products offering has been favorable, and we are excited to see our footwear business start to gain traction in this marketplace.
We attribute the growth in part to our increasing brand awareness in the region, which we now believe is at approximately 50% in large cities. Our strategic marketing effort in the region are one of the key drivers of brand awareness. We're excited to be hosting a star-studded event in November with Vogue, called Young China, to celebrate the opening of our largest flagship location in Huamao, Beijing, totaling 9,000 square feet. This media event will be attended by Michael himself as well as key influencers from China's movie industry, and will spotlight our luxury fashion and amplify the glamour of Michael Kors' jet-set luxury lifestyle. The development and success of our China business is increasing demand for the Michael Kors brand throughout Asia and Europe as Chinese consumers travel the globe, and 50% to 60% of their purchases are outside of Mainland China.
As we look to the second half of the year, we believe we are well-positioned for the upcoming holiday season. Michael and our design teams continue to create on-trend fashion products that embody the Michael Kors luxury brand. Our recent merchandise assortment truly reflects Michael's leadership in driving the latest fashion trends. Our rich suede saddle bags, mini bucket bags and quilted bags emerged as top-selling items this past quarter. 
Merlot was a hit in all departments. Watches with leather bands and new metal platings in navy and sable were met with great response, and our active footwear and backpacks capitalized on the sports lux trend. The positive response we are seeing from our customers gives us confidence that our new product introductions are taking hold. To celebrate this season with effortless glamor and style, our holiday gifting collections will continue to emphasize our on-trend fashion products.
To highlight our new holiday merchandise, we are excited to be launching the Michael Kors ""Just Because"" marketing campaign to connect our customers with that special gift that's just right. As we look ahead to spring 2016, we will continue to offer compelling on-trend fashion with the introduction of our largest assortment of new handbag groups as well as new watch offerings, reflecting the most expansive presentation of innovative materials we've used to date. In addition, our strong marketing program enables us to further engage customers with the brand, immerse them in the luxury lifestyle and encourage them to shop our sites and stores.
As we mentioned last quarter, we are excited about our new national advertising campaign that transport our customers to global cities, which represent the jet-set world of Michael Kors. Our integrated positioning through our content-rich website, compelling social media, global advertising, brand marketing and media events and traditional print and outdoor advertising are designed to speak to our customers globally in an authentic voice, always emphasizing our luxury DNA, ultimately marrying brand equity and awareness and translating that into conversion.
In summary, we are pleased with the success we achieved in the second quarter, with revenue growth of 7% on a reported basis and 12% on a constant-currency basis.
Our digital flagship business in North America more than doubled. We drove sequential improvement in comp store sales. We continued to increase brand awareness in international markets and we are seeing the acceptance of our newest handbag groups and watch styles and we are capitalizing on our leadership position in the luxury market. While we expect the macro headwinds to continue in the near term, the Michael Kors brand remains incredibly strong and we are focused on continuing to execute our strategic initiatives to drive long-term growth.
Now let me turn it over to Joe for a detailed review of our second quarter financial results and an update on our outlook."
143971118,314056254,892074,"Michael Kors Holdings Limited, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2015",2015-11-04,"Earnings Calls","Capri Holdings Limited","Executives","Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Our financial results exceeded our guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2016. Total revenue grew 6.9% to $1.1 billion. As expected, foreign currency headwinds continued to impact our results this quarter.",1894,"Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Our financial results exceeded our guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2016. Total revenue grew 6.9% to $1.1 billion. As expected, foreign currency headwinds continued to impact our results this quarter. On a constant-currency basis, total revenue grew 12.3%. By region, in constant currency, revenue in the Americas increased 5.6%, Europe revenue increased 20.6% and Japan revenue increased 60.7%. In our retail segment, net sales increased 7.5% to $532.8 million. In constant currencies, net sales increased 14.7%, driven by the opening of 116 net new stores since the second quarter of last year and an increase in our North American digital flagship sales.
Notably, we saw exceptional performance from our digital flagships, which generated a sales increase of 136% as compared to the sales of our previous outsourced site. Comp store sales declined 8.5% on a reported basis. On a constant-currency basis, comp store sales declined 3.4%, reflecting a sequential improvement from the first quarter. The decline is attributable to lower comp store sales in North America, partially offset by an increase in comp sales in both Europe and Japan. If we included our U.S. digital flagship sales in our comp base, our global comp store sales would have decreased in the low single-digit range on a constant-currency basis. We added 39 new stores in the second quarter: 23 in Americas, which included 18 previously opened stores from our Panama joint venture, which was consolidated for the first time this quarter; 12 in Europe; and 4 in Japan. In addition, we expanded or relocated 13 stores. We ended the quarter with 589 company-owned stores, including concessions, and 804 stores overall, including our licensed locations.
Wholesale net sales grew 7.8% to $554.0 million for the second quarter. On a constant-currency basis, wholesale sales increased 11.8%, driven by our accessories category and growth across our regions. During the second quarter, we converted 223 wholesale doors into shop-in-shops globally.
In our licensing segment, revenue decreased 8.1% to $43.2 million for the quarter due to lower licensing revenue related to sales of watches, somewhat offset by a revenue increase related to sales of outerwear, jewelry and eyewear. We continue to open new watch and jewelry shop-in-shops during the quarter and ended the quarter with 310 shop-in-shops globally.
Gross profit grew 3.0% to $664.4 million. Gross margin declined 220 basis points to 58.8%, which includes an 89 basis point foreign currency impact. The decline in gross margin reflects a 280 basis point decline in retail gross margins due to additional promotional activity in our North American retail business, a 130 basis point decline in wholesale gross margin due to additional wholesale allowances, partially offset by geographic mix and lower licensing gross margin dollars.
Total operating expenses grew 15.3% to $391.3 million. This increase was attributable to our global investments, including our retail expansion, our digital flagship initiatives, infrastructure investment in Korea in the men's business, the build-out of our European distribution center and the continued investment in corporate systems and infrastructure. As a percent of total revenue, total operating expenses increased 250 basis points to 34.6%. This was below the 440 to 490 basis points of deleverage in our guidance as sales exceeded our expectation and depreciation expense and SG&A were somewhat lower than anticipated.
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 13.0% to $345.2 million. The increase in SG&A expenses was largely due to the higher retail occupancy and salary costs related to new store openings, an increase in corporate employee-related expenses primarily due to an increase in our corporate staff to support our global growth as well as other corporate occupancy and operations-related costs. As a percent of total revenue, SG&A expenses were 30.5%, compared to 28.9% for the second quarter last year.
Depreciation and amortization expense increased 35.5% to $46.2 million for the second quarter, primarily due to new retail stores, new shop-in-shops, an increase in lease rights related to our new European stores and investments in our corporate facilities and IT infrastructure. As a result of these factors, income from operations were $273.1 million or 24.2% of total revenue, as compared to 28.9% of total revenue in the same period last year.
Retail operating margin declined 690 basis points due to a 410 basis point increase in operating expenses attributable to higher store-related costs, corporate-allocated expense as well as higher depreciation and amortization expense primarily attributable to new store openings as well as a decline in retail gross margin, as discussed earlier. Retail operating margin was also impacted by the growth of digital sales as the e-commerce business carries a lower operating margin rate than retail stores. As the e-commerce business reaches scale, we do expect e-commerce margins to be more in line with that of a brick-and-mortar business.
Wholesale operating margin declined 220 basis points due to the decline in the wholesale gross margin, as discussed earlier, and an 80 basis point increase in operating expense attributable to higher depreciation expense. Licensing operating margin decreased 820 basis points, primarily due to higher advertising costs, corporate-allocated expenses and selling expenses relative to lower revenues. Income taxes were $78.4 million in the quarter, and our effective tax rate was 28.9% as compared to 31.9% in the same period last year. The decrease in our effective tax rate was primarily due to the increase of taxable income in certain non-U.S. subsidiaries, which are subject to lower statutory tax rates as well as state tax benefits.
Net income was $193.1 million for the second quarter, and diluted earnings per share were $1.01 based upon 191.5 million weighted-average diluted shares outstanding. The unfavorable currency impact to EPS was $0.06 per share.
As we noted last quarter, we obtained a 75% controlling interest in our Latin American joint venture and are now consolidating MK Panama into our operations beginning this quarter. You can find the details of the acquisition described in Note 3 of our 10-Q, which is scheduled to be filed tomorrow.
For the second quarter, the impact of the consolidation to our sales and earnings results was not material. Going forward, we do not expect MK Panama's operating results to have a meaningful impact on our consolidated financials. We are continuing to evaluate the required assets, and there may be future adjustments taken against this business which have not been included in our guidance.
Turning to the balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, cash and cash equivalents were $431.5 million as compared to $1.0 billion last year. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 9.4 million shares, totaling $400 million under our share repurchase authorization. To date, our buybacks totaled approximately 23.2 million shares and $1.2 billion. We remain confident in our long-term growth outlook and free cash flow generation, and are pleased to announce that the Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of an additional $500 million of the company's ordinary shares. This increases our initial repurchase authorization to $2 billion, of which $758 million is available to us for future repurchases through March 2018.
Ex MK Panama, there were no outstanding borrowings under our credit facility in either year. I am pleased to report that we have entered into an amended and restated credit facility on October 29, 2015, increasing the size to $1 billion and extending the maturity to October 2020. We believe this facility provides us with more flexibility to pursue our long-term operational and financial growth objectives, and may be used for general corporate purposes, share repurchases and acquisition of licenses or fashion brands.
Inventory increased 15.2% compared to last year. Approximately $14 million of the increase related to our European inventory, which was valued 19% higher than the prior year due to the year-over-year currency exchange rate differential. Approximately $10 million was due to acceleration of holiday merchandise resulting in higher in-transit inventory, and approximately $14 million was related to the consolidation of MK Panama. The remainder is attributable to normal growth of our business as we continued to open stores, open shop-in-shops, expand e-commerce and our omnichannel capabilities and an increased replenishment program.
As we look forward, we anticipate that the exchange rate differential in the MK Panama consolidation will continue into the third quarter, and that our inventory will increase at a rate higher than sales increase.
Capital expenditures for the quarter were $87.5 million, and were related to the build-out of our new retail stores and shop-in-shops as well as investments in our information technology, distribution system enhancements, our corporate offices and other infrastructure improvements.
Turning to our outlook. For the third quarter, we expect total revenues to be between $1.33 billion and $1.35 billion. On a constant-currency basis, total revenue is expected to increase in the mid-single-digit range, assuming a $42 million impact from a change in foreign currency rates. We expect a mid-single-digit comp store decrease on a reported basis and a low single-digit decrease in constant currency.
Operating expense as a percentage of total revenue is expected to increase 200 to 240 basis points in the third quarter due to our global investments. We expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.44 to $1.48, assuming a tax rate of approximately 28.5% and 187.0 million shares outstanding. We expect foreign currency to impact net income by approximately $11 million and EPS by approximately $0.06 for the third quarter. For the full fiscal year, we now expect revenue of $4.6 billion to $4.65 billion. On a constant-currency basis, total revenue is expected to increase in the low double-digit range, assuming a $164 million impact from the change in foreign currency rates. We expect a mid-single-digit comp store decrease on a reported basis and a low single-digit decrease in constant currency.
Our revised revenue expectation reflects our tempered outlook for the second half of the year. While we believe our product and marketing efforts will benefit our business longer term, we are taking a more prudent stance in the second half. We expect the sequential improvement in comp store sales in the third or fourth quarter to be driven by the inclusion of U.S. digital sales in the comp base, the rollout of Kors Concierge in our stores, the launch of our new national advertising campaign, the introduction of new innovative product offerings for holiday and spring 2016, diminished FX headwinds and easier year-over-year comparisons.
As we stated previously, we anticipate the 53rd week to add approximately $40 million of additional sales this fiscal year. We expect international gross margin to remain under pressure in the third and fourth quarters as favorable hedging contracts we entered into last year expire. Operating expense as a percent of total revenue is expected to increase 200 to 220 basis points for the year. We expect the increase in operating expense as a percent of total revenue to continue to moderate as compared to the first half of the year as the rate of spend slows and we begin to anniversary the investments we made in 2015. We now expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $4.38 to $4.42 for the year, assuming a tax rate of approximately 29% and 191.5 million shares outstanding. We expect foreign currency to impact net income by approximately $36 million and EPS by approximately $0.19 for the year.
I will now turn the call back to John for closing remarks."

I mean, obviously, the numbers are very strong in terms of the growth rates and the conversion rates as well. And what we're re",812,"Great. Thank you, Kimberly. We're very pleased with what's happening with our e-commerce business since we brought it in-house. I mean, obviously, the numbers are very strong in terms of the growth rates and the conversion rates as well. And what we're really seeing is the engagement of the customer. And I have to be frank with you, we're I think at the very early stages of what we're going to be able to achieve with this platform. We're operationally, I think, in great shape, I think the site itself is quite exciting. We're going to do a lot of things over the next 6 months or so to improve our mobile experience. We don't think that's where it really needs to be. And secondly, what we're going to be able to do through our analytics and CRM with truly presenting our styling capabilities and Michael's messaging with the various communication vehicles that we're developing to tailor the experience for our customer. We think the opportunity is, quite frankly, very, very large for us. So I think that, basically, it's all systems go in terms of what we're seeing both in North America -- and I'll say America and Canada, both platforms are operating at a very, very high productivity rate. And as we said in the call, we're bringing on Europe in the fall, and we will actually bring up Korea and Japan not too far after that. So we will be, I think, in a very, very strong position. We told you 2 years ago that we were going to make a very big investment in systems, people and in the distribution facilities to be able to handle all this, and we're there, and we consider ourselves to be a company who will ultimately be best-in-class in this category. Secondly, on the inventory side. The pullback on inventory is predominantly in North America. The department store business in North America is suffering some of the same channels -- challenges that we've seen in terms of the traffic in shopping malls. So that's got us taking a more prudent approach to how much inventory we actually have sitting in the stores. That being said, our e-commerce business, with all of our department store partners, is really quite extraordinary. And I think we're all just learning how we can turn these inventories faster and supply the customer with a very strong experience, both online and in store. Again, that being said, we find the environment to be a little more promotional than we would like. So that being said, we'd like to have less inventory in the stores and have less of our brand appearing on sale, in particular, in that channel distribution. So you'll see that pullback happen kind of between now, you'll start to see a little bit of it in Q3, a little in Q4, and it will more normalize itself by June or July, which we think is the right thing for us to do, given the climate and what we want to do in terms of keeping the health of the brand. Kimberly, I want to mention one last thing. I made a highlight of it in the call, and I think it's an important issue. We continue to outperform in our categories, whether that's accessories, footwear or women's ready-to-wear, we're outperforming our competitors in the department store channel by a fairly significant amount, and we're quite proud of that. That is under the whole cloud of the fact that we said that we grew the North American handbag business in the low single digits at retail, both in our stores and department stores, but high double digits in terms of units. So the idea that people are not buying handbags, I do not believe is a correct concept. They happen to be, the fashion trend is smaller bags. So if we were selling x% of $350, $400 and $500 handbags at this time last year, we are selling less of those because we are selling a lot more, in particular, of crossbodies and large wallets. And that is what the consumer, in particular, the millennial, is viewing as a fashion trend. So that has an impact on AUR. And so therefore, we're selling a lot of Michael Kors product to people. Young people think they have bought a handbag. It's not that we're not selling handbags, in fact, we're selling a lot more handbags. So I think there is really a misnomer about what is happening in the marketplace. We believe that the handbag market in North America is, again, growing at the low single digits, but very, very high numbers in terms of units. So I think as you all are looking at the business, you should do some analysis on that, and we can share any insights that we have with you as well."

In fact, our comp stores through October are getting better, again, from what we just reported. So we're pleased with what's",383,"Okay, sure. Omar, first off, we're kind of pleased with what's happening with the sequential performance of our comp store trend. In fact, our comp stores through October are getting better, again, from what we just reported. So we're pleased with what's happening with the trend in the marketplace. It's 2 things in North America. It is, without question, smaller handbags. Again, I want to really hit home on this point, so you all understand. When we're selling high double digits in terms of additional units, that means that people are buying a lot more Michael Kors product and the same thing may be happening to some of our other competitors. That's just trend. So we're losing actual performance in the stores just because a customer thinks that they bought a handbag. So that's the first thing. And the second thing is the moderation from our previous guidance also reflects the continuation of what we think is impacting us, is the tourist traffic. Both in the department stores and in the retail channel, we have huge doors, whether it's in New York, whether it's in the Southern Florida area, all of us are now being impacted in parts of Texas because of oil prices there, that's a little bit less tourist, but some of it is related to the Mexicans shopping cross-border with the peso to the dollar. So these are things that we just don't see going away so quickly, even though we'll be lapsing the change in currency, which will happen, probably to its largest effect, Q4, the tail end of that. That's just something we think we're going to be a little bit more prudent about. And again, both in retail and wholesale, we just like to have a lot less markdown inventory in the stores. We don't think that's good for the brand long term. And we can still achieve our financial targets. As you can see, our new range annually still puts us kind of, if you take the middle of that range, at the low end of our previous guidance, so we're still going to achieve our financial objectives, and we're going to do it in a prudent way that's going to protect the health of the brand and be respectful of what's happening in the environment."

As I said in the call, saddle bags are -- we're probably going to run out before even before the holiday season. Merlot, we're probably going to run out before the fashion season. We've got some great new handbag styles that have hit. They're really getting some excellent traction. And the whole crossbody piece of the business, I want to tell you, we're excited about. We're less excited about the lower transaction value, but we are on trend, and all the consumer research that we're doing, our customer says, ""We love Michael Kors"", ""We want to buy Michael Kors"", and they are actually buying more Michael Kors. They're just buying small units, a smaller average price point unit for us. So we're seeing that happen. The biggest piece of that is going to hit for the spring season, where we've got 22 new handbag groups that we're introducing. Obviously, all of those won't be at retail. But you're going to see a major change in the way that the product looks in the stores. And that's not just because of comp store trend, I want to be clear. That's because that's what's happening in the handbag and the fashion business. Our luxury competitors around the world are doing a great job, certain of them, in really updating product and making it exciting and compelling for the customer, and that's what the customer wants today. When we're delivering newness, they get excited. And I want to say, we're seeing that in the watch business, in a business that is clearly challenged and the customer has voted a little bit more for the iPhone and a little bit less for the watch, well, all of a sudden, when Michael was the one who really drove it and said, ""Let's go after the leather watchband business in a big way."" We're getting excellent sell-throughs on that. Our new platings, sable and navy, excellent sell-throughs on that. So that's just saying to us, she wants -- she's ready to shop, but we better be a fashion leader and on trend to inspire her. So we like what we see in the stores, and I want to leave you with this call that we're kind of excited about what we see what's happening out there right now."

Erinn, I remember, about 3 or 4 years ago, when the conversation of sequential deceleration came up, this is going -- our business is going to sequentially decline, whether it's North America or Europe, in the quarter, just because we're getting bigger. We're doing over $1 billion in Europe, which is incredibly impressive, to have built that in basically 6 years. And we have high brand awareness, great customer loyalty. We're looking at our newest kind of developed market that we went after this year, Italy, business is literally on fire, running strong double-digit comp growth there. So I would tell you that our business in Europe is very, very strong. There are -- leave the FX headwinds out of this a second. There are a couple of factors that are impacting the business in Europe. And that is, first and foremost, the Russian tourist who is a very large piece of our business, has not been traveling as you well know. The second piece is there's a Middle Eastern tourist issue, that they are not traveling as much as they did, and we had a very nice business with them. So both of those individual markets, if I go in to look at our Middle East market and our Russia market, are doing exceptional double-digit comp store growth in both of those markets because customers are not coming into Europe, they're shopping in those markets. So we picked some of that up through our wholesale channel. But they tend to spend a little bit more when they're traveling, and a little bit less fluidly when they're in their country. And then there is some challenge in the U.K., and that's more of a pound-to-the-euro situation, where, again, the tourists are traveling a little less into the U.K. because of the strength of the pound, i.e., the U.S. dollar. So we -- again, we really like what we see going on in Europe. And some of our department store businesses, in particular, Galeries Lafayette, I mean just fantastic; Rinascente, fantastic. I can go through the areas. But we are going to, over the years, we're probably today the largest accessible luxury handbag company in Europe, and we told you we would get there about 3 years ago, and we're probably there today. So as we have either the #1 or #2 position in the marketplace, we will grow, but it just won't be at the same growth rates that we've seen before. But overall, we really like the response that we're still having with the brand in the markets, and especially as we enter some of these new markets, customers responding with great enthusiasm."

North America, yes, we've said we'd be at 400. That will actually probably change just slightly because of -- I mean, North American women's, and the Americas will change slightly because you'll see the South American numbers reported in our Americas numbers, so just so you know. But no, we have no intent of kind of going beyond that, and we're close to it. We'll open a few more stores, and then that rollout will be complete. And again, as we've said to you many times, because you've all questioned us regularly, I might say, on why do you open more stores, well, we're profitable when we open more stores, and people, while online shopping is absolutely a trend and it's going to move the needle for the company, people will still go out and shop in a store. That won't -- at least while I'm alive, won't have evaporated. So we'll be in the right cities, in the right locations and feel good about that. And then in terms of men's, I would say to you that we're going to open these 6 or 7 stores in North America. We've got about 3/4 on the docket in Europe and then a handful in Asia. And then we've got about 75 shop-in-shops going into North America, and I don't remember the exact number in Europe. I would say we'll get these all in place, and then we'll kind of hold a little bit, just to make sure we understand what the performances are, productivities, how we're going to go about doing this. We're really excited, I can't wait to show you guys the new fall line that's coming, with Marcel Ostwald joining us. And as you know, he headed sportswear design for Hugo Boss. So we're really excited about what's coming product-wise. We've got a whole new marketing campaign that Michael has developed that will include some significant television advertising for men, because men, it's not a traditional magazine-driven communication market. So what we're going to do digitally and on TV with men's, I think you'll be quite impressed with. So we're deadly serious about the men's business. You've heard me say before it's a $1 billion opportunity. Of that $1 billion, we think $300 million of it is in leather goods, and if you go down to Macy's Herald Square, you can see our leather goods shop there, you're going to see quite a few more opening as we move forward. So this is an area of business, it's going to take us a couple of years to grow it, but once it gets going, this will be a very nice additional growth vehicle for the company."

So that is driven, I would say about 60% of that is driven by smaller handbags. And I'd say the balance of that is driven by additional promotional activity inside the stores. We see that starting to stabilize, in particular, in the third and fourth quarter because, remember, we're lapping some of the stuff starting to happen, that we all got a little more promotional last holiday season, got really promotional into Q1 -- or our Q4, calendar Q1. And then the small handbag thing started around that time. So we see in our retail business in North America in particular, we think margins are going to start to stabilize in Q3 and Q4. You've seen kind of a sequential 1% to 2% decline in gross margins in the retail business, and we think that's going to stabilize for us. We feel pretty good about that. And we think this AUR situation, we'll be lapping it as well. The other thing I might add that also impacted -- again, I don't want to sound defensive, but a lot of people are writing about our comp store decline, and it's all about the handbags. The watches are having an enormous impact on our comp store decline. So our handbag business is relatively healthy. And I think the industry is relatively healthy, it's not growing at the high single-digit rate it used to. But when you look at the amount of bags that are being purchased, the interest by the customer, we feel good about all that. We'll start to lapse the comp store decline in watches also coming soon. And remember, our average watch sale was between $200 and $225. So that actually impacts our average transaction inside of our stores. So that once we start to lapse some of that, again, we feel pretty good about that situation as well. And your second question was? Or was that it? That was it."

But I would tell you that the traffic in outlets has also seen a sequential decline, although modest. It's been very, very small. So the larger decline in traffic is in full price shopping malls, and the smaller piece of it is in outlets. And what's interesting now is the kind of the traffic decline and the comps are starting to marry up a little bit. At one point, the traffic decline was higher than the comp decline, and the comp decline got higher than the traffic decline, and that was driven by AUR. Now it's, as I said to you, that's why you're hearing me feel positive, it's kind of evening out. Our conversion rates are up, which, they're up significantly by the way, I have to take my hat off, I want to compliment our 7,000 employees out selling around the world, these people are doing a great job. And that's one of our, I think, incredible strengths. You may remember from the IPO, our jet-set training, the way that we really work with our teams and we've announced the Kors Concierge, which will be piloted starting really this week, it's going to be an incredible tool for these people to really act as not only a brand ambassador, but really to be a styling consultant. And again, we'll show this to you, guys, because I think you'll be quite impressed with what the technology gives our sales associates from not only a product point of view, but also information about who the customer is, what they bought previously, et cetera, all at their fingertips. And I think that is going to help us with comps because traffic is going to continue to decline. We know that, although I think moderate at a certain point. And if we can continue to keep our transaction and conversion levels up, which we've been able to do -- or get our transaction level stabilized and get our conversion rates up, which we've been able to do that, I think, that's where you're going to see the comps turn for us. And so again, we feel pretty excited about that, along with the launching of new products. Asia, or let me start -- Asia, in general, is doing great for us. So I'll just make that as an overall statement. You saw the comps in Japan. We reported that we have strong double-digit comps in China. And then in Southeast Asia, pretty much similar strong double-digit comps, 1 or 2 markets are high single-digit comps. So the whole region for us is fantastic. And what's interesting is in China, Hong Kong and Macau are not exactly flourishing, as we speak. But when we look at our China comps, we're running strong double-digit comps, even with Macau and Hong Kong suffering from lower tourist traffic. As it relates to the repurchase, we've always said we'll look at it when the business reaches scale and profitability level that will be accretive to the company. I will tell you that the business is obviously growing very rapidly. We report in the Q the size every quarter of this because we report the royalties earned and the wholesale that we ship. So you can see the growth of the business. We're going to be a significant player in China, and really excited about the new Huamao 9,000 square foot store that we're opening, and Michael will be there in November. And the events that we're putting on, the team that we have on the ground, it just further gives us great confidence that this region, potentially over the next few years, will probably be larger even than Europe for us."

I said that to you that we're feeling pretty good about that. We think we've got a pretty clear picture on that. We are going to take some price increases on some of our small leather goods because we've been actually slightly underpriced compared to some of our other luxury competitors, and also on some of our crossbodies. So we think that'll get us some margin improvement there. And as I said, we're kind of lapsing the promotional environment. So I'd say that, that's going to remain in a pretty good place. And we'll probably have a little sequential decline in wholesale gross margin, and that's a result of higher allowances to department stores. But again, we think that will be not highly significant as we look out, and especially as we begin to pull back some of the inventories. And that's really more of a North American thing. We don't see that as a European or -- we have a very sizable business in Asia now growing through our license partners and through the Duty Free operating channels as well.
So I'd like to thank everyone for joining us on the call today. I think you can sense a lot of enthusiasm from us here at Michael Kors. And that's based around, I want to first start with the incredible product that Michael and the design teams have been putting forth. And what we're feeling good about is the fact that, that product is resonating. We're both delivering great new fashion innovation, and we're delivering trend. So those are 2 things that are important to being successful, and Michael and our design teams have done that. Secondly, we're really excited about our execution of what's happening in the digital world for us. And I also want to layer onto that what's going to come with Kors Concierge and give our already 7,000 amazing employees around the world who are selling every day of the week to our fashion customers an outstanding tool to help deliver a better jet-set experience. And third, I want to say that we believe that we'll be lapping some of the headwinds that we've seen over the past 12 months. And that, therefore, we will have slightly easier comparisons, and additionally, we think we'll have a little bit more of a platform to begin to launch off of.
So with those things resonating in front of us and the growth of our international business, Michael Kors is going to be an exciting company to watch, and we're looking forward to reporting to you on the next quarter and delivering another outstanding set of results. Thank you very much."

Good morning, and welcome to Michael Kors' second quarter fiscal 2016 earnings call. I'll begin with a review of the quarter and then provide an update on some of our growth initiatives.
I'm pleased to report that our financial results for the second quarter exceeded expectations as we continued to expand the Michael Kors luxury brand worldwide. Total revenue increased 7% on a reported basis, and on a constant-currency basis, total revenue increased 12%, driven by increases in both our retail and wholesale segments across geographies. We saw revenue growth of approximately 6% in the Americas, 21% in Europe and 61% in Japan on a constant-currency basis. Our EPS of $1.01, which included a $0.06 impact from foreign currency, was also better than anticipated for the quarter. Our retail sales grew 8%, and in constant currency, our retail business grew 15%, driven by new store openings, strength in our North American digital flagships and continued momentum in Europe and Japan.
Global comparable store sales decreased 8.5% or 3.4% on a constant-currency basis, in line with expectations and reflecting sequential improvement as compared to the first quarter. North American digital sales more than doubled compared to last year as consumers continued to shift purchases to online and mobile channels. On a constant-currency basis, we delivered a high single-digit comp increase in Europe and strong double-digit growth in Japan.
In our North American retail stores, comps declined in high single digits as we continued to see the impact from lower mall traffic and a shift to the online channel. If we included our U.S. digital flagship sales in our comp base, our North American comparable store sales would have declined in the mid-single-digit range. Wholesale sales grew 8% in the second quarter, and in constant currency, wholesale sales increased 12%, led by continued strength in our accessories category. In addition, our wholesale business expanded across geographies with mid-single-digit growth in both the Americas and Europe in constant currency as well as further growth in the Asian market. Licensing revenue in the quarter declined due to lower sales of watches as we saw continued softness in this category. Revenue increased in a number of other areas of our licensing business in the second quarter, including fragrance, jewelry and eyewear categories.
Turning to our product categories. The accessories business in North America grew at a mid-single-digit rate with a double-digit increase in units sold, demonstrating continued growth of this category and the demand for the Michael Kors luxury brand. However, dollar growth was impacted by lower AUR due to increased demand for smaller-sized handbags, crossbodies and small leather goods, which carry lower price points. We saw accelerated growth in footwear, although the warm weather tempered boot sales in the quarter. The watch business continues to remain under pressure in retail and wholesale. But we are excited by the introduction of several new watch styles, including a broader assortment of watches with leather bands and watches with new platings in navy and sable, which we believe is creating renewed desire for the category.
Now turning to some highlights of our strategic initiatives. We remain focused on growing our business globally through both retail and wholesale expansion as well as our licensing partnerships.
On the retail side. We are driving growth through the continued development of our digital flagships worldwide as well as the expansion of our store footprint in the Americas, Europe and Asia. As I mentioned earlier, our North America digital business is growing rapidly. Desktop and mobile traffic has increased at a double-digit rate and conversion rates are strong, proving that our customers love the convenience of shopping and connecting with Michael Kors online and on-the-go.
We are seeing accessories and footwear emerge as dominant e-commerce categories, demonstrating the brand strength of these core luxury product lines. We believe the transition to online and mobile purchasing will continue worldwide, and we are poised to capitalize on this shift with the development of our digital platform to provide a global, multi-language, multicurrency e-commerce experience for our customers. The rollout of our digital flagships across Europe is expected to begin in fall of 2016, followed by Asia thereafter.
In men's, we are encouraged by the early growth rates and acceptance of our products as we begin to build a world-class men's brand. Our men's collection was initially introduced into the retail channel with the opening of our SoHo flagship store nearly a year ago, providing the first dedicated jet-set luxury experience for the Michael Kors man. We are pleased to announce the upcoming opening of 3 additional men's locations in Scottsdale Fashion Square in Arizona, Garden State Plaza in Paramus, New Jersey and San Francisco Centre in California.
In Europe, we've begun to sell our men's product in our recently opened Stockholm flagship and Amsterdam flagship locations, and we're pleased with the favorable response. And looking forward, we have already identified several additional prime locations in Roosevelt Field, New York, Memorial City in Houston Texas, World Trade Center in New York City as well as London, Tokyo, Singapore and Taiwan. We remain excited about the long-term opportunity for this business with the potential for up to 500 freestanding stores or combined format locations worldwide.
Lastly, we are set to unlock the opportunity for Michael Kors in Korea as we transition this business in-house by the end of the year. We are well on our way to building the right infrastructure and developing an expansion strategy to position this business for long-term growth.
In wholesale, we, like many others, have seen the department store channel slowing, and we will be monitoring this business carefully and managing our inventory to protect our brand and margins. However, our brand strength and compelling luxury product offerings have enabled us to maintain our leadership position in this space. We expect continued growth in accessories business globally as well as in our womenswear, footwear and men's categories as we further develop these businesses and extend our lifestyle presence.
We also continue to benefit from the conversion of existing department store doors into shop-in-shop locations across product categories, capturing incremental sales as customers respond favorably to Michael Kors' branded environments.
We are on track to convert 600 shop-in-shops this year across all categories and are particularly excited to have opened a new flagship men's shop within Macy's Herald Square, presenting our broadest product assortment in one of the most historic, well-recognized department store locations in the world.
In our licensing business, we're excited about the recent launch of our new Gold Fragrance Collection, featuring a scent for every women ranging from feminine and seductive to sparkling and sensuous. Our men's fragrance offering as well as the expansion of key EMEA markets are contributing to the growth we've seen this year in this category.
In eyewear, we are pleased with our partnership with Luxottica, and the customers' response we're seeing to our new eyewear collection, particularly with our iconic aviator styles. Both of these categories offer consumers a number of great gifting items for this holiday season. We also see opportunity for long-term growth in fragrance and eyewear through both expanded distribution and increased penetration.
Another category that we are excited about is our new connected fashion accessories line, which will launch in fall 2016. There's a great opportunity to build a significant position in this growing category and become a fashion leader in the emerging tech space. In addition, given the strong acceptance we have seen across international markets, we remain focused on expanding the Michael Kors luxury brand through our licensing partners. The Asia region continues to represent a significant growth opportunity for our company. We continue to see strong results in the Greater China business with double-digit comp store growth in the second quarter. Consumer response to our luxury products offering has been favorable, and we are excited to see our footwear business start to gain traction in this marketplace.
We attribute the growth in part to our increasing brand awareness in the region, which we now believe is at approximately 50% in large cities. Our strategic marketing effort in the region are one of the key drivers of brand awareness. We're excited to be hosting a star-studded event in November with Vogue, called Young China, to celebrate the opening of our largest flagship location in Huamao, Beijing, totaling 9,000 square feet. This media event will be attended by Michael himself as well as key influencers from China's movie industry, and will spotlight our luxury fashion and amplify the glamour of Michael Kors' jet-set luxury lifestyle. The development and success of our China business is increasing demand for the Michael Kors brand throughout Asia and Europe as Chinese consumers travel the globe, and 50% to 60% of their purchases are outside of Mainland China.
As we look to the second half of the year, we believe we are well-positioned for the upcoming holiday season. Michael and our design teams continue to create on-trend fashion products that embody the Michael Kors luxury brand. Our recent merchandise assortment truly reflects Michael's leadership in driving the latest fashion trends. Our rich suede saddle bags, mini bucket bags and quilted bags emerged as top-selling items this past quarter. 
Merlot was a hit in all departments. Watches with leather bands and new metal platings in navy and sable were met with great response, and our active footwear and backpacks capitalized on the sports lux trend. The positive response we are seeing from our customers gives us confidence that our new product introductions are taking hold. To celebrate this season with effortless glamor and style, our holiday gifting collections will continue to emphasize our on-trend fashion products.
To highlight our new holiday merchandise, we are excited to be launching the Michael Kors ""Just Because"" marketing campaign to connect our customers with that special gift that's just right. As we look ahead to spring 2016, we will continue to offer compelling on-trend fashion with the introduction of our largest assortment of new handbag groups as well as new watch offerings, reflecting the most expansive presentation of innovative materials we've used to date. In addition, our strong marketing program enables us to further engage customers with the brand, immerse them in the luxury lifestyle and encourage them to shop our sites and stores.
As we mentioned last quarter, we are excited about our new national advertising campaign that transport our customers to global cities, which represent the jet-set world of Michael Kors. Our integrated positioning through our content-rich website, compelling social media, global advertising, brand marketing and media events and traditional print and outdoor advertising are designed to speak to our customers globally in an authentic voice, always emphasizing our luxury DNA, ultimately marrying brand equity and awareness and translating that into conversion.
In summary, we are pleased with the success we achieved in the second quarter, with revenue growth of 7% on a reported basis and 12% on a constant-currency basis.
Our digital flagship business in North America more than doubled. We drove sequential improvement in comp store sales. We continued to increase brand awareness in international markets and we are seeing the acceptance of our newest handbag groups and watch styles and we are capitalizing on our leadership position in the luxury market. While we expect the macro headwinds to continue in the near term, the Michael Kors brand remains incredibly strong and we are focused on continuing to execute our strategic initiatives to drive long-term growth.
Now let me turn it over to Joe for a detailed review of our second quarter financial results and an update on our outlook."
143971118,314056254,892738,"Michael Kors Holdings Limited, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2015",2015-11-04,"Earnings Calls","Capri Holdings Limited","Executives","Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Our financial results exceeded our guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2016. Total revenue grew 6.9% to $1.1 billion. As expected, foreign currency headwinds continued to impact our results this quarter.",1894,"Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Our financial results exceeded our guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2016. Total revenue grew 6.9% to $1.1 billion. As expected, foreign currency headwinds continued to impact our results this quarter. On a constant-currency basis, total revenue grew 12.3%. By region, in constant currency, revenue in the Americas increased 5.6%, Europe revenue increased 20.6% and Japan revenue increased 60.7%. In our retail segment, net sales increased 7.5% to $532.8 million. In constant currencies, net sales increased 14.7%, driven by the opening of 116 net new stores since the second quarter of last year and an increase in our North American digital flagship sales.
Notably, we saw exceptional performance from our digital flagships, which generated a sales increase of 136% as compared to the sales of our previous outsourced site. Comp store sales declined 8.5% on a reported basis. On a constant-currency basis, comp store sales declined 3.4%, reflecting a sequential improvement from the first quarter. The decline is attributable to lower comp store sales in North America, partially offset by an increase in comp sales in both Europe and Japan. If we included our U.S. digital flagship sales in our comp base, our global comp store sales would have decreased in the low single-digit range on a constant-currency basis. We added 39 new stores in the second quarter: 23 in Americas, which included 18 previously opened stores from our Panama joint venture, which was consolidated for the first time this quarter; 12 in Europe; and 4 in Japan. In addition, we expanded or relocated 13 stores. We ended the quarter with 589 company-owned stores, including concessions, and 804 stores overall, including our licensed locations.
Wholesale net sales grew 7.8% to $554.0 million for the second quarter. On a constant-currency basis, wholesale sales increased 11.8%, driven by our accessories category and growth across our regions. During the second quarter, we converted 223 wholesale doors into shop-in-shops globally.
In our licensing segment, revenue decreased 8.1% to $43.2 million for the quarter due to lower licensing revenue related to sales of watches, somewhat offset by a revenue increase related to sales of outerwear, jewelry and eyewear. We continue to open new watch and jewelry shop-in-shops during the quarter and ended the quarter with 310 shop-in-shops globally.
Gross profit grew 3.0% to $664.4 million. Gross margin declined 220 basis points to 58.8%, which includes an 89 basis point foreign currency impact. The decline in gross margin reflects a 280 basis point decline in retail gross margins due to additional promotional activity in our North American retail business, a 130 basis point decline in wholesale gross margin due to additional wholesale allowances, partially offset by geographic mix and lower licensing gross margin dollars.
Total operating expenses grew 15.3% to $391.3 million. This increase was attributable to our global investments, including our retail expansion, our digital flagship initiatives, infrastructure investment in Korea in the men's business, the build-out of our European distribution center and the continued investment in corporate systems and infrastructure. As a percent of total revenue, total operating expenses increased 250 basis points to 34.6%. This was below the 440 to 490 basis points of deleverage in our guidance as sales exceeded our expectation and depreciation expense and SG&A were somewhat lower than anticipated.
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 13.0% to $345.2 million. The increase in SG&A expenses was largely due to the higher retail occupancy and salary costs related to new store openings, an increase in corporate employee-related expenses primarily due to an increase in our corporate staff to support our global growth as well as other corporate occupancy and operations-related costs. As a percent of total revenue, SG&A expenses were 30.5%, compared to 28.9% for the second quarter last year.
Depreciation and amortization expense increased 35.5% to $46.2 million for the second quarter, primarily due to new retail stores, new shop-in-shops, an increase in lease rights related to our new European stores and investments in our corporate facilities and IT infrastructure. As a result of these factors, income from operations were $273.1 million or 24.2% of total revenue, as compared to 28.9% of total revenue in the same period last year.
Retail operating margin declined 690 basis points due to a 410 basis point increase in operating expenses attributable to higher store-related costs, corporate-allocated expense as well as higher depreciation and amortization expense primarily attributable to new store openings as well as a decline in retail gross margin, as discussed earlier. Retail operating margin was also impacted by the growth of digital sales as the e-commerce business carries a lower operating margin rate than retail stores. As the e-commerce business reaches scale, we do expect e-commerce margins to be more in line with that of a brick-and-mortar business.
Wholesale operating margin declined 220 basis points due to the decline in the wholesale gross margin, as discussed earlier, and an 80 basis point increase in operating expense attributable to higher depreciation expense. Licensing operating margin decreased 820 basis points, primarily due to higher advertising costs, corporate-allocated expenses and selling expenses relative to lower revenues. Income taxes were $78.4 million in the quarter, and our effective tax rate was 28.9% as compared to 31.9% in the same period last year. The decrease in our effective tax rate was primarily due to the increase of taxable income in certain non-U.S. subsidiaries, which are subject to lower statutory tax rates as well as state tax benefits.
Net income was $193.1 million for the second quarter, and diluted earnings per share were $1.01 based upon 191.5 million weighted-average diluted shares outstanding. The unfavorable currency impact to EPS was $0.06 per share.
As we noted last quarter, we obtained a 75% controlling interest in our Latin American joint venture and are now consolidating MK Panama into our operations beginning this quarter. You can find the details of the acquisition described in Note 3 of our 10-Q, which is scheduled to be filed tomorrow.
For the second quarter, the impact of the consolidation to our sales and earnings results was not material. Going forward, we do not expect MK Panama's operating results to have a meaningful impact on our consolidated financials. We are continuing to evaluate the required assets, and there may be future adjustments taken against this business which have not been included in our guidance.
Turning to the balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, cash and cash equivalents were $431.5 million as compared to $1.0 billion last year. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 9.4 million shares, totaling $400 million under our share repurchase authorization. To date, our buybacks totaled approximately 23.2 million shares and $1.2 billion. We remain confident in our long-term growth outlook and free cash flow generation, and are pleased to announce that the Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of an additional $500 million of the company's ordinary shares. This increases our initial repurchase authorization to $2 billion, of which $758 million is available to us for future repurchases through March 2018.
Ex MK Panama, there were no outstanding borrowings under our credit facility in either year. I am pleased to report that we have entered into an amended and restated credit facility on October 29, 2015, increasing the size to $1 billion and extending the maturity to October 2020. We believe this facility provides us with more flexibility to pursue our long-term operational and financial growth objectives, and may be used for general corporate purposes, share repurchases and acquisition of licenses or fashion brands.
Inventory increased 15.2% compared to last year. Approximately $14 million of the increase related to our European inventory, which was valued 19% higher than the prior year due to the year-over-year currency exchange rate differential. Approximately $10 million was due to acceleration of holiday merchandise resulting in higher in-transit inventory, and approximately $14 million was related to the consolidation of MK Panama. The remainder is attributable to normal growth of our business as we continued to open stores, open shop-in-shops, expand e-commerce and our omnichannel capabilities and an increased replenishment program.
As we look forward, we anticipate that the exchange rate differential in the MK Panama consolidation will continue into the third quarter, and that our inventory will increase at a rate higher than sales increase.
Capital expenditures for the quarter were $87.5 million, and were related to the build-out of our new retail stores and shop-in-shops as well as investments in our information technology, distribution system enhancements, our corporate offices and other infrastructure improvements.
Turning to our outlook. For the third quarter, we expect total revenues to be between $1.33 billion and $1.35 billion. On a constant-currency basis, total revenue is expected to increase in the mid-single-digit range, assuming a $42 million impact from a change in foreign currency rates. We expect a mid-single-digit comp store decrease on a reported basis and a low single-digit decrease in constant currency.
Operating expense as a percentage of total revenue is expected to increase 200 to 240 basis points in the third quarter due to our global investments. We expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.44 to $1.48, assuming a tax rate of approximately 28.5% and 187.0 million shares outstanding. We expect foreign currency to impact net income by approximately $11 million and EPS by approximately $0.06 for the third quarter. For the full fiscal year, we now expect revenue of $4.6 billion to $4.65 billion. On a constant-currency basis, total revenue is expected to increase in the low double-digit range, assuming a $164 million impact from the change in foreign currency rates. We expect a mid-single-digit comp store decrease on a reported basis and a low single-digit decrease in constant currency.
Our revised revenue expectation reflects our tempered outlook for the second half of the year. While we believe our product and marketing efforts will benefit our business longer term, we are taking a more prudent stance in the second half. We expect the sequential improvement in comp store sales in the third or fourth quarter to be driven by the inclusion of U.S. digital sales in the comp base, the rollout of Kors Concierge in our stores, the launch of our new national advertising campaign, the introduction of new innovative product offerings for holiday and spring 2016, diminished FX headwinds and easier year-over-year comparisons.
As we stated previously, we anticipate the 53rd week to add approximately $40 million of additional sales this fiscal year. We expect international gross margin to remain under pressure in the third and fourth quarters as favorable hedging contracts we entered into last year expire. Operating expense as a percent of total revenue is expected to increase 200 to 220 basis points for the year. We expect the increase in operating expense as a percent of total revenue to continue to moderate as compared to the first half of the year as the rate of spend slows and we begin to anniversary the investments we made in 2015. We now expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $4.38 to $4.42 for the year, assuming a tax rate of approximately 29% and 191.5 million shares outstanding. We expect foreign currency to impact net income by approximately $36 million and EPS by approximately $0.19 for the year.
I will now turn the call back to John for closing remarks."

But maybe you can just help us out with that. And then I'm wondering, on the wholesale channel, it sounds like a very prudent move to pull back on the inventory there.

And I have to be frank with you, we're I think at the very early stages of what we're going to be able to achieve with this platform. We're operationally, I think, in great shape, I think the site itself is quite exciting. We're going to do a lot of things over the next 6 months or so to improve our mobile experience. We don't think that's where it really needs to be. And secondly, what we're going to be able to do through our analytics and CRM with truly presenting our styling capabilities and Michael's messaging with the various communication vehicles that we're developing to tailor the experience for our customer. We think the opportunity is, quite frankly, very, very large for us. So I think that, basically, it's all systems go in terms of what we're seeing both in North America -- and I'll say America and Canada, both platforms are operating at a very, very high productivity rate. And as we said in the call, we're bringing on Europe in the fall, and we will actually bring up Korea and Japan not too far after that. So we will be, I think, in a very, very strong position. We told you 2 years ago that we were going to make a very big investment in systems, people and in the distribution facilities to be able to handle all this, and we're there, and we consider ourselves to be a company who will ultimately be best-in-class in this category. Secondly, on the inventory side. The pullback on inventory is predominantly in North America. The department store business in North America is suffering some of the same channels -- challenges that we've seen in terms of the traffic in shopping malls. So that's got us taking a more prudent approach to how much inventory we actually have sitting in the stores. That being said, our e-commerce business, with all of our department store partners, is really quite extraordinary. And I think we're all just learning how we can turn these inventories faster and supply the customer with a very strong experience, both online and in store. Again, that being said, we find the environment to be a little more promotional than we would like. So that being said, we'd like to have less inventory in the stores and have less of our brand appearing on sale, in particular, in that channel distribution. So you'll see that pullback happen kind of between now, you'll start to see a little bit of it in Q3, a little in Q4, and it will more normalize itself by June or July, which we think is the right thing for us to do, given the climate and what we want to do in terms of keeping the health of the brand. Kimberly, I want to mention one last thing. I made a highlight of it in the call, and I think it's an important issue. We continue to outperform in our categories, whether that's accessories, footwear or women's ready-to-wear, we're outperforming our competitors in the department store channel by a fairly significant amount, and we're quite proud of that. That is under the whole cloud of the fact that we said that we grew the North American handbag business in the low single digits at retail, both in our stores and department stores, but high double digits in terms of units. So the idea that people are not buying handbags, I do not believe is a correct concept. They happen to be, the fashion trend is smaller bags. So if we were selling x% of $350, $400 and $500 handbags at this time last year, we are selling less of those because we are selling a lot more, in particular, of crossbodies and large wallets. And that is what the consumer, in particular, the millennial, is viewing as a fashion trend. So that has an impact on AUR. And so therefore, we're selling a lot of Michael Kors product to people. Young people think they have bought a handbag. It's not that we're not selling handbags, in fact, we're selling a lot more handbags. So I think there is really a misnomer about what is happening in the marketplace. We believe that the handbag market in North America is, again, growing at the low single digits, but very, very high numbers in terms of units. So I think as you all are looking at the business, you should do some analysis on that, and we can share any insights that we have with you as well."

In fact, our comp stores through October are getting better, again, from what we just reported. So we're pleased with what's",383,"Okay, sure. Omar, first off, we're kind of pleased with what's happening with the sequential performance of our comp store trend. In fact, our comp stores through October are getting better, again, from what we just reported. So we're pleased with what's happening with the trend in the marketplace. It's 2 things in North America. It is, without question, smaller handbags. Again, I want to really hit home on this point, so you all understand. When we're selling high double digits in terms of additional units, that means that people are buying a lot more Michael Kors product and the same thing may be happening to some of our other competitors. That's just trend. So we're losing actual performance in the stores just because a customer thinks that they bought a handbag. So that's the first thing. And the second thing is the moderation from our previous guidance also reflects the continuation of what we think is impacting us, is the tourist traffic. Both in the department stores and in the retail channel, we have huge doors, whether it's in New York, whether it's in the Southern Florida area, all of us are now being impacted in parts of Texas because of oil prices there, that's a little bit less tourist, but some of it is related to the Mexicans shopping cross-border with the peso to the dollar. So these are things that we just don't see going away so quickly, even though we'll be lapsing the change in currency, which will happen, probably to its largest effect, Q4, the tail end of that. That's just something we think we're going to be a little bit more prudent about. And again, both in retail and wholesale, we just like to have a lot less markdown inventory in the stores. We don't think that's good for the brand long term. And we can still achieve our financial targets. As you can see, our new range annually still puts us kind of, if you take the middle of that range, at the low end of our previous guidance, so we're still going to achieve our financial objectives, and we're going to do it in a prudent way that's going to protect the health of the brand and be respectful of what's happening in the environment."

As I said in the call, saddle bags are -- we're probably going to run out before even before the holiday season. Merlot, we're probably going to run out before the fashion season. We've got some great new handbag styles that have hit. They're really getting some excellent traction. And the whole crossbody piece of the business, I want to tell you, we're excited about. We're less excited about the lower transaction value, but we are on trend, and all the consumer research that we're doing, our customer says, ""We love Michael Kors"", ""We want to buy Michael Kors"", and they are actually buying more Michael Kors. They're just buying small units, a smaller average price point unit for us. So we're seeing that happen. The biggest piece of that is going to hit for the spring season, where we've got 22 new handbag groups that we're introducing. Obviously, all of those won't be at retail. But you're going to see a major change in the way that the product looks in the stores. And that's not just because of comp store trend, I want to be clear. That's because that's what's happening in the handbag and the fashion business. Our luxury competitors around the world are doing a great job, certain of them, in really updating product and making it exciting and compelling for the customer, and that's what the customer wants today. When we're delivering newness, they get excited. And I want to say, we're seeing that in the watch business, in a business that is clearly challenged and the customer has voted a little bit more for the iPhone and a little bit less for the watch, well, all of a sudden, when Michael was the one who really drove it and said, ""Let's go after the leather watchband business in a big way."" We're getting excellent sell-throughs on that. Our new platings, sable and navy, excellent sell-throughs on that. So that's just saying to us, she wants -- she's ready to shop, but we better be a fashion leader and on trend to inspire her. So we like what we see in the stores, and I want to leave you with this call that we're kind of excited about what we see what's happening out there right now. Thanks, Omar."

Thanks, Erinn. Erinn, I remember, about 3 or 4 years ago, when the conversation of sequential deceleration came up, this is going -- our business is going to sequentially decline, whether it's North America or Europe, in the quarter, just because we're getting bigger. We're doing over $1 billion in Europe, which is incredibly impressive, to have built that in basically 6 years. And we have high brand awareness, great customer loyalty. We're looking at our newest kind of developed market that we went after this year, Italy, business is literally on fire, running strong double-digit comp growth there. So I would tell you that our business in Europe is very, very strong. There are -- leave the FX headwinds out of this a second. There are a couple of factors that are impacting the business in Europe. And that is, first and foremost, the Russian tourist who is a very large piece of our business, has not been traveling as you well know. The second piece is there's a Middle Eastern tourist issue, that they are not traveling as much as they did, and we had a very nice business with them. So both of those individual markets, if I go in to look at our Middle East market and our Russia market, are doing exceptional double-digit comp store growth in both of those markets because customers are not coming into Europe, they're shopping in those markets. So we picked some of that up through our wholesale channel. But they tend to spend a little bit more when they're traveling, and a little bit less fluidly when they're in their country. And then there is some challenge in the U.K., and that's more of a pound-to-the-euro situation, where, again, the tourists are traveling a little less into the U.K. because of the strength of the pound, i.e., the U.S. dollar. So we -- again, we really like what we see going on in Europe. And some of our department store businesses, in particular, Galeries Lafayette, I mean just fantastic; Rinascente, fantastic. I can go through the areas. But we are going to, over the years, we're probably today the largest accessible luxury handbag company in Europe, and we told you we would get there about 3 years ago, and we're probably there today. So as we have either the #1 or #2 position in the marketplace, we will grow, but it just won't be at the same growth rates that we've seen before. But overall, we really like the response that we're still having with the brand in the markets, and especially as we enter some of these new markets, customers responding with great enthusiasm."

North America, yes, we've said we'd be at 400. That will actually probably change just slightly because of -- I mean, North American women's, and the Americas will change slightly because you'll see the South American numbers reported in our Americas numbers, so just so you know. But no, we have no intent of kind of going beyond that, and we're close to it. We'll open a few more stores, and then that rollout will be complete. And again, as we've said to you many times, because you've all questioned us regularly, I might say, on why do you open more stores, well, we're profitable when we open more stores, and people, while online shopping is absolutely a trend and it's going to move the needle for the company, people will still go out and shop in a store. That won't -- at least while I'm alive, won't have evaporated. So we'll be in the right cities, in the right locations and feel good about that. And then in terms of men's, I would say to you that we're going to open these 6 or 7 stores in North America. We've got about 3/4 on the docket in Europe and then a handful in Asia. And then we've got about 75 shop-in-shops going into North America, and I don't remember the exact number in Europe. I would say we'll get these all in place, and then we'll kind of hold a little bit, just to make sure we understand what the performances are, productivities, how we're going to go about doing this. We're really excited, I can't wait to show you guys the new fall line that's coming, with Marcel Ostwald joining us. And as you know, he headed sportswear design for Hugo Boss. So we're really excited about what's coming product-wise. We've got a whole new marketing campaign that Michael has developed that will include some significant television advertising for men, because men, it's not a traditional magazine-driven communication market. So what we're going to do digitally and on TV with men's, I think you'll be quite impressed with. So we're deadly serious about the men's business. You've heard me say before it's a $1 billion opportunity. Of that $1 billion, we think $300 million of it is in leather goods, and if you go down to Macy's Herald Square, you can see our leather goods shop there, you're going to see quite a few more opening as we move forward. So this is an area of business, it's going to take us a couple of years to grow it, but once it gets going, this will be a very nice additional growth vehicle for the company. Thank you, Erinn."

So that is driven, I would say about 60% of that is driven by smaller handbags. And I'd say the balance of that is driven by additional promotional activity inside the stores. We see that starting to stabilize, in particular, in the third and fourth quarter because, remember, we're lapping some of the stuff starting to happen, that we all got a little more promotional last holiday season, got really promotional into Q1 -- or our Q4, calendar Q1. And then the small handbag thing started around that time. So we see in our retail business in North America in particular, we think margins are going to start to stabilize in Q3 and Q4. You've seen kind of a sequential 1% to 2% decline in gross margins in the retail business, and we think that's going to stabilize for us. We feel pretty good about that. And we think this AUR situation, we'll be lapping it as well. The other thing I might add that also impacted -- again, I don't want to sound defensive, but a lot of people are writing about our comp store decline, and it's all about the handbags. The watches are having an enormous impact on our comp store decline. So our handbag business is relatively healthy. And I think the industry is relatively healthy, it's not growing at the high single-digit rate it used to. But when you look at the amount of bags that are being purchased, the interest by the customer, we feel good about all that. We'll start to lapse the comp store decline in watches also coming soon. And remember, our average watch sale was between $200 and $225. So that actually impacts our average transaction inside of our stores. So that once we start to lapse some of that, again, we feel pretty good about that situation as well. And your second question was? Or was that it? That was it."

But I would tell you that the traffic in outlets has also seen a sequential decline, although modest. It's been very, very small. So the larger decline in traffic is in full price shopping malls, and the smaller piece of it is in outlets. And what's interesting now is the kind of the traffic decline and the comps are starting to marry up a little bit. At one point, the traffic decline was higher than the comp decline, and the comp decline got higher than the traffic decline, and that was driven by AUR. Now it's, as I said to you, that's why you're hearing me feel positive, it's kind of evening out. Our conversion rates are up, which, they're up significantly by the way, I have to take my hat off, I want to compliment our 7,000 employees out selling around the world, these people are doing a great job. And that's one of our, I think, incredible strengths. You may remember from the IPO, our jet-set training, the way that we really work with our teams and we've announced the Kors Concierge, which will be piloted starting really this week, it's going to be an incredible tool for these people to really act as not only a brand ambassador, but really to be a styling consultant. And again, we'll show this to you, guys, because I think you'll be quite impressed with what the technology gives our sales associates from not only a product point of view, but also information about who the customer is, what they bought previously, et cetera, all at their fingertips. And I think that is going to help us with comps because traffic is going to continue to decline. We know that, although I think moderate at a certain point. And if we can continue to keep our transaction and conversion levels up, which we've been able to do -- or get our transaction level stabilized and get our conversion rates up, which we've been able to do that, I think, that's where you're going to see the comps turn for us. And so again, we feel pretty excited about that, along with the launching of new products. Asia, or let me start -- Asia, in general, is doing great for us. So I'll just make that as an overall statement. You saw the comps in Japan. We reported that we have strong double-digit comps in China. And then in Southeast Asia, pretty much similar strong double-digit comps, 1 or 2 markets are high single-digit comps. So the whole region for us is fantastic. And what's interesting is in China, Hong Kong and Macau are not exactly flourishing, as we speak. But when we look at our China comps, we're running strong double-digit comps, even with Macau and Hong Kong suffering from lower tourist traffic. As it relates to the repurchase, we've always said we'll look at it when the business reaches scale and profitability level that will be accretive to the company. I will tell you that the business is obviously growing very rapidly. We report in the Q the size every quarter of this because we report the royalties earned and the wholesale that we ship. So you can see the growth of the business. We're going to be a significant player in China, and really excited about the new Huamao 9,000 square foot store that we're opening, and Michael will be there in November. And the events that we're putting on, the team that we have on the ground, it just further gives us great confidence that this region, potentially over the next few years, will probably be larger even than Europe for us."

I said that to you that we're feeling pretty good about that. We think we've got a pretty clear picture on that. We are going to take some price increases on some of our small leather goods because we've been actually slightly underpriced compared to some of our other luxury competitors, and also on some of our crossbodies. So we think that'll get us some margin improvement there. And as I said, we're kind of lapsing the promotional environment. So I'd say that, that's going to remain in a pretty good place. And we'll probably have a little sequential decline in wholesale gross margin, and that's a result of higher allowances to department stores. But again, we think that will be not highly significant as we look out, and especially as we begin to pull back some of the inventories. And that's really more of a North American thing. We don't see that as a European or -- we have a very sizable business in Asia now growing through our license partners and through the Duty Free operating channels as well.
So I'd like to thank everyone for joining us on the call today. I think you can sense a lot of enthusiasm from us here at Michael Kors. And that's based around, I want to first start with the incredible product that Michael and the design teams have been putting forth. And what we're feeling good about is the fact that, that product is resonating. We're both delivering great new fashion innovation, and we're delivering trend. So those are 2 things that are important to being successful, and Michael and our design teams have done that. Secondly, we're really excited about our execution of what's happening in the digital world for us. And I also want to layer onto that what's going to come with Kors Concierge and give our already 7,000 amazing employees around the world who are selling every day of the week to our fashion customers an outstanding tool to help deliver a better jet-set experience. And third, I want to say that we believe that we'll be lapping some of the headwinds that we've seen over the past 12 months. And that, therefore, we will have slightly easier comparisons, and additionally, we think we'll have a little bit more of a platform to begin to launch off of.
So with those things resonating in front of us and the growth of our international business, Michael Kors is going to be an exciting company to watch, and we're looking forward to reporting to you on the next quarter and delivering another outstanding set of results. Thank you very much."
