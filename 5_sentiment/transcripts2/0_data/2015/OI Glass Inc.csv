I'd  like to start today with a brief summary of our 2014 results and performance and touch on our expectations for 2015.Europe and South America delivered solid results for the year, and we achieved our second highest",681,"Thank you, Dave, and good morning. I'd  like to start today with a brief summary of our 2014 results and performance and touch on our expectations for 2015.
Europe and South America delivered solid results for the year, and we achieved our second highest cash flow and company history at $329 million. Like every other U.S.-based global company, our final results were negatively impacted by the strong U.S. dollar. As an example, we experienced a $40 million headwind to free cash flow in the year. On a constant currency basis, free cash flow would have been closer to $370 million, higher than the target we established a year ago.
Our adjusted EPS for the year was $2.63, modestly lower than 2013. This reflects our strong performance in Europe and South America and disappointing performance in North America and Asia Pacific.
The underlying demand pattern in the first half of the year was in line with our projections going into 2014. During the third quarter, however, we perceived a considerable gap between actual volume and our expectations, plus the dollar began to strengthen, and we shared this with you in September. On the whole, 2014 was still a strong year for O-I financially, nearly record cash flow, stronger balance sheet and disciplined capital allocation.
Our higher level of financial flexibility was illustrated in 2014 when we used capital to invest for growth in a joint venture with Constellation Brands to supply glass for well-known Mexican beer brands that are exported to the United States. These include the Corona Modelo and Pacifico brands. We also signed a separate long-term agreement with Constellation to supply additional bottles. These agreements are great examples of strategic partnerships with our customers and allow us to participate in growing segments in the U.S. This is possible due to O-I's unique capabilities as the only truly global class provider.
On Slide 3, I'll provide a bit more detail about business performance in each region. Profits in Europe improved in 2014 despite a sluggish macroenvironment. We are clearly benefiting from our ongoing asset optimization program, which delivered an expected $25 million of incremental cost savings in 2014. In addition, we continue to strengthen our position in the wine and beer segments. I'm happy to report that our most senior commercial leader in Europe, Vitaliano Torno, has succeeded Erik Bouts as the Managing Director of O-I Europe. As one of the architects of our market-oriented structure in Europe, Vitaliano provides the continuity we need to keep our European operations strongly moving forward.
In South America, operating profit margins climbed back to 20%, driven by overall volume growth of 4%, including record volumes in Brazil. Our results were boosted by the anticipated recovery in the Andean countries. Currency headwinds dampened operating profit margin in the region but were essentially offset by considerable productivity improvements. 
North America and Asia Pacific were less profitable year-on-year due to a number of challenges we identified earlier in the year and are working diligently to address.
In North America, sales volumes were down 2%, largely driven by the ongoing decline in the sales of mega beer package and glass. Our difficulties in the region started in the beginning of the year with weather-induced supply chain challenges, and we ended the year by curtailing production to adjust for demand expectations that did not manifest during the peak season.
In Asia Pacific, our financial performance was impacted by lower sales and production volume. Sales volume in China was about half of that of the prior year in light of our deliberate actions to scale back our presence there. In addition, Australian volumes were down double digits driven by continued weakness in the domestic beer and wine export markets. On the upside, we are well-positioned in Southeast Asia to take advantage of ongoing growth opportunities there. Our management team in Asia Pacific has responded to the macroeconomic environment aggressively, so we expect the region to stabilize and increase its profitability in 2015. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve to review our financial performance in more detail. Steve?"

Before discussing any specifics, I'd like to make a general comment on currency. Given the well-documented strengthening of the U.S. dollar recently, combined with the fact that 75% of our business resides outside of the United States, we will present financial information this morning on a constant currency basis, that is using the prior year's currency rates. Our intent is to allow greater visibility into the actual underlying business performance and trends. I hope this facilitates a clearer understanding for investors generally.
Now turning to Slide 4. In the fourth quarter of 2014, sales on a constant currency basis declined as price increases were more than offset by a decline in volume. Please be cognizant, however, that much of the volume decline compared with prior year fourth quarter was driven by the footprint adjustments we consciously and proactively made in China, where we took out 3 facilities versus the prior-year period. The strengthening dollar started to significantly take its toll on the top line in the fourth quarter, ultimately causing an approximate 6% decline in sales. In line with expectations, however, segment operating profit contracted only modestly. Price increases tracked in line with inflation of $23 million, which is consistent with the trends seen in the prior 2 quarters. On the whole, our cost-containment efforts more than offset the impact of production curtailments. Lower sales volumes and currency rates were clear headwinds.
Turning to adjusted EPS on Slide 5, you will see that while there are various influencing factors, 80% of the decline in profitability in the fourth quarter was due to currency.
Moving to the full year adjusted EPS on the right, net correlation between fourth quarter and full year impacts was modestly unfavorable segment and tax results, offset by better corporate and interest expense. The one exception is currency where you may have expected a larger full year impact. Because the U.S. dollar only really began to quickly strengthen in the back half of the year, the currency impact in Europe, specifically on profitability, was essentially flat for the full year.
Let me shift my comments to GAAP earnings per share for the moment, highlighting the items considered not to be representative of ongoing operations, which you can find enumerated in our earnings press release. The annual evaluation of our asbestos-related liability resulted in a $135 million charge in the fourth quarter. This is $10 million less than the prior year's charge and is entirely consistent with the underlying trends we have been experiencing for several years. Asbestos remains a gradually declining, though still significant, liability for the company.
We also recorded pretax charges of $92 million in the fourth quarter. These charges were primarily from our refinancing activity during the quarter, plus a noncash charge for pension liability reduction actions in the United States and Europe, both of which we have been expecting and have previously communicated.
On Slide 6, we provide a snapshot of our financial performance for the year. In line with our owners' priorities, we remain clearly focused on generating free cash flow. In local currency, we've seen growth for several years. In fact, as we've said before, we expected record free cash flow in local currency in 2014 and that's exactly what we delivered. Said differently, had we not experienced such strong currency headwinds in late 2014, we would have exceeded the $350 million in free cash flow that we guided to at this time last year.
We have been, I believe, quite transparent about how we allocate our cash and the logic underpinning our allocation priorities. Of our approximately $700 million in cash flow from operations, a bit over half is directed to maintaining and enhancing our manufacturing assets. To date, we have used the remaining cash, what we call our free cash flow, in a balanced way for antidilutive share repurchases, net debt reduction and, in 2014, for modest nonorganic growth investments via the CBI joint venture. As such, we continue to make progress reducing our leverage ratio, which stood at 2.4x net debt to EBITDA at year-end 2014. Please note that the weakening euro provided half of the 0.2 year-on-year improvement in the ratio. Otherwise, we would have achieved our expected year-end target of 2.5x.
Moving to last graph, you can see that our return on invested capital has been consistent for several years and well above our constant capital. Going forward, we anticipate gradual improvement in returns via the elimination of low-return businesses in China and the addition of value-added investments, such as our joint venture in Mexico.
Let me now spend a few minutes with our 2015 business outlook on Slide 7. Overall, we continue to expect fairly stable local market environments in 2015 as our base case scenario. In Europe, the asset optimization program is enabling improved productivity, especially at plants in which investments have been made. In line with our original expectations, the programs should deliver an incremental $25 million in cost savings for the full year. Competitive pressures, particularly in the wine segment in Southern Europe, will partially offset the benefit of these cost reductions.
In North America, we anticipate a similar environment, with a gradual dissipation of the mega beer demand slowdown. We have not incorporated any upside in our base case scenario from the North American consumers' potential, higher discretionary income emanating from lower gasoline and energy costs. Although it's too soon to tell, we are certainly hopeful for a positive impact. We fully expect our business to recover from the supply chain and production problems that impeded 2014 results.
In South America, we expect the growth will pause in 2015 after record volume levels were achieved in 2014. We also anticipate reduced production volume in the Andean countries due to lower buffer stock requirements from Brazil and the United States. We do see some inflation pressure in the region that will likely take time for the market to fully absorb. For instance, electricity costs in Brazil are increasing substantially, as has been referenced by other companies doing business in the region. And global commodities that are heavily influenced by U.S. dollar movements, such as soda ash, will certainly be more expensive in 2015.
Turning now to Asia Pacific. By the end of the second quarter, we expect to lap the sales decline attributed to our early 2014 retrenchment in China. in Oceania, we expect essentially stable demand, albeit at today's relatively low historical levels. On balance though, our actions to regain beer business, market share and restructure assets in Australia are expected to more than compensate for the sales and production declines we project for the first half of the year. In other words, the second half should be better year-on-year than the first half.
For the company overall, we expect higher segment operating profit for 2015 on a constant currency basis, driven primarily by productivity gains in North America and continued asset optimization benefits in Europe.
Moving now to Slide 8. In 2015, we will incur the brunt of the strong U.S. dollar on full year earnings. We have updated our currency expectations here since our last communication in December as they U.S. dollar continues to strengthen, particularly against the euro. Clearly, the volatility is not over, with the U.S. dollar index just reaching another approximately 12-year high late last week. Currency rates are expected to reduce translated sales by nearly 10% in 2015.
As it relates to segment operating profit, in early December, we calculated the adverse year-on-year impact of currency at roughly $50 million. Using current rates, with the key currencies listed on this slide, it is now double that amount. This includes the decoupling of the Swiss franc from the euro, which happened in mid-January. With the cost structure of our Switzerland-based headquarters largely denominated in Swiss francs for our EU business, our European region now faces an incremental $10 million to $15 million headwind from this change alone.
As our budget process for 2015 is now behind us, we can also see more clearly the impact of currency on local inflation expectations. In particular, the price of certain raw materials, such as soda ash, are de facto based on U.S. dollar pricing. This has led to an approximate $20 million headwind that will manifest itself in the lower segment operating earnings, particularly in South America, but also partially in Asia Pacific. For long-term contracts with price adjustment formulas, we will ultimately recover this albeit with a 1 year lag.
Even though our local production and sourcing business model are non-U.S. debt and modest medium term euro hedging program mitigate significant amounts of currency risk, we still envision that foreign exchange will negatively impact earnings per share by approximately $0.40 at this time. Given the sensitivity and magnitude of currency movements on the reported earnings, we will continue to provide timely updates to the investment community as needed, with revised expectations of currency's impact on our consolidated results.
Turning to our nonoperational performance on Slide 9 now. Corporate expense ought to be on par with that of 2014. Pension expense, which I will discuss on the next slide, is roughly flat with prior year, and this is a clear improvement over our earlier expectations. While we will continue to invest in research and development and technology, I expect any increases there will be offset by cost containment elsewhere. With regard to interest expense, we will benefit from debt refinancing and lower overall leverage levels. And finally, our tax rate is still projected to be in the range of 23% to 25%.
Let me now turn to pension on Slide 10, where there have been many moving pieces. First of all, I'm pleased to say that the final impacts of lower discount rates and the adoption of new mortality tables in the United States were not as severe as we had feared. This is exclusively attributable to the aggressive actions we took to deal with the real economic liabilities within our pension plans. These actions have allowed us to reduce our pension liability by $750 million since 2012. We took a major step forward in 2014 when we were able to reduce our economic liability by approximately $600 million. We achieved this by closing all major plans and converting them, with one exception to defined contribution plans, most recently for salaried North American employees, by completing the buyouts of nearly all term vested participants in the United States and by effectively annuitizing the pension in the Netherlands, where we merged our plan into a national multicompany fund, was transferred assets and liabilities completely off of our books. 
On the asset side, we have consciously channeled approximately $225 million in discretionary funds to our pension plans over the past several years. In addition to being accretive to earnings, these payments have eliminated the need for us to contribute to our U.S. pensions, which are our largest for the foreseeable future. In all, we now expect pension expense to be essentially flat in 2015 and pension cash contributions to be approximately $10 million lower than in 2014. In light of a global reduction of rates, anywhere between 75 to 100 basis points during the year, plus the implementation of actuarial tables, which broadly increased longevity assumptions for retiree mortality in the United States, flat pension expense is a tremendous outcome for the company.
After thoroughly examining the various pros and cons of accounting methods for pension plans, the company intends to maintain its current accounting methodology. As a rule, we try to avoid changing our accounting practices if the changes would not reflect an underlying change in actual economics. However, as with all significant accounting assumptions and estimates, we will continue to assess this practice on an ongoing basis. I do believe it is important, however, to continue to be very clear as to the impact of noncash, nonservice-related charges in GAAP pension accounting on the company's results. Amortization of historical actuarial losses, for instance, do not reflect day-to-day operations, nor do they have any relationship to cash funding requirements. Yet if you back out this single item, our earnings would be approximately $0.50 higher per share, which is almost 20% of our adjusted earnings.
On Slide 11, I'd like to bring together the key pieces of our earnings outlook. As I indicated earlier, on a constant currency basis, we see improved operational and nonoperational performance, allowing for our normal lack of prescience [ph] 12 months into the future, adjusted earnings would be $2.60 to $3 on a constant currency basis per share. The midpoint of this range suggests an underlying earnings growth rate of approximately 5% to 6%. But of course, and unfortunately, we must take into consideration the strong U.S. dollar which, as mentioned before, we estimate will provide about a $0.40 headwind at this time. That brings us back to an adjusted EPS range of $2.20 to $2.60. Keep in mind that we believe the core business is quite stable, and we are not anticipating any fundamental shifts in volumes or price cost spread, which have been key sources of historical volatility in our business.
Moving to Slide 12. Given our full year outlook and recognizing sales and production patterns in 2014, it should come as no surprise that we expect that the first quarter of 2015 will be down year-on-year, followed by improving performance later in the year. 
Let me step through the regions. First, on a constant currency basis. In Europe, the results are expected to be considerably lower due to project timing and the asset optimization program, which will temporarily reduce production volume and increase cost during the quarter. There will also be sharpening competitive pressures, as I mentioned before, in the wine segment in Southern Europe.
In North America, we expect to see a $15 million benefit in logistics costs. This will partially be offset by lower beer sales.
In South America, profits will be dampened by inflation induced by the impact of local currency devaluation on U.S. dollar priced raw materials and some major local issues, such as the spike in electricity costs in Brazil. We will also face difficult comparables in the first half of the year in Brazil due to the volume uptick related to the World Cup in 2014.
Asia Pacific is likely to be flat as the actions to right size production with sales volume take hold.
The impact from currency in the quarter is expected to be approximately $0.07, maybe $0.08, mainly reflected in Europe and South America. In all, adjusted earnings should be in the range of $0.40 to $0.45.
Summarizing the delta from prior year first quarter, close to 40% is currency related, 40% is related to sales and production volumes as well as project timing, and most of the remainder is due to the higher expected tax rate of 4% to 5% we will see in the quarter.
Let's turn back to the full year with a more detailed look at free cash flow on Slide 13. In short, we expect to generate $300 million in free cash flow again in 2015. We've already mentioned improved operating profit in local currency terms. The year-on-year impact of foreign exchange on cash flows will be substantially lower than on earnings because we typically generate our cash flow in the latter half of the year. Because the stronger dollar already significantly impacted 2014 cash flows, its impact in 2015 should be less pronounced.
Working capital has been a source of cash for the past few years, but in the coming year we expect it to be balance, neither a source nor a use of cash. 
Payments for asbestos and pension together are expected to be $15 million to $20 million lower. Together, capital spending and restructuring should approximate our 2014 spending level, which is approximately equal to the total of depreciation and amortization.
Cash flow is expected to benefit from the lack of several outlays that we've made consistently over the past few years, such as for abnormally high returnable packaging levels and payments related to nonincome tax matter. When we put all the pieces together, we expect free cash flow to be $300 million. You can be certain that we will continue to focus on cash generation and that we will continue to prudently deploy the cash we earn in a value-added way, as I would like to discuss on Slide 14.
We will continue to invest over half of our cash from operations into CapEx in order to maintain and rebuild our assets, as well as to enhance our productivity and improve our flexibility. As we have increased our cash flow in recent years, we have enhanced our financial flexibility and enabled ourselves to pursue value-added strategic investments. Even as we invest in the business, we remain disciplined in the allocation of cash to our capital providers. While we have focused on reducing debt in recent years, lower interest rates and the strength of our balance sheet have brought us to a significant inflection point with respect to capital allocation, namely, as we have been consistently foreshadowing, we are poised to return more cash to our shareholders in 2015. We have regularly discussed with our Board of Directors and have solicit input from both investors and advisors on the best way to do this without compromising our financial flexibility. As we consider our debt and asbestos obligations, as well as opportunistic nonorganic growth investment commitments, we strongly prefer the flexibility of share repurchase at this time versus other legitimate alternatives such as a dividend. Our board has recently authorized a $500 million share repurchase program. Within the next week or so, we intend to enter into an accelerated share repurchase agreement with a financial institution to repurchase $100 million of our stock. Over the course of the year, we expect to purchase at least another $25 million.
For certain, we will be disciplined in our capital allocation. We will continue to invest in the business in order to sustain its cash-generating ability, return cash to shareholders and modestly delever over time. Thank you for your attention. Let me now turn the call back over to Al in order to wrap up."

The path that we have been on for the last 2 years or 3 years continues into 2015. We will maintain many of the same priorities such as strengthening our manufacturing capabilities and reducing costs and, as you heard, we will be making some adjustments to our capital allocation process. We will also continue to focus on the CEO succession process. Our Board of Directors has always viewed CEO succession as one of their most critical responsibilities. We launched a robust and detailed process several years ago. Internal succession candidates were identified and given expanded responsibilities, and external candidates were hired into key leadership roles. External firms were hired to help assess, track and coach all of the candidates, with late 2014 targeted as the time in which a decision would be made whether to proceed with the candidate. In December of last year, the board determined that we did indeed have a strong internal candidate in Andres Lopez. As the next planned step in the process, Andres was promoted to President of Glass Containers and Chief Operating Officer of O-I. Andres has proven himself as a strong and creative business leader with extensive knowledge of the industry and a deep understanding of manufacturing. After leading our South American operations to record volumes over a 5-year period, Andrew assumed responsibility for the North American operations in the fall of 2014. He has shaped and reinvigorated that business already and will hand over the reins of North America to a new leader soon. Andres is now working to more deeply familiarize himself with our businesses in Europe and Asia Pacific. We're anticipating that we will complete the CEO transition process by the end of 2015. In and around that time, I expect the new CEO will update the investment community on the company's long-term plans and i's related financial targets.
With regard to my role as Chairman of the Board, I intend to relinquish that role at our annual meeting in May 2016, at which time a nonexecutive chairperson will be chosen by the board.
Our board has clearly defined the company's expectations of succession, and I look forward to working with my team to ensure a smooth and orderly transition during the process.
Now before we take your questions, let's turn to Page 16, where I would like to summarize our outlook. Local market conditions and demand will remain largely unchanged. Of course, while this means ongoing competitive pressure in certain areas, our volumes stand to benefit from the long-term contracts we've locked in with most of our multinational partners. Our cost structure will improve through our restructuring activities, asset optimization, improved logistics and operating models. Nonoperational items are also in good shape. Interest expense will be lower and pension expenses flat in the face of lower discount rates. Our cash flow generation will remain strong in local currency terms. Of course, the stronger U.S. dollar will affect our reported results, yet we are focused on improving our underlying business to deliver value for the long-term. And lastly, as stewards of our owners' investments, we are acting now to increase our share buybacks, yet preserving the flexibility to invest in value-added opportunities.
Thank you, and now I will ask Beth to open up the lines for your questions."

And the best way to move volume is, of course, to move volume through supermarkets through large volume offerings and typically cans of course are better suited for that type of offering. And that is, I believe, some of the emphasis that we've seen over the last year and a half or last 2 years. Generally, expectations would be, if consumption picks up a little bit, that the brewers would tend to favor the more premium beer brands again and that's where you see a higher percentage of glass. So we've gone through these cycles before in the past. It's very difficult to predict how long they will last. But I think also we have seen a significant offset to our sales and continually increasing double-digit growth in the sales to the microbrewers."

We do not have any near-term funding requirements in the United States or in Canada, our North American plans being our largest.

But if we really bring them down to the more critical issues, it was to fundamentally understand the dynamics of this business and to have a very solid manufacturing background in general because, as you know, this is a very high fixed cost-oriented business. The other parts that were extremely important is to have courage, to have the courage of a difference of opinion, to have the courage of moving other people along and that the individual would have a very high level of attention to talent development, to make sure that the individuals that eventually are in the organization and in responsible roles can move up without a lot of lead time and be ready to take on additional responsibilities. I believe that beyond that, of course, it also was very important that a leader was able to learn and keep on learning and adjusting their strategy and their approaches to changing market conditions, to changing environments. And I believe all of that comes very well together in Andres and I think also the track record of course was an important aspect. And we have seen now over quite a number of years, 6 or so years, how that has developed and how many innovations Andres has brought into his businesses in Latin America that eventually find their duplication in other regions of the world as well.

I believe, clearly, what's going to make a huge difference is the general economy and the general economic environment. As you know very well, certainly in 2008, 2009, all the way to 2011 and '12, North America had a significant impact in consumption because of the financial crisis and, eventually, economic crisis. I think Europe is going through the same phase with a 2- to 3-year time delay behind it. That has had a significant impact on demand. As you know, from our discussions in the past, the 1% variance in demand has a significant impact. Typically, it's around what, $40 million of profit contribution. So I believe if we are going to see some general economic confidence returning into the marketplace, then the battle that we've been fighting to hold on to our volume will be alleviated, will be getting some support from demand profiles and that will have a significant impact. The other part that we've been working on for quite a number of years is in research and development to get to a different process of manufacturing glass and to get to a much lower cost manufacturing approach as we go forward. That's still a couple of years down the road, but we are already, at this point in time, taking lessons that we've learned and putting it in place in facilities we just opened, a facility in Estonia, which is using some of those insights. We'll have another plant coming onstream in, I think, April or May of this year in Italy. So I believe we are going to get some benefit in the margin and margin expansion as well from technology and technology improvements, aside from the overall demand profile improving with the general economic environment improving."

I'd like to start today with a brief summary of our 2014 results and performance and touch on our expectations for 2015. Europe and South America delivered solid results for the year and we achieved our second highest cash flow in company history at $329 million. Like every other U.S.-based global company, our final results were negatively impacted by the strong U.S. dollar. As an example, we experienced a $40 million headwind to free cash flow in the year. On a constant currency basis, free cash flow would have been closer to $370 million, higher than the target we established a year ago.
Our adjusted EPS for the year was $2.63, modestly lower than 2013. This reflects our strong performance in Europe and South America and disappointing performance in North America and Asia Pacific. The underlying demand pattern in the first half of the year was in line with our projections going into 2014. During the third quarter, however, we perceived a considerable gap between actual volume and our expectations plus the dollar began to strengthen. And we shared this with you in September. On the whole, 2014 was still a strong year for O-I financially, nearly record cash flow, stronger balance sheet and disciplined capital allocation.
Our higher level of financial flexibility was illustrated in 2014 when we used capital to invest for growth in a joint venture with Constellation Brands to supply glass for well-known Mexican beer brands that are exported to the United States. These include the Corona, Modelo and Pacifico brands. We also signed a separate long-term agreement with Constellation to supply additional bottles. These agreements are great examples of strategic partnerships with our customers and allow us to participate in growing segments in the U.S. This is possible due to O-I's unique capabilities as the only truly global class provider.
On Slide 3, I'll provide a bit more detail about business performance in each region. Profits in Europe improved in 2014 despite a sluggish macro environment. We are clearly benefiting from our ongoing asset optimization program, which delivered an expected $25 million of incremental cost savings in 2014. In addition, we continued to strengthen our position in the wine and beer segments. I'm happy to report that our most senior commercial leader in Europe, Vitaliano Torno, has succeeded Erik Bouts as the Managing Director of O-I Europe. As one of the architects of our market-oriented structure in Europe, Vitaliano provides the continuity we need to keep our European operations strongly moving forward. 
In South America, operating profit margins climbed back to 20%, driven by overall volume growth of 4%, including record volumes in Brazil. Our results were boosted by the anticipated recovery in the Andean countries. Currency headwinds dampened operating profit margin in the region but were essentially offset by considerable productivity improvements. 
North America and Asia Pacific were less profitable year-on-year due to a number of challenges we identified earlier in the year and are working diligently to address. In North America, sales volumes were down 2%, largely driven by the ongoing decline in the sales of mega beer packaged in glass. Our difficulties in the region started in the beginning of the year with weather-induced supply chain challenges. And we ended the year by curtailing production to adjust for demand expectations that did not manifest during the peak season.
In Asia Pacific, our financial performance was impacted by lower sales and production volume. Sales volume in China was about half of that of the prior year in line with our deliberate actions to scale back our presence there. In addition, Australian volumes were down double digits, driven by continued weakness in the domestic beer and wine export markets. On the upside, we are well positioned in Southeast Asia to take advantage of ongoing growth opportunities there. Our management team in Asia Pacific has responded to the macroeconomic environment aggressively, so we expect the region to stabilize and increase its profitability in 2015. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve to review our financial performance in more detail. Steve?"

Before discussing any specifics, I'd like to make a general comment on currency. Given the well-documented strengthening of the U.S. dollar recently, combined with the fact that 75% of our business resides outside of United States, we will present financial information this morning on a constant currency basis, that is, using the prior year's currency rates. Our intent is to allow greater visibility into the actual underlying business performance and trends. I hope this facilitates a clearer understanding for investors generally.
Now turning to Slide 4. In the fourth quarter of 2014, sales on a constant currency basis declined as price increases were more than offset by a decline in volume. Please be cognizant, however, that much of the volume decline compared with prior year fourth quarter was driven by the footprint adjustments we consciously and proactively made in China, where we took out 3 facilities versus the prior year period. The strengthening dollar started to significantly take its toll on the top line in the fourth quarter, ultimately causing an approximate 6% decline in sales. In line with expectations, however, segment operating profit contracted only modestly. Price increases tracked in line with inflation of $23 million, which is consistent with the trends seen in the prior 2 quarters. On the whole, our cost-containment efforts more than offset the impact of production curtailments. Lower sales volumes and currency rates were clear headwinds.
Turning to adjusted EPS on Slide 5. You will see that while there are various influencing factors, 80% of the decline in profitability in the fourth quarter was due to currency. Moving to the full year adjusted EPS on the right, note the correlation between fourth quarter and full year impacts with modestly unfavorable segment and tax results, offset by better corporate and interest expense. The one exception is currency, where you may have expected a larger full year impact. Because the U.S. dollar only really began to quickly strengthen in the back half of the year, the currency impact in Europe, specifically on profitability, was essentially flat for the full year.
Let me shift my comments to GAAP earnings per share for the moment, highlighting the items considered not to be representative of ongoing operations, which you can find enumerated in our earnings press release. The annual evaluation of our asbestos-related liability resulted in a $135 million charge in the fourth quarter. This is $10 million less than the prior year's charge and is entirely consistent with the underlying trends we have been experiencing for several years. Asbestos remains a gradually declining, though still significant, liability for the company. We also recorded pretax charges of $92 million in the fourth quarter. These charges were primarily from our refinancing activity during the quarter plus a noncash charge for pension liability reduction actions in the United States and Europe, both of which we have been expecting and have previously communicated.
On Slide 6, we provide a snapshot of our financial performance for the year. In line with our owners' priorities, we remain clearly focused on generating free cash flow. In local currency, we've seen growth for several years. In fact, as we've said before, we expected record free cash flow in local currency in 2014. And that's exactly what we delivered. Said differently, had we not experienced such strong currency headwinds in late 2014, we would have exceeded the $350 million in free cash flow that we guided to at this time last year.
We have been, I believe, quite transparent about how we allocate our cash and the logic underpinning our allocation priorities. Of our approximately $700 million in cash flow from operations, a bit over half is directed to maintaining and enhancing our manufacturing assets. To date, we have used the remaining cash, what we call our free cash flow, in a balanced way for antidilutive share repurchases, net debt reduction and, in 2014, for modest nonorganic growth investments via the CBI joint venture. As such, we continue to make progress reducing our leverage ratio, which stood at 2.4x net debt to EBITDA at year-end 2014. Please note that the weakening euro provided half of the 0.2 year-on-year improvement in the ratio. Otherwise, we would have achieved our expected year-end target of 2.5x.
Moving to last graph. You can see that our return on invested capital has been consistent for several years and well above our cost of capital. Going forward, we anticipate gradual improvement in returns via the elimination of low-return businesses in China and the addition of value-added investments, such as our joint venture in Mexico.
Let me now spend a few minutes with our 2015 business outlook on Slide 7. Overall, we continue to expect fairly stable local market environments in 2015 as our base-case scenario. In Europe, the asset optimization program is enabling improved productivity, especially at plants in which investments have been made. In line with our original expectations, the programs should deliver an incremental $25 million in cost savings for the full year. Competitive pressures, particularly in the wine segment in Southern Europe, will partially offset the benefit of these cost reductions.
In North America, we anticipate a similar environment with a gradual dissipation of the mega beer demand slowdown. We have not incorporated any upside in our base-case scenario from the North American consumers' potential higher discretionary income emanating from lower gasoline and energy costs. Although it's too soon to tell, we are certainly hopeful for a positive impact. We fully expect our business to recover from the supply chain and production problems that impeded 2014 results.
In South America, we expect the growth will pause in 2015 after record volume levels were achieved in 2014. We also anticipate reduced production volume in the Andean countries due to lower buffer stock requirements from Brazil and the United States. We do see some inflation pressure in the region that will likely take time for the market to fully absorb. For instance, electricity costs in Brazil are increasing substantially as has been referenced by other companies doing business in the region. And global commodities that are heavily influenced by U.S. dollar movements, such as soda ash, will certainly be more expensive in 2015.
Turning now to Asia Pacific. By the end of the second quarter, we expect to lap the sales decline attributed to our early 2014 retrenchment in China. In Oceania, we expect essentially stable demand, albeit at today's relatively low historical levels. On balance though, our actions to regain beer business, market share and restructure assets in Australia are expected to more than compensate for the sales and production declines we project for the first half of the year. In other words, the second half should be better year-on-year than the first half. For the company overall, we expect higher segment operating profit for 2015 on a constant currency basis, driven primarily by productivity gains in North America and continued asset optimization benefits in Europe.
Moving now to Slide 8. In 2015, we will incur the brunt of the strong U.S. dollar on full year earnings. We have updated our currency expectations here since our last communication in December as the U.S. dollar continues to strengthen, particularly against the euro. Clearly, the volatility is not over with the U.S. dollar index just reaching another approximately 12-year high late last week. Currency rates are expected to reduce translated sales by nearly 10% in 2015.
As it relates to segment operating profit, in early December, we calculated the adverse year-on-year impact of currency at roughly $50 million. Using current rates with the key currencies listed on this slide, it is now double that amount. This includes the decoupling of the Swiss franc from the euro, which happened in mid-January. With the cost structure of our Switzerland-based headquarters largely denominated in Swiss francs for our EU business, our European region now faces an incremental $10 million to $15 million headwind from this change alone.
As our budget process for 2015 is now behind us, we can also see more clearly the impact of currency on local inflation expectations. In particular, the price of certain raw materials, such as soda ash, are de facto based on U.S. dollar pricing. This has led to an approximate $20 million headwind that will manifest itself in the lower segment operating earnings, particularly in South America but also partially in Asia Pacific. For long-term contracts with price adjustment formulas, we will ultimately recover this, albeit with a 1-year lag. Even though our local production and sourcing business model, our non-U.S. debt and modest medium-term euro hedging program mitigate significant amounts of currency risk, we still envision that foreign exchange will negatively impact earnings per share by approximately $0.40 at this time. Given the sensitivity and magnitude of currency movements on our reported earnings, we will continue to provide timely updates to the investment community as needed with revised expectations of currencies' impact on our consolidated results.
Turning to our nonoperational performance on Slide 9 now. Corporate expense ought to be on par with that of 2014. Pension expense, which I will discuss on the next slide, is roughly flat with prior year. And this is a clear improvement over our earlier expectations. While we will continue to invest in research and development and technology, I expect any increases there will be offset by cost containment elsewhere. With regard to interest expense, we will benefit from debt refinancing and lower overall leverage levels. And finally, our tax rate is still projected to be in the range of 23% to 25%.
Let me now turn to pension on Slide 10, where there have been many moving pieces. First of all, I'm pleased to say that the final impacts of lower discount rates and the adoption of new mortality tables in the United States were not as severe as we had feared. This is exclusively attributable to the aggressive actions we took to deal with the real economic liabilities within our pension plans. These actions have allowed us to reduce our pension liability by $750 million since 2012, which is a major step forward in 2014 when we were able to reduce our economic liability by approximately $600 million. We achieved this by closing all major plans and converting them with one exception to defined contribution plans, most recently for salaried North American employees; by completing the buyouts of nearly all term-vested participants in the United States; and by effectively annuitizing the pension in the Netherlands, where we merged our plan into a national multicompany fund. This transferred assets and liabilities completely off of our books. 
On the asset side, we have consciously channeled approximately $225 million in discretionary funds to our pension plans over the past several years. In addition to being accretive to earnings, these payments have eliminated the need for us to contribute to our U.S. pensions, which are our largest for the foreseeable future. In all, we now expect pension expense to be essentially flat in 2015 and pension cash contributions to be approximately $10 million lower than in 2014. In light of a global reduction of rates, anywhere between 75 to 100 basis points during the year, plus the implementation of actuarial tables, which broadly increased longevity assumptions for retiree mortality in the United States, flat pension expense is a tremendous outcome for the company.
After thoroughly examining the various pros and cons of accounting methods for pension plans, the company intends to maintain its current accounting methodology. As a rule, we tried to avoid changing our accounting practices if the changes would not reflect an underlying change in actual economics. However, as with all significant accounting assumptions and estimates, we will continue to assess this practice on an ongoing basis. I do believe it is important, however, to continue to be very clear as to the impact of noncash, nonservice-related charges in GAAP pension accounting on the company's results. Amortization of historical actuarial losses, for instance, do not reflect day-to-day operations nor do they have any relationship to cash funding requirements. Yet if you back out this single item, our earnings would be approximately $0.50 higher per share, which is almost 20% of our adjusted earnings.
On Slide 11, I'd like to bring together the key pieces of our earnings outlook. As I indicated earlier, on a constant currency basis, we see improved operational and nonoperational performance. Allowing for our normal lack of prescience 12 months into the future, adjusted earnings would be $2.60 to $3 on a constant currency basis per share. The midpoint of this range suggests an underlying earnings growth rate of approximately 5% to 6%. But of course and unfortunately, we must take into consideration the strong U.S. dollar, which as mentioned before, we estimate will provide about a $0.40 headwind at this time. That brings us back to an adjusted EPS range of $2.20 to $2.60. Keep in mind that we believe the core business is quite stable, and we're not anticipating any fundamental shifts in volumes or price-cost spread, which have been key sources of historical volatility in our business.
Moving to Slide 12. Given our full year outlook and recognizing sales and production patterns in 2014, it should come as no surprise that we expect that the first quarter of 2015 will be down year-on-year, followed by improving performance later in the year. Let me step through the regions, first, on a constant currency basis. In Europe, the results are expected to be considerably lower due to project timing in the asset optimization program, which will temporarily reduce production volume and increase cost during the quarter. There will also be sharpening competitive pressures, as I mentioned before, in the wine segment in Southern Europe.
In North America, we expect to see a $15 million benefit in logistics costs. This will partially be offset by lower beer sales. In South America, profits will be dampened by inflation induced by the impact of local currency devaluation on U.S. dollar-priced raw materials and some major local issues, such as the spike in electricity costs in Brazil. We will also face difficult comparables in the first half of the year in Brazil due to the volume uptick related to the World Cup in 2014. Asia Pacific is likely to be flat as the actions to right-size production with sales volumes take hold. The impact from currency in the quarter is expected to be approximately $0.07, maybe $0.08, mainly reflected in Europe and South America. In all, adjusted earnings should be in the range of $0.40 to $0.45.
Summarizing the delta from prior year first quarter. Close to 40% is currency-related, 40% is related to sales and production volumes as well as project timing and most of the remainder is due to the higher expected tax rate of 4% to 5% we will see in the quarter.
Let's turn back to the full year with a more detailed look at free cash flow on Slide 13. In short, we expect to generate $300 million in free cash flow again in 2015. We've already mentioned improved operating profit in local currency terms. The year-on-year impact of foreign exchange on cash flows will be substantially lower than on earnings because we typically generate our cash flow in the latter half of the year. Because the stronger dollar already significantly impacted 2014 cash flows, its impact in 2015 should be less pronounced. Working capital has been a source of cash for the past few years. But in the coming year, we expect it to be balanced, neither a source nor a use of cash. Payments for asbestos and pension together are expected to be $15 million to $20 million lower. Together, capital spending and restructuring should approximate our 2014 spending levels, which is approximately equal to the total of depreciation and amortization.
Cash flow is expected to benefit from a lack of several outlays that we've made consistently over the past few years, such as for abnormally high returnable packaging levels and payments related to a nonincome tax matter. When we put all the pieces together, we expect free cash flow to be $300 million. You can be certain that we will continue to focus on cash generation and that we will continue to prudently deploy the cash we earn in a value-added way, as I would like to discuss on Slide 14.
We will continue to invest over half of our cash from operations into CapEx in order to maintain and rebuild our assets as well as to enhance our productivity and improve our flexibility. As we have increased our cash flow in recent years, we have enhanced our financial flexibility and enabled ourselves to pursue value-added strategic investments. Even as we invest in the business, we remain disciplined in the allocation of cash to our capital providers. While we have focused on reducing debt in recent years, lower interest rates and the strength of our balance sheet have brought us to a significant inflection point with respect to capital allocation, namely as we have been consistently foreshadowing, we are poised to return more cash to our shareholders in 2015. 
We have regularly discussed with our Board of Directors and have solicit input from both investors and advisers on the best way to do this without compromising our financial flexibility. As we consider our debt and asbestos obligations as well as opportunistic nonorganic growth investment commitments, we strongly prefer the flexibility of share repurchase at this time versus other legitimate alternatives, such as a dividend. Our board has recently authorized a $500 million share repurchase program. Within the next week or so, we intend to enter into an accelerated share repurchase agreement with a financial institution to repurchase $100 million of our stock. Over the course of the year, we expect to purchase at least another $25 million. For certain, we will be disciplined in our capital allocation. We will continue to invest in the business in order to sustain its cash-generating ability, return cash to shareholders and modestly delever over time. 
Thank you for your attention. Let me now turn the call back over to Al in order to wrap up."

The path that we have been on for the last 2 years or 3 years continues into 2015. We will maintain many of the same priorities, such as strengthening our manufacturing capabilities and reducing costs. And as you heard, we will be making some adjustments to our capital allocation process. We will also continue to focus on the CEO succession process. 
Our Board of Directors has always viewed CEO succession as one of their most critical responsibilities. We launched a robust and detailed process several years ago. Internal succession candidates were identified and given expanded responsibilities. And external candidates were hired into key leadership roles. External firms were hired to help assess, track and coach all of the candidates with late 2014 targeted as the time in which a decision would be made whether to proceed with a candidate. 
In December of last year, the board determined that we did indeed have a strong internal candidate in Andres Lopez. As the next planned step in the process, Andres was promoted to President of Glass Containers and Chief Operating Officer of O-I. Andres has proven himself as a strong and creative business leader with extensive knowledge of the industry and a deep understanding of manufacturing. After leading our South American operations to record volumes over a 5-year period, Andres assumed responsibility for the North American operations in the fall of 2014. He has shaped and reinvigorated that business already and will hand over the reins of North America to a new leader soon. Andres is now working to more deeply familiarize himself with our businesses in Europe and Asia Pacific. We're anticipating that we will complete this CEO transition process by the end of 2015. In and around that time, I expect the new CEO will update the investment community on the company's long-term plans and its related financial targets.
With regard to my role as Chairman of the Board, I intend to relinquish that role at our Annual Meeting in May 2016, at which time a nonexecutive chairperson will be chosen by the board. Our board has clearly defined the company's expectations of succession, and I look forward to working with my team to ensure a smooth and orderly transition during the process.
Now before we take your questions, let's turn to Page 16, where I would like to summarize our outlook. Local market conditions and demand will remain largely unchanged. Of course, while this means ongoing competitive pressure in certain areas, our volumes stand to benefit from the long-term contracts we've locked in with most of our multinational partners. Our cost structure will improve through our restructuring activities, asset optimization, improved logistics and operating models. Nonoperational items are also in good shape. Interest expense will be lower and pension expenses flat in the face of lower discount rates. Our cash flow generation will remain strong in local currency terms. Of course, the stronger U.S. dollar will affect our reported results, yet we are focused on improving our underlying business to deliver value for the long term. And lastly, as stewards of our owners' investments, we are acting now to increase our share buybacks yet preserving the flexibility to invest in value-added opportunities.
Thank you. And now I will ask Beth to open up the lines for your questions."

But what we have been seeing so far is clearly a lot of push to move volume of mega beer despite changing trends in the marketplace. And the best way to move volume is, of course, to move volume through supermarkets through large volume offerings. And typically, cans, of course, are better suited for that type of offering. And that is, I believe, some of the emphasis that we've seen over the last 1.5 years or last 2 years. Generally, expectations would be, if consumption picks up a little bit, that the brewers would tend to favor the more premium beer brands again. And that's where you see a higher percentage of glass. So we've gone through these cycles before in the past. It's very difficult to predict how long they will last. But I think also we have seen a significant offset to our sales and continually increasing double-digit growth in the sales to the microbrewers."

Less than half of the European business is under long-term contracts, probably closer to 30%, 35%. The majority of the Asia Pacific business, certainly in Oceania, is under long-term contracts, which have all been agreed to. And our largest customers in South America are long-term contracts.

But I believe also what we're seeing with the currency going down, and I just saw this morning the Australian Reserve Bank reduce their rates, and so the currency is now at $0.76 or $0.77, I believe the Australian business starts to become more competitive again. And having a local position in Australia as well as in New Zealand by extension I think makes a lot of sense. And also the focus that we have in Southeast Asia through joint ventures, I think, is a good position. Where we have made a correction, as you very well know, is in China. I think that was a bridge too early for us to cross. And we have taken the steps to correct that situation."

But if we really bring it down to the more critical issues, it was to fundamentally understand the dynamics of this business and to have a very solid manufacturing background in general because, as you know, this is a very high, fixed cost-oriented business. The other parts that were extremely important is to have courage, to have the courage of a difference of opinion, to have the courage of moving other people along. And that the individual would have a very high level of attention to talent development, to make sure that the individuals that eventually are in the organization and in responsible roles can move up without a lot of lead time and be ready to take on additional responsibilities. I believe that beyond that, of course, it also was very important that a leader was able to learn and keep on learning and adjusting their strategy and their approaches to changing market conditions, to changing environments. And I believe all of that comes very well together in Andres. And I think also the track record, of course, was an important aspect. And we have seen now over quite a number of years, 6 or so years, how that has developed and how many innovations Andres has brought into his businesses in Latin America that eventually find their duplication in other regions of the world as well. So I think clearly a very broad range of capabilities but a very strong focus on particularly this business and understanding this business."

Whether the joint venture ultimately project-finances itself is something that we will obviously, in conjunction with Constellation, be talking about. But I think our ideal scenario for both partners is that the project becomes self-financing to a large extent, right? There is an operating furnace there now. There will be 2 operating furnaces early in 2016. Those furnaces are generating revenue. And so while our guidance assumes there's no self-financing aspect of it, certainly beyond 2015, that would be the ideal scenario for us."

I believe, clearly what's going to make a huge difference is the general economy and the general economic environment. As you know very well, certainly in 2008, 2009, all the way to 2011 and '12, North America had a significant impact in consumption because of the financial crisis and eventually, economic crisis. I think Europe is going through the same phase with a 2- to 3-year time delay behind it. That has had a significant impact on demand. And as you know from our discussions in the past, a 1% variance in demand has a significant impact. Typically, it's around, what, $40 million of profit contribution. So I believe if we are going to see some general economic confidence returning into the marketplace, then the battle that we've been fighting to hold on to our volume will be alleviated, will be getting some support from demand profiles and that will have a significant impact. The other part that we've been working on for quite a number of years is in research and development, to get to a different process of manufacturing glass and to get to a much lower-cost manufacturing approach as we go forward. That's still a couple of years down the road, but we are already at this point in time taking lessons that we've learned and putting it in place in facilities. We just opened a facility in Jarvakandi in Estonia, which is using some of those insights. We'll have another plant coming onstream in, I think, April or May of this year in Italy. So I believe we are going to get some benefit in the margin and margin expansion as well from technology and technology improvements, aside from the overall demand profile improving with the general economic environment improving."

I'd like to start today with a brief summary of our 2014 results and performance and touch on our expectations for 2015. Europe and South America delivered solid results for the year and we achieved our second highest cash flow in company history at $329 million. Like every other U.S.-based global company, our final results were negatively impacted by the strong U.S. dollar. As an example, we experienced a $40 million headwind to free cash flow in the year. On a constant currency basis, free cash flow would have been closer to $370 million, higher than the target we established a year ago.
Our adjusted EPS for the year was $2.63, modestly lower than 2013. This reflects our strong performance in Europe and South America and disappointing performance in North America and Asia Pacific. The underlying demand pattern in the first half of the year was in line with our projections going into 2014. During the third quarter, however, we perceived a considerable gap between actual volume and our expectations, plus the dollar began to strengthen. And we shared this with you in September. On the whole, 2014 was still a strong year for O-I financially, nearly record cash flow, stronger balance sheet and disciplined capital allocation.
Our higher level of financial flexibility was illustrated in 2014 when we used capital to invest for growth in a joint venture with Constellation Brands to supply glass for well-known Mexican beer brands that are exported to the United States. These include the Corona, Modelo and Pacifico brands. We also signed a separate long-term agreement with Constellation to supply additional bottles. These agreements are great examples of strategic partnerships with our customers and allow us to participate in growing segments in the U.S. This is possible due to O-I's unique capabilities as the only truly global class provider.
On Slide 3, I'll provide a bit more detail about business performance in each region. Profits in Europe improved in 2014 despite a sluggish macro environment. We are clearly benefiting from our ongoing asset optimization program, which delivered an expected $25 million of incremental cost savings in 2014. In addition, we continued to strengthen our position in the wine and beer segments. I'm happy to report that our most senior commercial leader in Europe, Vitaliano Torno, has succeeded Erik Bouts as the Managing Director of O-I Europe. As one of the architects of our market-oriented structure in Europe, Vitaliano provides the continuity we need to keep our European operations strongly moving forward. 
In South America, operating profit margins climbed back to 20%, driven by overall volume growth of 4%, including record volumes in Brazil. Our results were boosted by the anticipated recovery in the Andean countries. Currency headwinds dampened operating profit margin in the region but were essentially offset by considerable productivity improvements. 
North America and Asia Pacific were less profitable year-on-year due to a number of challenges we identified earlier in the year and are working diligently to address. In North America, sales volumes were down 2%, largely driven by the ongoing decline in the sales of mega beer packaged in glass. Our difficulties in the region started in the beginning of the year with weather-induced supply chain challenges. And we ended the year by curtailing production to adjust for demand expectations that did not manifest during the peak season.
In Asia Pacific, our financial performance was impacted by lower sales and production volume. Sales volume in China was about half of that of the prior year in line with our deliberate actions to scale back our presence there. In addition, Australian volumes were down double digits, driven by continued weakness in the domestic beer and wine export markets. On the upside, we are well positioned in Southeast Asia to take advantage of ongoing growth opportunities there. Our management team in Asia Pacific has responded to the macroeconomic environment aggressively, so we expect the region to stabilize and increase its profitability in 2015. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve to review our financial performance in more detail. Steve?"

Before discussing any specifics, I'd like to make a general comment on currency. Given the well-documented strengthening of the U.S. dollar recently, combined with the fact that 75% of our business resides outside of United States, we will present financial information this morning on a constant currency basis, that is, using the prior year's currency rates. Our intent is to allow greater visibility into the actual underlying business performance and trends. I hope this facilitates a clearer understanding for investors generally.
Now turning to Slide 4. In the fourth quarter of 2014, sales on a constant currency basis declined as price increases were more than offset by a decline in volume. Please be cognizant, however, that much of the volume decline compared with prior year fourth quarter was driven by the footprint adjustments we consciously and proactively made in China, where we took out 3 facilities versus the prior year period. The strengthening dollar started to significantly take its toll on the top line in the fourth quarter, ultimately causing an approximate 6% decline in sales. In line with expectations, however, segment operating profit contracted only modestly. Price increases tracked in line with inflation of $23 million, which is consistent with the trends seen in the prior 2 quarters. On the whole, our cost-containment efforts more than offset the impact of production curtailments. Lower sales volumes and currency rates were clear headwinds.
Turning to adjusted EPS on Slide 5. You will see that while there are various influencing factors, 80% of the decline in profitability in the fourth quarter was due to currency. Moving to the full year adjusted EPS on the right, note the correlation between fourth quarter and full year impacts with modestly unfavorable segment and tax results, offset by better corporate and interest expense. The one exception is currency, where you may have expected a larger full year impact. Because the U.S. dollar only really began to quickly strengthen in the back half of the year, the currency impact in Europe, specifically on profitability, was essentially flat for the full year.
Let me shift my comments to GAAP earnings per share for the moment, highlighting the items considered not to be representative of ongoing operations, which you can find enumerated in our earnings press release. The annual evaluation of our asbestos-related liability resulted in a $135 million charge in the fourth quarter. This is $10 million less than the prior year's charge and is entirely consistent with the underlying trends we have been experiencing for several years. Asbestos remains a gradually declining, though still significant, liability for the company. We also recorded pretax charges of $92 million in the fourth quarter. These charges were primarily from our refinancing activity during the quarter plus a noncash charge for pension liability reduction actions in the United States and Europe, both of which we have been expecting and have previously communicated.
On Slide 6, we provide a snapshot of our financial performance for the year. In line with our owners' priorities, we remain clearly focused on generating free cash flow. In local currency, we've seen growth for several years. In fact, as we've said before, we expected record free cash flow in local currency in 2014. And that's exactly what we delivered. Said differently, had we not experienced such strong currency headwinds in late 2014, we would have exceeded the $350 million in free cash flow that we guided to at this time last year.
We have been, I believe, quite transparent about how we allocate our cash and the logic underpinning our allocation priorities. Of our approximately $700 million in cash flow from operations, a bit over half is directed to maintaining and enhancing our manufacturing assets. To date, we have used the remaining cash, what we call our free cash flow, in a balanced way for antidilutive share repurchases, net debt reduction and, in 2014, for modest nonorganic growth investments via the CBI joint venture. As such, we continue to make progress reducing our leverage ratio, which stood at 2.4x net debt to EBITDA at year-end 2014. Please note that the weakening euro provided half of the 0.2 year-on-year improvement in the ratio. Otherwise, we would have achieved our expected year-end target of 2.5x.
Moving to last graph. You can see that our return on invested capital has been consistent for several years and well above our cost of capital. Going forward, we anticipate gradual improvement in returns via the elimination of low-return businesses in China and the addition of value-added investments, such as our joint venture in Mexico.
Let me now spend a few minutes with our 2015 business outlook on Slide 7. Overall, we continue to expect fairly stable local market environments in 2015 as our base-case scenario. In Europe, the asset optimization program is enabling improved productivity, especially at plants in which investments have been made. In line with our original expectations, the programs should deliver an incremental $25 million in cost savings for the full year. Competitive pressures, particularly in the wine segment in Southern Europe, will partially offset the benefit of these cost reductions.
In North America, we anticipate a similar environment with a gradual dissipation of the mega beer demand slowdown. We have not incorporated any upside in our base-case scenario from the North American consumers' potential higher discretionary income emanating from lower gasoline and energy costs. Although it's too soon to tell, we are certainly hopeful for a positive impact. We fully expect our business to recover from the supply chain and production problems that impeded 2014 results.
In South America, we expect the growth will pause in 2015 after record volume levels were achieved in 2014. We also anticipate reduced production volume in the Andean countries due to lower buffer stock requirements from Brazil and the United States. We do see some inflation pressure in the region that will likely take time for the market to fully absorb. For instance, electricity costs in Brazil are increasing substantially as has been referenced by other companies doing business in the region. And global commodities that are heavily influenced by U.S. dollar movements, such as soda ash, will certainly be more expensive in 2015.
Turning now to Asia Pacific. By the end of the second quarter, we expect to lap the sales decline attributed to our early 2014 retrenchment in China. In Oceania, we expect essentially stable demand, albeit at today's relatively low historical levels. On balance though, our actions to regain beer business, market share and restructure assets in Australia are expected to more than compensate for the sales and production declines we project for the first half of the year. In other words, the second half should be better year-on-year than the first half. For the company overall, we expect higher segment operating profit for 2015 on a constant currency basis, driven primarily by productivity gains in North America and continued asset optimization benefits in Europe.
Moving now to Slide 8. In 2015, we will incur the brunt of the strong U.S. dollar on full year earnings. We have updated our currency expectations here since our last communication in December as the U.S. dollar continues to strengthen, particularly against the euro. Clearly, the volatility is not over with the U.S. dollar index just reaching another approximately 12-year high late last week. Currency rates are expected to reduce translated sales by nearly 10% in 2015.
As it relates to segment operating profit, in early December, we calculated the adverse year-on-year impact of currency at roughly $50 million. Using current rates with the key currencies listed on this slide, it is now double that amount. This includes the decoupling of the Swiss franc from the euro, which happened in mid-January. With the cost structure of our Switzerland-based headquarters largely denominated in Swiss francs for our EU business, our European region now faces an incremental $10 million to $15 million headwind from this change alone.
As our budget process for 2015 is now behind us, we can also see more clearly the impact of currency on local inflation expectations. In particular, the price of certain raw materials, such as soda ash, are de facto based on U.S. dollar pricing. This has led to an approximate $20 million headwind that will manifest itself in lower segment operating earnings, particularly in South America but also partially in Asia Pacific. For long-term contracts with price adjustment formulas we will ultimately recover this, albeit with a 1-year lag. Even though our local production and sourcing business model, our non-U.S. debt and modest medium-term euro hedging program mitigate significant amounts of currency risk, we still envision that foreign exchange will negatively impact earnings per share by approximately $0.40 at this time. Given the sensitivity and magnitude of currency movements on our reported earnings, we will continue to provide timely updates to the investment community as needed with revised expectations of currencies' impact on our consolidated results.
Turning to our nonoperational performance on Slide 9 now. Corporate expense ought to be on par with that of 2014. Pension expense, which I will discuss on the next slide, is roughly flat with prior year. And this is a clear improvement over our earlier expectations. While we will continue to invest in research and development and technology, I expect any increases there will be offset by cost containment elsewhere. With regard to interest expense, we will benefit from debt refinancing and lower overall leverage levels. And finally, our tax rate is still projected to be in the range of 23% to 25%.
Let me now turn to pension on Slide 10, where there have been many moving pieces. First of all, I'm pleased to say that the final impacts of lower discount rates and the adoption of new mortality tables in the United States were not as severe as we had feared. This is exclusively attributable to the aggressive actions we took to deal with the real economic liabilities within our pension plans. These actions have allowed us to reduce our pension liability by $750 million since 2012, we took a major step forward in 2014 when we were able to reduce our economic liability by approximately $600 million. We achieved this by closing all major plans and converting them, with one exception, to defined contribution plans, most recently for salaried North American employees; by completing the buyouts of nearly all term-vested participants in the United States; and by effectively annuitizing the pension in the Netherlands, where we merged our plan into a national multicompany fund. This transferred assets and liabilities completely off of our books. 
On the asset side, we have consciously channeled approximately $225 million in discretionary funds to our pension plans over the past several years. In addition to being accretive to earnings, these payments have eliminated the need for us to contribute to our U.S. pensions, which are our largest for the foreseeable future. In all, we now expect pension expense to be essentially flat in 2015 and pension cash contributions to be approximately $10 million lower than in 2014. In light of a global reduction of rates, anywhere between 75 to 100 basis points during the year, plus the implementation of actuarial tables, which broadly increased longevity assumptions for retiree mortality in the United States, flat pension expense is a tremendous outcome for the company.
After thoroughly examining the various pros and cons of accounting methods for pension plans, the company intends to maintain its current accounting methodology. As a rule, we tried to avoid changing our accounting practices if the changes would not reflect an underlying change in actual economics. However, as with all significant accounting assumptions and estimates, we will continue to assess this practice on an ongoing basis. I do believe it is important, however, to continue to be very clear as to the impact of noncash, nonservice-related charges in GAAP pension accounting on the company's results. Amortization of historical actuarial losses, for instance, do not reflect day-to-day operations nor do they have any relationship to cash funding requirements. Yet if you back out this single item, our earnings would be approximately $0.50 higher per share, which is almost 20% of our adjusted earnings.
On Slide 11, I'd like to bring together the key pieces of our earnings outlook. As I indicated earlier, on a constant currency basis, we see improved operational and nonoperational performance. Allowing for our normal lack of prescience 12 months into the future, adjusted earnings would be $2.60 to $3 on a constant currency basis per share. The midpoint of this range suggests an underlying earnings growth rate of approximately 5% to 6%. But of course and unfortunately, we must take into consideration the strong U.S. dollar, which as mentioned before, we estimate will provide about a $0.40 headwind at this time. That brings us back to an adjusted EPS range of $2.20 to $2.60. Keep in mind that we believe the core business is quite stable, and we're not anticipating any fundamental shifts in volumes or price-cost spread, which have been key sources of historical volatility in our business.
Moving to Slide 12. Given our full year outlook and recognizing sales and production patterns in 2014, it should come as no surprise that we expect that the first quarter of 2015 will be down year-on-year, followed by improving performance later in the year. Let me step through the regions, first, on a constant currency basis. In Europe, the results are expected to be considerably lower due to project timing in the asset optimization program, which will temporarily reduce production volume and increase cost during the quarter. There will also be sharpening competitive pressures, as I mentioned before, in the wine segment in Southern Europe.
In North America, we expect to see a $15 million benefit in logistics costs. This will partially be offset by lower beer sales. In South America, profits will be dampened by inflation induced by the impact of local currency devaluation on U.S. dollar-priced raw materials and some major local issues, such as the spike in electricity costs in Brazil. We will also face difficult comparables in the first half of the year in Brazil due to the volume uptick related to the World Cup in 2014. Asia Pacific is likely to be flat as the actions to right-size production with sales volumes take hold. The impact from currency in the quarter is expected to be approximately $0.07, maybe $0.08, mainly reflected in Europe and South America. In all, adjusted earnings should be in the range of $0.40 to $0.45.
Summarizing the delta from prior year first quarter. Close to 40% is currency-related, 40% is related to sales and production volumes as well as project timing and most of the remainder is due to the higher expected tax rate of 4% to 5% we will see in the quarter.
Let's turn back to the full year with a more detailed look at free cash flow on Slide 13. In short, we expect to generate $300 million in free cash flow again in 2015. We've already mentioned improved operating profit in local currency terms. The year-on-year impact of foreign exchange on cash flows will be substantially lower than on earnings because we typically generate our cash flow in the latter half of the year. Because the stronger dollar already significantly impacted 2014 cash flows, its impact in 2015 should be less pronounced. Working capital has been a source of cash for the past few years. But in the coming year, we expect it to be balanced, neither a source nor a use of cash. Payments for asbestos and pension together are expected to be $15 million to $20 million lower. Together, capital spending and restructuring should approximate our 2014 spending levels, which is approximately equal to the total of depreciation and amortization.
Cash flow is expected to benefit from a lack of several outlays that we've made consistently over the past few years, such as for abnormally high returnable packaging levels and payments related to a nonincome tax matter. When we put all the pieces together, we expect free cash flow to be $300 million. You can be certain that we will continue to focus on cash generation and that we will continue to prudently deploy the cash we earn in a value-added way, as I would like to discuss on Slide 14.
We will continue to invest over half of our cash from operations into CapEx in order to maintain and rebuild our assets as well as to enhance our productivity and improve our flexibility. As we have increased our cash flow in recent years, we have enhanced our financial flexibility and enabled ourselves to pursue value-added strategic investments. Even as we invest in the business, we remain disciplined in the allocation of cash to our capital providers. While we have focused on reducing debt in recent years, lower interest rates and the strength of our balance sheet have brought us to a significant inflection point with respect to capital allocation, namely as we have been consistently foreshadowing, we are poised to return more cash to our shareholders in 2015. 
We have regularly discussed with our Board of Directors and have solicited input from both investors and advisers on the best way to do this without compromising our financial flexibility. As we consider our debt and asbestos obligations as well as opportunistic nonorganic growth investment commitments, we strongly prefer the flexibility of share repurchase at this time versus other legitimate alternatives, such as a dividend. Our board has recently authorized a $500 million share repurchase program. Within the next week or so, we intend to enter into an accelerated share repurchase agreement with a financial institution to repurchase $100 million of our stock. Over the course of the year, we expect to purchase at least another $25 million. For certain, we will be disciplined in our capital allocation. We will continue to invest in the business in order to sustain its cash-generating ability, return cash to shareholders and modestly delever over time. 
Thank you for your attention. Let me now turn the call back over to Al in order to wrap up."

The path that we have been on for the last 2 years or 3 years continues into 2015. We will maintain many of the same priorities, such as strengthening our manufacturing capabilities and reducing costs. And as you heard, we will be making some adjustments to our capital allocation process. We will also continue to focus on the CEO succession process. 
Our Board of Directors has always viewed CEO succession as one of their most critical responsibilities. We launched a robust and detailed process several years ago. Internal succession candidates were identified and given expanded responsibilities. And external candidates were hired into key leadership roles. External firms were hired to help assess, track and coach all of the candidates with late 2014 targeted as the time in which a decision would be made whether to proceed with a candidate. 
In December of last year, the board determined that we did indeed have a strong internal candidate in Andres Lopez. As the next planned step in the process, Andres was promoted to President of Glass Containers and Chief Operating Officer of O-I. Andres has proven himself as a strong and creative business leader with extensive knowledge of the industry and a deep understanding of manufacturing. After leading our South American operations to record volumes over a 5-year period, Andres assumed responsibility for the North American operations in the fall of 2014. He has shaped and reinvigorated that business already and will hand over the reins of North America to a new leader soon. Andres is now working to more deeply familiarize himself with our businesses in Europe and Asia Pacific. We're anticipating that we will complete this CEO transition process by the end of 2015. In and around that time, I expect the new CEO will update the investment community on the company's long-term plans and its related financial targets.
With regard to my role as Chairman of the Board, I intend to relinquish that role at our Annual Meeting in May 2016, at which time a nonexecutive chairperson will be chosen by the board. Our board has clearly defined the company's expectations of succession, and I look forward to working with my team to ensure a smooth and orderly transition during the process.
Now before we take your questions, let's turn to Page 16, where I would like to summarize our outlook. Local market conditions and demand will remain largely unchanged. Of course, while this means ongoing competitive pressure in certain areas, our volumes stand to benefit from the long-term contracts we've locked in with most of our multinational partners. Our cost structure will improve through our restructuring activities, asset optimization, improved logistics and operating models. Nonoperational items are also in good shape. Interest expense will be lower and pension expenses flat in the face of lower discount rates. Our cash flow generation will remain strong in local currency terms. Of course, the stronger U.S. dollar will affect our reported results, yet we are focused on improving our underlying business to deliver value for the long term. And lastly, as stewards of our owners' investments, we are acting now to increase our share buybacks yet preserving the flexibility to invest in value-added opportunities.
Thank you. And now I will ask Beth to open up the lines for your questions."

And that is, I believe, some of the emphasis that we've seen over the last 1.5 years or last 2 years. Generally, expectations would be, if consumption picks up a little bit, that the brewers would tend to favor the more premium beer brands again. And that's where you see a higher percentage of glass. So we've gone through these cycles before in the past. It's very difficult to predict how long they will last.

We will also have more production offline in North America for some continuation of the inventory control actions that had impacted the fourth quarter.

And then on some of the volume -- part of our volume headwind in the first quarter in North America is a comparability issue, where we are lapping the rollouts of blue and black glass, where we benefited from them in the first quarter of North America in '14, which gave us a stronger-than-market performance in that quarter. Those are rolling off, and now we're looking at a weaker-than-market performance on the volume side in North America as well."

But I believe also what we're seeing with the currency going down, and I just saw this morning the Australian Reserve Bank reduce their rates, and so the currency is now at $0.76 or $0.77, I believe the Australian business starts to become more competitive again. And having a local position in Australia and as well as in New Zealand by extension I think makes a lot of sense. And also the focus that we have in Southeast Asia through joint ventures, I think, is a good position. Where we have made a correction, as you very well know, is in China.

And that the individual would have a very high level of attention to talent development, to make sure that the individuals that eventually are in the organization and in responsible roles can move up without a lot of lead time and be ready to take on additional responsibilities. I believe that beyond that, of course, it also was very important that a leader was able to learn and keep on learning and adjusting their strategy and their approaches to changing market conditions, to changing environments. And I believe all of that comes very well together in Andres. And I think also the track record, of course, was an important aspect. And we have seen now over quite a number of years, 6 or so years, how that has developed and how many innovations Andres has brought into his businesses in Latin America that eventually find their duplication in other regions of the world as well.

I believe, clearly what's going to make a huge difference is the general economy and the general economic environment. As you know very well, certainly in 2008, 2009, all the way to 2011 and '12, North America had a significant impact in consumption because of the financial crisis and eventually, economic crisis. I think Europe is going through the same phase with a 2- to 3-year time delay behind it. That has had a significant impact on demand. And as you know from our discussions in the past, a 1% variance in demand has a significant impact. Typically, it's around, what, $40 million of profit contribution. So I believe if we are going to see some general economic confidence returning into the marketplace, then the battle that we've been fighting to hold on to our volume will be alleviated, will be getting some support from demand profiles and that will have a significant impact. The other part that we've been working on for quite a number of years is in research and development, to get to a different process of manufacturing glass and to get to a much lower-cost manufacturing approach as we go forward. That's still a couple of years down the road, but we are already at this point in time taking lessons that we've learned and putting it in place in facilities. We just opened a facility in Jarvakandi in Estonia, which is using some of those insights. We'll have another plant coming on stream in, I think, April or May of this year in Italy. So I believe we are going to get some benefit in the margin and margin expansion as well from technology and technology improvements, aside from the overall demand profile improving with the general economic environment improving."

Our results in the first quarter were in line with our guidance despite the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar beyond our initial projections. Our EPS for the quarter was $0.44. This is $0.18 below the first quar",1094,"Thank you, Dave, and good morning. Our results in the first quarter were in line with our guidance despite the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar beyond our initial projections. Our EPS for the quarter was $0.44. This is $0.18 below the first quarter of 2014, yet the decline was $0.06 on a constant currency basis.
Our results reflect the lower sales and production volume that we had anticipated. Shipments were down about 2.5% globally, 1 percentage point is attributed to our China retrenchment and the remainder was driven by beer, which faced a difficult comparison with high volumes associated with World Cup demand in 2014. Shipments of all other categories combined were on par with the prior year. Production volume was down more than sales, primarily due to a relatively heavy furnace rebuild schedule.
Turning to segment performance and leaving aside currency headwinds, North and South America performed well in the quarter, south America through price gains and operational efficiencies and North America with improved supply chain performance following last year's very challenging winter conditions. In Asia Pacific, the benefits of last year's footprint restructuring largely offset lower sales and production volumes. Coming off a strong 2014, Europe has had a challenging start to this year. While production volumes were markedly lower as expected, price pressure has been greater than we had anticipated. Our attention to nonoperational cost-reduction delivered strong results in the quarter, though through lower pension and interest expense.
We continue to manage our capital structure and allocation. In line with our commitments, we launched a $100 million accelerated stock repurchase program in February and anticipate another $25 million to be allotted for repurchases through the remainder of the year.
Also, we renegotiated our bank credit agreement in April. This transaction significantly enhances our financial flexibility by extending our debt maturity horizon and enables further refinancing to reduce future interest expense.
I'd like to provide a bit more detail on each of the regions in the next 2 slides, beginning with our largest region --  regions, Europe and North America.
Our segment profit in Europe was down considerably from the prior year. About 1/2 of this decline can be attributed to the stronger U.S. dollar, which negatively impacted results by 22%. Profits were also impacted by lower price and higher production downtime. Shipments were nearly on a par with prior year. Our wine volumes were weak relative to the double-digit growth experienced in the same quarter last year. However, spirits demand stabilized and food volumes increased. Beer was off by less than 3%. A respectable result in light of last year's double-digit volume growth leading up to the World Cup.
Selling prices were lower driven by 2 factors. First, we entered into a number of long-term contracts mainly in beer to lock up attractive business that will secure market share and allow us to participate in market growth over time. At this early stage, we are seeing the impact of pricing associated with the contracts. However, securing more volume will drive improved operating leverage and make up for the lower prices, which is consistent with our asset optimization strategy.
The second factor impacting price was the more intense competitive price pressures being experienced in Southern Europe, which we believe to be of temporary nature and mainly driven by uncertainties surrounding the sale of a major competitor. Construction activities and their related operational impact accounted for more than 1/2 of Europe's lower profit in constant currency. We expected more production downtime in Europe in the first half of the year due to a frontloaded furnace rebuild schedule. Production was also impacted by several complex projects associated with the final phase of the asset optimization program. In some cases, new capabilities and technologies were introduced, which require some ramp-up time before we can achieve high utilization rates. While these factors impact earnings in the short-term, they will yield benefits in the long run.
North America managed its business well in the quarter. Smooth running supply chain operations added at least $10 million to segment profit, an improvement over the high costs associated with weather-induced logistic challenges last year. This was partially offset by the 1.5% decline in sales volume, largely reflecting the continued decline of the major domestic beer brands.
In February, we purchased a single furnace glass plant in Kalama, Washington, which has a state-of-the-art gas oxy furnace built in 2012. The plant primarily serves the West Coast wine market as well as craft beer, both growing markets with which we are actively engaged. The plant gives us some needed capacity in wine and it will allow additional flexibility across our North American production network.
Turning to Slide 4. South America was severely impacted by currency and inflation. Segment operating profit dropped more than 25%, entirely due to currency translation. Likewise, soda ash purchases in the region were impacted by local currency devaluation because prices are effectively set in U.S. dollars. If we back this out, South America's underlying operating performance improved over the prior year. Although business in the Andean region was quite stable, the macro economic environment in Brazil continues to present challenges. For instance, electricity rates have doubled and additional tariffs are in the works. Due to the strong comparable period, we had a small dip in South American volumes in the quarter year-over-year, but the region performed better than projected by offsetting rising inflation with price adjustments. Although productivity in South America improved, we have reduced production in Colombia because of lower exports to the U.S. and Brazil, as noted in our previous earnings call.
Asia Pacific's performance was in line with expectations. The strong U.S. dollar accounted for nearly all of the operating profit reduction. Results declined about $2 million from the prior year quarter on a constant basis.
Shipments were down in the quarter by about 15%, but 3/4 of that is attributed to our deliberate shutdowns in China last year. The China retrenchment is now nearly complete and the comparables will begin lapping in the second quarter.
In Australia, it appears that the wine and beer markets are stabilizing, albeit on a lower year-on-year level. In particular, we may be seeing early signs of an uptick in wine export as a result of the lower value of the Australian dollar. In all, lower sales and production volumes were almost fully offset by the restructuring actions we took in late 2014 to balance local supply and demand in Australia.
With that, I'll turn the call over to John to review our financial performance in more detail."

Due to the very strong impact of foreign currency translation, we are again showing prior year results on a constant currency basis. We believe this provides a clear picture of our underlying performance.
In the first quarter of 2015, sales were $1.4 billion, which was 14% lower than prior year. You can see that nearly 90% of the decline, almost $200 million, is attributed to the stronger U.S. dollar.
Price increases, about 1% overall, were more than offset by lower sales volume. As you can see on the right, our segment operating profit was $168 million, down from $208 million in the prior year. Like sales, most of the decline was currency-driven. On a constant currency basis, the decline in profit was more modest. On the upside, global price increases covered cost inflation, which included the currency-related pressure from U.S. dollar-priced raw materials. The margin impact on sales volume carries over from the top line and lower production, including the impact of greater furnace rebuild activity, weighed on results. We rebuilt 5 furnaces in the first quarter of 2015 compared to just 2 furnaces in the prior year quarter.
Turning to earnings on Slide 6. First quarter EPS was $0.44, which compares to $0.50 in the prior year quarter in constant currency. You can see the $0.07 headwind from segment operating profit that I just reviewed. The net of nonoperational items added $0.01 to our EPS. Corporate cost and interest expense were both favorable. Our effective tax rate was a bit higher in the quarter compared to a lower 2014 tax rate, which benefited from a few discrete items that did not repeat. Accordingly, our guidance for the full year 2015 tax rate is still expected to be between 23% and 25%. And lastly, the $100 million share repurchase program we launched mid-quarter reduced our share count and contributed about $0.01 to EPS.
On Slide 7, we illustrate the impact of mounting currency headwinds on earnings generated outside of the U.S., which accounts for nearly 3/4 of our sales volume. Based upon prevailing currency rates at our last earnings call, we anticipated a $0.40 annual EPS impact related to currency translation plus $0.09 of currency induced inflation on U.S. dollar-priced raw materials, especially in South America and Asia Pacific. Using March 31 currency rates, the annual impact has increased to almost $0.70. This represents a $0.20 incremental headwind compared with the full year 2015 earnings guidance we provided earlier this year.
On Slide 8, you can see the impact of currency movement on our projections. We are updating our annual adjusted earnings guidance range to between $2 even and $2.30 per share. This reflects the estimated $0.20 incremental currency headwind presented on the previous slide, and we have tightened the range slightly because of pricing pressures in Europe and continued weak trends in beer.
Note that the midpoint of our guidance range compares favorably to our 2014 results in constant currency. Overall, we expect our earnings in the second half of the year will exceed prior year levels and more than offset lower first half results, which were impacted by 5 additional furnace rebuilds compared to last year's activity. Maintenance activity in the second half of the year will be at more normalized levels.
Let me pause for a moment to touch on free cash flow generation. While we have not changed our target for cash flow in local currencies, we have reduced our annual free cash flow projection by $50 million. This adjustment solely reflects the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar. As a result, we expect 2015 free cash flow will approximate $250 million. Since we generate most of our cash in the fourth quarter, exchange rates in that quarter will have a significant impact on full year results.
Turning to Slide 9. Let me narrow the focus a bit to the second quarter outlook. Again, currency will be a strong headwind. We reported EPS of $0.80 per share last year. Based on March 31 rates, we anticipate translation will impact second quarter results by about 20%. This is similar to what we experienced in the first quarter of this year. Given a $0.17 currency adjustment, second quarter 2014 results in constant currency would be $0.63 per share. From this base, I will provide some directional guidance for each of our regions as well as for nonoperational items.
In Europe, underlying volume trends should remain stable, with some upside potential in beer if warm weather conditions prevail. We expect the previously mentioned competitive dynamics leading to modestly lower prices will continue. Operationally, we expect lower production in Europe, partially due to a continued greater level of furnace rebuild activity. As a result, we anticipate having between $5 million and $10 million of additional unabsorbed fixed cost and maintenance expense. However, those costs are temporary as we expect the benefit from higher production to serve increased demand in the back half of the year.
Europe's second quarter results will be impacted by another timing factor. In 2014, our European business received an energy rebate in the second quarter. We will again receive a credit in 2015, which should approximate $8 million. However, due to regulatory procedure, this year's rebate will be recognized during the third quarter.
In North America, second quarter results should be comparable to the prior year. The ongoing volume headwind in mega beer should be largely offset by better supply chain performance and increased productivity resulting from several organizational and process improvements.
In South America, we expect stable underlying business performance. That said, there is some uncertainty as to how weak macroeconomic conditions in Brazil may impact demand there. Our results in the region will be adversely impacted by having an entire quarter's worth of currency-induced inflation, which ramped up over the course of the first quarter. Also the region will not have the benefit of last year's $6 million sale of nonstrategic assets.
Asia Pacific's results should be essentially on par with prior year. Performance in the back half of the year is expected to improve due to increased sales and production volume associated with the major new beer contract. Plus there will be fewer furnace rebuilds in the second half of the year compared with the prior year.
We expect corporate items will be favorable compared to the prior year. Lower pension expense will reduce corporate costs, and net interest expense should be modestly down. Keep in mind that the $0.17 currency adjustment already noted includes the translation benefit from interest expense related to our non-U.S. dollar denominated debt. While we see no change in our annual tax rate, our second quarter rate should approximate 20%, which is lower than the prior year due to discrete tax items. Plus EPS should benefit by $0.01 from our share repurchase program. In all, adjusted earnings per share should be in the range of $0.55 to $0.60 in the second quarter. Note that the U.S. dollar has weakened a bit compared to March 31 rates. If current rates hold, currency pressures should be reduced by about $0.02 in the second quarter.
Setting currency aside, we expect modestly lower second quarter results compared to the prior year. However, this primarily reflects timing issues such as furnace rebuild activity. For reasons already noted, we expect financial results to strengthen in the second half of this year.
Now let me turn the call back to Al to wrap up."

Although we are clearly challenged by foreign currency exchange rates, the company is strong and profitable. We remain focused on the same priorities that have guided us in recent years while working to increase the benefit of some of the actions taken last year to advance our business. This includes expanding capacity at the joint venture with Constellation Brands in Mexico, integrating the Kalama plant into our North American footprint and taking full advantage of the capabilities we are building in our Innovation Center. We're pleased with our partnership with Constellation and the integration of Kalama has gone very well.
In 2015, we are working to achieve more stability in our operations overall, while we continue to build capabilities and reduce costs. Andres Lopez is actively engaging in all parts of the business globally in preparation for that CEO succession. The process is progressing well, and we intend to complete the transition by the end of this year.
Before I open the call for questions, I'm pleased to announce that we have issued our first ever global sustainability report. It's the first time we have captured our many sustainability activities in one place. The report covers our commitment to sustainability and the progress we are making against targets we have set to reduce energy use and emissions, also increase the amount of we use and of course eliminate safety incidents in the company. The report also serves as an excellent vehicle to demonstrate the terrific franchise this business represents in the packaging space as well as to tell the very strong environmental story behind glass. The report brings increased transparency to the company and will serve as a tool for change. We hope you will download the report from our website and learn more about these critical aspects of our business. Thank you, and I will now ask Shannon to open up the lines for your questions."

We started last year, around the middle of last year, to engage several of our larger customers because in Europe as you know, we typically tend to run to shorter-term contracts and we felt for stability in the business and to get the stable payoff for the investments that we're making in our restructuring in Europe. It was important to secure those larger volumes for a longer-term. So in the discussions with large brewers, we were able to get them to shift to a more longer-term perspective and secure those volumes for the company, and that did require some adjustments in the pricings that we had to make sure that our customers felt they had a good deal and, of course, we also had a good deal. Now, coming into this year, that of course we heard the announcement that was going to sell their business, and that created some uncertainty in the market because as you I think had seen last night from the reports that issued, they picked up some volume in the marketplace. And that really created some price pressure. Now the uncertainty in the market is the greatest in the first quarter because that's when the wine customers have some leverage because they don't have to fill yet. But that is now behind us and so we expect that the pricing trends in the remainder of the year will stabilize and be mitigated somewhat compared to what we saw in the first quarter."

We were recently in Australia and I think the latest reports that we're getting from the wine industry were certainly a little bit more confident about volumes because the decline in the Aussie dollar allows them again to reach the pricing points on the shelves economically. So I'd expect that trend-wise we're going to see some strengthening."

First of all, relative share loss, I think has been a trend that we've seen for quite a number of years. However, when we look at the overall volume evolution of our products, we see that even in Europe and in North America where the pressure has been the greatest, the volume still is relatively stable. So I think there are other underlying trends that help us to compensate for some of those specific issues that we see in certain markets. Now with regard to the mega beer in North America, I believe clearly there is a considerable trend change on the part of consumers that is impacting the overall volumes that go into the marketplace. And as a result, what we're seeing is large brewers are trying to move that volume still into the market with lower pricing points. And that favors cans. We would expect that if the economy improves and entrée consumption picks up that, that is going to change again and we've seen this happen in the past. Now with regard to what steps are we taking, you know that we have put more investments into those markets that are benefiting in the North American market, which is really the craft industry, the craft beer industry, as well as important products. That's why we did the deal with Constellation Brands. So I think we're taking the right steps to make sure that we are in the stronger parts of the beer segment overrepresented to mitigate some of these impacts that we have seen. Now with regard to Europe, what we are doing there is really to get to a much more competitive pricing base or cost base for our business. Now the main focus of course is that is related to other glass manufacturers and other glass providers in the marketplace. But certainly, it also is going to help in comparison to alternative packaging. Now when we see percentages of what can is doing in Europe, we also have to understand this is coming from a very low percentage of share, especially in the beer segment. And I believe when we put that into perspective, we also then will have to put into additional consideration that Europe is a returnable market, especially in Germany, it's a very strong returnable market. So for every 1 beer model, you would need 20 or 25 cans to replace that bottle in the marketplace. So that sometimes distorts the direct comparisons of units."

Let me first address our outlook in the most current adjustment and how we look at the current year, and then we can backtrack a little bit to what we said back in the Investor Day a couple of years ago.

So it's very comparable to the outlook that we are laying out right now for 2015. Likewise, if you take a look at our outlook that we provided in our guidance in the midpoint of the range as an illustration, we are pointing to earnings that are slightly better than the prior year in constant currency. So those seem pretty commiserate. Now one thing I would say is that last year we didn't have a benefit from working capital. We do get this point in time, we're not assuming a significant change in working capital, but we do have a few items that are moving in our favor this year that are different than what we saw last year. First of all, with the challenges we had in North America higher inventory levels, we had a higher packaging spend last year, and we think that's going to come down about $40 million. With the conclusion of our Italian VAT litigation we expect a refund in the neighborhood of $40 million.

Now when -- I believe we are looking at trends, we started in the first quarter of this year, January and February were weak, but then March started at much stronger and then that trend is continuing in April. Also some of the vibes that we are picking up from our various markets at least lead us to believe that the foundation of our business has become more solid, it's not as tenuous as it has been in the past.

There's 5 additional in the first half compared to the second half, as a rule of thumb of about $3 million impact plus or minus on this, you can see that's a pretty substantial impact on earnings on a period-over-period basis. Additionally, as we mentioned before, to truly get the value out of the asset optimization program, we really need to be able to have the additional production coming through, the furnace rebuilds schedule has to taper off. And so as we mentioned, that's about a $20 million, $25 million annual benefit. And let's not forget that $8 million energy credit, that is a timing issue between the first half and the second half.

And as we all know, Europe has been going through a couple of very difficult years economically, I would say generally. I've said this before, Europe is running about 3 years behind North America with regards to recovering from the financial and economic crises. I would say that as soon as demand is picking up a little bit in Europe, that 5% of overcapacity that exists in the market is no longer going to have a significant impact on the pricing activities, as we have seen in the past. So it's really a question of dynamics. It's not a question of a fundamental imbalance in supply and demand in the marketplace. And your second question was related to the long-term contracts. And in the long term contracts, we typically are talking about a 5-year commitment, 4 to 6 years is the range of the various contracts."

If I look at 2013, 2014, if I take China out of that comparison, the rest of the volume has remained flat, and we expect again this year our volume to be relatively stable with the exception again of the China situation. But I think what we are doing is clearly adjusting capacity to the reduced demand to maintain the balance in the marketplace. We will continue to do that also in the more mature markets as we look at this. And fortunately, we are not the only ones who look at this scenario. You know and I believe we mentioned it at the last call that we just had some significant capacity taken out of North America, which I think amounted to about 2% of the available capacity in the U.S. market by taking out a facility in New Jersey by one of our competitors.

I believe that we did see, in comparison again with last year, a different trend, last year was very strong, this year was weaker, so we were down about 7% or something in glass. But that was specifically for beer. On the other hand, we picked up considerable volume to -- in segments like non-alcoholic beverages, in carbonated soft drinks, which really helped us considerably in the overall balance of the marketplace. And then of course, in Latin America, from an overall perspective, the Andean region, again with soft drinks and non-alcoholic beverages helping significantly in the overall demand profile.

Our results in the first quarter were in line with our guidance despite the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar beyond our initial projections. Our EPS for the quarter was $0.44. This is $0.18 below the first quar",1094,"Thank you, Dave, and good morning. Our results in the first quarter were in line with our guidance despite the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar beyond our initial projections. Our EPS for the quarter was $0.44. This is $0.18 below the first quarter of 2014, yet the decline was $0.06 on a constant currency basis.
Our results reflect the lower sales and production volume that we had anticipated. Shipments were down about 2.5% globally. 1 percentage point is attributed to our China retrenchment, and the remainder was driven by beer, which faced a difficult comparison, with high volumes associated with World Cup demand in 2014. Shipments of all other categories combined were on par with the prior year. Production volume was down more than sales, primarily due to a relatively heavy furnace rebuild schedule.
Turning to segment performance and leaving aside currency headwinds, North and South America performed well in the quarter, South America through price gains and operational efficiencies and North America with improved supply chain performance following last year's very challenging winter conditions. In Asia Pacific, the benefits of last year's footprint restructuring largely offset lower sales and production volumes. Coming off a strong 2014, Europe has had a challenging start to this year. While production volumes were markedly lower as expected, price pressure has been greater than we had anticipated. Our attention to nonoperational cost reduction delivered strong results in the quarter, though through lower pension and interest expense.
We continue to manage our capital structure and allocation. In line with our commitments, we launched a $100 million accelerated stock repurchase program in February and anticipate another $25 million to be allotted for repurchases through the remainder of the year.
Also, we renegotiated our bank credit agreement in April. This transaction significantly enhances our financial flexibility by extending our debt maturity horizon and enables further refinancing to reduce future interest expense.
I'd like to provide a bit more detail on each of the regions in the next 2 slides, beginning with our largest region -- regions, Europe and North America. Our segment profit in Europe was down considerably from the prior year. About half of this decline can be attributed to the stronger U.S. dollar, which negatively impacted results by 22%. Profits were also impacted by lower price and higher production downtime. Shipments were nearly on par with the prior year. Our wine volumes were weak relative to the double-digit growth experienced in the same quarter last year. However, spirits demand stabilized, and food volumes increased. Beer was off by less than 3%, a respectable result in light of last year's double-digit volume growth leading up to the World Cup.
Selling prices were lower, driven by 2 factors. First, we entered into a number of long-term contracts mainly in beer to lock up attractive business that will secure market share and allow us to participate in market growth over time. At this early stage, we are seeing the impact of pricing associated with the contracts. However, securing more volume will drive improved operating leverage and make up for the lower prices, which is consistent with our asset optimization strategy.
The second factor impacting price was the more intense competitive price pressures being experienced in Southern Europe, which we believe to be of temporary nature and mainly driven by uncertainties surrounding the sale of a major competitor. Construction activities and their related operational impact accounted for more than half of Europe's lower profit in constant currency. We expected more production downtime in Europe in the first half of the year due to a front-loaded furnace rebuild schedule. Production was also impacted by several complex projects associated with the final phase of the asset optimization program. In some cases, new capabilities and technologies were introduced, which require some ramp-up time before we can achieve high utilization rates. While these factors impact earnings in the short term, they will yield benefits in the long run.
North America managed its business well in the quarter. Smooth-running supply chain operations added at least $10 million to segment profit, an improvement over the high costs associated with weather-induced logistics challenges last year. This was partially offset by the 1.5% decline in sales volume, largely reflecting the continued decline of the major domestic beer brands.
In February, we purchased a single furnace glass plant in Kalama, Washington, which has a state-of-the-art gas oxy furnace built in 2012. The plant primarily serves the West Coast wine market as well as craft beer, both growing markets with which we are actively engaged. The plant gives us some needed capacity in wine and will allow additional flexibility across our North American production network.
Turning to Slide 4. South America was severely impacted by currency and inflation. Segment operating profit dropped more than 25%, entirely due to currency translation. Likewise, soda ash purchases in the region were impacted by local currency devaluation because prices are effectively set in U.S. dollars. If we back this out, South America's underlying operating performance improved over the prior year. Although business in the Andean region was quite stable, the macroeconomic environment in Brazil continues to present challenges. For instance, electricity rates have doubled, and additional tariffs are in the works. Due to the strong comparable period, we had a small dip in South American volumes in the quarter year-over-year, but the region performed better than projected by offsetting rising inflation with price adjustments. Although productivity in South America improved, we have reduced production in Colombia because of lower exports to the U.S. and Brazil, as noted in our previous earnings call.
Asia Pacific's performance was in line with expectations. The strong U.S. dollar accounted for nearly all of the operating profit reduction. Results declined about $2 million from the prior year quarter on a constant basis. Shipments were down in the quarter by about 15%, but 3/4 of that is attributed to our deliberate shutdowns in China last year. The China retrenchment is now nearly complete, and the comparables will begin lapping in the second quarter.
In Australia, it appears that the wine and beer markets are stabilizing, albeit at a lower year-on-year level. In particular, we may be seeing early signs of an uptick in wine exports as a result of the lower value of the Australian dollar. In all, lower sales and production volumes were almost fully offset by the restructuring actions we took in late 2014 to balance local supply and demand in Australia.
With that, I will turn the call over to John to review our financial performance in more detail."

In the first quarter of 2015, sales were $1.4 billion, which was 14% lower than prior year. You can see that nearly 90% of the decline, almost $200 million, is attributed to the stronger U.S. dollar.
Price increases, about 1% overall, were more than offset by lower sales volume. As you can see on the right, our segment operating profit was $168 million, down from $208 million in the prior year. Like sales, most of the decline was currency-driven. On a constant currency basis, the decline in profit was more modest. On the upside, global price increases covered cost inflation, which included the currency-related pressure from U.S. dollar-priced raw materials. The margin impacts on sales volume carries over from the top line, and lower production, including the impact of greater furnace rebuild activity, weighed on results. We rebuilt 5 furnaces in the first quarter of 2015 compared to just 2 furnaces in the prior year quarter.
Turning to earnings on Slide 6. First quarter EPS was $0.44, which compares to $0.50 in the prior year quarter in constant currency. You can see the $0.07 headwind from segment operating profit that I just reviewed. The net of nonoperational items added $0.01 to our EPS. Corporate cost and interest expense were both favorable. Our effective tax rate was a bit higher in the quarter compared to a lower 2014 tax rate, which benefited from a few discrete items that did not repeat. Accordingly, our guidance for the full year 2015 tax rate is still expected to be between 23% and 25%. And lastly, the $100 million share repurchase program we launched mid-quarter reduced our share count and contributed about $0.01 to EPS.
On Slide 7, we illustrate the impact of mounting currency headwinds on earnings generated outside of the U.S., which accounts for nearly 3/4 of our sales volume. Based upon prevailing currency rates at our last earnings call, we anticipated a $0.40 annual EPS impact related to currency translation plus $0.09 of currency-induced inflation on U.S. dollar-priced raw materials, especially in South America and Asia Pacific. Using March 31 currency rates, the annual impact has increased to almost $0.70. This represents a $0.20 incremental headwind compared with the full year 2015 earnings guidance we provided earlier this year.
On Slide 8, you can see the impact of currency movement on our projections. We are updating our annual adjusted earnings guidance range to between $2 even and $2.30 per share. This reflects the estimated $0.20 incremental currency headwind presented on the previous slide. And we have tightened the range slightly because of pricing pressures in Europe and continued weak trends in beer. Note that the midpoint of our guidance range compares favorably to our 2014 results in constant currency. Overall, we expect our earnings in the second half of the year will exceed prior year levels and more than offset lower first half results, which were impacted by 5 additional furnace rebuilds compared to last year's activity. Maintenance activity in the second half of the year will be at more normalized levels.
Let me pause for a moment to touch on free cash flow generation. While we have not changed our target for cash flow in local currencies, we have reduced our annual free cash flow projection by $50 million. This adjustment solely reflects the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar. As a result, we expect 2015 free cash flow will approximate $250 million. Since we generate most of our cash in the fourth quarter, exchange rates in that quarter will have a significant impact on full year results.
Turning to Slide 9. Let me narrow the focus a bit to the second quarter outlook. Again, currency will be a strong headwind. We reported EPS of $0.80 per share last year. Based on March 31 rates, we anticipate translation will impact second quarter results by about 20%. This is similar to what we experienced in the first quarter of this year. Given a $0.17 currency adjustment, second quarter 2014 results in constant currency would be $0.63 per share. From this base, I will provide some directional guidance for each of our regions as well as for nonoperational items.
In Europe, underlying volume trends should remain stable, with some upside potential in beer if warm weather conditions prevail. We expect the previously mentioned competitive dynamics leading to modestly lower prices will continue. Operationally, we expect lower production in Europe, partially due to a continued greater level of furnace rebuild activity. As a result, we anticipate having between $5 million and $10 million of additional unabsorbed fixed cost and maintenance expense. However, those costs are temporary as we expect the benefit from higher production to serve increased demand in the back half of the year.
Europe's second quarter results will be impacted by another timing factor. In 2014, our European business received an energy rebate in the second quarter. We will again receive a credit in 2015, which should approximate $8 million. However, due to regulatory procedure, this year's rebate will be recognized during the third quarter.
In North America, second quarter results should be comparable to the prior year. The ongoing volume headwind in mega beer should be largely offset by better supply chain performance and increased productivity resulting from several organizational and process improvements.
In South America, we expect stable underlying business performance. That said, there is some uncertainty as to how weak macroeconomic conditions in Brazil may impact demand there. Our results in the region will be adversely impacted by having an entire quarter's worth of currency-induced inflation, which ramped up over the course of the first quarter. Also, the region will not have the benefit of last year's $6 million sale of nonstrategic assets.
Asia Pacific's results should be essentially on par with prior year. Performance in the back half of the year is expected to improve due to increased sales and production volume associated with the major new beer contract. Plus, there will be fewer furnace rebuilds in the second half of the year compared with the prior year.
We expect corporate items will be favorable compared to the prior year. Lower pension expense will reduce corporate costs, and net interest expense should be modestly down. Keep in mind that the $0.17 currency adjustment already noted includes the translation benefit from interest expense related to our non-U.S. dollar-denominated debt. While we see no change in our annual tax rate, our second quarter rate should approximate 20%, which is lower than the prior year due to discrete tax items. Plus, EPS should benefit by $0.01 from our share repurchase program. In all, adjusted earnings per share should be in the range of $0.55 to $0.60 in the second quarter. Note that the U.S. dollar has weakened a bit compared to March 31 rates. If current rates hold, currency pressure should be reduced by about $0.02 in the second quarter.
Setting currency aside, we expect modestly lower second quarter results compared to the prior year. However, this primarily reflects timing issues such as furnace rebuild activity. For reasons already noted, we expect financial results to strengthen in the second half of this year.
Now let me turn the call back to Al to wrap up."

Although we are clearly challenged by foreign currency exchange rates, the company is strong and profitable. We remain focused on the same priorities that have guided us in recent years while working to increase the benefit of some of the actions taken last year to advance our business. This includes expanding capacity at the joint venture with Constellation Brands in Mexico, integrating the Kalama plant into our North American footprint and taking full advantage of the capabilities we are building in our Innovation Center. We're pleased with our partnership with Constellation, and the integration of Kalama has gone very well.
In 2015, we are working to achieve more stability in our operations overall while we continue to build capabilities and reduce costs. Andres Lopez is actively engaging in all parts of the business globally in preparation for the CEO succession. The process is progressing well, and we intend to complete the transition by the end of this year.
Before I open the call for questions, I'm pleased to announce that we have issued our first-ever global sustainability report. It's the first time we have captured our many sustainability activities in one place. The report covers our commitment to sustainability and the progress we're making against targets we have set to reduce energy use and emissions, also increase the amount of color we use and of course, eliminate safety incidents in the company. The report also serves as an excellent vehicle to demonstrate the terrific franchise this business represents in the packaging space as well as to tell the very strong environmental story behind glass. The report brings increased transparency to the company and will serve as a tool for change. We hope you will download the report from our website and learn more about these critical aspects of our business. 
Thank you, and I will now ask Shannon to open up the lines for your questions."

We started last year -- around the middle of last year to engage several of our larger customers because in Europe as you know, we typically tend to run through shorter-term contracts, and we felt for stability in the business and to get the stable payoff for the investments that we're making in our restructuring in Europe. It was important to secure those larger volumes for longer term. So in the discussions with the large brewers, we were able to get them to shift to a more longer-term perspective and secure those volumes for the company. And that did require some adjustments in the pricings that we had to make sure that our customers felt they had a good deal and of course, we also had a good deal. Now coming into this year, that, of course, we heard the announcement that Verallia was going to sell their business, and that created some uncertainty in the market because as you, I think, had seen last night from the reports that Verallia issued, they picked up some volume in the marketplace, and that clearly created some price pressure. Now the uncertainty in the market is the greatest in the first quarter because that's when the wine customers have some leverage because they don't have to fill yet, and -- but that is now behind us. And so we expect that the pricing trends in the remainder of the year will stabilize and be mitigated somewhat compared to what we saw in the first quarter."

We were recently in Australia, and I think the latest reports that we're getting from the wine industry were certainly a little bit more confident about volumes because the decline in the Aussie dollar allows them again to reach the pricing points on the shelves economically. So I'd expect that trend-wise, we're going to see some strengthening."

First of all, relative share loss I think has been a trend that we've seen for quite a number of years. However, when we look at the overall volume evolution of our products, we see that even in Europe and in North America, where the pressure has been the greatest, the volume still is relatively stable. So I think there are other underlying trends that help us to compensate for some of those specific issues that we see in certain markets. Now with regard to the mega beer in North America, I believe, clearly, there was a considerable trend change on the part of consumers that is impacting the overall volumes that go into the marketplace. And as a result, what we're seeing is large brewers are trying to move that volume still into the market with lower pricing points, and that favors cans. We would expect that if the economy improves and on-trade consumption picks up that, that is going to change again, and we've seen this happen in the past. Now with regard to what steps are we taking, you know that we have put more investments into those markets that are benefiting in the North American market, which is really the craft industry, the craft beer industry, as well as imported products. That's why we did the deal with Constellation Brands. So I think we're taking the right steps to make sure that we are in the stronger parts of the beer segment overrepresented to mitigate some of these impacts that we have seen. Now with regard to Europe, what we are doing there is really to get to a much more competitive pricing base -- or cost base for our business. Now the main focus, of course, is that is related to other glass manufacturers and other glass providers in the marketplace. But certainly, it also is going to help in comparison to alternative packaging. Now when we see percentages of what can is doing in Europe, we also have to understand this is coming from a very low percentage of share, especially in the beer segment. And I believe, when we put that into perspective, we also then have to put into additional consideration that Europe is a returnable market. Especially in Germany, it's a very strong returnable market. So for every one beer bottle, you will need 20 or 25 cans to replace that bottle in the marketplace. So that sometimes distorts the direct comparisons of units."

So it's very comparable to the outlook that we are laying out right now for 2015. Likewise, if you take a look at our outlook that we provided in our guidance, and the midpoint of the range as an illustration, we are pointing to earnings that are slightly better than the prior year in constant currency. So those seem pretty commiserate. Now one thing I would say is that last year, we did have a benefit from working capital. We do -- at this point in time, we're not assuming a significant change in working capital, but we do have a few items that are moving in our favor this year that are different than what we saw last year. First of all, with the challenges we had in North America and higher inventory levels, we had a higher packaging spend last year, and we think that's going to come down about $40 million.

Now when -- I believe we are looking at trends. We started in the first quarter of this year, January and February were weak, but then March started much stronger, and then that trend is continuing in April. Also, some of the vibes that we're picking up from our various markets at least lead us to believe that the foundation of our business has become more solid, is not as tenuous as it has been in the past. And that, I believe, combined with what we're seeing so far, going into this quarter and what we have been discussing with our various regions, leads us to believe that our predictions for the slight pickup in volume are going to be pretty realistic."

As a rule of thumb of about $3 million impact plus or minus on this, you can see that's a pretty substantial impact on earnings on a period-over-period basis. Additionally, the -- as we mentioned before, to truly get the value out of the asset optimization program, we really need to be able to have the additional production coming through, the furnace rebuild schedule has to taper off. And so as we mentioned, that's about a $20 million, $25 million annual benefit. And let's not forget that $8 million energy credit that is a timing issue between the first half and the second half.

And as we all know, Europe has been going through a couple of very difficult years economically, I would say generally. We've said this before, Europe is running about 3 years behind North America with regards to recovering from the financial and economic crises. I would say that as soon as demand is picking up a little bit in Europe, that 5% of overcapacity that exists in the market is no longer going to have a significant an impact on the pricing activities as we have seen in the past. So it's really a question of dynamics. It's not a question of a fundamental imbalance in supply and demand in the marketplace. And your second question was related to the long-term contracts. And in the long-term contracts, we typically are talking about a 5-year commitment. 4 to 6 years is the range of the various contracts."

But I think what we are doing is clearly adjusting capacity to the reduced demand to maintain the balance in the marketplace. We will continue to do that also in the more mature markets as we look at this. And fortunately, we're not the only ones who look at this scenario.

On the other hand, we picked up considerable volume to -- in segments like nonalcoholic beverages and carbonated soft drinks, which really helped us considerably in the overall balance of the marketplace.

Our results in the first quarter were in line with our guidance despite the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar beyond our initial projections. Our EPS for the quarter was $0.44. This is $0.18 below the first quar",1093,"Thank you, Dave, and good morning. Our results in the first quarter were in line with our guidance despite the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar beyond our initial projections. Our EPS for the quarter was $0.44. This is $0.18 below the first quarter of 2014, yet the decline was $0.06 on a constant currency basis.
Our results reflect the lower sales and production volume that we had anticipated. Shipments were down about 2.5% globally. 1 percentage point is attributed to our China retrenchment, and the remainder was driven by beer, which faced a difficult comparison, with high volumes associated with World Cup demand in 2014. Shipments of all other categories combined were on par with the prior year. Production volume was down more than sales, primarily due to a relatively heavy furnace rebuild schedule.
Turning to segment performance and leaving aside currency headwinds, North and South America performed well in the quarter, South America through price gains and operational efficiencies and North America with improved supply chain performance following last year's very challenging winter conditions. In Asia-Pacific, the benefits of last year's footprint restructuring largely offset lower sales and production volumes. Coming off a strong 2014, Europe has had a challenging start to this year. While production volumes were markedly lower, as expected, price pressure has been greater than we had anticipated. Our attention to nonoperational cost reduction delivered strong results in the quarter, though through lower pension and interest expense.
We continue to manage our capital structure and allocation. In line with our commitments, we launched a $100 million accelerated stock repurchase program in February and anticipate another $25 million to be allotted for repurchases through the remainder of the year.
Also, we renegotiated our bank credit agreement in April. This transaction significantly enhances our financial flexibility by extending our debt maturity horizon and enables further refinancing to reduce future interest expense.
I'd like to provide a bit more detail on each of the regions in the next 2 slides, beginning with our largest region -- regions, Europe and North America. Our segment profit in Europe was down considerably from the prior year. About half of this decline can be attributed to the stronger U.S. dollar, which negatively impacted results by 22%. Profits were also impacted by lower price and higher production downtime. Shipments were nearly on a par with the prior year. Our wine volumes were weak relative to the double-digit growth experienced in the same quarter last year. However, spirits demand stabilized and food volumes increased. Beer was off by less than 3%, a respectable result in light of last year's double-digit volume growth leading up to the World Cup.
Selling prices were lower, driven by 2 factors. First, we entered into a number of long-term contracts, mainly in beer, to lock up attractive business that will secure market share and allow us to participate in market growth over time. At this early stage, we are seeing the impact of pricing associated with the contracts. However, securing more volume will drive improved operating leverage and make up for the lower prices, which is consistent with our asset optimization strategy.
The second factor impacting price was the more intense competitive price pressures being experienced in Southern Europe, which we believe to be of temporary nature and mainly driven by uncertainties surrounding the sale of a major competitor. Construction activities and their related operational impact accounted for more than half of Europe's lower profit in constant currency. We expected more production downtime in Europe in the first half of the year due to a front-loaded furnace rebuild schedule. Production was also impacted by several complex projects associated with the final phase of the asset optimization program. In some cases, new capabilities and technologies were introduced, which require some ramp-up time before we can achieve high utilization rates. While these factors impact earnings in the short term, they will yield benefits in the long run.
North America managed its business well in the quarter. Smooth-running supply chain operations added at least $10 million to segment profit, an improvement over the high costs associated with weather-induced logistics challenges last year. This was partially offset by the 1.5% decline in sales volume, largely reflecting the continued decline of the major domestic beer brands.
In February, we purchased a single-furnace glass plant in Kalama, Washington, which has a state-of-the-art gas oxy furnace built in 2012. The plant primarily serves the West Coast wine market as well as craft beer, both growing markets with which we are actively engaged. The plant gives us some needed capacity in wine and will allow additional flexibility across our North American production network.
Turning to Slide 4. South America was severely impacted by currency and inflation. Segment operating profit dropped more than 25%, entirely due to currency translation. Likewise, soda ash purchases in the region were impacted by local currency devaluation because prices are effectively set in U.S. dollars. If we back this out, South America's underlying operating performance improved over the prior year. Although business in the Andean region was quite stable, the macroeconomic environment in Brazil continues to present challenges. For instance, electricity rates have doubled and additional tariffs are in the works. Due to the strong comparable period, we had a small dip in South American volumes in the quarter year-over-year, but the region performed better than projected by offsetting rising inflation with price adjustments. Although productivity in South America improved, we have reduced production in Colombia because of lower exports to the U.S. and Brazil, as noted in our previous earnings call.
Asia Pacific's performance was in line with expectations. The strong U.S. dollar accounted for nearly all of the operating profit reduction. Results declined about $2 million from the prior year quarter on a constant basis. Shipments were down in the quarter by about 15%, but 3/4 of that is attributed to our deliberate shutdowns in China last year. The China retrenchment is now nearly complete, and the comparables will begin lapping in the second quarter.
In Australia, it appears that the wine and beer markets are stabilizing, albeit at a lower year-on-year level. In particular, we may be seeing early signs of an uptick in wine exports as a result of the lower value of the Australian dollar. In all, lower sales and production volumes were almost fully offset by the restructuring actions we took in late 2014 to balance local supply and demand in Australia.
With that, I will turn the call over to John to review our financial performance in more detail."

Due to the very strong impact of foreign currency translation, we are again showing prior year results on a constant currency basis. We believe this provides a clearer picture of our underlying performance.
In the first quarter of 2015, sales were $1.4 billion, which was 14% lower than prior year. You can see that nearly 90% of the decline, almost $200 million, is attributed to the stronger U.S. dollar.
Price increases, about 1% overall, were more than offset by lower sales volume. As you can see on the right, our segment operating profit was $168 million, down from $208 million in the prior year. Like sales, most of the decline was currency-driven. On a constant currency basis, the decline in profit was more modest. On the upside, global price increases covered cost inflation, which included the currency-related pressure from U.S.-dollar-priced raw materials. The margin impacts on sales volume carries over from the top line, and lower production, including the impact of greater furnace rebuild activity, weighed on results. We rebuilt 5 furnaces in the first quarter of 2015 compared to just 2 furnaces in the prior year quarter.
Turning to earnings on Slide 6. First quarter EPS was $0.44, which compares to $0.50 in the prior year quarter in constant currency. You can see the $0.07 headwind from segment operating profit that I just reviewed. The net of nonoperational items added $0.01 to our EPS. Corporate cost and interest expense were both favorable. Our effective tax rate was a bit higher in the quarter compared to a lower 2014 tax rate, which benefited from a few discrete items that did not repeat. Accordingly, our guidance for the full year 2015 tax rate is still expected to be between 23% and 25%. And lastly, the $100 million share repurchase program we launched mid-quarter reduced our share count and contributed about $0.01 to EPS.
On Slide 7, we illustrate the impact of mounting currency headwinds on earnings generated outside of the U.S., which accounts for nearly 3/4 of our sales volume. Based upon prevailing currency rates at our last earnings call, we anticipated a $0.40 annual EPS impact related to currency translation plus $0.09 of currency-induced inflation on U.S.-dollar-priced raw materials, especially in South America and Asia-Pacific. Using March 31 currency rates, the annual impact has increased to almost $0.70. This represents a $0.20 incremental headwind compared with the full year 2015 earnings guidance we provided earlier this year.
On Slide 8, you can see the impact of currency movement on our projections. We are updating our annual adjusted earnings guidance range to between $2 even and $2.30 per share. This reflects the estimated $0.20 incremental currency headwind presented on the previous slide. And we have tightened the range slightly because of pricing pressures in Europe and continued weak trends in beer. Note that the midpoint of our guidance range compares favorably to our 2014 results in constant currency. Overall, we expect our earnings in the second half of the year will exceed prior year levels and more than offset lower first half results, which were impacted by 5 additional furnace rebuilds compared to last year's activity. Maintenance activity in the second half of the year will be at more normalized levels.
Let me pause for a moment to touch on free cash flow generation. While we have not changed our target for cash flow in local currencies, we have reduced our annual free cash flow projection by $50 million. This adjustment solely reflects the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar. As a result, we expect 2015 free cash flow will approximate $250 million. Since we generate most of our cash in the fourth quarter, exchange rates in that quarter will have a significant impact on full year results.
Turning to Slide 9. Let me narrow the focus a bit to the second quarter outlook. Again, currency will be a strong headwind. We reported EPS of $0.80 per share last year. Based on March 31 rates, we anticipate translation will impact second quarter results by about 20%. This is similar to what we experienced in the first quarter of this year. Given a $0.17 currency adjustment, second quarter 2014 results in constant currency would be $0.63 per share. From this base, I will provide some directional guidance for each of our regions as well as for nonoperational items.
In Europe, underlying volume trends should remain stable, with some upside potential in beer if warm weather conditions prevail. We expect the previously mentioned competitive dynamics leading to modestly lower prices will continue. Operationally, we expect lower production in Europe, partially due to a continued greater level of furnace rebuild activity. As a result, we anticipate having between $5 million and $10 million of additional unabsorbed fixed cost and maintenance expense. However, those costs are temporary as we expect to benefit from higher production to serve increased demand in the back half of the year.
Europe's second quarter results will be impacted by another timing factor. In 2014, our European business received an energy rebate in the second quarter. We will again receive a credit in 2015, which should approximate $8 million. However, due to regulatory procedure, this year's rebate will be recognized during the third quarter.
In North America, second quarter results should be comparable to the prior year. The ongoing volume headwind in mega beer should be largely offset by better supply chain performance and increased productivity resulting from several organizational and process improvements.
In South America, we expect stable underlying business performance. That said, there is some uncertainty as to how weak macroeconomic conditions in Brazil may impact demand there. Our results in the region will be adversely impacted by having an entire quarter's worth of currency-induced inflation, which ramped up over the course of the first quarter. Also, the region will not have the benefit of last year's $6 million sale of nonstrategic assets.
Asia-Pacific's results should be essentially on par with prior year. Performance in the back half of the year is expected to improve due to increased sales and production volume associated with a major new beer contract. Plus, there will be fewer furnace rebuilds in the second half of the year compared with the prior year.
We expect corporate items will be favorable compared to the prior year. Lower pension expense will reduce corporate costs, and net interest expense should be modestly down. Keep in mind that the $0.17 currency adjustment already noted includes the translation benefit from interest expense related to our non-U.S. dollar-denominated debt. While we see no change in our annual tax rate, our second quarter rate should approximate 20%, which is lower than the prior year due to discrete tax items. Plus, EPS should benefit by $0.01 from our share repurchase program. In all, adjusted earnings per share should be in the range of $0.55 to $0.60 in the second quarter. Note that the U.S. dollar has weakened a bit compared to March 31 rates. If current rates hold, currency pressure should be reduced by about $0.02 in the second quarter.
Setting currency aside, we expect modestly lower second quarter results compared to the prior year. However, this primarily reflects timing issues such as furnace rebuild activity. For reasons already noted, we expect financial results to strengthen in the second half of this year.
Now let me turn the call back to Al to wrap up."

Although we are clearly challenged by foreign currency exchange rates, the company is strong and profitable. We remain focused on the same priorities that have guided us in recent years while working to increase the benefit of some of the actions taken last year to advance our business. This includes expanding capacity at the joint venture with Constellation Brands in Mexico, integrating the Kalama plant into our North American footprint and taking full advantage of the capabilities we are building in our Innovation Center. We're pleased with our partnership with Constellation, and the integration of Kalama has gone very well.
In 2015, we are working to achieve more stability in our operations overall while we continue to build capabilities and reduce costs. Andres Lopez is actively engaging in all parts of the business globally in preparation for the CEO succession. The process is progressing well, and we intend to complete the transition by the end of this year.
Before I open the call for questions, I'm pleased to announce that we have issued our first-ever global sustainability report. It's the first time we have captured our many sustainability activities in one place. The report covers our commitment to sustainability and the progress we're making against targets we have set to reduce energy use and emissions, also increase the amount of color we use and of course, eliminate safety incidents in the company. The report also serves as an excellent vehicle to demonstrate the terrific franchise this business represents in the packaging space as well as to tell the very strong environmental story behind glass. The report brings increased transparency to the company and will serve as a tool for change. We hope you will download the report from our website and learn more about these critical aspects of our business. 
Thank you, and I will now ask Shannon to open up the lines for your questions."

We started last year -- around the middle of last year to engage several of our larger customers because in Europe, as you know, we typically tend to run through shorter-term contracts, and we felt for stability in the business and to get the stable payoff for the investments that we're making in our restructuring in Europe. It was important to secure those larger volumes for a longer term. So in the discussions with the large brewers, we were able to get them to shift to a more longer-term perspective and secure those volumes for the company. And that did require some adjustments in the pricings that we had to make sure that our customers felt they had a good deal and, of course, we also had a good deal. Now coming into this year, that, of course, we heard the announcement that Verallia was going to sell their business, and that created some uncertainty in the market because as you, I think, had seen last night from the reports that Verallia issued, they picked up some volume in the marketplace, and that clearly created some price pressure. Now the uncertainty in the market is the greatest in the first quarter because that's when the wine customers have some leverage because they don't have to fill yet, and -- but that is now behind us. And so we expect that the pricing trends in the remainder of the year will stabilize and be mitigated somewhat compared to what we saw in the first quarter."

First of all, relative share loss, I think, has been a trend that we've seen for quite a number of years. However, when we look at the overall volume evolution of our products, we see that even in Europe and in North America, where the pressure has been the greatest, the volume still is relatively stable. So I think there are other underlying trends that help us to compensate for some of those specific issues that we see in certain markets. Now with regard to the mega beer in North America, I believe, clearly, there is a considerable trend change on the part of consumers that is impacting the overall volumes that go into the marketplace. And as a result, what we're seeing is large brewers are trying to move that volume still into the market with lower pricing points, and that favors cans. We would expect that if the economy improves and on-trade consumption picks up that, that is going to change again, and we've seen this happen in the past. Now with regard to what steps are we taking, you know that we have put more investments into those markets that are benefiting in the North American market, which is really the craft industry, the craft beer industry, as well as imported products. That's why we did the deal with Constellation Brands. So I think we're taking the right steps to make sure that we are in the stronger parts of the beer segment overrepresented to mitigate some of these impacts that we have seen. Now with regard to Europe, what we are doing there is really to get to a much more competitive pricing base -- or cost base for our business. Now the main focus, of course, is that is related to other glass manufacturers and other glass providers in the marketplace. But certainly, it also is going to help in comparison to alternative packaging. Now when we see percentages of what can is doing in Europe, we also have to understand this is coming from a very low percentage of share, especially in the beer segment. And I believe, when we put that into perspective, we also then have to put into additional consideration that Europe is a returnable market. Especially in Germany, it's a very strong returnable market. So for every one beer bottle, you will need 20 or 25 cans to replace that bottle in the marketplace. So that sometimes distorts the direct comparisons of units."

Let me first address our outlook in the most current adjustment and how we look at the current year, and then we can backtrack a little bit to what we said back in the Investor Day a couple of years ago.

So it's very comparable to the outlook that we are laying out right now for 2015. Likewise, if you take a look at our outlook that we provided in our guidance, in the midpoint of the range, as an illustration, we are pointing to earnings that are slightly better than the prior year in constant currency. So those seem pretty commiserate. Now one thing I would say is that last year, we did have a benefit from working capital. We do -- at this point in time, we're not assuming a significant change in working capital, but we do have a few items that are moving in our favor this year that are different than what we saw last year. First of all, with the challenges we had in North America in high Empire inventory levels, we had a higher packaging spend last year, and we think that's going to come down about $40 million. With the conclusion of our Italian VAT litigation, we expect a refund in the neighborhood of $40 million.

Now when -- I believe we are looking at trends. We started in the first quarter of this year, January and February were weak, but then March started out much stronger, and then that trend is continuing in April. Also, some of the vibes that we're picking up from our various markets at least lead us to believe that the foundation of our business has become more solid, is not as tenuous as it has been in the past.

As I think we mentioned in our prepared remarks, we have more furnace rebuilds in the first half of the year. There's 5 additional in the first half compared to the second half. As a rule of thumb of about $3 million impact plus or minus on those, you can see that's a pretty substantial impact on earnings on a period-over-period basis. Additionally, the -- as we mentioned before is, to truly get the value out of the asset optimization program, we really need to be able to have the additional production coming through, the furnace rebuild schedule has to taper off. And so as we mentioned, that's about a $20 million, $25 million annual benefit. And let's not forget that $8 million energy credit that is a timing issue between the first half and the second half. So when you look at all those pieces, there's clearly some cost performance elements that suggest a stronger second half of the year for O-I."

And as we all know, Europe has been going through a couple of very difficult years economically. I would say generally, we've said this before, Europe is running about 3 years behind North America with regards to recovering from the financial and economic crises. I would say that as soon as demand is picking up a little bit in Europe, that 5% of overcapacity that exists in the market is no longer going to have a significant an impact on the pricing activities as we have seen in the past. So it's really a question of dynamics. It's not a question of a fundamental imbalance in supply and demand in the marketplace. And your second question was related to the long-term contracts. And in the long-term contracts, we typically are talking about a 5-year commitment. 4 to 6 years is the range of the various contracts."

And we expect again this year, our volume to be relatively stable, with the exception again of the China situation. But I think what we are doing is clearly adjusting capacity to the reduced demand to maintain the balance in the marketplace. We will continue to do that also in the more mature markets as we look at this. And fortunately, we're not the only ones who look at this scenario. You know, and I believe we mentioned it at the last call, that we just had some significant capacity taken out of North America, which I think amounted to about 2% of the available capacity in the U.S. market by taking out a facility in New Jersey by one of our competitors.

I would say for the first quarter, Brazil beer production was down 4%, and cans in the first quarter outperformed glass. I believe that we did see, in comparison again with last year, a different trend. Last year was very strong. This year was weaker. So we were down about 7% or something in glass, but that was specifically for beer. On the other hand, we picked up considerable volume to -- in segments like nonalcoholic beverages and carbonated soft drinks, which really helped us considerably in the overall balance of the marketplace. And then, of course, in Latin America, from an overall perspective, the Andean region, again, with soft drinks and nonalcoholic beverages helping significantly in the overall demand profile. Now with regard to the second half of the year, at this point in time, when we talk to our major customers, they're still fairly confident about overall trends and what they expect to do in the marketplace.

Our results in the first quarter were in line with our guidance despite the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar beyond our initial projections. Our EPS for the quarter was $0.44. This is $0.18 below the first quar",1095,"Thank you, Dave, and good morning. Our results in the first quarter were in line with our guidance despite the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar beyond our initial projections. Our EPS for the quarter was $0.44. This is $0.18 below the first quarter of 2014, yet the decline was $0.06 on a constant currency basis.
Our results reflect the lower sales and production volume that we had anticipated. Shipments were down about 2.5% globally. 1 percentage point is attributed to our China retrenchment, and the remainder was driven by beer, which faced a difficult comparison, with high volumes associated with World Cup demand in 2014. Shipments of all other categories combined were on par with the prior year. Production volume was down more than sales, primarily due to a relatively heavy furnace rebuild schedule.
Turning to segment performance and leaving aside currency headwinds, North and South America performed well in the quarter, South America through price gains and operational efficiencies and North America with improved supply chain performance following last year's very challenging winter conditions. In Asia Pacific, the benefits of last year's footprint restructuring largely offset lower sales and production volumes. Coming off a strong 2014, Europe has had a challenging start to this year. While production volumes were markedly lower as expected, price pressure has been greater than we had anticipated. Our attention to nonoperational cost reduction delivered strong results in the quarter, though through lower pension and interest expense.
We continue to manage our capital structure and allocation. In line with our commitments, we launched a $100 million accelerated stock repurchase program in February and anticipate another $25 million to be allotted for repurchases through the remainder of the year.
Also, we renegotiated our bank credit agreement in April. This transaction significantly enhances our financial flexibility by extending our debt maturity horizon and enables further refinancing to reduce future interest expense.
I'd like to provide a bit more detail on each of the regions in the next 2 slides, beginning with our largest region -- regions, Europe and North America. Our segment profit in Europe was down considerably from the prior year. About half of this decline can be attributed to the stronger U.S. dollar, which negatively impacted results by 22%. Profits were also impacted by lower price and higher production downtime. Shipments were nearly on a par with the prior year. Our wine volumes were weak relative to the double-digit growth experienced in the same quarter last year. However, spirits demand stabilized and food volumes increased. Beer was off by less than 3%, a respectable result in light of last year's double-digit volume growth leading up to the World Cup.
Selling prices were lower, driven by 2 factors. First, we entered into a number of long-term contracts mainly in beer to lock up attractive business that will secure market share and allow us to participate in market growth over time. At this early stage, we are seeing the impact of pricing associated with the contracts. However, securing more volume will drive improved operating leverage and make up for the lower prices, which is consistent with our asset optimization strategy.
The second factor impacting price was the more intense competitive price pressures being experienced in Southern Europe, which we believe to be of temporary nature and mainly driven by uncertainties surrounding the sale of a major competitor. Construction activities and their related operational impact accounted for more than half of Europe's lower profit in constant currency. We expected more production downtime in Europe in the first half of the year due to a front-loaded furnace rebuild schedule. Production was also impacted by several complex projects associated with the final phase of the asset optimization program. In some cases, new capabilities and technologies were introduced, which require some ramp-up time before we can achieve high utilization rates. While these factors impact earnings in the short term, they will yield benefits in the long run.
North America managed its business well in the quarter. Smooth-running supply chain operations added at least $10 million to segment profit, an improvement over the high costs associated with weather-induced logistics challenges last year. This was partially offset by the 1.5% decline in sales volume, largely reflecting the continued decline of the major domestic beer brands.
In February, we purchased a single furnace glass plant in Kalama, Washington, which has a state-of-the-art gas oxy furnace built in 2012. The plant primarily serves the West Coast wine market as well as craft beer, both growing markets with which we are actively engaged. The plant gives us some needed capacity in wine and will allow additional flexibility across our North American production network.
Turning to Slide 4. South America was severely impacted by currency and inflation. Segment operating profit dropped more than 25%, entirely due to currency translation. Likewise, soda ash purchases in the region were impacted by local currency devaluation because prices are effectively set in U.S. dollars. If we back this out, South America's underlying operating performance improved over the prior year. Although business in the Andean region was quite stable, the macroeconomic environment in Brazil continues to present challenges. For instance, electricity rates have doubled and additional tariffs are in the works. Due to the strong comparable period, we had a small dip in South American volumes in the quarter year-over-year, but the region performed better than projected by offsetting rising inflation with price adjustments. Although productivity in South America improved, we have reduced production in Colombia because of lower exports to the U.S. and Brazil, as noted in our previous earnings call.
Asia Pacific's performance was in line with expectations. The strong U.S. dollar accounted for nearly all of the operating profit reduction. Results declined about $2 million from the prior year quarter on a constant basis. Shipments were down in the quarter by about 15%, but 3/4 of that is attributed to our deliberate shutdowns in China last year. The China retrenchment is now nearly complete, and the comparables will begin lapping in the second quarter.
In Australia, it appears that the wine and beer markets are stabilizing, albeit at a lower year-on-year level. In particular, we may be seeing early signs of an uptick in wine exports as a result of the lower value of the Australian dollar. In all, lower sales and production volumes were almost fully offset by the restructuring actions we took in late 2014 to balance local supply and demand in Australia.
With that, I will turn the call over to John to review our financial performance in more detail."

Due to the very strong impact of foreign currency translation, we are again showing prior year results on a constant currency basis.

Due to the very strong impact of foreign currency translation, we are again showing prior year results on a constant currency basis. We believe this provides a clearer picture of our underlying performance.
In the first quarter of 2015, sales were $1.4 billion, which was 14% lower than prior year. You can see that nearly 90% of the decline, almost $200 million, is attributed to the stronger U.S. dollar.
Price increases, about 1% overall, were more than offset by lower sales volume. As you can see on the right, our segment operating profit was $168 million, down from $208 million in the prior year. Like sales, most of the decline was currency-driven. On a constant currency basis, the decline in profit was more modest. On the upside, global price increases covered cost inflation, which included the currency-related pressure from U.S. dollar priced raw materials. The margin impacts on sales volume carries over from the top line, and lower production, including the impact of greater furnace rebuild activity, weighed on results. We rebuilt 5 furnaces in the first quarter of 2015 compared to just 2 furnaces in the prior year quarter.
Turning to earnings on Slide 6. First quarter EPS was $0.44, which compares to $0.50 in the prior year quarter in constant currency. You can see the $0.07 headwind from segment operating profit that I just reviewed. The net of nonoperational items added $0.01 to our EPS. Corporate cost and interest expense were both favorable. Our effective tax rate was a bit higher in the quarter compared to a lower 2014 tax rate, which benefited from a few discrete items that did not repeat. Accordingly, our guidance for the full year 2015 tax rate is still expected to be between 23% and 25%. And lastly, the $100 million share repurchase program we launched mid-quarter reduced our share count and contributed about $0.01 to EPS.
On Slide 7, we illustrate the impact of mounting currency headwinds on earnings generated outside of the U.S., which accounts for nearly 3/4 of our sales volume. Based upon prevailing currency rates at our last earnings call, we anticipated a $0.40 annual EPS impact related to currency translation plus $0.09 of currency-induced inflation on U.S. dollar priced raw materials, especially in South America and Asia Pacific. Using March 31 currency rates, the annual impact has increased to almost $0.70. This represents a $0.20 incremental headwind compared with the full year 2015 earnings guidance we provided earlier this year.
On Slide 8, you can see the impact of currency movement on our projections. We are updating our annual adjusted earnings guidance range to between $2 even and $2.30 per share. This reflects the estimated $0.20 incremental currency headwind presented on the previous slide. And we have tightened the range slightly because of pricing pressures in Europe and continued weak trends in beer. Note that the midpoint of our guidance range compares favorably to our 2014 results in constant currency. Overall, we expect our earnings in the second half of the year will exceed prior year levels and more than offset lower first half results, which were impacted by 5 additional furnace rebuilds compared to last year's activity. Maintenance activity in the second half of the year will be at more normalized levels.
Let me pause for a moment to touch on free cash flow generation. While we have not changed our target for cash flow in local currencies, we have reduced our annual free cash flow projection by $50 million. This adjustment solely reflects the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar. As a result, we expect 2015 free cash flow will approximate $250 million. Since we generate most of our cash in the fourth quarter, exchange rates in that quarter will have a significant impact on full year results.
Turning to Slide 9. Let me narrow the focus a bit to the second quarter outlook. Again, currency will be a strong headwind. We reported EPS of $0.80 per share last year. Based on March 31 rates, we anticipate translation will impact second quarter results by about 20%. This is similar to what we experienced in the first quarter of this year. Given a $0.17 currency adjustment, second quarter 2014 results in constant currency would be $0.63 per share. From this base, I will provide some directional guidance for each of our regions as well as for nonoperational items.
In Europe, underlying volume trends should remain stable, with some upside potential in beer if warm weather conditions prevail. We expect the previously mentioned competitive dynamics leading to modestly lower prices will continue. Operationally, we expect lower production in Europe, partially due to a continued greater level of furnace rebuild activity. As a result, we anticipate having between $5 million and $10 million of additional unabsorbed fixed cost and maintenance expense. However, those costs are temporary as we expect to benefit from higher production to serve increased demand in the back half of the year.
Europe's second quarter results will be impacted by another timing factor. In 2014, our European business received an energy rebate in the second quarter. We will again receive a credit in 2015, which should approximate $8 million. However, due to regulatory procedure, this year's rebate will be recognized during the third quarter.
In North America, second quarter results should be comparable to the prior year. The ongoing volume headwind in mega beer should be largely offset by better supply chain performance and increased productivity resulting from several organizational and process improvements.
In South America, we expect stable underlying business performance. That said, there is some uncertainty as to how weak macroeconomic conditions in Brazil may impact demand there. Our results in the region will be adversely impacted by having an entire quarter's worth of currency-induced inflation, which ramped up over the course of the first quarter. Also, the region will not have the benefit of last year's $6 million sale of nonstrategic assets.
Asia Pacific's results should be essentially on par with prior year. Performance in the back half of the year is expected to improve due to increased sales and production volume associated with a major new beer contract. Plus, there will be fewer furnace rebuilds in the second half of the year compared with the prior year.
We expect corporate items will be favorable compared to the prior year. Lower pension expense will reduce corporate costs, and net interest expense should be modestly down. Keep in mind that the $0.17 currency adjustment already noted includes the translation benefit from interest expense related to our non-U.S. dollar-denominated debt. While we see no change in our annual tax rate, our second quarter rate should approximate 20%, which is lower than the prior year due to discrete tax items. Plus, EPS should benefit by $0.01 from our share repurchase program. In all, adjusted earnings per share should be in the range of $0.55 to $0.60 in the second quarter. Note that the U.S. dollar has weakened a bit compared to March 31 rates. If current rates hold, currency pressure should be reduced by about $0.02 in the second quarter.
Setting currency aside, we expect modestly lower second quarter results compared to the prior year. However, this primarily reflects timing issues such as furnace rebuild activity. For reasons already noted, we expect financial results to strengthen in the second half of this year.
Now let me turn the call back to Al to wrap up."

Although we are clearly challenged by foreign currency exchange rates, the company is strong and profitable. We remain focused on the same priorities that have guided us in recent years while working to increase the benefit of some of the actions taken last year to advance our business. This includes expanding capacity at the joint venture with Constellation Brands in Mexico, integrating the Kalama plant into our North American footprint and taking full advantage of the capabilities we are building in our Innovation Center. We're pleased with our partnership with Constellation, and the integration of Kalama has gone very well.
In 2015, we are working to achieve more stability in our operations overall while we continue to build capabilities and reduce costs. Andres Lopez is actively engaging in all parts of the business globally in preparation for the CEO succession. The process is progressing well, and we intend to complete the transition by the end of this year.
Before I open the call for questions, I'm pleased to announce that we have issued our first-ever global sustainability report. It's the first time we have captured our many sustainability activities in one place. The report covers our commitment to sustainability and the progress we're making against targets we have set to reduce energy use and emissions, also increase the amount of color we use and of course, eliminate safety incidents in the company. The report also serves as an excellent vehicle to demonstrate the terrific franchise this business represents in the packaging space as well as to tell the very strong environmental story behind glass. The report brings increased transparency to the company and will serve as a tool for change. We hope you will download the report from our website and learn more about these critical aspects of our business. 
Thank you, and I will now ask Shannon to open up the lines for your questions."

It was important to secure those larger volumes for a longer term. So in the discussions with the large brewers, we were able to get them to shift to a more longer-term perspective and secure those volumes for the company. And that did require some adjustments in the pricings that we had to make sure that our customers felt they had a good deal and, of course, we also had a good deal. Now coming into this year, that, of course, we heard the announcement that Verallia was going to sell their business, and that created some uncertainty in the market because as you, I think, had seen last night from the reports that Verallia issued, they picked up some volume in the marketplace, and that clearly created some price pressure. Now the uncertainty in the market is the greatest in the first quarter because that's when the wine customers have some leverage because they don't have to fill yet, and -- but that is now behind us. And so we expect that the pricing trends in the remainder of the year will stabilize and be mitigated somewhat compared to what we saw in the first quarter."

First of all, relative share loss I think has been a trend that we've seen for quite a number of years. However, when we look at the overall volume evolution of our products, we see that even in Europe and in North America, where the pressure has been the greatest, the volume still is relatively stable. So I think there are other underlying trends that help us to compensate for some of those specific issues that we see in certain markets. Now with regard to the mega beer in North America, I believe, clearly, there is a considerable trend change on the part of consumers that is impacting the overall volumes that go into the marketplace. And as a result, what we're seeing is large brewers are trying to move that volume still into the market with lower pricing points, and that favors cans. We would expect that if the economy improves and on-trade consumption picks up that, that is going to change again, and we've seen this happen in the past. Now with regard to what steps are we taking, you know that we have put more investments into those markets that are benefiting in the North American market, which is really the craft industry, the craft beer industry as well as imported products. That's why we did the deal with Constellation Brands. So I think we're taking the right steps to make sure that we are in the stronger parts of the beer segment overrepresented to mitigate some of these impacts that we have seen. Now with regard to Europe, what we are doing there is really to get to a much more competitive pricing base -- or cost base for our business. Now the main focus, of course, is that is related to other glass manufacturers and other glass providers in the marketplace. But certainly, it also is going to help in comparison to alternative packaging. Now when we see percentages of what can is doing in Europe, we also have to understand this is coming from a very low percentage of share, especially in the beer segment. And I believe, when we put that into perspective, we also then have to put into additional consideration that Europe is a returnable market. Especially in Germany, it's a very strong returnable market. So for every one beer bottle, you will need 20 or 25 cans to replace that bottle in the marketplace. So that sometimes distorts the direct comparisons of units."

Likewise, if you take a look at our outlook that we provided in our guidance, in the midpoint of the range, as an illustration, we are pointing to earnings that are slightly better than the prior year in constant currency. So those seem pretty commiserate. Now one thing I would say is that last year, we did have a benefit from working capital. We do -- at this point in time, we're not assuming a significant change in working capital, but we do have a few items that are moving in our favor this year that are different than what we saw last year.

So most of the benefits that we are going to see this year are really going to come from the differential in production volume, plus a little bit stronger sales profile compared to last year because we do not expect the same correction to happen in the third and the fourth quarter that we saw last year following the ramp-up for the World Cup and then a pretty miserable summer in Europe. Now when -- I believe we are looking at trends. We started in the first quarter of this year, January and February were weak, but then March started out much stronger, and then that trend is continuing in April. Also, some of the vibes that we're picking up from our various markets at least lead us to believe that the foundation of our business has become more solid, is not as tenuous as it has been in the past. And that, I believe, combined with what we're seeing so far, going into this quarter and what we have been discussing with our various regions, leads us to believe that our predictions for the slight pickup in volume are going to be pretty realistic."

As I think we mentioned in our prepared remarks, we have more furnace rebuilds in the first half of the year. There's 5 additional in the first half compared to the second half. As a rule of thumb of about $3 million impact plus or minus on those, you can see that's a pretty substantial impact on earnings on a period-over-period basis. Additionally, the -- as we mentioned before is, to truly get the value out of the asset optimization program, we really need to be able to have the additional production coming through, the furnace rebuild schedule has to taper off. And so as we mentioned, that's about a $20 million, $25 million annual benefit. And let's not forget that $8 million energy credit that is a timing issue between the first half and the second half. So when you look at all those pieces, there's clearly some cost performance elements that suggest a stronger second half of the year for O-I."

And as we all know, Europe has been going through a couple of very difficult years economically. I would say generally, we've said this before, Europe is running about 3 years behind North America with regards to recovering from the financial and economic crises. I would say that as soon as demand is picking up a little bit in Europe, that 5% of overcapacity that exists in the market is no longer going to have a significant an impact on the pricing activities as we have seen in the past. So it's really a question of dynamics. It's not a question of a fundamental imbalance in supply and demand in the marketplace. And your second question was related to the long-term contracts.

And as you know, from the retrenchment, we have corrected those capacity numbers in China as well as in Australia appropriately to adjust for that reduced demand. However, overall, the company's volume has been fairly flat. So if I look at 2013, 2014, if I take China out of that comparison, the rest of the volume has remained flat. And we expect again this year, our volume to be relatively stable, with the exception again of the China situation. But I think what we are doing is clearly adjusting capacity to the reduced demand to maintain the balance in the marketplace. We will continue to do that also in the more mature markets as we look at this. And fortunately, we're not the only ones who look at this scenario. You know, and I believe we mentioned it at the last call, that we just had some significant capacity taken out of North America, which I think amounted to about 2% of the available capacity in the U.S. market by taking out a facility in New Jersey by one of our competitors.

I would say for the first quarter, Brazil beer production was down 4%, and cans in the first quarter outperformed glass. I believe that we did see, in comparison again with last year, a different trend. Last year was very strong. This year was weaker. So we were down about 7% or something in glass, but that was specifically for beer. On the other hand, we picked up considerable volume to -- in segments like nonalcoholic beverages and carbonated soft drinks, which really helped us considerably in the overall balance of the marketplace. And then, of course, in Latin America, from an overall perspective, the Andean region, again, with soft drinks and nonalcoholic beverages helping significantly in the overall demand profile. Now with regard to the second half of the year, at this point in time, when we talk to our major customers, they're still fairly confident about overall trends and what they expect to do in the marketplace.

I'll begin with a summary of the quarter on Slide 3. We were able to achieve solid results in the quarter despite sluggish macroeconomic conditions in many markets, a continued strong U.S. dollar and several major engineering projects in our plants. Our adjusted EPS was $0.60, which was at the high end of our guidance range. Adjusted EPS was down $0.20 compared to the prior year yet by $0.05 on a constant currency basis. Overall, lower segment operating profit was mostly offset by the effects of favorable nonoperating items.
Given our global footprint, we had variations in our regional performance. Sales volume increased in North America despite the ongoing decline in mega beer. In Asia Pacific, benefits from last year's restructuring in Australia largely mitigated lower sales and production volume. Declines in Europe were caused by lower prices as well as lower output stemming from planned engineering and maintenance activity while volume remained relatively stable. And in South America, the bottom line was impacted by lower sales volume of beer in Brazil. The majority of the drop in beer reflected the record sales volume achieved in the comparison period of 2014 as a result of the World Cup. Brazil's broader economic weakness contributed to the rest of the decline.
We continue to actively manage our capital structure in the second quarter. We refinanced our bank credit agreement, repaid $300 million of high coupon bonds and completed our $100 million accelerated share repurchase program.
And due to the hard work of many teams on the status of reviews by the regulatory agencies, we anticipate that our proposed acquisition of Vitro's food and beverage business in Mexico will close in the second half of this year.
Turning now to an overview of our performance by region, beginning on Slide 4. Weaker results in Europe were significantly impacted by currency headwinds. Currency devaluation in the region drove more than 90% of the revenue decline and 40% of the decrease in operating profit.
Despite broad uncertainty in the euro zone, our sales volumes were in line with relatively strong shipments realized in the prior year. Beer volumes even increased 2% as the benefits of our approach to long-term contracts in 2014 began to take hold.
As we have previously discussed, our results in Southern Europe were pressured by competitive dynamics in wine that impacted both price and volume. While cost inflation in Europe remained fairly benign, lower prices in the region led to a price cost gap of approximately $10 million, similar to our experience in the first quarter of this year. European profits also were impacted by a higher-than-normal amount of furnace rebuild activity as well as production downtime related to ongoing asset optimization efforts.
While these efforts can impact short-term profitability, they are, of course, designed to make changes that yield long-term benefits. For instance, we recently celebrated the installation of a gas oxy furnace system in Jarvakandi, Estonia. While using purified oxygen, we can melt glass using less energy. We're installing similar systems in other plants in an effort to reduce overall energy consumption and thereby also significantly reducing our emissions.
A final element to note in Europe's profitability relates to an energy rebate we received in the second quarter of 2014. We will receive another energy credit of approximately $8 million this year but not until the third quarter.
Summing up the region, Europe's volume was fairly stable, but bottom line results in constant currency by dampened by roughly equal parts of industry price pressure, production downtime and the timing of the energy credit.
Moving on to more favorable results in North America. There, segment profit was up slightly in constant currency from the prior year. Sales volume was up nearly 2%. A modest decline in mega beer was surpassed by gains across all other categories. Prices in the quarter were slightly lower mostly due to the contractual pass-through of lower natural gas costs. By design, production volume in the quarter was lower than prior year. Recall that in the second quarter of 2014, we ran our assets hard in anticipation of strong summer sales that then did not materialize. This year, we did a better job balancing production with sales. In fact, we reported significantly improved warehouse and delivery costs and a double-digit decrease in finished goods inventory.
Turning to Slide 5. Similar to last quarter, our results in South America were severely impacted by currency valuation. On a constant currency basis, operating profit was lower due to a 10% decline in shipments. Low consumer confidence amid economic uncertainty in Brazil led to lower on-premise consumption where glass is the primary packaging option. Brazil accounted for nearly 90% of the region's volume decline, almost all of which was beer. As I mentioned earlier, demand was at record levels in the comparable period of 2014, and in fact, compared with 2013, Brazil volumes were down low single digits, which more aptly reflects the underlying market conditions.
Inflation in the region picked up considerably in the quarter. As we reported earlier, this was driven by substantially higher electricity costs and the currency impact on dollar-denominated purchases of soda ash. The successful efforts of our commercial teams virtually offset all of the inflation.
Asia Pacific results improved slightly from the prior year on a constant currency basis. Shipments were down 3%. While the Australian wine market began to stabilize, the overall beer market may still be a few quarters away from reaching a bottom. Also keep in mind that we now have lapped the unfavorable comparisons resulting from last year's retrenchment activities in China. Improved results in Asia Pacific mostly reflect benefits from the prior year's restructuring efforts to better align supply with demand in Australia.
With that, I'll turn the call over to John to review our financial performance."
32583,292903511,842426,"Owens-Illinois, Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 30, 2015",2015-07-30,"Earnings Calls","O-I Glass, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Al. Let's turn to Slide 6. Due to the very strong impact of foreign currency translation, we are again showing prior year results on a constant currency basis. We believe this provides a clear picture of our underlying performance.In the second",1365,"Thanks, Al. Let's turn to Slide 6. Due to the very strong impact of foreign currency translation, we are again showing prior year results on a constant currency basis. We believe this provides a clear picture of our underlying performance.
In the second quarter of 2015, sales were $1.5 billion. This is 15% lower than prior year. You can see that $240 million, or more than 90% of the decline, was attributed to the stronger U.S. dollar.
Price was flat at the enterprise level. Higher prices in South America were essentially offset by modestly lower prices in the other regions. 
Shipments globally were down about 1%. Excluding Brazil, volumes were flat year-on-year.
As you can see in the right-hand side of the slide, our segment operating profit was $187 million, down from $262 million in the prior year. As expected, the stronger dollar weighed heavily on segment operating profit.
Beyond that, price and the margin impact on sales volume carried over from the top line. Results were impacted by cost inflation, the effective engineering activity on production and prior year onetime items that we've already discussed.
Moving to EPS on Slide 7. Second quarter adjusted EPS was $0.60, which compared to $0.65 in the prior year quarter in constant currency. On the whole, the main components of earnings moved in the direction on the order of magnitude consistent with the guidance we presented at sell side conference in early June. Segment operating profit accounted for a $0.19 headwind. The net of nonoperational items added $0.14 to our EPS.
Corporate costs were favorable and benefited from lower pension expense and higher machine parts sales for engineering projects conducted by our licensees. We realized a $0.02 benefit from net interest expense in the quarter driven by the debt refinancing already mentioned. We had an effective tax rate of 17% in the quarter, lower than the prior year rate. That said, we expect that our full year 2015 tax rate will be between 23% and 25%. The $100 million accelerated share repurchase program that we finished in May reduced our share count and contributed about $0.02 to EPS. For the full year, we expect about a $0.05 favorable impact on EPS from share repurchases.
Let me shift momentarily to GAAP EPS. In the second quarter, we reported $61 million of pretax charges that were not representative of ongoing operations. About half of that charge stemmed from bond redemption premiums and fees related to refinancing activities. Separately, we recognized the impact of modest restructuring activities at several sites around the world. And finally, there were initial onetime costs related to the proposed Vitro acquisition. In all, EPS was at the high end of the range as somewhat weaker than expected volumes in Brazil were offset by a tax rate that was marginally better than expected.
Moving to Slide 8. We continue to actively manage our capital structure. We renewed our bank credit agreement in the quarter and repaid $300 million in high coupon debt that was due in 2016. Both of these efforts enhanced our credit and liquidity profile. As noted earlier, the strong U.S. dollar negatively impacted our consolidated earnings. However, this trend favorably impacted the considerable amount of non-U.S. dollar-denominated debt that we have in our capital structure.
Like many other manufacturing companies, we have a large pension liability to manage. In recent years, we have taken actions to reduce that liability, including buyouts and converting several major plans to defined contribution plans. Keep in mind that our underlying earnings performance is partially masked by pension accounting guidelines. If you back out the noncash charge and pension related to the amortization of actuarial loss, for instance, you would see that the business is generating $0.50 per share higher earnings than one sees in a quick review of our financials.
On the equity side, our buybacks this year amounted to 4 million shares. We expect to repurchase another 25 million shares by the end of 2015.
Turning to the third quarter outlook on Slide 9. Currency will continue to be a strong headwind. We reported adjusted EPS of $0.75 per share in the third quarter of last year. Using June 30 rates, prior-year results were more like $0.60, an impact of about 20%. Overall, we do not see material changes from first half of 2015 in the business environment. That said, let me provide some insight on our third quarter outlook by region on a constant currency basis.
In Europe, volumes should be stable with the prior year, and the year-on-year price decline experienced in the first half of 2015 will continue rather than abate, as we had expected. While most of our engineering projects were concentrated in the first half of 2015, we do expect some work to continue into the early part of the third quarter. Production and efficiency should improve over the course of the quarter. We estimate the combined effect of price and production downtime will negatively impact results by nearly $20 million compared to the prior year. However, this should be partially offset by the $8 million energy credit mentioned earlier.
For North America, gains in craft beer, spirits, food and non-alcoholic beverages should counterbalance the continued decline in mega beer. We expect continued performance of our manufacturing and supply chain operations, which will compare favorably with prior year largely due to our efforts to better match production with sales. However, this will be partially offset by the costs associated with 2 more furnace rebuilds in the prior year quarter. Overall, we expect North American profit to be modestly higher than the prior year.
In South America, we anticipate that price increases will mitigate cost inflation. We expect sales volumes will be down low single digits, reflecting macro uncertainty primarily in Brazil. As a result, we see South America generating lower year-over-year operating profit.
In Asia Pacific, we expect segment profit will improve modestly from prior year. In sluggish overall market conditions, our volumes should benefit from a new beer contract in Australia. The region will also benefit from lost production downtime. Nonoperational items should be favorable compared to the prior year. Lower pension and interest expense will help. Keep in mind that the $0.15 currency adjustment already noted includes the translation benefit from interest expense related to our non-U.S. dollar-denominated debt.
While we see no change in our annual tax rate guidance, the third quarter rate should be at the low end of our full year range. Plus EPS will benefit by $0.01 or $0.02 from a lower share count. 
Taking into account all the puts and takes, we expect our adjusted EPS to be in line with the prior year in constant currency terms. Note that the U.S. dollar has strengthened compared to June 30 rates. If current rates hold, the currency pressures would reduce EPS by another $0.03 in the third quarter compared to this outlook.
Let's turn to our full year guidance on Slide 10. We are taking $0.10 off the upper end of our previous EPS guidance, reflecting economic weakness in Brazil and ongoing competitive pressures in Europe. That said, we still expect second half year-on-year comparisons to fare better than those of the first half. Sales volumes, other than in South America, are expected to be modestly better year-over-year, and production volume should improve driven by higher sales and more normal levels of engineering and maintenance activity.
We have not changed our target for cash flow for the year. Although the midpoint of our earnings guidance is modestly lower, other cash flow sources and uses are tracking with our expectation. Notwithstanding this year's $80 million currency headwind on cash flow, we remain focused on generating $250 million in free cash flow in 2015. Of course, while we generate cash in local currency, our cash flow is reported in U.S. dollars. Since we make most of our cash in the fourth quarter, exchange rates in that quarter will have a significant impact on full year results. Please note that this guidance excludes any impact of the proposed acquisition of Vitro's food and beverage glass container business.
At this point, let me turn the call back over to Al."

As you know in May, we announced an agreement with Vitro, a leading glass container producer in Mexico and Bolivia to acquire their food and beverage glass containers business. From a financial perspective, we expect the transaction to be immediately accretive to earnings and cash flow. In the third year after closing, we anticipate EPS accretion will reach approximately $0.50 per share as we deliver on the rising impact of highly achievable low cost synergies. By that time, we also expect the transaction will add at least $100 million in incremental free cash flow. The Mexican glass containers segment is strong and has continued to demonstrate healthy demand trends. We presently expect to close the transaction on the second half of 2015, earlier than our original expectations. In early July, the waiting period under Hart-Scott Rodino expired without any action taken by the Federal Trade Commission. The transaction is still subject to 2 approval from the Mexican and Federal Competition Commission and the National of Foreign Investment Commission, and we're working with these agencies as appropriate to support their reviews and to come to their conclusions. Internally, teams from both companies are appropriately collaborating to achieve a successful integration.
As we stated at the outset, the leadership of Vitro business, including the plants, will largely remain intact. While we have identified specific ways in which we believe we can add value, we absolutely want to capitalize on Vitro's proven track record of meeting customer needs and serving local markets.
Andres Lopez is playing a critical role in the Vitro acquisition, and he has been heavily involved in integrating the planning and will ensure that we meet critical milestones in this transaction. We are deep into preparation for the financing of the deal, so that we can access the credit market soon and timely enough to be ready for a closing this year. We believe the transaction represents a significant opportunity to create shareholder value, extend our global franchise in glass and cement and build upon our position as the world's leading glass packaging company. It provides access to a strong and growing market in which we have virtually no presence. It also allows us to grow with our multinational customers as they tap into Mexico's market. And seen together with our joint venture with Constellation, the Vitro business enhances our position to participate in the growing segments of the U.S. market served by Mexico.
As I wrap up on Slide 12, I want to highlight a couple of our priorities for the second half of 2015. The CEO succession process is progressing smoothly and Andrew Lopez is primed to assume the CEO role by the end of this year. He has been actively shaping his future leadership team. In the quarter, he was able to hand over his Latin America and North America leadership responsibilities to Miguel Alvarez and Sergio Galindo, respectively. Tim Connors, formerly the General Manager of Australia and Asia Pacific CFO, succeeded Sergio as President of Asia Pacific. In addition, we hired as our Chief Marketing Officer. He brings a wealth of rich packaging experience to the company. Andres and his team are developing the company's short- and long-term strategy, which he will present to the board later this year. And he's also actively engaging with our shareholders and the broader investment community with several events scheduled for the back half of the year. He intends to discuss the company's new strategic and financial plan with investors in the first quarter of next year.
We are continuing with the CFO selection process. We expect to announce a decision on the role before our next earnings call.
Despite the backdrop of uncertain macros, we feel that the volume stability in North America, Europe and now, Asia Pacific, are positive signs. Although the evolution of volume in Brazil is difficult to predict, typically, we have seen a V-shaped recovery in the past, and this may well be the case again. Our engagement in Mexico is a very positive step forward, and with all the work we are doing to improve our operations and cost position, we are setting a firm foundation on which the new leadership of O-I can build.
And now I will ask the -- Jeremy, the operator, to open up the lines for your questions."

I would say the major difference from last year, and I think you see that reflected in comments from other packaging companies as well, is that last year saw a significant volume dropoff in the second half of the year, which we really do not expect this year, which then led to inventory reductions and inventory curtailments towards the end of the year, and they were particularly concentrated in the fourth quarter. That's not going to happen this year. And also in Europe, we really had underproduction in the first of this year because of the construction projects. And we need to make sure that we have a sufficient level of inventory as we go into next year. So those 2 factors, and it's really all mainly production-related, combined, of course, with some expectations of volume stability, which we have seen evolving over the last couple of months, is going to be a significant factor for the differentiation in the performance in the second half of the year. Perhaps John can add 1 or 2 comments as well on specifics."

I kind of remember last year's overall South American volumes being up only about a couple of percent in aggregate. Correct me if I'm wrong on that comparison. And then the other part of the question is, back in the late 1990s when you had a lot of similar factors at work, emerging markets declining, the dollar being strong, you saw some very interesting trade patterns in glass, one-way glass, were thermal glass and one-way packaging.

Comparing to 2013, the volume reduction is really single digits and mid-single digits, I would say. And so I think that's more reflective of the economic impact. I believe that given the overall currency evolution in the region, because this also applies to Colombia, this applies to Peru, this applies to Brazil, of course, is going to be beneficial for economics in the manufacturing process for our customer base and the packaging base that they supply to the marketplace. So typically, we would expect that a lower value of the currency will lead to a greater drive to economics and packaging, which would favor returnable packaging, which I believe answers the question, at least, conventionally that you have with regard to the potential impact on the mix of one way versus returnables."

And even though, of course, the top line is impacted by the currency, the reported EBITDA was very strong and showed a very strong evolution or very strong growth in reality. So I believe the processes are in place, and a significant portion of the Mexican business is also in the United States. And of course, clearly, some of the cost structures in Mexico are based on U.S. dollar. So there are pass-through provisions that would make sure that, that is going to not burden the results and the profit generation capability in the future. I believe, as we have said, that what we're seeing at this point in time from published information is very much on track and on track with what we assumed when we made the deal, when we announced the deal to you. And we're very encouraged by what we've seen so far. And I would expect that the strength of the profitability profile is really driven by a variety of factors. First of all, it's the distribution of the customer base, which is very similar to Latin America, where we also tend to have fairly high margins over a series of years because the customer base is a much more distributed customer base. Secondly, I believe also that the contracts that Vitro engaged in with regard to supply of Constellation perhaps added additional earnings generation on an existing cost base, which really, I believe, give us a pretty good assurance that these margins are sustainable for quite a while."

First of all, when we gave our outlook for the expected potential accretion of the deal, we had kept some conservative assumptions to accommodate any chance of the FX movement, postclosing adjustments, things like that. So at today's rates, we believe we can still hit the numbers that we talked about before even with an elevated stronger dollar versus the peso. And specifically on that, I would add that up to 40% of the business in Vitro is actually outside the United States -- I'm sorry, outside of Mexico, such as United States, Caribbean, et cetera, that would be priced in U.S. dollar, so there's a reduction in the exposure to that peso in that regard. We are also considering other tax planning strategies, and not to mention that there is a robust hedging market for the peso, much like the euro, that we may consider in the future from time to time."

And of course, with the lower output that we had in the first half of the year because of the construction project and the startup of the plants and investments that we've made, that is going to lead to a need to build up inventory as we go into next year to be able to supply our customers in a fashion that allows us to be on time and to deal with the demand profile that we expect at this point in time to come next year."

But as Al mentioned, we expect we can have better performance in packaging costs as inventory levels were higher in North America last year, which required more in and things like that. We don't expect that type of spending. We expect restructuring cost to be down overall. We expect asbestos payments be down as well as the pension that Al mentioned before. And of course, as we have discussed in the past, the Italian VAT litigation was actually requiring cash outlays in the last couple of years and now becomes a cash source this year as we get some money back there.

Well, I think we are making quite a significant investment and footprint adjustments in Europe, been working at it for the last 2 or 3 years, and it really has been addressing misalignments of where we have manufacturing facilities, where we have capacity to where the market strengths have been. That is going to continue. And I believe that at this point in time, it's very well balanced with what we are seeing in the overall volume evolution and demand profile. In North America, we constantly are looking at adjustments here and there. And I think as you saw in the note 1 items, we did some light restructuring in North America to make some adjustments for the volume changes that we're seeing. But again, it's really addressing more a change in the demand pattern than a decline in overall volume because I believe if you look over the last couple of years, our sales in North America have remained fairly stable. And then, of course, in Latin America, again, in the quarter, we made some adjustments to the capacity in Latin America because of the reduced demand. There is no need to keep this capacity in abeyance, and you know our rule or our approach has been particularly in Brazil that we want to make sure that in Brazil we don't have an overcapacity because of the high manufacturing costs that we typically have in that country. And so we have taken the steps there. So I believe it's an ongoing process, Ghansham. And I think that looking down the road, we're in pretty good position at this point in time with regard to our balance of supply and demand or capacity and demand as we go into the next year."

I think, it really, from our perspective, has more to do with logic. Because as you could tell from our comments, volume in Europe, despite last year being a pretty strong second quarter, was fairly stable this year. We've seen some of our competitors, particularly those that are active in Southern Europe, showing some slight increases in volume, between 2% and 3%, which really would indicate to me that demand is pretty solid, which typically would not be an environment where you would see a lot of price competition. I believe it really has to do with the transaction that is pending at this point in time in Europe, where the seller most probably wanted to optimize the profile of the company and that of course has led to an instability in the marketplace. Once that instability is there, it takes a while to dissipate to eventually get out of the system. And we were possibly a bit too optimistic that the stronger demand profile we are gradually seeing evolving in Europe would counteract some of the price pressure. And at least it hasn't happened yet. As John indicated in his comments, we expect that as we go into the negotiation for next year with our customers that, that will have a more positive effect on pricing because it gives people an opportunity to reset as we go into those discussions."

So that trend is continuing. Also you will recall that last year, midyear, we lost a significant wine contract. So we're also now basically overtaking that impact that we saw in the first 2 quarters of this year, which leads to a strengthening of the comparables. And then as we have signaled already since last year, we had an agreement for a significant beer contract to bump up volumes in the second half of this year, which is also most probably going to set us a little bit apart from the general trend that we still observe in the market.

Equally, we're making a significant investment in, which really is using a combination of technologies. And as you said, oxy fired has been around for a long time. But the way we are applying it is in a combination of factors that has not been really used that way in the glass industry or in the container glass container industry. And it's a combination of using waste heat much more efficiently to save energy, to generate additional components that are needed for the process or to be able to reduce waste, to reduce the energy input into the furnace. I think those are the factors that really have quite a significant impact. And I believe that will progress as we make investments. Particularly, in the case of Europe, where in the Europe, the energy component of the manufacturing cost is 2x as high as the energy component of manufacturing cost in the United States. So really make sense to do it in Europe. With regard to the broader and longer-term technology aspects that we have talked about in the past, as I have said, we will not see a major impact until the end of this decade.

I'll begin with a summary of the quarter on Slide 3. We were able to achieve solid results in the quarter despite sluggish macroeconomic conditions in many markets, a continued strong U.S. dollar and several major engi",970,"Thank you, Dave, and good morning. I'll begin with a summary of the quarter on Slide 3. 
We were able to achieve solid results in the quarter despite sluggish macroeconomic conditions in many markets, a continued strong U.S. dollar and several major engineering projects in our plants. Our adjusted EPS was $0.60, which was at the high end of our guidance range. Adjusted EPS was down $0.20 compared to the prior year yet by $0.05 on a constant currency basis. Overall, lower segment operating profit was mostly offset by the effect of favorable nonoperating items.
Given our global footprint, we had variations in our regional performance. Sales volume increased in North America despite the ongoing decline in mega beer. In Asia Pacific, benefits from last year's restructuring in Australia largely mitigated lower sales and production volume. Declines in Europe were caused by lower prices as well as lower output stemming from plant engineering and maintenance activity while volume remained relatively stable. And in South America, the bottom line was impacted by lower sales volume of beer in Brazil. The majority of the drop in beer reflected the record sales volume achieved in the comparison period of 2014 as a result of the World Cup. Brazil's broader economic weakness contributed to the rest of the decline.
We continued to actively manage our capital structure in the second quarter. We refinanced our bank credit agreement, repaid $300 million of high-coupon bonds and completed our $100 million accelerated share repurchase program. And due to the hard work of many teams on the status of reviews by the regulatory agencies, we anticipate that our proposed acquisition of Vitro's food and beverage business in Mexico will close in the second half of this year.
Turning now to an overview of our performance by region beginning on Slide 4. Weaker results in Europe were significantly impacted by currency headwinds. Currency devaluation in the region drove more than 90% of the revenue decline and 40% of the decrease in operating profit.
Despite broad uncertainty in the Eurozone, our sales volumes were in line with relatively strong shipments realized in the prior year. Beer volumes even increased 2% as the benefits of our approach to long-term contracts in 2014 began to take hold.
As we have previously discussed, our results in Southern Europe were pressured by competitive dynamics in wine that impacted both price and volume. While cost inflation in Europe remained fairly benign, lower prices in the region led to a price-cost gap of approximately $10 million, similar to our experience in the first quarter of this year. 
European profits also were impacted by a higher-than-normal amount of furnace rebuild activity as well as production downtime related to ongoing asset optimization efforts. While these efforts can impact short-term profitability, they are, of course, designed to make changes that yield long-term benefits. For instance, we recently celebrated the installation of a gas-oxy furnace system in Jarvakandi, Estonia. By using purified oxygen, we can melt glass using less energy. We're installing similar systems in other plants in an effort to reduce overall energy consumption and thereby also significantly reducing our emissions.
A final element to note in Europe's profitability relates to an energy rebate we received in the second quarter of 2014. We will receive another energy credit of approximately $8 million this year but not until the third quarter.
Summing up the region, Europe's volume was fairly stable, but bottom line results in constant currency were dampened by roughly equal parts of industry price pressure, production downtime and the timing of the energy credit.
Moving on to more favorable results in North America. There, segment profit was up slightly in constant currency from the prior year. Sales volume was up nearly 2%. A modest decline in mega beer was surpassed by gains across all other categories. Prices in the quarter were slightly lower mostly due to the contractual pass-through of lower natural gas costs. 
By design, production volume in the quarter was lower than prior year. Recall that in the second quarter of 2014, we ran our assets hard in anticipation of strong summer sales that then did not materialize. This year, we did a better job balancing production with sales. In fact, we reported significantly improved warehouse and delivery cost and a double-digit decrease in finished goods inventory.
Turning to Slide 5. Similar to last quarter, our results in South America were severely impacted by currency valuation. On a constant currency basis, operating profit was lower due to a 10% decline in shipments. Low consumer confidence amid economic uncertainty in Brazil led to lower on-premise consumption where glass is the primary packaging option. Brazil accounted for nearly 90% of the region's volume decline, almost all of which was beer. As I mentioned earlier, demand was at record levels in the comparable period of 2014. And in fact, compared with 2013, Brazil volumes were down low single digits, which more aptly reflects the underlying market conditions.
Inflation in the region picked up considerably in the quarter. As we reported earlier, this was driven by substantially higher electricity costs and the currency impact on dollar-denominated purchases of soda ash. The successful efforts of our commercial teams virtually offset all of the inflation.
Asia Pacific results improved slightly from the prior year on a constant currency basis. Shipments were down 3%. While the Australian wine market began to stabilize, the overall beer market may still be a few quarters away from reaching a bottom. Also keep in mind that we now have lapped the unfavorable comparisons resulting from last year's retrenchment activities in China. Improved results in Asia Pacific mostly reflect benefits from the prior year's restructuring efforts to better align supply with demand in Australia.
With that, I'll turn the call over to John to review our financial performance."

Due to the very strong impact of foreign currency translation, we are again showing prior year results on a constant currency basis. We believe this provides a clear picture of our underlying performance.In the second",1363,"Thanks, Al. Let's turn to Slide 6. Due to the very strong impact of foreign currency translation, we are again showing prior year results on a constant currency basis. We believe this provides a clear picture of our underlying performance.
In the second quarter of 2015, sales were $1.5 billion. This is 15% lower than prior year. You can see that $240 million, or more than 90% of the decline, was attributed to the stronger U.S. dollar.
Price was flat at the enterprise level. Higher prices in South America were essentially offset by modestly lower prices in the other regions. 
Shipments globally were down about 1%. Excluding Brazil, volumes were flat year-on-year.
As you can see in the right-hand side at the slide, our segment operating profit was $187 million, down from $262 million in the prior year. As expected, the stronger dollar weighed heavily on segment operating profits. Beyond that, price and the margin impact on sales volume carried over from the top line. Results were impacted by cost inflation, the effective engineering activity on production and prior year onetime items that we've already discussed.
Moving to EPS on Slide 7. Second quarter adjusted EPS was $0.60, which compared to $0.65 in the prior year quarter in constant currency. On the whole, the main components of earnings moved in the direction on the order of magnitude consistent with the guidance we presented at sell-side conference in early June. Segment operating profit accounted for a $0.19 headwind. The net of nonoperational items added $0.14 to our EPS.
Corporate costs were favorable and benefited from lower pension expense and higher machine parts sales for engineering projects conducted by our licensees. 
We realized a $0.02 benefit from net interest expense in the quarter driven by the debt refinancing already mentioned. 
We had an effective tax rate of 17% in the quarter, lower than the prior year rate. That said, we expect that our full year 2015 tax rate will be between 23% and 25%. 
The $100 million accelerated share repurchase program that we finished in May reduced our share count and contributed about $0.02 to EPS. For the full year, we expect about a $0.05 favorable impact on EPS from share repurchases.
Let me shift momentarily to GAAP EPS. In the second quarter, we reported $61 million of pretax charges that were not representative of ongoing operations. About half of that charge stemmed from bond redemption premiums and fees related to refinancing activities. Separately, we recognized the impact of modest restructuring activities at several sites around the world. And finally, there were initial onetime costs related to the proposed Vitro acquisition. In all, EPS was at the high end of the range as somewhat weaker-than-expected volumes in Brazil were offset by a tax rate that was marginally better than expected.
Moving to Slide 8. We continue to actively manage our capital structure. We renewed our bank credit agreement in the quarter and repaid $300 million in high-coupon debt that was due in 2016. Both of these efforts enhanced our credit and liquidity profile. 
As noted earlier, the strong U.S. dollar negatively impacted our consolidated earnings. However, this trend favorably impacted the considerable amount of non-U.S. dollar-denominated debt that we have in our capital structure.
Like many other manufacturing companies, we have a large pension liability to manage. In recent years, we have taken actions to reduce that liability, including buyouts and converting several major plans to defined contribution plans. 
Keep in mind that our underlying earnings performance is partially masked by pension accounting guidelines. If you back out the noncash charge in pension related to the amortization of actuarial loss, for instance, you would see that the business is generating $0.50 per share higher earnings than one sees in a quick review of our financials.
On the equity side, our buybacks this year amounted to 4 million shares. We expect to repurchase another 25 million shares by the end of 2015.
Turning to the third quarter outlook on Slide 9. Currency will continue to be a strong headwind. We reported adjusted EPS of $0.75 per share in the third quarter of last year. Using June 30 rates, prior year results were more like $0.60, an impact of about 20%. Overall, we do not see material changes from the first half of 2015 in the business environment. That said, let me provide some insight on our third quarter outlook by region on a constant currency basis.
In Europe, volumes should be stable with the prior year, and the year-on-year price declines experienced in the first half of 2015 will continue rather than abate, as we had expected. While most of our engineering projects were concentrated in the first half of 2015, we do expect some work to continue into the early part of the third quarter. Production and efficiency should improve over the course of the quarter. 
We estimate the combined effect of price and production downtime will negatively impact results by nearly $20 million compared to the prior year. However, this should be partially offset by the $8 million energy credit mentioned earlier.
For North America, gains in craft beer, spirits, food and non-alcoholic beverages should counterbalance the continued decline in mega beer. We expect continued performance of our manufacturing and supply chain operations, which will compare favorably with prior year largely due to our efforts to better match production with sales. However, this will be partially offset by the costs associated with 2 more furnace rebuilds in the prior year quarter. Overall, we expect North American profit to be modestly higher than the prior year.
In South America, we anticipate that price increases will mitigate cost inflation. We expect sales volumes will be down low single digits, reflecting macro uncertainty primarily in Brazil. As a result, we see South America generating lower year-over-year operating profit.
In Asia Pacific, we expect segment profit will improve modestly from prior year. In sluggish overall market conditions, our volumes should benefit from the new beer contract in Australia. The region will also benefit from less production downtime. 
Nonoperational items should be favorable compared to the prior year. Lower pension and interest expense will help. Keep in mind that the $0.15 currency adjustment already noted includes the translation benefit from interest expense related to our non-U.S. dollar-denominated debt.
While we see no change in our annual tax rate guidance, the third quarter rate should be at the low end of our full year range. Plus, EPS will benefit by $0.01 or $0.02 from a lower share count. 
Taking into account all the puts and takes, we expect our adjusted EPS to be in line with the prior year in constant currency terms. Note that the U.S. dollar has strengthened compared to June 30 rates. If current rates hold, the currency pressures would reduce EPS by another $0.03 in the third quarter compared to this outlook.
Let's turn to our full year guidance on Slide 10. We are taking $0.10 off the upper end of our previous EPS guidance, reflecting economic weakness in Brazil and ongoing competitive pressures in Europe. That said, we still expect second half year-on-year comparisons to fare better than those of the first half. Sales volumes other than in South America are expected to be modestly better year-over-year, and production volumes should improve driven by higher sales and more normal levels of engineering and maintenance activity.
We have not changed our target for cash flow for the year. Although the midpoint of our earnings guidance is modestly lower, other cash flow sources and uses are tracking with our expectation. Notwithstanding this year's $80 million currency headwind on cash flow, we remain focused on generating $250 million in free cash flow in 2015. 
Of course, while we generate cash in local currency, our cash flow is reported in U.S. dollars. Since we make most of our cash in the fourth quarter, exchange rates in that quarter will have a significant impact on full year results. 
Please note that this guidance excludes any impact of the proposed acquisition of Vitro's food and beverage glass container business.
At this point, let me turn the call back over to Al."

As you know, in May, we announced an agreement with Vitro, a leading glass container producer in Mexico and Bolivia, to acquire their food and beverage glass container business. From a financial perspective, we expect the transaction to be immediately accretive to earnings and cash flow. In the third year after closing, we anticipate EPS accretion will reach approximately $0.50 per share as we deliver on the rising impact of highly achievable low-cost synergies. By that time, we also expect the transaction will add at least $100 million in incremental free cash flow. The Mexican glass container segment is strong and has continued to demonstrate healthy demand trends. 
We presently expect to close the transaction on the second half of 2015, earlier than our original expectations. In early July, the waiting period under Hart-Scott Rodino expired without any action taken by the Federal Trade Commission. The transaction is still subject to approval from the Mexican Federal Competition Commission and the National Foreign Investment Commission, and we're working with these agencies as appropriate to support their reviews and their -- to come to their conclusions. Internally, teams from both companies are appropriately collaborating to achieve a successful integration.
As we stated at the outset, the leadership of Vitro business including the plans will largely remain intact. While we have identified specific ways in which we believe we can add value, we absolutely want to capitalize on Vitro's proven track record of meeting customer needs and serving local markets.
Andres Lopez is playing a critical role in the Vitro acquisition, and he has been heavily involved in integrating the planning and will ensure that we meet critical milestones in this transaction. We are deep into preparation for the financing of the deal so that we can access the credit markets soon and timely enough to be ready for a closing this year. 
We believe the transaction represents a significant opportunity to create shareholder value, extend our global franchise in glass and cement and build upon our position as the world's leading glass packaging company. It provides access to a strong and growing market in which we have virtually no presence. It also allows us to grow with our multinational customers as they tap into Mexico's market. And seen together with our joint venture with Constellation, the Vitro business enhances our position to participate in the growing segments of the U.S. market served by Mexico.
As I wrap up on Slide 12, I want to highlight a couple of our priorities for the second half of 2015. The CEO succession process is progressing smoothly and Andres Lopez is primed to assume the CEO role by the end of this year. He has been actively shaping his future leadership team. In the quarter, he was able to hand over his Latin America and North American leadership responsibilities to Miguel Alvarez and Sergio Galindo, respectively. 
Tim Connors, formerly the General Manager of Australia and Asia Pacific CFO, succeeded Sergio as President of Asia Pacific. In addition, we hired as our Chief Marketing Officer. He brings a wealth of rich packaging experience to the company. 
Andres and his team are developing the company's short- and long-term strategy, which he will present to the board later this year. And he's also actively engaging with our shareholders and the broader investment community with several events scheduled for the back half of the year. He intends to discuss the company's new strategic and financial plan with investors in the first quarter of next year.
We are continuing with the CFO selection process. We expect to announce a decision on the role before our next earnings call.
Despite a backdrop of uncertain macros, we feel that the volume stability in North America, Europe and now Asia Pacific are positive signs. Although the evolution of volume in Brazil is difficult to predict, typically we have seen a V-shaped recovery in the past, and this may well be the case again. Our engagement in Mexico is a very positive step forward, and with all the work we are doing to improve our operations and cost position, we are setting a firm foundation on which the new leadership of O-I can build.
And now I will ask the -- Jeremy, the operator, to open up the lines for your questions."

That's not going to happen this year. And also, in Europe, we really had a underproduction in the first half of this year because of the construction projects, and we need to make sure that we have a sufficient level of inventory as we go into next year. So those 2 factors, and it's really all mainly production related, combined, of course, with some expectations of volume stability, which we have seen evolving over the last couple of months, is going to be a significant factor for the differentiation in the performance in the second half of the year. And perhaps John can add 1 or 2 comments as well on specifics."

Shorter term, Al, can you help us parse what you think the effect of the World Cup swing and what the effect of the macro is in that decline being driven by Brazil is? I kind of remember last year's overall South American volumes being up only about a couple percent in aggregate. Correct me if I'm wrong on that comparison. And then the other part of the question is, back in the late 1990s when you had a lot of similar factors at work, emerging markets declining, the dollar being strong, you saw some very interesting trade patterns in glass, one-way glass, returnable glass and one-way packaging.

Comparing to 2013, the volume reduction is really single digits and mid-single digits, I would say. And so I think that's more reflective of the economic impact. I believe that given the overall currency evolution in the region, because this also applies to Colombia, this applies to Peru, this applies to Brazil, of course, is going to be beneficial for economics in the manufacturing process for our customer base and then the -- and the packaging base that they supply to the marketplace, so typically we would expect that a lower value of the currency will lead to a greater drive to economics and packaging, which would favor returnable packaging, which I believe answers the question, at least conventionally, that you have with regard to the potential impact on the mix of one way versus returnables."

And even though, of course, the top line is impacted by the currency, the reported EBITDA was very strong and showed a very strong evolution or very strong growth in reality. So I believe the processes are in place. And a significant portion of the Mexican business is also in the United States, and, of course, clearly some of the cost structures in Mexico are based on U.S. dollar. So there are pass-through provisions that would make sure that, that is going to not burden the results and the profit generation capability in the future. I believe, as we have said, that what we're seeing at this point in time from published information is very much on track and on track with what we assumed when we made the deal, when we announced the deal to you. And we're very encouraged by what we've seen so far. And I would expect that the strength of the profitability profile is really driven by a variety of factors. First of all, it's the distribution of the customer base, which is very similar to Latin America, where we also tend to have fairly high margins over a series of years because the customer base is a much more distributed customer base. On -- secondly, I believe also that the contracts that Vitro engaged in with regard to supply of Constellation perhaps added additional earnings generation on an existing cost base, which really, I believe, give us a pretty good assurance that these margins are sustainable for quite a while."

So that's indicative of what we have been doing so far this year. I believe also what we will see is a considerable draw of inventory still in the third quarter, which is the peak quarter in Europe. And of course, with the lower output that we had in the first half of the year because of the construction projects and the start-up of the plants and investments that we've made, that is going to lead to a need to build up inventory as we go into next year to be able to supply our customers in a fashion that allows us to be on time and to deal with the demand profile that we expect at this point in time to come next year."

At the same time, we're looking at fairly stable earnings. So the moving pieces within that is working capital will be a benefit. It won't be as much of a benefit as we had last year. But as Al mentioned, we expect we can have better performance in packaging costs as inventory levels were higher in North America last year, which required more pallets and tier sheets and things like that. We don't expect that type of spending. We expect restructuring costs to be down overall. We expect asbestos payments be down as well as the pension that Al mentioned before. And of course, that -- as we have discussed in the past, the Italian VAT litigation was actually requiring cash outlays in the last couple of years. It now becomes a cash source this year as we get some money back there. So overall, we feel comfortable that all those puts and takes brings us to the $250 million in cash flow for the year."

Well, I think we are making quite a significant investment in footprint adjustments in Europe and been working at it for the last 2 or 3 years. And it really has been addressing misalignments of where we had manufacturing facilities, where we had capacity to where the market strengths have been. So that is going to continue. And I believe that at this point in time, it's very well balanced with what we are seeing in the overall volume evolution and demand profile. In North America, we constantly are looking at adjustments here and there. And I think as you saw in the Note 1 items, we did some light restructuring in North America to make some adjustments for the volume changes that we're seeing. But again, it's really addressing more a change in the demand pattern than a decline in overall volume because I believe if you look over the last couple of years, our sales in North America have remained fairly stable. And then, of course, in Latin America, again in the quarter, we made some adjustments to the capacity in Latin America because of the reduced demand and there is no need to keep this capacity in abeyance. And you know our rule or our approach has been, particularly in Brazil, that we want to make sure that in Brazil, we don't have an overcapacity because of the high manufacturing costs that we typically have in that country. And so we have taken the steps there. So I believe it's an ongoing process, Ghansham. And I think that looking down the road, we're in pretty good position at this point in time with regard to our balance of supply and demand and -- or capacity and demand as we go into the next year."

I think it really, from our perspective, has more to do with logic because, as you could tell from our comments, volume in Europe, despite last year being a pretty strong second quarter, was fairly stable this year. We've seen some of our competitors, particularly those that are active in Southern Europe, showing some slight increases in volume, between 2% and 3%, which really would indicate to me that demand is pretty solid, which typically would not be an environment where you would see a lot of price competition. I believe it really had to do with the transaction that is pending at this point in time in Europe, where the seller most probably wanted to optimize the profile of the company, and that, of course, has led to an instability in the marketplace. Once that instability is there, it takes a while to dissipate to eventually get out of the system. And we were possibly a bit too optimistic that the stronger demand profile we are gradually seeing evolving in Europe would counteract some of the price pressure. And -- at least it hasn't happened yet. As John indicated in his comments, we expect that as we go into the negotiation for next year with our customers, that, that will have a more positive effect on pricing because it gives people an opportunity to reset as we go into those discussions."

So we're also now basically overtaking that impact that we saw in the first 2 quarters of this year, which leads to a strengthening of the comparables.

And I mentioned the investment that we made in Jarvakandi. Equally, we're making a significant investment in Villotta, which really is using a combination of technologies. And as you said, oxy fired has been around for a long time, but the way we are applying it is in a combination of factors that has not been really used that way in the glass industry or in the container -- glass container industry. And it's a combination of using waste heat much more efficiently to save energy, to generate additional components that are needed for the process or to be able to reduce waste heat, also to reduce the energy input into the furnace. I think those are the factors that really have quite a significant impact. And I believe that will progress as we make investments and particularly in the case of Europe where in Europe the energy component of the manufacturing cost is twice as high as the energy component of manufacturing cost in the United States. So really makes sense to do it in Europe. With regard to the broader and longer-term technology aspects that we have talked about in the past, as I have said, we will not see a major impact until the end of this decade. So that's 4, 5 years out at this point in time. But I certainly would say that we will see a progression of events that we will, when it's appropriate at that point in time, then talk about.

I'll begin with a summary of the quarter on Slide 3. We were able to achieve solid results in the quarter despite sluggish macroeconomic conditions in many markets, a continued strong U.S. dollar and several major engi",971,"Thank you, Dave, and good morning. I'll begin with a summary of the quarter on Slide 3. 
We were able to achieve solid results in the quarter despite sluggish macroeconomic conditions in many markets, a continued strong U.S. dollar and several major engineering projects in our plants. Our adjusted EPS was $0.60, which was at the high end of our guidance range. Adjusted EPS was down $0.20 compared to the prior year yet by $0.05 on a constant currency basis. Overall, lower segment operating profit was mostly offset by the effect of favorable nonoperating items.
Given our global footprint, we had variations in our regional performance. Sales volume increased in North America despite the ongoing decline in mega beer. In Asia Pacific, benefits from last year's restructuring in Australia largely mitigated lower sales and production volume. Declines in Europe were caused by lower prices as well as lower output stemming from plant engineering and maintenance activity while volume remained relatively stable. And in South America, the bottom line was impacted by lower sales volume of beer in Brazil. The majority of the drop in beer reflected the record sales volume achieved in the comparison period of 2014 as a result of the World Cup. Brazil's broader economic weakness contributed to the rest of the decline.
We continued to actively manage our capital structure in the second quarter. We refinanced our bank credit agreement, repaid $300 million of high-coupon bonds and completed our $100 million accelerated share repurchase program. And due to the hard work of many teams on the status of reviews by the regulatory agencies, we anticipate that our proposed acquisition of Vitro's food and beverage business in Mexico will close in the second half of this year.
Turning now to an overview of our performance by region beginning on Slide 4. The weaker results in Europe were significantly impacted by currency headwinds. Currency devaluation in the region drove more than 90% of the revenue decline and 40% of the decrease in operating profit.
Despite broad uncertainty in the Eurozone, our sales volumes were in line with relatively strong shipments realized in the prior year. Beer volumes even increased 2% as the benefits of our approach to long-term contracts in 2014 began to take hold.
As we have previously discussed, our results in Southern Europe were pressured by competitive dynamics in wine that impacted both price and volume. While cost inflation in Europe remained fairly benign, lower prices in the region led to a price-cost gap of approximately $10 million, similar to our experience in the first quarter of this year. 
European profits also were impacted by a higher-than-normal amount of furnace rebuild activity as well as production downtime related to ongoing asset optimization efforts. While these efforts can impact short-term profitability, they are, of course, designed to make changes that yield long-term benefits. For instance, we recently celebrated the installation of a gas-oxy furnace system in Jarvakandi, Estonia. By using purified oxygen, we can melt glass using less energy. We're installing similar systems in other plants in an effort to reduce overall energy consumption and thereby also significantly reducing our emissions.
A final element to note in Europe's profitability relates to an energy rebate we received in the second quarter of 2014. We will receive another energy credit of approximately $8 million this year but not until the third quarter.
Summing up the region, Europe's volume was fairly stable, but bottom line results in constant currency were dampened by roughly equal parts of industry price pressure, production downtime and the timing of the energy credit.
Moving on to more favorable results in North America. There, segment profit was up slightly in constant currency from the prior year. Sales volume was up nearly 2%. A modest decline in mega beer was surpassed by gains across all other categories. Prices in the quarter were slightly lower mostly due to the contractual pass-through of lower natural gas costs. 
By design, production volume in the quarter was lower than prior year. Recall that in the second quarter of 2014, we ran our assets hard in anticipation of strong summer sales that then did not materialize. This year, we did a better job balancing production with sales. In fact, we reported significantly improved warehouse and delivery cost and a double-digit decrease in finished goods inventory.
Turning to Slide 5. Similar to last quarter, our results in South America were severely impacted by currency valuation. On a constant currency basis, operating profit was lower due to a 10% decline in shipments. Low consumer confidence amid economic uncertainty in Brazil led to lower on-premise consumption where glass is the primary packaging option. Brazil accounted for nearly 90% of the region's volume decline, almost all of which was beer. As I mentioned earlier, demand was at record levels in the comparable period of 2014. And in fact, compared with 2013, Brazil volumes were down low single digits, which more aptly reflects the underlying market conditions.
Inflation in the region picked up considerably in the quarter. As we reported earlier, this was driven by substantially higher electricity costs and the currency impact on dollar-denominated purchases of soda ash. The successful efforts of our commercial teams virtually offset all of the inflation.
Asia Pacific results improved slightly from the prior year on a constant currency basis. Shipments were down 3%. While the Australian wine market began to stabilize, the overall beer market may still be a few quarters away from reaching a bottom. Also keep in mind that we now have lapped the unfavorable comparisons resulting from last year's retrenchment activities in China. Improved results in Asia Pacific mostly reflect benefits from the prior year's restructuring efforts to better align supply with demand in Australia.
With that, I'll turn the call over to John to review our financial performance."

Due to the very strong impact of foreign currency translation, we are again showing prior year results on a constant currency basis.

Due to the very strong impact of foreign currency translation, we are again showing prior year results on a constant currency basis. We believe this provides a clearer picture of our underlying performance.
In the second quarter of 2015, sales were $1.5 billion. This is 15% lower than prior year. You can see that $240 million, or more than 90% of the decline, was attributed to the stronger U.S. dollar.
Price was flat at the enterprise level. Higher prices in South America were essentially offset by modestly lower prices in the other regions. 
Shipments globally were down about 1%. Excluding Brazil, volumes were flat year-on-year.
As you can see in the right-hand side at the slide, our segment operating profit was $187 million, down from $262 million in the prior year. As expected, the stronger dollar weighed heavily on segment operating profits. Beyond that, price and the margin impact on sales volume carried over from the top line. Results were impacted by cost inflation, the effective engineering activity on production and prior year onetime items that we've already discussed.
Moving to EPS on Slide 7. Second quarter adjusted EPS was $0.60, which compared to $0.65 in the prior year quarter in constant currency. On the whole, the main components of earnings moved in the direction on the order of magnitude consistent with the guidance we presented at sell-side conference in early June. Segment operating profit accounted for a $0.19 headwind. The net of nonoperational items added $0.14 to our EPS.
Corporate costs were favorable and benefited from lower pension expense and higher machine parts sales for engineering projects conducted by our licensees. 
We realized a $0.02 benefit from net interest expense in the quarter driven by the debt refinancing already mentioned. 
We had an effective tax rate of 17% in the quarter, lower than the prior year rate. That said, we expect that our full year 2015 tax rate will be between 23% and 25%. 
The $100 million accelerated share repurchase program that we finished in May reduced our share count and contributed about $0.02 to EPS. For the full year, we expect about a $0.05 favorable impact on EPS from share repurchases.
Let me shift momentarily to GAAP EPS. In the second quarter, we reported $61 million of pretax charges that were not representative of ongoing operations. About half of that charge stemmed from bond redemption premiums and fees related to refinancing activities. Separately, we recognized the impact of modest restructuring activities at several sites around the world. And finally, there were initial onetime costs related to the proposed Vitro acquisition. In all, EPS was at the high end of the range as somewhat weaker-than-expected volumes in Brazil were offset by a tax rate that was marginally better than expected.
Moving to Slide 8. We continue to actively manage our capital structure. We renewed our bank credit agreement in the quarter and repaid $300 million in high-coupon debt that was due in 2016. Both of these efforts enhanced our credit and liquidity profile. 
As noted earlier, the strong U.S. dollar negatively impacted our consolidated earnings. However, this trend favorably impacted the considerable amount of non-U.S. dollar-denominated debt that we have in our capital structure.
Like many other manufacturing companies, we have a large pension liability to manage. In recent years, we have taken actions to reduce that liability, including buyouts and converting several major plans to defined contribution plans. 
Keep in mind that our underlying earnings performance is partially masked by pension accounting guidelines. If you back out the noncash charge in pension related to the amortization of actuarial loss, for instance, you would see that the business is generating $0.50 per share higher earnings than one sees in a quick review of our financials.
On the equity side, our buybacks this year amounted to 4 million shares. We expect to repurchase another 25 million shares by the end of 2015.
Turning to the third quarter outlook on Slide 9. Currency will continue to be a strong headwind. We reported adjusted EPS of $0.75 per share in the third quarter of last year. Using June 30 rates, prior year results were more like $0.60, an impact of about 20%. Overall, we do not see material changes from the first half of 2015 in the business environment. That said, let me provide some insight on our third quarter outlook by region on a constant currency basis.
In Europe, volumes should be stable with the prior year, and the year-on-year price declines experienced in the first half of 2015 will continue rather than abate, as we had expected. While most of our engineering projects were concentrated in the first half of 2015, we do expect some work to continue into the early part of the third quarter. Production and efficiency should improve over the course of the quarter. 
We estimate the combined effect of price and production downtime will negatively impact results by nearly $20 million compared to the prior year. However, this should be partially offset by the $8 million energy credit mentioned earlier.
For North America, gains in craft beer, spirits, food and non-alcoholic beverages should counterbalance the continued decline in mega beer. We expect continued performance of our manufacturing and supply chain operations, which will compare favorably with prior year largely due to our efforts to better match production with sales. However, this will be partially offset by the costs associated with 2 more furnace rebuilds in the prior year quarter. Overall, we expect North American profit to be modestly higher than the prior year.
In South America, we anticipate that price increases will mitigate cost inflation. We expect sales volumes will be down low single digits, reflecting macro uncertainty primarily in Brazil. As a result, we see South America generating lower year-over-year operating profit.
In Asia Pacific, we expect segment profit will improve modestly from prior year. In sluggish overall market conditions, our volumes should benefit from the new beer contract in Australia. The region will also benefit from less production downtime. 
Nonoperational items should be favorable compared to the prior year. Lower pension and interest expense will help. Keep in mind that the $0.15 currency adjustment already noted includes the translation benefit from interest expense related to our non-U.S. dollar-denominated debt.
While we see no change in our annual tax rate guidance, the third quarter rate should be at the low end of our full year range. Plus, EPS will benefit by $0.01 or $0.02 from a lower share count. 
Taking into account all the puts and takes, we expect our adjusted EPS to be in line with the prior year in constant currency terms. Note that the U.S. dollar has strengthened compared to June 30 rates. If current rates hold, the currency pressures would reduce EPS by another $0.03 in the third quarter compared to this outlook.
Let's turn to our full year guidance on Slide 10. We are taking $0.10 off the upper end of our previous EPS guidance, reflecting economic weakness in Brazil and ongoing competitive pressures in Europe. That said, we still expect second half year-on-year comparisons to fare better than those of the first half. Sales volumes other than in South America are expected to be modestly better year-over-year, and production volumes should improve driven by higher sales and more normal levels of engineering and maintenance activity.
We have not changed our target for cash flow for the year. Although the midpoint of our earnings guidance is modestly lower, other cash flow sources and uses are tracking with our expectation. Notwithstanding this year's $80 million currency headwind on cash flow, we remain focused on generating $250 million in free cash flow in 2015. 
Of course, while we generate cash in local currency, our cash flow is reported in U.S. dollars. Since we make most of our cash in the fourth quarter, exchange rates in that quarter will have a significant impact on full year results. 
Please note that this guidance excludes any impact of the proposed acquisition of Vitro's food and beverage glass container business.
At this point, let me turn the call back over to Al."

As you know, in May, we announced an agreement with Vitro, a leading glass container producer in Mexico and Bolivia, to acquire their food and beverage glass container business. From a financial perspective, we expect the transaction to be immediately accretive to earnings and cash flow. In the third year after closing, we anticipate EPS accretion will reach approximately $0.50 per share as we deliver on the rising impact of highly achievable low-cost synergies. By that time, we also expect the transaction will add at least $100 million in incremental free cash flow. The Mexican glass container segment is strong and has continued to demonstrate healthy demand trends. 
We presently expect to close the transaction in the second half of 2015, earlier than our original expectations. In early July, the waiting period under Hart-Scott Rodino expired without any action taken by the Federal Trade Commission. The transaction is still subject to approval from the Mexican Federal Competition Commission and the National Foreign Investment Commission, and we're working with these agencies as appropriate to support their reviews and their -- to come to their conclusions. Internally, teams from both companies are appropriately collaborating to achieve a successful integration.
As we stated at the outset, the leadership of Vitro business including the plans will largely remain intact. While we have identified specific ways in which we believe we can add value, we absolutely want to capitalize on Vitro's proven track record of meeting customer needs and serving local markets.
Andres Lopez is playing a critical role in the Vitro acquisition, and he has been heavily involved in integrating the planning and will ensure that we meet critical milestones in this transaction. We are deep into preparation for the financing of the deal so that we can access the credit markets soon and timely enough to be ready for a closing this year. 
We believe the transaction represents a significant opportunity to create shareholder value, extend our global franchise in glass and cement and build upon our position as the world's leading glass packaging company. It provides access to a strong and growing market in which we have virtually no presence. It also allows us to grow with our multinational customers as they tap into Mexico's market. And seen together with our joint venture with Constellation, the Vitro business enhances our position to participate in the growing segments of the U.S. market served by Mexico.
As I wrap up on Slide 12, I want to highlight a couple of our priorities for the second half of 2015. The CEO succession process is progressing smoothly and Andres Lopez is primed to assume the CEO role by the end of this year. He has been actively shaping his future leadership team. In the quarter, he was able to hand over his Latin America and North American leadership responsibilities to Miguel Alvarez and Sergio Galindo, respectively. 
Tim Connors, formerly the General Manager of Australia and Asia Pacific CFO, succeeded Sergio as President of Asia Pacific. In addition, we hired Suley Muratoglu as our Chief Marketing Officer. He brings a wealth of rich packaging experience to the company. 
Andres and his team are developing the company's short- and long-term strategy, which he will present to the board later this year. And he's also actively engaging with our shareholders and the broader investment community with several events scheduled for the back half of the year. He intends to discuss the company's new strategic and financial plan with investors in the first quarter of next year.
We are continuing with the CFO selection process. We expect to announce a decision on the role before our next earnings call.
Despite a backdrop of uncertain macros, we feel that the volume stability in North America, Europe and now Asia Pacific are positive signs. Although the evolution of volume in Brazil is difficult to predict, typically we have seen a V-shaped recovery in the past, and this may well be the case again. Our engagement in Mexico is a very positive step forward, and with all the work we are doing to improve our operations and cost position, we are setting a firm foundation on which the new leadership of O-I can build.
And now I will ask the -- Jeremy, the operator, to open up the lines for your questions."

That's not going to happen this year. And also, in Europe, we really had a underproduction in the first half of this year because of the construction projects, and we need to make sure that we have a sufficient level of inventory as we go into next year. So those 2 factors, and it's really all mainly production related, combined, of course, with some expectations of volume stability, which we have seen evolving over the last couple of months, is going to be a significant factor for the differentiation in the performance in the second half of the year. And perhaps John can add 1 or 2 comments as well on specifics."

Shorter term, Al, can you help us parse what you think the effect of the World Cup swing and what the effect of the macro is in that decline being driven by Brazil is? I kind of remember last year's overall South American volumes being up only about a couple percent in aggregate. Correct me if I'm wrong on that comparison. And then the other part of the question is, back in the late 1990s when you had a lot of similar factors at work, emerging markets declining, the dollar being strong, you saw some very interesting trade patterns in glass, one-way glass, returnable glass and one-way packaging. How do you see those playing out here in this potentially comparable cycle?"

Comparing to 2013, the volume reduction is really single digits and mid-single digits, I would say. And so I think that's more reflective of the economic impact. I believe that given the overall currency evolution in the region, because this also applies to Colombia, this applies to Peru, this applies to Brazil, of course, is going to be beneficial for economics in the manufacturing process for our customer base and then the -- and the packaging base that they supply to the marketplace, so typically we would expect that a lower value of the currency will lead to a greater drive to economics in packaging, which would favor returnable packaging, which I believe answers the question, at least conventionally, that you have with regard to the potential impact on the mix of one way versus returnables."

And even though, of course, the top line is impacted by the currency, the reported EBITDA was very strong and showed a very strong evolution or a very strong growth in reality. So I believe the processes are in place. And a significant portion of the Mexican business is also in the United States, and, of course, clearly some of the cost structures in Mexico are based on U.S. dollar. So there are pass-through provisions that would make sure that, that is going to not burden the results and the profit generation capability in the future. I believe, as we have said, that what we're seeing at this point in time from published information is very much on track and on track with what we assumed when we made the deal, when we announced the deal to you. And we're very encouraged by what we've seen so far. And I would expect that the strength of the profitability profile is really driven by a variety of factors. First of all, it's the distribution of the customer base, which is very similar to Latin America, where we also tend to have fairly high margins over a series of years because the customer base is a much more distributed customer base. On -- secondly, I believe also that the contracts that Vitro engaged in with regard to supply of Constellation perhaps added additional earnings generation on an existing cost base, which really, I believe, give us a pretty good assurance that these margins are sustainable for quite a while."

At the same time, we're looking at fairly stable earnings. So the moving pieces within that is working capital will be a benefit. It won't be as much of a benefit as we had last year. But as Al mentioned, we expect we can have better performance in packaging costs as inventory levels were higher in North America last year, which required more pallets and tier sheets and things like that. We don't expect that type of spending. We expect restructuring costs to be down overall. We expect asbestos payments be down as well as the pension that Al mentioned before. And of course, that as we have discussed in the past, the Italian VAT litigation was actually requiring cash outlays in the last couple of years. It now becomes a cash source this year as we get some money back there. So overall, we feel comfortable that all those puts and takes brings us to the $250 million in cash flow for the year."

Well, I think we are making quite a significant investment in footprint adjustments in Europe and been working at it for the last 2 or 3 years. And it really has been addressing misalignments of where we had manufacturing facilities, where we had capacity to where the market strengths have been. So that is going to continue. And I believe that at this point in time, it's very well balanced with what we are seeing in the overall volume evolution and demand profile. In North America, we constantly are looking at adjustments here and there. And I think as you saw in the Note 1 items, we did some light restructuring in North America to make some adjustments for the volume changes that we're seeing. But again, it's really addressing more a change in the demand pattern than a decline in overall volume because I believe if you look over the last couple of years, our sales in North America have remained fairly stable. And then, of course, in Latin America, again in the quarter, we made some adjustments to the capacity in Latin America because of the reduced demand and there is no need to keep this capacity in abeyance. And you know our rule or our approach has been, particularly in Brazil, that we want to make sure that in Brazil, we don't have an overcapacity because of the high manufacturing costs that we typically have in that country. And so we have taken the steps there. So I believe it's an ongoing process, Ghansham. And I think that looking down the road, we're in pretty good position at this point in time with regard to our balance of supply and demand and -- or capacity and demand as we go into the next year."

I think it really, from our perspective, has more to do with logic because, as you could tell from our comments, volume in Europe, despite last year being a pretty strong second quarter, was fairly stable this year. We've seen some of our competitors, particularly those that are active in Southern Europe, showing some slight increases in volume, between 2% and 3%, which really would indicate to me that demand is pretty solid, which typically would not be an environment where you would see a lot of price competition. I believe it really had to do with the transaction that is pending at this point in time in Europe, where the seller most probably wanted to optimize the profile of the company, and that, of course, has led to an instability in the marketplace. Once that instability is there, it takes a while to dissipate to eventually get out of the system. And we were possibly a bit too optimistic that the stronger demand profile we are gradually seeing evolving in Europe would counteract some of the price pressure. And -- at least it hasn't happened yet. As John indicated in his comments, we expect that as we go into the negotiation for next year with our customers, that, that will have a more positive effect on pricing because it gives people an opportunity to reset as we go into those discussions."

So that trend is continuing. Also, you will recall that last year, midyear, we lost a significant wine contract. So we're also now basically overtaking that impact that we saw in the first 2 quarters of this year, which leads to a strengthening of the comparables. And then as we have signaled already since last year, we had an agreement for a significant beer contract to bump up volumes in the second half of this year, which is also most probably going to set us a little bit apart from the general trends that we still observe in the market.

I believe with regard to some of the insights that we're achieving in our research and development, we are already applying them into our existing infrastructure. And I mentioned the investment that we made in Jarvakandi. Equally, we're making a significant investment in Villotta, which really is using a combination of technologies. And as you said, oxy fired has been around for a long time, but the way we are applying it is in a combination of factors that has not been really used that way in the glass industry or in the container -- glass container industry. And it's a combination of using waste heat much more efficiently to save energy, to generate additional components that are needed for the process or to be able to reduce waste heat, also to reduce the energy input into the furnace. I think those are the factors that really have quite a significant impact. And I believe that will progress as we make investments and particularly in the case of Europe where in Europe the energy component of the manufacturing cost is twice as high as the energy component of manufacturing cost in the United States. So it really makes sense to do it in Europe. With regard to the broader and longer-term technology aspects that we have talked about in the past, as I have said, we will not see a major impact until the end of this decade. So that's 4, 5 years out at this point in time. But I certainly would say that we will see a progression of events that we will, when it's appropriate at that point in time, then talk about. But certainly, it has focus, it has the attention of the organization. And you'll have the opportunity to see our facilities.

I'll begin with a summary of the quarter on Slide 3. We were able to achieve solid results in the quarter despite sluggish macroeconomic conditions in many markets, a continued strong U.S. dollar and several major engi",971,"Thank you, Dave, and good morning. I'll begin with a summary of the quarter on Slide 3. 
We were able to achieve solid results in the quarter despite sluggish macroeconomic conditions in many markets, a continued strong U.S. dollar and several major engineering projects in our plants. Our adjusted EPS was $0.60, which was at the high end of our guidance range. Adjusted EPS was down $0.20 compared to the prior year yet by $0.05 on a constant currency basis. Overall, lower segment operating profit was mostly offset by the effect of favorable nonoperating items.
Given our global footprint, we had variations in our regional performance. Sales volume increased in North America despite the ongoing decline in mega beer. In Asia Pacific, benefits from last year's restructuring in Australia largely mitigated lower sales and production volume. Declines in Europe were caused by lower prices as well as lower output stemming from plant engineering and maintenance activity while volume remained relatively stable. And in South America, the bottom line was impacted by lower sales volume of beer in Brazil. The majority of the drop in beer reflected the record sales volume achieved in the comparison period of 2014 as a result of the World Cup. Brazil's broader economic weakness contributed to the rest of the decline.
We continued to actively manage our capital structure in the second quarter. We refinanced our bank credit agreement, repaid $300 million of high-coupon bonds and completed our $100 million accelerated share repurchase program. And due to the hard work of many teams on the status of reviews by the regulatory agencies, we anticipate that our proposed acquisition of Vitro's food and beverage business in Mexico will close in the second half of this year.
Turning now to an overview of our performance by region beginning on Slide 4. The weaker results in Europe were significantly impacted by currency headwinds. Currency devaluation in the region drove more than 90% of the revenue decline and 40% of the decrease in operating profit.
Despite broad uncertainty in the Eurozone, our sales volumes were in line with relatively strong shipments realized in the prior year. Beer volumes even increased 2% as the benefits of our approach to long-term contracts in 2014 began to take hold.
As we have previously discussed, our results in Southern Europe were pressured by competitive dynamics in wine that impacted both price and volume. While cost inflation in Europe remained fairly benign, lower prices in the region led to a price-cost gap of approximately $10 million, similar to our experience in the first quarter of this year. 
European profits also were impacted by a higher-than-normal amount of furnace rebuild activity as well as production downtime related to ongoing asset optimization efforts. While these efforts can impact short-term profitability, they are, of course, designed to make changes that yield long-term benefits. For instance, we recently celebrated the installation of a gas-oxy furnace system in Jarvakandi, Estonia. By using purified oxygen, we can melt glass using less energy. We're installing similar systems in other plants in an effort to reduce overall energy consumption and thereby also significantly reducing our emissions.
A final element to note in Europe's profitability relates to an energy rebate we received in the second quarter of 2014. We will receive another energy credit of approximately $8 million this year but not until the third quarter.
Summing up the region, Europe's volume was fairly stable, but bottom line results in constant currency were dampened by roughly equal parts of industry price pressure, production downtime and the timing of the energy credit.
Moving on to more favorable results in North America. There, segment profit was up slightly in constant currency from the prior year. Sales volume was up nearly 2%. A modest decline in mega beer was surpassed by gains across all other categories. Prices in the quarter were slightly lower mostly due to the contractual pass-through of lower natural gas costs. 
By design, production volume in the quarter was lower than prior year. Recall that in the second quarter of 2014, we ran our assets hard in anticipation of strong summer sales that then did not materialize. This year, we did a better job balancing production with sales. In fact, we reported significantly improved warehouse and delivery cost and a double-digit decrease in finished goods inventory.
Turning to Slide 5. Similar to last quarter, our results in South America were severely impacted by currency valuation. On a constant currency basis, operating profit was lower due to a 10% decline in shipments. Low consumer confidence amid economic uncertainty in Brazil led to lower on-premise consumption where glass is the primary packaging option. Brazil accounted for nearly 90% of the region's volume decline, almost all of which was beer. As I mentioned earlier, demand was at record levels in the comparable period of 2014. And in fact, compared with 2013, Brazil volumes were down low single digits, which more aptly reflects the underlying market conditions.
Inflation in the region picked up considerably in the quarter. As we reported earlier, this was driven by substantially higher electricity costs and the currency impact on dollar-denominated purchases of soda ash. The successful efforts of our commercial teams virtually offset all of the inflation.
Asia Pacific results improved slightly from the prior year on a constant currency basis. Shipments were down 3%. While the Australian wine market began to stabilize, the overall beer market may still be a few quarters away from reaching a bottom. Also keep in mind that we now have lapped the unfavorable comparisons resulting from last year's retrenchment activities in China. Improved results in Asia Pacific mostly reflect benefits from the prior year's restructuring efforts to better align supply with demand in Australia.
With that, I'll turn the call over to John to review our financial performance."

Due to the very strong impact of foreign currency translation, we are again showing prior year results on a constant currency basis. We believe this provides a clearer picture of our underlying performance.In the secon",1363,"Thanks, Al. Let's turn to Slide 6. Due to the very strong impact of foreign currency translation, we are again showing prior year results on a constant currency basis. We believe this provides a clearer picture of our underlying performance.
In the second quarter of 2015, sales were $1.5 billion. This is 15% lower than prior year. You can see that $240 million, or more than 90% of the decline, was attributed to the stronger U.S. dollar.
Price was flat at the enterprise level. Higher prices in South America were essentially offset by modestly lower prices in the other regions. 
Shipments globally were down about 1%. Excluding Brazil, volumes were flat year-on-year.
As you can see in the right-hand side at the slide, our segment operating profit was $187 million, down from $262 million in the prior year. As expected, the stronger dollar weighed heavily on segment operating profits. Beyond that, price and the margin impact on sales volume carried over from the top line. Results were impacted by cost inflation, the effective engineering activity on production and prior year onetime items that we've already discussed.
Moving to EPS on Slide 7. Second quarter adjusted EPS was $0.60, which compared to $0.65 in the prior year quarter in constant currency. On the whole, the main components of earnings moved in the direction on the order of magnitude consistent with the guidance we presented at sell-side conference in early June. Segment operating profit accounted for a $0.19 headwind. The net of nonoperational items added $0.14 to our EPS.
Corporate costs were favorable and benefited from lower pension expense and higher machine parts sales for engineering projects conducted by our licensees. 
We realized a $0.02 benefit from net interest expense in the quarter driven by the debt refinancing already mentioned. 
We had an effective tax rate of 17% in the quarter, lower than the prior year rate. That said, we expect that our full year 2015 tax rate will be between 23% and 25%. 
The $100 million accelerated share repurchase program that we finished in May reduced our share count and contributed about $0.02 to EPS. For the full year, we expect about a $0.05 favorable impact on EPS from share repurchases.
Let me shift momentarily to GAAP EPS. In the second quarter, we reported $61 million of pretax charges that were not representative of ongoing operations. About half of that charge stemmed from bond redemption premiums and fees related to refinancing activities. Separately, we recognized the impact of modest restructuring activities at several sites around the world. And finally, there were initial onetime costs related to the proposed Vitro acquisition. In all, EPS was at the high end of the range as somewhat weaker-than-expected volumes in Brazil were offset by a tax rate that was marginally better than expected.
Moving to Slide 8. We continue to actively manage our capital structure. We renewed our bank credit agreement in the quarter and repaid $300 million in high-coupon debt that was due in 2016. Both of these efforts enhanced our credit and liquidity profile. 
As noted earlier, the strong U.S. dollar negatively impacted our consolidated earnings. However, this trend favorably impacted the considerable amount of non-U.S. dollar-denominated debt that we have in our capital structure.
Like many other manufacturing companies, we have a large pension liability to manage. In recent years, we have taken actions to reduce that liability, including buyouts and converting several major plans to defined contribution plans. 
Keep in mind that our underlying earnings performance is partially masked by pension accounting guidelines. If you back out the noncash charge in pension related to the amortization of actuarial loss, for instance, you would see that the business is generating $0.50 per share higher earnings than one sees in a quick review of our financials.
On the equity side, our buybacks this year amounted to 4 million shares. We expect to repurchase another 25 million shares by the end of 2015.
Turning to the third quarter outlook on Slide 9. Currency will continue to be a strong headwind. We reported adjusted EPS of $0.75 per share in the third quarter of last year. Using June 30 rates, prior year results were more like $0.60, an impact of about 20%. Overall, we do not see material changes from the first half of 2015 in the business environment. That said, let me provide some insight on our third quarter outlook by region on a constant currency basis.
In Europe, volumes should be stable with the prior year, and the year-on-year price declines experienced in the first half of 2015 will continue rather than abate, as we had expected. While most of our engineering projects were concentrated in the first half of 2015, we do expect some work to continue into the early part of the third quarter. Production and efficiency should improve over the course of the quarter. 
We estimate the combined effect of price and production downtime will negatively impact results by nearly $20 million compared to the prior year. However, this should be partially offset by the $8 million energy credit mentioned earlier.
For North America, gains in craft beer, spirits, food and non-alcoholic beverages should counterbalance the continued decline in mega beer. We expect continued performance of our manufacturing and supply chain operations, which will compare favorably with prior year largely due to our efforts to better match production with sales. However, this will be partially offset by the costs associated with 2 more furnace rebuilds in the prior year quarter. Overall, we expect North American profit to be modestly higher than the prior year.
In South America, we anticipate that price increases will mitigate cost inflation. We expect sales volumes will be down low single digits, reflecting macro uncertainty primarily in Brazil. As a result, we see South America generating lower year-over-year operating profit.
In Asia Pacific, we expect segment profit will improve modestly from prior year. In sluggish overall market conditions, our volumes should benefit from the new beer contract in Australia. The region will also benefit from less production downtime. 
Nonoperational items should be favorable compared to the prior year. Lower pension and interest expense will help. Keep in mind that the $0.15 currency adjustment already noted includes the translation benefit from interest expense related to our non-U.S. dollar-denominated debt.
While we see no change in our annual tax rate guidance, the third quarter rate should be at the low end of our full year range. Plus, EPS will benefit by $0.01 or $0.02 from a lower share count. 
Taking into account all the puts and takes, we expect our adjusted EPS to be in line with the prior year in constant currency terms. Note that the U.S. dollar has strengthened compared to June 30 rates. If current rates hold, the currency pressures would reduce EPS by another $0.03 in the third quarter compared to this outlook.
Let's turn to our full year guidance on Slide 10. We are taking $0.10 off the upper end of our previous EPS guidance, reflecting economic weakness in Brazil and ongoing competitive pressures in Europe. That said, we still expect second half year-on-year comparisons to fare better than those of the first half. Sales volumes other than in South America are expected to be modestly better year-over-year, and production volumes should improve driven by higher sales and more normal levels of engineering and maintenance activity.
We have not changed our target for cash flow for the year. Although the midpoint of our earnings guidance is modestly lower, other cash flow sources and uses are tracking with our expectation. Notwithstanding this year's $80 million currency headwind on cash flow, we remain focused on generating $250 million in free cash flow in 2015. 
Of course, while we generate cash in local currency, our cash flow is reported in U.S. dollars. Since we make most of our cash in the fourth quarter, exchange rates in that quarter will have a significant impact on full year results. 
Please note that this guidance excludes any impact of the proposed acquisition of Vitro's food and beverage glass container business.
At this point, let me turn the call back over to Al."

As you know, in May, we announced an agreement with Vitro, a leading glass container producer in Mexico and Bolivia, to acquire their food and beverage glass container business. From a financial perspective, we expect the transaction to be immediately accretive to earnings and cash flow. In the third year after closing, we anticipate EPS accretion will reach approximately $0.50 per share as we deliver on the rising impact of highly achievable low-cost synergies. By that time, we also expect the transaction will add at least $100 million in incremental free cash flow. The Mexican glass container segment is strong and has continued to demonstrate healthy demand trends. 
We presently expect to close the transaction in the second half of 2015, earlier than our original expectations. In early July, the waiting period under Hart-Scott Rodino expired without any action taken by the Federal Trade Commission. The transaction is still subject to approval from the Mexican Federal Competition Commission and the National Foreign Investment Commission, and we're working with these agencies as appropriate to support their reviews and their -- to come to their conclusions. Internally, teams from both companies are appropriately collaborating to achieve a successful integration.
As we stated at the outset, the leadership of Vitro business including the plans will largely remain intact. While we have identified specific ways in which we believe we can add value, we absolutely want to capitalize on Vitro's proven track record of meeting customer needs and serving local markets.
Andres Lopez is playing a critical role in the Vitro acquisition, and he has been heavily involved in integrating the planning and will ensure that we meet critical milestones in this transaction. We are deep into preparation for the financing of the deal so that we can access the credit markets soon and timely enough to be ready for a closing this year. 
We believe the transaction represents a significant opportunity to create shareholder value, extend our global franchise in glass and cement and build upon our position as the world's leading glass packaging company. It provides access to a strong and growing market in which we have virtually no presence. It also allows us to grow with our multinational customers as they tap into Mexico's market. And seen together with our joint venture with Constellation, the Vitro business enhances our position to participate in the growing segments of the U.S. market served by Mexico.
As I wrap up on Slide 12, I want to highlight a couple of our priorities for the second half of 2015. The CEO succession process is progressing smoothly and Andres Lopez is primed to assume the CEO role by the end of this year. He has been actively shaping his future leadership team. In the quarter, he was able to hand over his Latin America and North American leadership responsibilities to Miguel Alvarez and Sergio Galindo, respectively. 
Tim Connors, formerly the General Manager of Australia and Asia Pacific CFO, succeeded Sergio as President of Asia Pacific. In addition, we hired Suley Muratoglu as our Chief Marketing Officer. He brings a wealth of rich packaging experience to the company. 
Andres and his team are developing the company's short- and long-term strategy, which he will present to the board later this year. And he's also actively engaging with our shareholders and the broader investment community with several events scheduled for the back half of the year. He intends to discuss the company's new strategic and financial plan with investors in the first quarter of next year.
We are continuing with the CFO selection process. We expect to announce a decision on the role before our next earnings call.
Despite a backdrop of uncertain macros, we feel that the volume stability in North America, Europe and now Asia Pacific are positive signs. Although the evolution of volume in Brazil is difficult to predict, typically we have seen a V-shaped recovery in the past, and this may well be the case again. Our engagement in Mexico is a very positive step forward, and with all the work we are doing to improve our operations and cost position, we are setting a firm foundation on which the new leadership of O-I can build.
And now I will ask the -- Jeremy, the operator, to open up the lines for your questions."

That's not going to happen this year. And also, in Europe, we really had a underproduction in the first half of this year because of the construction projects, and we need to make sure that we have a sufficient level of inventory as we go into next year. So those 2 factors, and it's really all mainly production related, combined, of course, with some expectations of volume stability, which we have seen evolving over the last couple of months, is going to be a significant factor for the differentiation in the performance in the second half of the year. And perhaps John can add 1 or 2 comments as well on specifics."

Shorter term, Al, can you help us parse what you think the effect of the World Cup swing and what the effect of the macro is in that decline being driven by Brazil is? I kind of remember last year's overall South American volumes being up only about a couple percent in aggregate. Correct me if I'm wrong on that comparison. And then the other part of the question is, back in the late 1990s when you had a lot of similar factors at work, emerging markets declining, the dollar being strong, you saw some very interesting trade patterns in glass, one-way glass, returnable glass and one-way packaging. How do you see those playing out here in this potentially comparable cycle?"

If I look at last year compared to the previous year, we saw a double-digit increase last year in volume in the second quarter. So that clearly was impacted by the World Cup. And also, it was very close to double digit in the first quarter of last year. So both of these factors, of course, give you some perspective as to what really the underlying economic impact was. Comparing to 2013, the volume reduction is really single digits and mid-single digits, I would say. And so I think that's more reflective of the economic impact. I believe that given the overall currency evolution in the region, because this also applies to Colombia, this applies to Peru, this applies to Brazil, of course, is going to be beneficial for economics in the manufacturing process for our customer base and then the -- and the packaging base that they supply to the marketplace, so typically we would expect that a lower value of the currency will lead to a greater drive to economics in packaging, which would favor returnable packaging, which I believe answers the question, at least conventionally, that you have with regard to the potential impact on the mix of one way versus returnables."

Because ultimately, the question of whether eventually a float gets replaced is a different question from okay, how can we access markets that we can no longer access perhaps with one-way containers economically?

And we -- again, I think Vitro came out a day ago or 2 days ago with their results. And even though, of course, the top line is impacted by the currency, the reported EBITDA was very strong and showed a very strong evolution or a very strong growth in reality. So I believe the processes are in place. And a significant portion of the Mexican business is also in the United States, and, of course, clearly some of the cost structures in Mexico are based on U.S. dollar. So there are pass-through provisions that would make sure that, that is going to not burden the results and the profit generation capability in the future. I believe, as we have said, that what we're seeing at this point in time from published information is very much on track and on track with what we assumed when we made the deal, when we announced the deal to you. And we're very encouraged by what we've seen so far. And I would expect that the strength of the profitability profile is really driven by a variety of factors. First of all, it's the distribution of the customer base, which is very similar to Latin America, where we also tend to have fairly high margins over a series of years because the customer base is a much more distributed customer base. On -- secondly, I believe also that the contracts that Vitro engaged in with regard to supply of Constellation perhaps added additional earnings generation on an existing cost base, which really, I believe, give us a pretty good assurance that these margins are sustainable for quite a while."

At the same time, we're looking at fairly stable earnings. So the moving pieces within that is working capital will be a benefit. It won't be as much of a benefit as we had last year. But as Al mentioned, we expect we can have better performance in packaging costs as inventory levels were higher in North America last year, which required more pallets and tier sheets and things like that. We don't expect that type of spending. We expect restructuring costs to be down overall. We expect asbestos payments be down as well as the pension that Al mentioned before. And of course, that as we have discussed in the past, the Italian VAT litigation was actually requiring cash outlays in the last couple of years. It now becomes a cash source this year as we get some money back there. So overall, we feel comfortable that all those puts and takes brings us to the $250 million in cash flow for the year."

Well, I think we are making quite a significant investment in footprint adjustments in Europe and been working at it for the last 2 or 3 years. And it really has been addressing misalignments of where we had manufacturing facilities, where we had capacity to where the market strengths have been. So that is going to continue. And I believe that at this point in time, it's very well balanced with what we are seeing in the overall volume evolution and demand profile. In North America, we constantly are looking at adjustments here and there. And I think as you saw in the Note 1 items, we did some light restructuring in North America to make some adjustments for the volume changes that we're seeing. But again, it's really addressing more a change in the demand pattern than a decline in overall volume because I believe if you look over the last couple of years, our sales in North America have remained fairly stable. And then, of course, in Latin America, again in the quarter, we made some adjustments to the capacity in Latin America because of the reduced demand and there is no need to keep this capacity in abeyance. And you know our rule or our approach has been, particularly in Brazil, that we want to make sure that in Brazil, we don't have an overcapacity because of the high manufacturing costs that we typically have in that country. And so we have taken the steps there. So I believe it's an ongoing process, Ghansham. And I think that looking down the road, we're in pretty good position at this point in time with regard to our balance of supply and demand and -- or capacity and demand as we go into the next year."

I think it really, from our perspective, has more to do with logic because, as you could tell from our comments, volume in Europe, despite last year being a pretty strong second quarter, was fairly stable this year. We've seen some of our competitors, particularly those that are active in Southern Europe, showing some slight increases in volume, between 2% and 3%, which really would indicate to me that demand is pretty solid, which typically would not be an environment where you would see a lot of price competition. I believe it really had to do with the transaction that is pending at this point in time in Europe, where the seller most probably wanted to optimize the profile of the company, and that, of course, has led to an instability in the marketplace. Once that instability is there, it takes a while to dissipate to eventually get out of the system. And we were possibly a bit too optimistic that the stronger demand profile we are gradually seeing evolving in Europe would counteract some of the price pressure. And -- at least it hasn't happened yet. As John indicated in his comments, we expect that as we go into the negotiation for next year with our customers, that, that will have a more positive effect on pricing because it gives people an opportunity to reset as we go into those discussions."

So we're also now basically overtaking that impact that we saw in the first 2 quarters of this year, which leads to a strengthening of the comparables.

I believe with regard to some of the insights that we're achieving in our research and development, we are already applying them into our existing infrastructure. And I mentioned the investment that we made in Jarvakandi. Equally, we're making a significant investment in Villotta, which really is using a combination of technologies. And as you said, oxy fired has been around for a long time, but the way we are applying it is in a combination of factors that has not been really used that way in the glass industry or in the container -- glass container industry. And it's a combination of using waste heat much more efficiently to save energy, to generate additional components that are needed for the process or to be able to reduce waste heat, also to reduce the energy input into the furnace. I think those are the factors that really have quite a significant impact. And I believe that will progress as we make investments and particularly in the case of Europe where in Europe the energy component of the manufacturing cost is twice as high as the energy component of manufacturing cost in the United States. So it really makes sense to do it in Europe. With regard to the broader and longer-term technology aspects that we have talked about in the past, as I have said, we will not see a major impact until the end of this decade. So that's 4, 5 years out at this point in time. But I certainly would say that we will see a progression of events that we will, when it's appropriate at that point in time, then talk about. But certainly, it has focus, it has the attention of the organization. And you'll have the opportunity to see our facilities.

I'd like to begin our call today by congratulating Andres Lopez on his appointment as a CEO beginning January of next year. Andres has now served as an innovative and visionary member of our leadership team, so his assumption of the CEO role is a natural fit.
We have been working closely this past year to transition responsibilities. As Andres has been playing a key leadership role already, he will lead today's discussion of regional performance. Besides finalizing the CEO's succession process, we completed the acquisition of Vitro's food and beverage glass container business in Mexico, Bolivia and the U.S., much earlier than originally anticipated. I want to complement the transaction teams on both sides for a smooth transition. We are very pleased with the business performance and have included September results in our reported numbers.
Turning to third quarter earnings. Our adjusted EPS was $0.57. The operating performance of our legacy business was essentially flat to the prior year and constant currency and in line with our most recent guidance. While we did not receive a significant energy credit we had expected, lower corporate costs made up for this difference.
Given the uncertainty surrounding the timing of this credit, we have removed it entirely from this year's projections. We anticipated that the acquisition would reduce results by $0.05, given temporary tax expense as we set up the optimal structure in Mexico. And we will are pleased with the operating results of the acquired business in September and also, that its headwind on EPS was less than expected.
Although EPS was $0.18 lower than the prior year third quarter, the difference on a constant currency basis was only $0.03. And these $0.03 were essentially attributable to temporary tax issues related to the acquisition.
Global volumes were up 4% overall. Without the acquired business, global volumes were stable compared to prior year. Segment operating profit in the quarter was lower than prior year third quarter by $9 million in constant currency, and the delta was entirely offset by favorable corporate items.
Now let me turn the call over to you Andres."

I'm both humbled and honored to be given this great opportunity. I've been working with my leadership team and the work to identify the opportunities, prioritize our efforts and determine how we can lead change in the company. One of our first priorities and one we are already working on is stability. We need to bring stability back into all of our operations. Stability can bring significant financial benefits as it is the basis for improved performance in the future.
So as I walk you through our results today for the third quarter, I will mention a couple of places where we are stabilizing the operations as well as all areas where improving performance is creating value.
Let me start with the Europe on Slide 4. Europe's operating performance was in line with our expectations. We were pleased to see an uptick in volumes, primarily related to the improved beer sales. In fact, overall European volumes are slightly up year-to-date.  Operating profit was lower, primarily due to ongoing price pressure and elevated engineering activity. The price pressure stemmed from 2 sources: 1 source is a long-term beer contracts negotiated in 2014; and other source is lower wine price in southern Europe, which were set earlier in the year.
Operating profit was lower than our expectations due to a significant nonoperational item, a legislative delay prevented us from recognizing an $8 million energy credit in the quarter. We are now waiting for clarification as to when or if it will be granted.
We are working to bring more stability in Europe, targeting productivity improvements at selected plants, and completing initiatives associated with the asset optimization program.
Moving to Slide #5 and about North America. The modest decline in North America's operating profit hides the very real progress we are making in this region. We have addressed the significant operational challenges we faced in the third quarter of last year. Again, the objective was stability. 
We had a substantially higher level of engineering activity in this quarter, some devoted to plant furnace rebuilds, some devoted to projects that will lower end-to-end supply chain costs and provide more flexibility as we serve growing segments.  In each case, the temporary impact on downtime and productivity is setting the stage for increased performance in the future. 
Demand trends in the region remain the same. Sales volume of our Legacy business were down 1% in the quarter due to weak demand in mega beer.
With the addition of the U.S. portion of the acquisition, a distribution business now called O-I Packaging Solutions, volumes were up 2%. Integrating this business into our North American operations will be a key area of focus for us going forward. We are excited by the high level of capabilities and enthusiasm the new distribution team brings. 
The team is eager to leverage legacy O-I products in the distribution system. And separately, to meet consumer needs that increasingly prefer craft beer, wine, spirits and non-alcoholic beverages, will continue to advance the flexibility of our operations. We are confident that we are turning the corner in North America and we're gaining stability in the business.
Turning to Slide 6. Latin America earnings adjusted for currency improved from the prior year. This primarily reflects the contribution from the acquisition. Results were down modestly in our Legacy business. This is what we expect. Sales volumes declined 4%. While domestic segments were up slightly in the Andean countries, shipments for Brazil declined primarily driven by beer.
Cost inflation remains high, influenced by currency rates. However, our commercial team was able to secure price gains to largely offset inflation. We are pleased with the results, and we have opportunities to add more value. The most obvious opportunity is the integration of the Mexico and Bolivia operations. Another opportunity is to support our customer's efforts to introduce new product designs and to tap into new markets.  In summary, the region is operating well and we expect this to continue.
Turning to Slide 7. Asia Pacific has turned the corner. We can see the impact of a strong leadership and execution on our results. Our team in Asia Pacific has worked hard to right size the footprint, to improve operating costs, and to earn incremental business. Overall, sales volume was flat for the region. We benefited from a change in the geographic mix with business in Australia up and China down.
The weaker Australian dollar hailed its competitiveness. Australian wine exports are up, and so is our business. For us, beer was up due to a new contract even as mainstream beer in Australia has lost share to craft beer and imports.
Our production profile improved substantially in the quarter. Previously, Australia had a significant amount of planned downtime. With its assets now ramped up, we are introducing more for local markets. As such, we imported fewer containers from China. By minimizing cross regional shipment -- shipping, we grew the cost position of the region. We note the Asia-Pacific team has done a great job of stabilizing the business. They are now focused on incremental performance improvement by working together with customers to meet their needs and collaborating internally across the sales, manufacturing and supply chain functions to ensure sustainable performance gains.
That completes the regional review. So let me turn the call over to John to review performance at the enterprise level."

Third quarter adjusted EPS was $0.57. This compares to a $0.75 last year. The strong U.S. dollar is still a significant headwind for the company, amounting to about $0.15.
In constant currency, our earnings were $0.60 in the prior year quarter. Segment operating profit was lower by $0.04, as Andres just covered with the regions. This was completely offset by lower corporate costs. Pension expense declined and management incentive accruals were trimmed. Corporate also benefited from our modest currency hedging program. Net interest expense and constant currency was higher, mainly due to the borrowings for the acquisition. We had an effective tax rate of 27% in the quarter. This was higher than average, principally reflecting timing issues associated with the set-up of the optimal legal structure for the acquisition.  And EPS benefited from our share buybacks earlier this year.
Let me shift momentarily to gap EPS. In the third quarter, we reported $78 million of pretax charges that were not representative of ongoing operations. We recognized several key charges: Initial onetime costs related to the Mexico acquisition; restructuring activities as several plants around the world; and bond redemption premiums and fees related to refinancing activities. In all, adjusted EPS was modestly higher than our $0.55 guidance.
The Legacy business performed as expected and the ultimate impact of acquisition was a penny or 2 or better than we had expected. Let's turn to our fourth quarter outlook on Slide 9. 
We reported adjusted EPS of $0.46 per share in the fourth quarter of last year. Currency will continue to be a strong headwind, using September 30 rates, the prior year results were more like $0.31, a contraction of nearly 1/3.  Overall, we see no change in the external business environment. Of course, we face specific opportunities and challenges, so let me drill down now on each region. In Europe, operating profit is projected to be modestly down. Sales volumes should be flat with the prior year quarter. The ongoing price declines experienced in the second and third quarters of 2015 will continue but with less year-on-year impact. Our asset optimization program will wind down, and our focus will shift improving productivity at our lower performing plants.
We expect that better manufacturing results will partially mitigate the price declines in Europe. And while price we continue to be a headwind for the fourth quarter, we are assessing the situation for opportunities to increase price in upcoming annual contract negotiations.
Turning to North America. We expect overall industry trends to continue yet our financial performance should increase substantially against an easy comparable due to a number of factors. Modestly higher sales volume; higher production volume since we don't anticipate curtailing production like we did last year; improved productivity; continued cost improvements in our end-to-end supply chain; and a full quarter contribution from O-I packaging solutions.
In Latin America, the acquisition will provide significant benefits to segment profit. However, the legacy business will see some continued pressure, especially given macro challenges. For instance, in Brazil, we anticipate modestly lower production volume. And price increases may not completely cover persistently high cost inflation linked to the strong U.S. dollar.  Overall, Latin America's operating profit should be similar to the prior year, taking into account currency headwinds, the legacy business performance and the benefit from the acquisition.  
In Asia Pacific, we expect higher year-on-year profits -- Andres already mentioned higher sales volume and we'll see a similar increase in production volume.  While we are now lapping the benefits of the Blast Furnace closure in Australia, the region continues to benefit from a favorable cost position. Corporate expense should be similar to prior year. Please note that pension expense had already begun to decline in the fourth quarter of last year.  Interest expense will be higher, of course, as we are carrying incremental debt for the acquisition. Our effective tax rate is higher than usual. We face timing issues associated with a set up of the optimal legal structure for the acquired operations in Mexico. We expect this to normalize by year end.  Blending in Mexico, we see a full year tax rate of approximately 25% to 27%.
Taking into account all the puts and takes, we expect that our adjusted EPS in the fourth quarter will be approximately $0.40. This is substantially higher than prior year in constant currency terms, reflecting better business performance from North America and Asia-Pacific.
Our 2000 [ph] free cash flow targets now approximately $200 million. In local currency terms, we are on track to generate about the same free cash flow as last year. Currency changes alone have created a $120 million headwind to free cash flow. Our original cash flow forecast has been dampened by several issues, none of which should impact as beyond year end 2015. They include: Upfront acquisition costs, CapEx to finish O-I Mexico's furnace with the new CVI business; higher taxes and the European energy credit worth $8 million, which we removed from our forecast to remain conservative.  Of course, while we generate cash in local currency, our cash flow is reported in U.S. dollars. Since we make most of our cash in the fourth quarter, exchange rates at year end will have a significant impact on the translation of full year results.
Let me comment on the impacts of the acquisitions to earnings. In the fourth quarter, we will be more or less breakeven benefits that manifest in North America and Latin America operating profits will be essentially offset by higher borrowing costs and most importantly, the temporarily higher tax rate.
In 2015, it will be a modest use of cash flow for the reasons I just mentioned. And in 2016, it turns accretive to both earnings and free cash flow. 
Moving to Slide 10. We tap the financial markets to borrow for the Mexico acquisition. We did so at a blended rate of approximately 4.2%, a real achievement given choppy market conditions in the credit markets.  Separately, we repaid the remaining $300 million of outstanding 2016 that carried a rate of 7.38%. At quarter end, our total debt has increased to $5.9 billion, and our leverage ratio was nearly 4.2x. Consistent with our previous guidance, we are shifting our capital allocation parity to debt reduction now that the acquisition is completed.
As the acquisition closed earlier than anticipated, we will cap our 2015 share repurchase program at $100 million. By concentrating on deleveraging, we anticipate a leverage ratio of approximately 3x by the end of 2018. Now let me turn the call back over to Andres."

The acquisition of Vitro's food and beverage business is a key building block of our strategy. We waited a long time to acquire it, and all signs today demonstrate that it will make a significant contribution to O-I financially, commercially, operationally and culturally.
We are pleased with the rapid pace with which the integration is progressing. The business in all 3 countries performed well and in line with expectations. There has been a great deal of activity. Employees in all of the major functions are working together to align processes and identified the opportunities for improvement. And strong local leadership teams are working hard to motivate and energize our 5,500 [ph] new employees there.
We are just 1 month into the integration, and we are gaining more visibility into the performance of the operations every day. While there is a lot to learn, we are working to validate the assumptions we had established at the time of the acquisition. So our financial expectations remain the same. The acquisitions should contribute about $0.30 in earnings per share in 2016. It should contribute about $0.50 per share in 2018, and it should generate at least $100 million in free cash flow by 2018.  Note that these expectations are based on average third quarter rates for the Mexican peso. Of course, we are working to drive upsides.
Turning to Slide 12. I mentioned earlier that we have identified some clear opportunities to create shareholder value. To pursue these opportunities, we need to change, and I know, I absolutely know, that we have what it takes to bring about this change at O-I. We have most of the capabilities already, and what we don't have, we can develop, build or hire. We need to develop a performance-focused culture, a culture based on collaboration and integrated decision-making.  
We are already working on many of the necessary changes beginning with the senior leadership team. We have realigned and strengthened our team. And to emphasize the importance of strategy and integrated approach to business and change in our future, we are creating a new role: The Chief Strategy and Integration Officer who will be instrumental in executing our strategy. While John Haudrich has done an excellent job as acting CFO, he is ideal for the strategy and integration role. So he will take it on once we have a new CFO in place. And on that point, we have narrowed our search for an experienced CFO. The external hire will have a solid mentoring industry background, and will bring an outside strategic perspective on value creation to the senior leadership team.  We look forward to sharing news on this as soon as possible.
We have said it already, but I want to reiterate that integrating our new businesses, O-I Mexico, O-I Bolivia and O-I Packaging Solutions, is an important and critical opportunity. These are enormously important additions to our business, and we need to capture all the value they bring.  We look forward to sharing more of our strategy with you at our Investor Day in March.

We also see more and more our desire on the part of international companies to contract on a global basis, which of course, also limits the pool of parties that can participate in such bids and in such long-term agreements for an overall global supply, which again given our footprint, I believe, puts us in a very solid and favorable position as we go forward. Now what we are seeing as well as is that many of the large customers are also trying to become more responsive to market trends themselves. And as you know, we have seen now for a couple of years mega beers are really suffering in overall demand trends. And I think even the larger ones are now trying to become much more active in those segments of the markets as well which again, requires us to be much more flexible because it means more SKUs, it means greater flexibility in our facilities to serve those changing and varying needs.

Clearly, this is a very attractive acquisition, and continues to be a significant contributor to the profitability profile of the company going forward. The variance that you see from the initial announcement that we made in May, I believe it was, is really that at that point in time, the peso was around 14 pesos to the U.S. dollars. Today, the peso is -- I think the average for last month or 16.5 or something like that. We've seen it go over 17, which is, of course, is impacting the conversion. However, what we have seen over the past 5 or 6 years when there was a gradual inflation or deflation of the value of the peso, we have seen the Vitro business was able to really make the adjustments on a regular basis and kept to fairly comparable in strong U.S. dollar results. I believe we still have that capability as well in the company and in the business that we acquired. However, what we have seen is we have seen a very drastic change in currency in a short period of time, and that leads to some uncertainty. We've only been in the business now for 4 weeks and 5 weeks, so we still need to do some fire-kicking to understand what the mechanisms are and that is perhaps reflected in some of the caution that you see.

And as it relates to the asset optimization program on that earlier question, the activities that we've been doing have been very busy -- very busy also with the high level of engineering projects in Europe with the asset -- higher level of asset rebuild that we have this year. That has obviously taken of a bit more time, and the complexities of been higher.

The activity in the market in Brazil in terms of introducing new premium products, beer products, has been very, very high. This is kind of something that the consumer is embracing very well and this tends to go primarily to glass containers, it's like 70% of the mix is sold in one-way containers. So we're seeing a good performance within the circumstances of class. Now in the last couple of months, we're seeing some early signs of better performance overall.

From 2006, now the company has generated close to $2.4 billion, $2.5 billion in free cash flow. We have strengthened our position in Latin America, which is the most profitable region for the glass business in the world by the acquisitions of Cive [ph] in Southern Brazil and of course, most recently, Vitro. So it really has strengthened the underlying capabilities of this organization tremendously. We've built management capabilities for several -- and several of our global leadership numbers today have come out of the internal program that we developed and that we created. And I believe that the new focus of the company on innovation and breakthrough technology is an absolutely need for us to remain in this strength -- position of strength, a position of leadership as we go forward. We weathered one of the deepest and most loved global financial roller coaster rides, and it continues to do this day, with the exchange rate development, as you have see it has a huge impact on top and bottom line of the company. But I would say overall, we have our leadership team today that I wish I would've had 5 or 6 years ago. So that is really the strength of us. The lesson this China, I made a mistake. I really went too early. It's not the certainly a bridge too far, but it was a bridge too early going to China. And I believe also, one of the things I created was I pushed the operations to really find the limits of sweating the assets and getting the best productivity. And we found the boundaries, and that has caused us some interactions in our operation. And I think with Andres' background and knowledge in this business, that's certainly something that we have learned very good lessons from and that we're applying today.

From the CBI discussion that we've had, that we're going to build 3 new furnaces on top of the furnace that was just installed 2 years ago. We also, in Vitro in the O-I business, are building a new furnace at this point in time for glass. And our several Brewers, at this point in time, talking about building additional capacity for which they need -- glass supply and glass capacity.

We have also, over the years, spent some on internal strategic projects. Frankly, what we're looking for is more of the stability that Andres said. So would say that some of the investments in those type of spot projects will be decline, but we'll see that being replaced with more investments in the base operations of the business. And so those are the moving parts, and I think we'll frame all this out when we get to our Investor Day next March about these specific dollar amounts, but that at least gives you the leverage that we're looking at."

Presentation materials for this earnings call are available on the company's website at o-i.com. Please review the Safe Harbor comments and disclosure of our use of non-GAAP financial measures included in those materials.
Unless otherwise noted, the financial results we are presenting today relate to adjusted earnings, which exclude certain items that management considers not representative of ongoing operations. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP earnings can be found in our earnings press release and in the appendix to this presentation.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Al."

I'd like to begin our call today by congratulating Andres Lopez on his appointment as CEO beginning January of next year. Andres has long served as an innovative and visionary member of our leadership team, so his assumption of the CEO role is a natural fit. We have been working closely this past year to transition responsibilities. As Andres has been playing a key leadership role already, he will lead today's discussion of regional performance. 
Besides finalizing the CEO succession process, we completed the acquisition of Vitro's food and beverage glass container business in Mexico, Bolivia and the U.S., much earlier than originally anticipated. I want to complement the transaction teams on both sides for a smooth transition. We are very pleased with the business performance and have included September results in our reported earnings.
Turning to third quarter earnings. Our adjusted EPS was $0.57. The operating performance of our legacy business was essentially flat to the prior year in constant currency and in line with our most recent guidance. While we did not receive a significant energy credit we had expected, lower corporate costs made up for this difference. Given the uncertainty surrounding the timing of this credit, we have removed it entirely from this year's projections. 
We anticipated that the acquisition would reduce results by $0.05, given temporary tax expense as we set up the optimal structure in Mexico. And we were are pleased with the operating results of the acquired business in September and also that its headwind on EPS was less than expected.
Although EPS was $0.18 lower than the prior year third quarter, the difference on a constant currency basis was only $0.03, and these $0.03 were essentially attributable to temporary tax issues related to the acquisition.
Global volumes were up 4% overall. Without the acquired business, global volumes were stable compared to prior year. 
Segment operating profit in the quarter was lower than prior year third quarter by $9 million in constant currency, and the delta was entirely offset by favored corporate items.
Now let me turn the call over to Andres."

I'm both humbled and honored to be given this great opportunity. I've been working with my leadership team and the board to identify the opportunities, prioritize our efforts and determine how we can lead change in the company. 
One of our first priorities and one we are already working on is stability. We need to bring stability back into all of our operations. Stability can bring significant financial benefits, as it is the basis for improved performance in the future. So as I walk you through our results today for the third quarter, I will mention a couple of places where we are stabilizing the operations, as well as other areas where improving performance is creating value.
Let me start with Europe on Slide 4. Europe's operating performance was in line with our expectations. We were pleased to see an uptick in volumes, primarily related to improved beer sales. In fact, overall European volumes are slightly up year-to-date. Operating profit was lower, primarily due to ongoing price pressure and elevated engineering activity. The price pressure stemmed from 2 sources: One source is long-term beer contracts negotiated in 2014; another source is lower wine price in Southern Europe, which were set earlier in the year.
Operating profit was lower than our expectations due to a significant nonoperational item. A legislative delay prevented us from recognizing an $8 million energy credit in the quarter. We are now waiting for clarification as to when or if it will be granted.
We are working to bring more stability in Europe, targeting productivity improvements at selected plants and completing initiatives associated with the asset optimization program.
Moving to Slide #5 and about North America. The modest decline in North America's operating profit hides the very real progress we are making in this region. We have addressed the significant operational challenges we faced in the third quarter of last year. Again, the objective was stability. 
We had a substantially higher level of engineering activity in this quarter, some devoted to planned furnace rebuilds, some devoted to projects that will lower end-to-end supply chain cost and provide more flexibility as we serve growing segments. In each case, the temporary impact on downtime and productivity is setting the stage for increased performance in the future. 
Demand trends in the region remain the same. Sales volume of our Legacy business were down 1% in the quarter due to weak demand in mega beer.
With the addition of the U.S. portion of the acquisition, a distribution business now called O-I Packaging Solutions, volumes were up 2%. Integrating this business into our North American operations will be a key area of focus for us going forward. We are excited by the high level of capabilities and enthusiasm the new distribution team brings. The team is eager to leverage legacy O-I products in the distribution system. 
And separately, to meet consumer needs that increasingly prefer craft beer, wine, spirits and non-alcoholic beverages, we will continue to advance the flexibility of our operations. We are confident that we are turning the corner in North America and regaining stability in the business.
Turning to Slide 6. Latin America earnings adjusted for currency improved from the prior year. This primarily reflects the contribution from the acquisition. Results were down modestly in our Legacy business. This is what we expected. Sales volumes declined 4%. While domestic shipments were up slightly in the Andean countries, shipments for Brazil declined, primarily driven by beer.
Cost inflation remains high, influenced by currency rates. However, our commercial team was able to secure price gains to largely offset inflation. 
We are pleased with the results, and we have opportunities to add more value. The most obvious opportunity is the integration of the Mexico and Bolivia operations. Another opportunity is to support our customers' efforts to introduce new product designs and to tap into new markets.  In summary, the region is operating well and we expect this to continue.
Turning to Slide 7. Asia Pacific has turned the corner. We can see the impact of a strong leadership and execution on our results. Our team in Asia Pacific has worked hard to rightsize the footprint, to improve operating cost and to earn incremental business. 
Overall, sales volume was flat for the region. We benefited from a change in the geographic mix, with business in Australia up and China down. The weaker Australian dollar helps competitiveness. Australian wine exports are up, and so is our business. For us, beer was up due to a new contract even as mainstream beer in Australia has lost share to craft beer and imports.
Our production profile improved substantially in the quarter. Previously, Australia had a significant amount of planned downtime. With its assets now ramped up, we are producing more for local markets. As such, we imported fewer containers from China. By minimizing cross-regional shipment -- shipping, we improve the cost position of the region. 
We note the Asia-Pacific team has done a great job of stabilizing the business. They are now focused on incremental performance improvement by working together with customers to meet their needs and collaborating internally across the sales, manufacturing and supply chain functions to ensure sustainable performance gains.
That completes the regional review. So I -- so let me turn the call over to John to review performance at the enterprise level."

Third quarter adjusted EPS was $0.57. This compares to  $0.75 last year. The strong U.S. dollar is still a significant headwind for the company, amounting to about $0.15. In constant currency, our earnings were $0.60",1103,"Thanks, Andres. Let's turn to Slide 8. Third quarter adjusted EPS was $0.57. This compares to  $0.75 last year. The strong U.S. dollar is still a significant headwind for the company, amounting to about $0.15. In constant currency, our earnings were $0.60 in the prior year quarter. 
Segment operating profit was lower by $0.04, as Andres just covered with the regions. This was completely offset by lower corporate costs. Pension expense declined and management incentive accruals were trimmed. Corporate also benefited from our modest currency hedging program. 
Net interest expense in constant currency was higher, mainly due to the borrowings for the acquisition. We had an effective tax rate of 27% in the quarter. This was higher than average, principally reflecting timing issues associated with the set-up of the optimal legal structure for the acquisition. And EPS benefited from our share buybacks earlier this year.
Let me shift momentarily to GAAP EPS. In the third quarter, we reported $78 million of pretax charges that were not representative of ongoing operations. We recognize several key charges: Initial onetime cost related to the Mexico acquisition; restructuring activities at several plants around the world; and bond redemption premiums and fees related to refinancing activities. In all, adjusted EPS was modestly higher than our $0.55 guidance.
The legacy business performed as expected, and the ultimate impact of the acquisition was a $0.01 or $0.02 or better than we had expected. 
Let's turn to our fourth quarter outlook on Slide 9. We reported adjusted EPS of $0.46 per share in the fourth quarter of last year. Currency will continue to be a strong headwind. Using September 30 rates, prior year results were more like $0.31, a contraction of nearly 1/3. 
Overall, we see no change in the external business environment. Of course, we face specific opportunities and challenges, so let me drill down now on each region. In Europe, operating profit is projected to be modestly down. Sales volumes should be flat with the prior year quarter. The ongoing price declines experienced in the second and third quarters of 2015 will continue, but with less year-on-year impact. Our asset optimization program will wind down, and our focus will shift improving productivity at our lower-performing plants. 
We expect that better manufacturing results will partially mitigate the price declines in Europe. And while price will continue to be a headwind for the fourth quarter, we are assessing the situation for opportunities to increase price in upcoming annual contract negotiations.
Turning to North America. We expect overall industry trends to continue, yet our financial performance should increase substantially against an easy comparable due to a number of factors: Modestly higher sales volume; higher production volume since we don't anticipate curtailing production like we did last year; improved productivity; continued cost improvements in our end-to-end supply chain; and a full quarter contribution from O-I Packaging Solutions.
In Latin America, the acquisition will provide significant benefits to segment profit. However, the legacy business will see some continued pressure, especially given macro challenges. For instance, in Brazil, we anticipate modestly lower production volume, and price increases may not completely cover persistently high cost inflation linked to the strong U.S. dollar. Overall, Latin America's operating profit should be similar to the prior year, taking into account currency headwinds, the legacy business performance and the benefit from the acquisition.  
In Asia Pacific, we expect higher year-on-year profits. Andres already mentioned higher sales volume. And we'll see a similar increase in production volume.  While we are now lapping the benefit of the last furnace closure in Australia, the region continues to benefit from a favorable cost position. 
Corporate expense should be similar to prior year. Please note that pension expense had already begun to decline in the fourth quarter of last year.  Interest expense will be higher, of course, as we are carrying incremental debt for the acquisition. Our effective tax rate is higher than usual. We face timing issues associated with the set up of the optimal legal structure for the acquired operations in Mexico. We expect this to normalize by year end.  Blending in Mexico, we see a full year tax rate of approximately 25% to 27%.
Taking into account all the puts and takes, we expect that our adjusted EPS in the fourth quarter will be approximately $0.40. This is substantially higher than prior year in constant currency terms, reflecting better business performance from North America and Asia Pacific.
Our 2000 (sic) [ 2015 ] free cash flow target now approximately $200 million. In local currency terms, we are on track to generate about the same free cash flow as last year. Currency changes alone have created a $120 million headwind to free cash flow. 
Our original cash flow forecast has been dampened by several issues, none of which should impact us beyond year end 2015. They include: Upfront acquisition cost; CapEx to finish O-I Mexico's furnace for the new CBI business; higher taxes; and the European energy credit worth $8 million, which we removed from our forecast to remain conservative.  
Of course, while we generate cash in local currency, our cash flow is reported in U.S. dollars. Since we make most of our cash in the fourth quarter, exchange rates at year end will have a significant impact on the translation of full year results.
Let me comment on the impacts of the acquisition to earnings. In the fourth quarter, it will be more or less breakeven to earnings. Benefits that manifest in North America and Latin America operating profits will be essentially offset by higher borrowing cost, and most importantly, the temporarily higher tax rate. In 2015, it will be a modest use of cash flow for the reasons I just mentioned. And in 2016, it turns accretive to both earnings and free cash flow. 
Moving to Slide 10. We tapped the financial markets to borrow for the Mexico acquisition. We did so at a blended rate of approximately 4.2%, a real achievement given choppy market conditions in the credit markets. Separately, we repaid the remaining $300 million of outstanding 2016s that carried a rate of 7 3/8%. At quarter end, our total debt has increased to $5.9 billion, and our leverage ratio was nearly 4.2x. Consistent with our previous guidance, we are shifting our capital allocation priority to debt reduction now that the acquisition is completed.
As the acquisition closed earlier than anticipated, we will cap our 2015 share repurchase program at $100 million. By concentrating on deleveraging, we anticipate a leverage ratio of approximately 3x by the end of 2018. 
Now let me turn the call back over to Andres."

The acquisition of Vitro's food and beverage business is a key building block of our strategy. We waited a long time to acquire it, and all signs today demonstrate that it will make a significant contribution to O-I financially, commercially, operationally and culturally.
We are pleased with the rapid pace with which the integration is progressing. The business in all 3 countries performed well and in line with expectations. There has been a great deal of activity. Employees in all of the major functions are working together to align processes and identified opportunities for improvement. And a strong local leadership teams are working hard to motivate and energize our 5,500 new employees there.
We are just 1 month into the integration, and we are gaining more visibility into the performance of the operations every day. While there is a lot to learn, we are working to validate the assumptions we had established at the time of the acquisition. So our financial expectations remain the same. The acquisition should contribute about $0.30 in earnings per share in 2016. It should contribute about $0.50 per share in 2018, and it should generate at least $100 million in free cash flow by 2018. Note that these expectations are based on average third quarter rates for the Mexican peso. Of course, we are working to drive upsides.
Turning to Slide 12. I mentioned earlier that we have identified some clear opportunities to create shareholder value. To pursue these opportunities, we need to change, and I know, I absolutely know, that we have what it takes to bring about this change at O-I. We have most of the capabilities already, and what we don't have, we can develop, build or hire. We need to develop a performance-focused culture, a culture based on collaboration and integrated decision-making.  
We are already working on many of the necessary changes, beginning with the senior leadership team. We have realigned and strengthened our team. And to emphasize the importance of strategy, an integrated approach to business and change in our future, we are creating a new role: The Chief Strategy and Integration Officer, who will be instrumental in executing our strategy. While John Haudrich has done an excellent job as acting CFO, he is ideal for the strategy and integration role. So he will take it on once we have a new CFO in place. 
And on that point, we have narrowed our search for an experienced CFO. The external hire will have a solid manufacturing industry background and will bring an outside strategic perspective on value creation to the senior leadership team. We look forward to sharing news on this as soon as possible.
We have said it already, but I want to reiterate that integrating our new businesses, O-I Mexico, O-I Bolivia and O-I Packaging Solutions, is an important and critical opportunity. These are enormously important additions to our business, and we need to capture all the value they bring. We look forward to sharing more of our strategy with you at our Investor Day in March. 
And now I will ask Brian -- Breanna to open the lines for your questions."

So I think this will make a lot easier for us to drive performance up as we continue to take over the operations. When it comes to pricing, we've been experiencing the same pattern and trend over the entire year in pricing in Europe. And our expectation is that as we go into this quarter and we're getting to a negotiation season and even going into Q1, we're going to be able to evaluate better, what is the spend of -- the trend going forward, if we're -- this is going to continue into 2016 or it's going to moderate a little bit more."

And it's getting to be a more concentrated market on the customer side. And it's also a more concentrated supplier base, as you have seen. Now when we look at our positioning, I think we're ideally positioned on a global basis to really deal with those trends because in most cases, and of course, everybody is aware of the big kahuna that's out there at this point in time. If you look at that particular situation, we are basically represented with both of those companies in each of the regions in which they are active, and have a long-term significant supply relation, in some cases with long-term contracts still into effect 3 or 4 years hence at this point in time, which I believe puts us in an excellent position to benefit from this changing profile of our customer base. We also see more and more a desire on the part of international companies to contract on a global basis, which of course, also limits the pool of parties that can participate in such bids and in such long-term agreements for an overall global supply, which again given our footprint, I believe, puts us in a very solid and favorable position as we go forward. Now what we are seeing as well is that many of the large customers are also trying to become more responsive to market trends themselves. And as you know, we have seen now for a couple of years, mega beer's really suffering in overall demand trends. And I think even the larger ones are now trying to become much more active in those segments of the markets as well, which again, requires us to be much more flexible, because it means more SKUs, it means greater flexibility in our facilities to serve those changing and varying needs. And I think, again, with the focus that we have and the focus that we're putting on flexibility on our operations, we're very well-positioned."

Clearly, this is a very attractive acquisition and continues to be a significant contributor to the profitability profile of the company going forward. The variance that you see from the initial announcement that we made in May, I believe it was, is really that at that point in time, the peso was around 14 pesos to the U.S. dollars. Today, the peso is -- I think the average for last month was 16.5 or something like that. We've seen it go over 17, which of course, is impacting the conversion. However, what we have seen over the past 5 or 6 years, when there was a gradual inflation or deflation of the value of the peso, we have seen that the Vitro business was able to really make the adjustments on a regular basis and kept to fairly comparable and strong U.S. dollar results. I believe we still have that capability as well in the company and in the business that we acquired. However, what we have seen is we have seen a very drastic change in currency in a short period of time, and that leads to some uncertainty. We've only been in the business now for 4 weeks or 5 weeks, so we still need to do some tire-kicking to understand what the mechanisms are, and that is perhaps reflected in some of the caution that you see.

And as it relates to the asset optimization program on that earlier question, is the activities that we've been doing have been very busy, very busy also with the high level of engineering projects in Europe with the asset -- higher level of asset rebuild that we had this year. That has obviously taken a little bit more time, and the complexity is a little bit, been higher.

The activity in the market in Brazil in terms of introducing new premium products, beer products, has been very, very high. This is something that the consumer is embracing very well and this tends to go primarily to glass containers, it's like 70% of the mix is sold in one-way containers. So we're seeing a good performance within the circumstances of glass. Now in the last couple of months, we're seeing some early signs of better performance overall.

From 2006 to now, the company has generated close to $2.4 billion, $2.5 billion in free cash flow. We have strengthened our position in Latin America, which is the most profitable region for the glass business in the world by the acquisitions of Cive [ph] in Northern Brazil and of course, most recently in Vitro. So it really has strengthened the underlying capabilities of this organization tremendously. We've built management capabilities for several -- and several of our global leadership numbers today have come out of the internal program that we developed and that we created. And I believe the new focus of the company on innovation and breakthrough technology is an absolute need for us to remain in this strength -- position of strength, a position of leadership as we go forward. We weathered one of the deepest and most prolonged global financial and economic roller coaster rides, and it continues to this day with the exchange rate development. As you see, it has a huge impact on top and bottom line of the company. But I would say overall, we have a leadership team today that I wish I would have had 5 or 6 years ago. So that is really the strength of it. The lesson is China, I made a mistake. I really went too early. It's not necessarily a bridge too far, but it was a bridge too early going to China. And I believe also, one of the things I created was I pushed the operations to really find the limits of sweating the assets and getting the best productivity. And we found the boundaries, and that has cost us some interactions in our operation. And I think with Andres' background and knowledge in this business, that's certainly something that we have learned very good lessons from and that we're applying today.

I believe one of the things that really is important for us to keep an eye on -- because what we are seeing in North America, and that includes now the Mexican market for this discussion, is a significant increase in capacity and intent of building capacity on the part or brewers, which are really also driving the demand for glass. From the CBI discussion that we've had, that we're going to build 3 new furnaces on top of the furnace that was just installed 2 years ago. We also, in Vitro, in the O-I Mexico business, are building a new furnace at this point in time for glass. And there are several brewers at this point in time talking about building additional capacity for which they need glass supply and glass capacity. So I think as we go forward, we're going to have to see what is the right approach for us to make sure that we get a profitable hold of those opportunities.

We have also, over the years, spent some on internal strategic projects. Frankly, what we're looking for is more of the stability, as Andres said. So I would say to that -- some of the investments in those type of spot projects will decline, but we'll see that being replaced with more investments in the base operations of the business.

I'd like to begin our call today by congratulating Andres Lopez on his appointment as CEO beginning January of next year. Andres has long served as an innovative and visionary member of our leadership team, so his assumption of the CEO role is a natural fit. We have been working closely this past year to transition responsibilities. As Andres has been playing a key leadership role already, he will lead today's discussion of regional performance. 
Besides finalizing the CEO succession process, we completed the acquisition of Vitro's food and beverage glass container business in Mexico, Bolivia and the U.S., much earlier than originally anticipated. I want to compliment the transaction teams on both sides for a smooth transition. We are very pleased with the business performance and have included September results in our reported earnings.
Turning to third quarter earnings. Our adjusted EPS was $0.57. The operating performance of our legacy business was essentially flat to the prior year in constant currency and in line with our most recent guidance. While we did not receive a significant energy credit we had expected, lower corporate costs made up for this difference. Given the uncertainty surrounding the timing of this credit, we have removed it entirely from this year's projections. 
We anticipated the acquisition would reduce results by $0.05, given temporary tax expense as we set up the optimal structure in Mexico. And we were are pleased with the operating results of the acquired business in September and also that its headwind on EPS was less than expected. Although EPS was $0.18 lower than the prior year third quarter, the difference on a constant currency basis was only $0.03, and these $0.03 were essentially attributable to temporary tax issues related to the acquisition. Global volumes were up 4% overall. Without the acquired business, global volumes were stable compared to prior year.  Segment operating profit in the quarter was lower than prior year third quarter by $9 million in constant currency, and the delta was entirely offset by favored corporate items.
Now let me turn the call over to Andres."

I'm both humbled and honored to be given this great opportunity. I've been working with my leadership team and the board to identify the opportunities, prioritize our efforts and determine how we can lead change in the company. 
One of our first priorities and one we are already working on is stability. We need to bring stability back into all of our operations. Stability can bring significant financial benefits, as it is the basis for improved performance in the future. So as I walk you through our results today for the third quarter, I will mention a couple of places where we are stabilizing the operations, as well as other areas where improving performance is creating value.
Let me start with Europe on Slide 4. Europe's operating performance was in line with our expectations. We were pleased to see an uptick in volumes, primarily related to improved beer sales. In fact, overall European volumes are slightly up year-to-date. Operating profit was lower, primarily due to ongoing price pressure and elevated engineering activity. The price pressure stemmed from 2 sources: One source is long-term beer contracts negotiated in 2014; another source is lower wine price in Southern Europe, which were set earlier in the year.
Operating profit was lower than our expectations due to a significant nonoperational item. A legislative delay prevented us from recognizing an $8 million energy credit in the quarter. We are now waiting for clarification as to when or if it will be granted. We are working to bring more stability in Europe, targeting productivity improvements at selected plants and completing initiatives associated with the asset optimization program.
Moving to Slide #5 and about North America. The modest decline in North America's operating profit hides the very real progress we are making in this region. We have addressed the significant operational challenges we faced in the third quarter of last year. Again, the objective was stability.  We had a substantially higher level of engineering activity in this quarter, some devoted to planned furnace rebuilds, some devoted to projects that will lower end-to-end supply chain cost and provide more flexibility as we serve growing segments. In each case, the temporary impact on downtime and productivity is setting the stage for increased performance in the future.  Demand trends in the region remain the same. Sales volume of our Legacy business were down 1% in the quarter due to weak demand in mega beer.
With the addition of the U.S. portion of the acquisition, a distribution business now called O-I Packaging Solutions, volumes were up 2%. Integrating this business into our North American operations will be a key area of focus for us going forward. We are excited by the high level of capabilities and enthusiasm the new distribution team brings. The team is eager to leverage legacy O-I products in the distribution system.  And separately, to meet consumer needs that increasingly prefer craft beer, wine, spirits and non-alcoholic beverages, we will continue to advance the flexibility of our operations. We are confident that we are turning the corner in North America and regaining stability in the business.
Turning to Slide 6. Latin America earnings adjusted for currency improved from the prior year. This primarily reflects the contribution from the acquisition. Results were down modestly in our Legacy business. This is what we expected. Sales volumes declined 4%. While domestic shipments were up slightly in the Andean countries, shipments for Brazil declined, primarily driven by beer. Cost inflation remains high, influenced by currency rates. However, our commercial team was able to secure price gains to largely offset inflation.  We are pleased with the results, and we have opportunities to add more value. The most obvious opportunity is the integration of the Mexico and Bolivia operations. Another opportunity is to support our customers' efforts to introduce new product designs and to tap into new markets.  In summary, the region is operating well and we expect this to continue.
Turning to Slide 7. Asia Pacific has turned the corner. We can see the impact of a strong leadership and execution on our results. Our team in Asia Pacific has worked hard to rightsize the footprint, to improve operating cost and to earn incremental business.  Overall, sales volume was flat for the region. We benefited from a change in the geographic mix, with business in Australia up and China down. The weaker Australian dollar helps competitiveness. Australian wine exports are up, and so is our business. For us, beer was up due to a new contract even as mainstream beer in Australia has lost share to craft beer and imports.
Our production profile improved substantially in the quarter. Previously, Australia had a significant amount of planned downtime. With its assets now ramped up, we are producing more for local markets. As such, we imported fewer containers from China. By minimizing cross-regional shipment -- shipping, we improve the cost position of the region. In all, the Asia-Pacific team has done a great job of stabilizing the business. They are now focused on incremental performance improvement by working together with customers to meet their needs and collaborating internally across the sales, manufacturing and supply chain functions to ensure sustainable performance gains.
That completes the regional review. So I -- so let me turn the call over to John to review performance at the enterprise level."

Third quarter adjusted EPS was $0.57. This compares to $0.75 last year. The strong U.S. dollar is still a significant headwind for the company, amounting to about $0.15. In constant currency, our earnings were $0.60",1100,"Thanks, Andres. Let's turn to Slide 8. Third quarter adjusted EPS was $0.57. This compares to $0.75 last year. The strong U.S. dollar is still a significant headwind for the company, amounting to about $0.15. In constant currency, our earnings were $0.60 in the prior year quarter. Segment operating profit was lower by $0.04, as Andres just covered with the regions. This was completely offset by lower corporate costs. Pension expense declined and management incentive accruals were trimmed. Corporate also benefited from our modest currency hedging program. 
Net interest expense in constant currency was higher, mainly due to the borrowings for the acquisition. We had an effective tax rate of 27% in the quarter. This was higher than average, principally reflecting timing issues associated with the set-up of the optimal legal structure for the acquisition. And EPS benefited from our share buybacks earlier this year.
Let me shift momentarily to GAAP EPS. In the third quarter, we reported $78 million of pretax charges that were not representative of ongoing operations. We recognized several key charges: Initial onetime costs related to the Mexico acquisition; restructuring activities at several plants around the world; and bond redemption premiums and fees related to refinancing activities. In all, adjusted EPS was modestly higher than our $0.55 guidance. The legacy business performed as expected, and the ultimate impact of the acquisition was a $0.01 or $0.02 or better than we had expected. 
Let's turn to our fourth quarter outlook on Slide 9. We reported adjusted EPS of $0.46 per share in the fourth quarter of last year. Currency will continue to be a strong headwind. Using September 30 rates, prior year results were more like $0.31, a contraction of nearly 1/3. Overall, we see no change in the external business environment. Of course, we face specific opportunities and challenges, so let me drill down now on each region. In Europe, operating profit is projected to be modestly down. Sales volumes should be flat with the prior year quarter. The ongoing price declines experienced in the second and third quarters of 2015 will continue, but with less year-on-year impact. Our asset optimization program will wind down, and our focus will shift improving productivity at our lower-performing plants.  We expect that better manufacturing results will partially mitigate the price declines in Europe. And while price will continue to be a headwind for the fourth quarter, we are assessing the situation for opportunities to increase price in upcoming annual contract negotiations.
Turning to North America. We expect overall industry trends to continue, yet our financial performance should increase substantially against an easy comparable due to a number of factors: Modestly higher sales volume; higher production volume since we don't anticipate curtailing production like we did last year; improved productivity; continued cost improvements in our end-to-end supply chain; and a full quarter contribution from O-I Packaging Solutions.
In Latin America, the acquisition will provide significant benefits to segment profit. However, the legacy business will see some continued pressure, especially given macro challenges. For instance, in Brazil, we anticipate modestly lower production volume, and price increases may not completely cover persistently high cost inflation linked to the strong U.S. dollar. Overall, Latin America's operating profit should be similar to the prior year, taking into account currency headwinds, the legacy business performance and the benefit from the acquisition.  
In Asia Pacific, we expect higher year-on-year profits. Andres already mentioned higher sales volume. And we'll see a similar increase in production volume.  While we are now lapping the benefit of the last furnace closure in Australia, the region continues to benefit from a favorable cost position. 
Corporate expense should be similar to prior year. Please note that pension expense had already begun to decline in the fourth quarter of last year.  Interest expense will be higher, of course, as we are carrying incremental debt for the acquisition. Our effective tax rate is higher than usual. We face timing issues associated with the setup of the optimal legal structure for the acquired operations in Mexico. We expect this to normalize by year end.  Blending in Mexico, we see a full year tax rate of approximately 25% to 27%. Taking into account all the puts and takes, we expect that our adjusted EPS in the fourth quarter will be approximately $0.40. This is substantially higher than prior year in constant currency terms, reflecting better business performance from North America and Asia Pacific.
Our 2000 (sic) [2015] free cash flow target now approximately $200 million. In local currency terms, we are on track to generate about the same free cash flow as last year. Currency changes alone have created a $120 million headwind to free cash flow.  Our original cash flow forecast has been dampened by several issues, none of which should impact us beyond year end 2015. They include: Upfront acquisition cost; CapEx to finish O-I Mexico's furnace for the new CBI business; higher taxes; and the European energy credit worth $8 million, which we removed from our forecast to remain conservative.  Of course, while we generate cash in local currency, our cash flow is reported in U.S. dollars. Since we make most of our cash in the fourth quarter, exchange rates at year end will have a significant impact on the translation of full year results.
Let me comment on the impacts of the acquisition to earnings. In the fourth quarter, it will be more or less breakeven to earnings. Benefits that manifest in North America and Latin America operating profits will be essentially offset by higher borrowing cost, and most importantly, the temporarily higher tax rate. In 2015, it will be a modest use of cash flow for the reasons I just mentioned. And in 2016, it turns accretive to both earnings and free cash flow. 
Moving to Slide 10. We tapped the financial markets to borrow for the Mexico acquisition. We did so at a blended rate of approximately 4.2%, a real achievement given choppy market conditions in the credit markets. Separately, we repaid the remaining $300 million of outstanding 2016s that carried a rate of 7 3/8%. At quarter end, our total debt has increased to $5.9 billion, and our leverage ratio was nearly 4.2x. Consistent with our previous guidance, we are shifting our capital allocation priority to debt reduction now that the acquisition is completed. As the acquisition closed earlier than anticipated, we will cap our 2015 share repurchase program at $100 million. By concentrating on deleveraging, we anticipate a leverage ratio of approximately 3x by the end of 2018. 
Now let me turn the call back over to Andres."

The acquisition of Vitro's food and beverage business is a key building block of our strategy. We waited a long time to acquire it, and all signs today demonstrate that it will make a significant contribution to O-I financially, commercially, operationally and culturally. We are pleased with the rapid pace with which the integration is progressing. 
The business in all 3 countries performed well and in line with expectations. There has been a great deal of activity. Employees in all of the major functions are working together to align processes and identified opportunities for improvement. And a strong local leadership teams are working hard to motivate and energize our 5,500 new employees there. We are just 1 month into the integration, and we are gaining more visibility into the performance of the operations every day. While there is a lot to learn, we are working to validate the assumptions we had established at the time of the acquisition. So our financial expectations remain the same. The acquisition should contribute about $0.30 in earnings per share in 2016. It should contribute about $0.50 per share in 2018, and it should generate at least $100 million in free cash flow by 2018. Note that these expectations are based on average third quarter rates for the Mexican peso. Of course, we are working to drive upsides.
Turning to Slide 12. I mentioned earlier that we have identified some clear opportunities to create shareholder value. To pursue these opportunities, we need to change, and I know, I absolutely know, that we have what it takes to bring about this change at O-I. We have most of the capabilities already, and what we don't have, we can develop, build or hire. We need to develop a performance-focused culture, a culture based on collaboration and integrated decision-making.  
We are already working on many of the necessary changes, beginning with the senior leadership team. We have realigned and strengthened our team. And to emphasize the importance of strategy, an integrated approach to business and change in our future, we are creating a new role: The Chief Strategy and Integration Officer, who will be instrumental in executing our strategy. While John Haudrich has done an excellent job as acting CFO, he is ideal for the strategy and integration role. So he will take it on once we have a new CFO in place. 
And on that point, we have narrowed our search for an experienced CFO. The external hire will have a solid manufacturing industry background and will bring an outside strategic perspective on value creation to the senior leadership team. We look forward to sharing news on this as soon as possible. We have said it already, but I want to reiterate that integrating our new businesses, O-I Mexico, O-I Bolivia and O-I Packaging Solutions, is an important and critical opportunity. These are enormously important additions to our business, and we need to capture all the value they bring. We look forward to sharing more of our strategy with you at our Investor Day in March.

The second related question, I think last quarter, it's -- at least, we took away that pricing trends in Europe should be improving, there seemed to be some stability, at least, entering your outlook. It seems from this call, perhaps that pressures remain a little bit more persistent. Could you comment/correct/change that view in terms of the outlook on pricing as well for Europe?"

So I think this will make a lot easier for us to drive performance up as we continue to take over the operations. When it comes to pricing, we've been experiencing the same pattern and trend over the entire year in pricing Europe. And our expectation is that as we go into this quarter and we're getting to a negotiation season and even going into Q1, we're going to be able to evaluate better, what is the spend of -- the trend going forward, if we're -- this is going to continue into 2016 or it's going to moderate a little bit more."

What we're saying is in comparison to last year, the price pressure is still maintained but it is not new pricing action that we're seeing. In fact, if you look at the published reports by quite a few of our competitors, they're all lamenting the inability that they have seen to get prices and to recover what they have seen in internal inflation.

That being, of course, a major part of the overall market, it has a reflection of overall demand. But I would say long term, the trends in China still remain fairly positive.

And it's getting to be a more concentrated market on the customer side. But it's also a more concentrated supplier base, as you have seen. Now when we look at our positioning, I think we're ideally positioned on a global basis to really deal with those trends because in most cases, and of course, everybody is aware of the big kahuna that's out there at this point in time. If you look at that particular situation, we are basically represented with both of those companies in each of the regions in which they are active, and have a long-term significant supply relation, in some cases with long-term contracts still into effect 3 or 4 years hence at this point in time, which I believe puts us in an excellent position to benefit from this changing profile of our customer base. We also see more and more a desire on the part of international companies to contract on a global basis, which of course, also limits the pool of parties that can participate in such bids and in such long-term agreements for an overall global supply, which again given our footprint, I believe, puts us in a very solid and favorable position as we go forward. Now what we are seeing as well is that many of the large customers are also trying to become more responsive to market trends themselves. And as you know, we have seen now for a couple of years, mega beer's really suffering in overall demand trends. And I think even the larger ones are now trying to become much more active in those segments of the markets as well, which again, requires us to be much more flexible, because it means more SKUs, it means greater flexibility in our facilities to serve those changing and varying needs. And I think, again, with the focus that we have and the focus that we're putting on flexibility on our operations, we're very well-positioned."

Clearly, this is a very attractive acquisition and continues to be a significant contributor to the profitability profile of the company going forward. The variance that you see from the initial announcement that we made in May, I believe it was, is really that at that point in time, the peso was around 14 pesos to the U.S. dollars. Today, the peso is -- I think the average for last month was 16.5 or something like that. We've seen it go over 17, which of course, is impacting the conversion. However, what we have seen over the past 5 or 6 years, when there was a gradual inflation or deflation of the value of the peso, we have seen that the Vitro business was able to really make the adjustments on a regular basis and get to fairly comparable and strong U.S. dollar results. I believe we still have that capability as well in the company and in the business that we acquired. However, what we have seen is we have seen a very drastic change in currency in a short period of time, and that leads to some uncertainty. We've only been in the business now for 4 weeks or 5 weeks, so we still need to do some tire-kicking to understand what the mechanisms are, and that is perhaps reflected in some of the caution that you see.

And as it relates to the asset optimization program on that earlier question, is the activities that we've been doing have been very busy, very busy also with the high level of engineering projects in Europe with the asset -- higher level of asset rebuild that we had this year.

And I believe the new focus of the company on innovation and breakthrough technology is an absolute need for us to remain in this strength -- position of strength and position of leadership as we go forward. We weathered one of the deepest and most prolonged global financial and economic roller coaster rides, and it continues to this day with the exchange rate development. As you see, it has a huge impact on top and bottom line of the company. But I would say overall, we have a leadership team today that I wish I would have had 5 or 6 years ago. So that is really the strength of it. The lesson is China, I made a mistake. I really went too early. It's not necessarily a bridge too far, but it was a bridge too early going to China. And I believe also, one of the things I created was I pushed the operations to really find the limits of sweating the assets and getting the best productivity. And we found the boundaries, and that has cost us some interruptions in our operation. And I think with Andres' background and knowledge in this business, that's certainly something that we have learned very good lessons from and that we're applying today. I hope that answers your question."

And now that you have this -- the Vitro in the mix, and you sort of have, obviously, some number in mind as you look to get your leverage down to 3x at the end of '18. What sort of should we expect to see on the CapEx side? And as you answer, where do we stand in terms of the furnace rebuild process? Is that something that is happening at the same rate going forward? Or will it speed up or slow down?"

Overall, the mix is really not going to change that significantly from where we have been in the past. Of course, we have to add the Vitro capital requirements, but we talked about that already in the past. I believe one of the things that really is important for us to keep an eye on, because what we are seeing in North America, and that includes now the Mexican market for this discussion, is a significant increase in capacity and intent of building capacity on the part of brewers, which are really also driving the demand for glass. You know from the CBI discussion that we've had, that we're going to build 3 new furnaces on top of the furnace that was just installed 2 years ago. We also, in Vitro, in the O-I Mexico business, are building a new furnace at this point in time for glass. And there are several brewers at this point in time talking about building additional capacity for which they need glass supply and glass capacity. So I think as we go forward, we're going to have to see what is the right approach for us to make sure that we get a profitable hold of those opportunities. And I would say it's too early at this point in time to really make any projections other than the ones we already have talked about and that are in the pipeline. But with regard to specific numbers and investments and investment profile, perhaps John can add a few comments."

So a couple of things that will be moving, all right? So we will not be -- look, we're exiting the asset optimization program in Europe. This is the last year of that. We have also, over the years, spent some on internal strategic projects. Frankly, what we're looking for is more of the stability, as Andres said. So I would say to that -- some of the investments in those type of spot projects will decline, but we'll see that being replaced with more investments in the base operations of the business. And so those are the moving parts, and I think we'll frame all this out when we get to our Investor Day next March about the specific dollar amounts. But that at least gives you the levers that we're looking at."

I believe what I said earlier with regard to capacity being built in Mexico for export markets and beer is adding significant upside to the volume profile for Mexico, which leads us to believe that the growth rates that we've seen in the past 4 or 5 years are going to continue for quite a while as we go forward. It's not all consumed in Mexico, of course, you have to add that. And we will see some trend changes based on economic conditions.
