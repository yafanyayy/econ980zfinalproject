So as usual, I will briefly comment on our financial statements and provide some highlights of our financial results for the quarter and the year starting with the income statement. Total revenue increased 14.5% for the quarter and 19.6% for",789,"Thanks, John. So as usual, I will briefly comment on our financial statements and provide some highlights of our financial results for the quarter and the year starting with the income statement. Total revenue increased 14.5% for the quarter and 19.6% for the year. This increase reflects our growth primarily from new acquisitions over the past year as well as same-store rent growth. Our annualized rental revenue at December 31 was approximately $920 million.
On the expense side, depreciation and amortization expense increased to $96.5 million in the quarter as depreciation expenses, obviously, increased with our portfolio growth. Interest expense increased in the quarter to $59.1 million. This increase was primarily due to our 2 recent bond offerings, the $350 million 10-year notes we issued in June and the $250 million 12-year notes issued in September.
On a related note, our coverage ratios will remain strong with interest coverage at 3.8x and fixed charge coverage at 3.4x.
General and administrative, or G&A, expenses were approximately $15.6 million for the quarter and $51.1 million for the year. Both were decreases from last year due to lower acquisition transaction costs as well as lower stock compensation cost. Overall, our total G&A in 2014 as a percentage of total rental and other revenues represented only 5.7% of revenues. Our projection for G&A expenses in 2015 is approximately $55 million or about 5.5% of revenues. 
Property expenses, which were not reimbursed by tenant totaled $4.2 million for the quarter and $16.8 million for the year. Our current projection for property expenses that we will be responsible for in 2015 is approximately $20 million. 
Income taxes, consist of income taxes paid to various states and cities by the company, they were approximately $1.1 million for the quarter and $3.5 million for the year.
Provisions for impairment of approximately $2 million during the quarter includes impairments we recorded on 1 sold property and 2 properties held for sale at December 31. Note that approximately $510,000 of this impairment is recognized in discontinued operations on the income statement, an accounting treatment that is necessary because the property was held for sale at the end of last year when the [indiscernible] accounting rules changed.
Gain on sales were approximately $25 million in the quarter and $42 million for the year. And just a reminder, as always, we do not include property sales gains in our FFO or AFFO.
Funds from operations, or FFO, per share was $0.64 for the quarter, a 4.9% increase versus a year ago and $2.58 for the year, a 7.1% increase over 2013.
Adjusted funds from operations, or AFFO, or the actual cash we have available for distribution at dividend was $0.65 per share for the quarter, a 4.8% increase versus a year ago. It came in at $2.57 for the year, a 6.6% increase over 2013.
Dividends paid increased 2.1% in 2014, an improvement. We announced last month, we declared a 3% increase to our cash monthly dividend, which was paid to shareholders this month. Our monthly dividend now equates to a current annualized amount of approximately $2.268 per share.
Briefly turning to the balance sheet. We've continued to maintain our conservative and safe capital structure. As previously disclosed, we redeemed our $220 million of preferred E stock, which had a coupon of 6.75% back in October. Recall that in mid-September we issued $250 million of 12-year bonds, priced at a yield of 4.178% to prefund this preferred redemption. This transaction overall resulted in annual cash expense savings of almost $5.7 million.
Obviously, we are pleased with our continued access to low-cost long-term capital in the bond market. Our bonds, which are all unsecured in fixed-rate and continue to be rated Baa1, BBB+, have a weighted average maturity of 7.2 years. Our $1.5 billion acquisition credit facility had a $223 million balance at December 31. And currently we have $382 million of borrowings on the line. We do not assume any mortgages during the quarter. We did pay off some of the maturity, so our outstanding net mortgage debt at year-end decreased to approximately $836 million.
Not including our credit facility, the only variable rates debt exposure to rising interest rates that we have is on just $39 million of this mortgage debt. And our overall debt maturity schedule remains in very good shape with only $120 million of mortgages and $150 million of bonds coming due in 2015 and our maturity schedule as well [indiscernible] thereafter. Currently, our debt-to-total market capitalization is approximately 30% and our preferred stock outstanding was less than 2.5% of our capital structure. And our debt-to-EBITDA at year-end was only 5.8x. 
Now let me turn the call back over the John, who will give you more background."

I'll begin with an overview of the portfolio, which is performing well and continues to generate a tenable cash flow for our shareholders. Occupancy increased 10 basis points from last quarter and 20 basis points year-over-year to 98.4% base",1077,"Thanks, Paul. I'll begin with an overview of the portfolio, which is performing well and continues to generate a tenable cash flow for our shareholders. Occupancy increased 10 basis points from last quarter and 20 basis points year-over-year to 98.4% based on the number of properties, with 70 properties available for lease out of over 4,300 properties in our portfolio. This is the highest our occupancy had been since 2007. Occupancy based on square footage was 99.2%, a 10 basis points improvement from last quarter and 20 basis points year-over-year. Economic occupancy was also 99.2%, a 10 basis points improvement from both last quarter and year-over-year. 
2014 has been one of our most active years ever for lease rollover activity with leases expiring on 220 properties. Of these properties, we re-lease 173 to existing tenants to 30 to new tenants, recapturing 99.3% of expiring rents on the properties that were re-leased. In addition, we sold 17 vacant properties during the year. 
In the fourth quarter, we experienced 54 lease rollovers. Of these, we re-leased 40 to existing tenants and 10 to new tenants, recapturing approximately 97% of expiring rents on the properties that were re-leased. 8 vacant properties were sold during the fourth quarter. 
Our same-store rent increased 1.7% during the quarter and 1.5% in 2014. The industry is contributing most to our quarterly same-store rent growth where convenient stores, health and fitness and quick service restaurants. We expect same-store rent growth to remain at about 1.5% for the foreseeable future.
Our portfolio continues to be diversified by tenant, industry, geography and to a certain extent property type. At the end of the fourth quarter, our properties were leased to 234 commercial tenants and 47 different industries located in 49 states and Puerto Rico, 79% of our rental revenues from our traditional retail properties, while 21% is from nonretail properties, the largest component being industrial and distribution.
This diversification continues to enhance the predictability of our cash flow. We continue to focus on retail properties leased to tenants with a service, nondiscretionary and/or a low price point component to their business. Today,, more than 90% of our retail revenues come from businesses with these characteristics, which better position them to successfully operate in all economic environments and compete with e-commerce.
At the end of the fourth quarter, our top 10 and top 20 tenants represented 37% and 53% of rental revenue, respectively. The tenants in our top 20 continue to capture nearly every tenant representing more than 1% of our rental revenue. There were no changes to the composition of our tenants and our top 25 last quarter.
None of the top 20 tenants have investment grade credit ratings. The rental revenue from these non-investment-grade-rated tenants represents over 1/2 of the rent from our top 20 tenants. Within our portfolio, no single tenant accounts for more than 5.4% of our rental revenue. The diversification by tenant remains favorable. 
Walgreens continues to be our largest tenant at 5.4% of rental revenue, unchanged from last quarter. FedEx remains our second largest tenant at 5.1% of rental revenue, which is also unchanged from last quarter.
Convenient stores remain our largest industry at 9.8% of rental revenue, down 20 basis points from last quarter. Our second largest industry is dollar stores at 9.5%, down 10 basis points from last quarter.
As many of you know the competition between Dollar Tree and Dollar General to purchase Family Dollar recently ended with Family Dollar shareholders approving a merger with Dollar Tree. Family Dollar is our fifth largest tenant at 4.5% of rental revenues. We view this outcome as an incremental positive given the minimal portfolio overlap Family Dollar has with Dollar Tree and there will be no impact on our tenant diversification metrics. The FTC is currently reviewing the merger, but we remain confident that the performance and long lease duration of our Family Dollar locations should ensure that the divestitures have no impact on our rental revenue.
We continue to have excellent credit quality in the portfolio with 46% of our rental revenue generated from investment-grade-rated tenants. Again, we define an investment-grade-rated company as having an investment-grade rating by 1 or more of the 3 major rating agencies. This revenue percentage is up from 40% a year ago. 
We continued to generate solid rental growth from these investment-grade tenants. Nearly 70% of our investment grade leases as a percentage of rental revenues have rental rate increases in them which average approximately 1.4% annually, which is consistent with our historical portfolio of rental growth rate. Overall, investment-grade tenant rental growth is about 1%. 
In addition to tenant credit, the store level performance of our retail tenants remains positive. Our weighted average rent coverage ratio in our retail properties is 2.6x on a four-wall basis and importantly, the median is 2.7x.
Moving onto acquisitions. We continue to see a very high volume of sourced acquisition opportunities. During the quarter, we sourced nearly $4 billion in acquisition opportunities. And for the year, we sourced $24 billion, making this our second most active year ever for sourced transactions. There continues to be a lot of capital in pursuing these transactions, and we continue to remain selective in our investment strategy, investing at attractive risk-adjusted returns and investment spreads for our shareholders.
During the quarter, we completed $158 million in property level acquisitions at a cash cap rate of 7.1%, bringing us to $1.4 billion in acquisitions for the year at an initial cash cap rate of 7.1% as well. Our investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital continues to be well above our historical average. Today, we are investing at spreads over 250 basis points above our weighted average cost of capital.
Given the active environment we are seeing, we are raising our 2015 acquisitions guidance. We now expect acquisitions volume of $700 million to $1 billion, an increase from our initial acquisitions guidance for the year of $500 million to $800 million.
As expected, we had a very active quarter for dispositions as we sold 18 properties for $53 million during the fourth quarter. During the year,, we sold 46 properties for $107 million, more than double our initial expectation of $50 million at the beginning of the year. And we are again reiterating our initial disposition guidance for 2015 of approximately $50 million. 
Now let me hand it over to Sumit to discuss in more detail our acquisitions and dispositions. Sumit?"

During the fourth quarter of 2014, we invested $158 million in 82 properties, approximately $1.9 million for property, located in 26 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 7.1% and with a weighted average lease term of 14.6 years.",703,"Thank you, John. During the fourth quarter of 2014, we invested $158 million in 82 properties, approximately $1.9 million for property, located in 26 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 7.1% and with a weighted average lease term of 14.6 years. As a reminder, our initial cap rate are cash not GAAP, which tend to be higher due to straight lining of rent. We define cash cap rates as contractual cash net operating income for the first 12 months of each lease following the acquisition date, divided by the total cost of the property, including all expenses borne by Realty income.
On a revenue basis, 32% of total acquisitions are from investment-grade tenants and 68% of the revenues are from noninvestment grade retail tenants. 87% of the revenues are generated from retail and 13% are from industrial and distribution. These assets are leased to 23 different tenants in 19 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented our Quick Service Restaurants, grocery stores and drugstores.
For the year 2014, we invested $1.4 billion in 506 properties, which equates to approximately 2.8 million of properties, located in 42 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 7.1% and with a weighted average lease term of 12.8 years. Of the total amount, approximately $434 million was invested in non-investment-grade retail properties.
On a revenue basis, 66% of total acquisitions are from investment-grade tenants. 86% of the revenues are generated from retail, 8% are from industrial, distribution and manufacturing and 6% are from office. These assets are leased to 62 different tenants in 32 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented our dollar stores, home improvement and drugstores. Of the 80 independent transactions closed in 2014, only 3 transactions were above $50 million. 
Transaction flow continues to remain healthy. We sourced approximately $4 billion in the fourth quarter. For 2014, we have sourced more than $24 billion in potential transaction opportunities. 2014 was the year with the second largest volume sourced in our company's history. Of these opportunities, 82% of the volumes sourced were portfolios and 18%, or approximately $5 billion, were one-off assets.
Investment-grade opportunities represented 49% for the fourth quarter. Of the $158 million in acquisitions closed in the quarter, approximately 33% were one-off transactions. 88% of the transactions closed in the fourth quarter were relationship-driven. We remain selective and disciplined in our investment approach, closing on less than 6% of deals sourced and continue to capitalize on our extensive industry relationships developed over our extended operating history.
As to pricing, cap rates remains tight in the fourth quarter with investment-grade properties trading from low 5% to high 6% cap rate range, and non-investment-grade properties trading from high 5% to low 8% cap rate range.
As John highlighted, our disposition activities remained active. During the quarter, we sold 18 properties for $53.4 million at a net cash cap rate of 5.7% and realized an unlevered IRR of just over 12%.
For 2014, we sold 46 properties for $106.6 million at a net cash cap rate of 6.9% and realized an unlevered IRR of 11.6%. Our investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital were very healthy, averaging 211 basis points in the fourth quarter and 195 basis points in 2014, which was significantly above our historical average spreads. We define investment spread as initial cash yield less our nominal first-year weighted average cost of capital. 
In conclusion, the fourth quarter investments remained solid at $158 million. For the year 2014, we invested $1.4 billion while sourcing more than $24 billion in transactions. Our spreads remained comfortably above our historical level as the tight cap rate environment in the fourth quarter was more than offset by an improving cost of capital. We continue to be very selective in pursuing opportunities that are in line with our long-term strategic objectives and within our acquisition parameters. We also took advantage of an aggressive pricing environment to accelerate disposition of assets that are no longer a strategic fit. As John mentioned, we are raising our acquisition guidance for 2015 from $500 million to $800 million, to $700 million to $1 billion. 
With that, I'd like to hand it back to John."

We continue to generate healthy per share earnings growth while maintaining a conservative capital structure. Our fourth quarter FFO and AFFO per share of $0.64 and $0.65, represented increases of 4.9% and 4.8%, respectively, from a year ago. Our 2014 FFO and AFFO per share of $2.58 and $2.57, represented increases of 7.1% and 6.6%, respectively, from a year ago. We are reiterating our 2015 FFO per share guidance range of $2.67 to $2.72, an increase of 3.5% to 5.4% over 2014 FFO per share. As mentioned earlier, we are also reiterating our AFFO per share guidance of $2.66 to $2.71, an increase of 3.5% to 5.4% over 2014 per share figures.
Our focus continues to be the payment of reliable monthly dividends that grow over time. We have increased our dividend every year since the company's listing in 1994, growing the dividend at a compounded average annual rate of 4.7%. Our track record was recognized last month with our addition to the S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrat Index, which measures the performance of companies in the S&P Composite 1500 that have increased their dividend every year for at least 20 consecutive years. We are 1 of only 6 REITs included in this index, and we remain committed to consistent growth of the dividend.
Our payout ratio is 84.5% based on a net point of our 2015 AFFO guidance, which is a level we continue to be comfortable with. This compares similarly with our 2014 AFFO payout ratio of 85.3%. 
Finally, to wrap it up, we are pleased with our performance for 2014, and we remain quite optimistic for 2015. As reflected in our increased acquisitions guidance, we continue to see healthy volumes of acquisition opportunities, but we will remain selective and disciplined with our investment strategy. We remain well positioned to execute on opportunities with just over $1.1 billion available on the credit facility today. Additionally, our cost of capital advantage continues to support our ability to drive healthy earnings accretion for our shareholders.

When you look at pricing, it's not only impacted by investment grade or non-investment-grade, it's also impacted by how much development did we do in the period, what are the average lease terms. So you'll look at that -- you look at the fourth quarter and you'll see lease terms that were longer and than they were in the third quarter. And that's reflected in the cap rate, the longer lease terms are going to be on more aggressive cap rates. And then on the development side, it constituted more activity in the third quarter and that's reflected -- those are higher yields and that's reflected in our average cap rate for the third quarter. So it's really hard to sort of extrapolate trends there because the mix shifts each quarter. I think it's better to look at the long-term trend.

So we're really approaching it with a long-term view here, and we think our investment strategy is something that will serve the company well over the long run. So, clearly, given our cost of capital advantage relative to the rest of this sector and our availability of capital, we could acquire a lot more than we're acquiring. But again we don't want to deviate from the assets that makes the most sense for us, and we don't want to get overly aggressive on that either."

So as usual, I will briefly comment on our financial statements and provide some highlights of our financial results for the quarter and the year, starting with the income statement. Total revenue increased 14.5% for the quarter and 19.6% for the year. This increase reflects our growth primarily from new acquisitions over the past year as well as same-store rent growth. Our annualized rental revenue at December 31 was approximately $920 million.
On the expense side, depreciation and amortization expense increased to $96.5 million in the quarter as depreciation expenses, obviously, increased with our portfolio growth. Interest expense increased in the quarter to $59.1 million. This increase was primarily due to our 2 recent bond offerings, a $350 million 10-year notes we issued in June, and the $250 million 12-year notes issued in September. On a related note, our coverage ratios both remain strong, with interest coverage at 3.8x and fixed charge coverage at 3.4x.
General and administrative, or G&A expenses, were approximately $15.6 million for the quarter and $51.1 million for the year. Both were decreases from last year, due to lower acquisition transaction cost as well as lower stock compensation cost. Overall, our total G&A in 2014 as a percentage of total rental and other revenues represented only 5.7% of revenues. Our projection for G&A expenses in 2015 is approximately $55 million or about 5.5% of revenues.
Property expenses, which were not reimbursed by tenant, totaled $4.2 million for the quarter and $16.8 million for the year. Our current projection for property expenses that we will be responsible for in 2015 is approximately $20 million. Income taxes, consist of income taxes paid to various states and cities by the company, they were approximately $1.1 million for the quarter and $3.5 million for the year.
Provisions for impairment of approximately $2 million during the quarter includes impairments we recorded on one sold property and 2 properties held for sale at December 31. Note that approximately $510,000 of this impairment is recognized in discontinued operations on the income statement, an accounting treatment that is necessary because the property was held for sale at the end of last year, when the disc ops accounting rules changed.
Gain on sales were approximately $25 million in the quarter and $42 million for the year. And just a reminder, as always, we do not include property sales gains in our FFO or AFFO. Funds from operations, or FFO per share, was $0.64 for the quarter, a 4.9% increase versus the year ago and $2.58 for the year, a 7.1% increase over 2013.
Adjusted funds from operations, or AFFO or the actual cash we have available for distribution at dividend, was $0.65 per share for the quarter, a 4.8% increase versus a year ago. It came in at $2.57 for the year, a 6.6% increase over 2013.
Dividends paid increased 2.1% in 2014, an improvement as we announced last month, we declared a 3% increase to our cash monthly dividend, which was paid to shareholders this month. Our monthly dividend now equates to a current annualized amount of approximately $2.268 per share.
Briefly turning to the balance sheet. We've continued to maintain our conservative and safe capital structure. As previously disclosed, we redeemed our $220 million of preferred E stock, which had a coupon of 6.75% back in October. Recall, that in mid-September, we issued $250 million of 12-year bonds, priced at a yield of 4.178% to prefund this preferred redemption. This transaction overall resulted in annual cash expense savings of almost $5.7 million.
Obviously, we are pleased with our continued access to low-cost, long-term capital in the bond market. Our bonds, which are all unsecured and fixed-rate and continue to be rated Baa1, BBB+, have a weighted average maturity of 7.2 years. Our $1.5 billion acquisition credit facility had a $223 million balance at December 31. And currently, we have $382 million of borrowings on the line. We do not assume any mortgages during the quarter. We did pay off some at maturity, so our outstanding net mortgage debt at year-end decreased to approximately $836 million.
Not including our credit facility, the only variable rate debt exposure to rising interest rates that we have is on just $39 million of this mortgage debt. And our overall debt maturity schedule remains in very good shape with only $120 million of mortgages and $150 million of bonds coming due in 2015, and our maturity schedule as well laddered thereafter. Currently, our debt-to-total market capitalization is approximately 30% and our preferred stock outstanding is less than 2.5% of our capital structure. And our debt-to-EBITDA at year-end was only 5.8x.
Now let me turn the call back over the John, who will give you more background."

I'll begin with an overview of the portfolio, which is performing well and continues to generate a tenable cash flow for our shareholders. Occupancy increased 10 basis points from last quarter and 20 basis points year-over-year to 98.4% base",1079,"Thanks, Paul. I'll begin with an overview of the portfolio, which is performing well and continues to generate a tenable cash flow for our shareholders. Occupancy increased 10 basis points from last quarter and 20 basis points year-over-year to 98.4% based on the number of properties, with 70 properties available for lease, out of over 4,300 properties in our portfolio. This is the highest our occupancy had been since 2007. Occupancy based on square footage was 99.2%, a 10 basis points improvement from last quarter and 20 basis points year-over-year. Economic occupancy was also 99.2%, a 10 basis points improvement from both last quarter and year-over-year. 
2014 has been one of our most active years ever for lease rollover activity with leases expiring on 220 properties. Of these properties, we re-leased 173 to existing tenants and 30 to new tenants, recapturing 99.3% of expiring rents on the properties that were re-leased. In addition, we sold 17 vacant properties during the year. 
In the fourth quarter, we experienced 54 lease rollovers. Of these, we re-leased 40 to existing tenants and 10 to new tenants, recapturing approximately 97% of expiring rents on the properties that were re-leased. 8 vacant properties were sold during the fourth quarter. 
Our same-store rent increased 1.7% during the quarter and 1.5% in 2014. The industry is contributing most to our quarterly same-store rent growth were convenience stores, health and fitness and quick service restaurants. We expect same-store rent growth to remain at about 1.5% for the foreseeable future.
Our portfolio continues to be diversified by tenant, industry, geography and to a certain extent, property type. At the end of the fourth quarter, our properties were leased to 234 commercial tenants and 47 different industries located in 49 states and Puerto Rico, 79% of our rental revenues from our traditional retail properties, while 21% is from non-retail properties, the largest component being industrial and distribution.
This diversification continues to enhance the predictability of our cash flow. We continue to focus on retail properties leased to tenants with a service, nondiscretionary and/or a low price point component to their business. Today, more than 90% of our retail revenues come from businesses with these characteristics, which better position them to successfully operate in all economic environments and to compete with e-commerce.
At the end of the fourth quarter, our top 10 and top 20 tenants represented 37% and 53% of rental revenue, respectively. The tenants in our top 20 continue to capture nearly every tenant representing more than 1% of our rental revenue. There were no changes to the composition of our tenants and our top 25 since last quarter.
None of the top 20 tenants have investment grade credit ratings. The rental revenue from these non-investment-grade-rated tenants represents over 1/2 of the rent from our top 20 tenants. Within our portfolio, no single tenant accounts for more than 5.4% of our rental revenue. The diversification by tenant remains favorable. 
Walgreens continues to be our largest tenant at 5.4% of rental revenue, unchanged from last quarter. FedEx remains our second largest tenant at 5.1% of rental revenue, which is also unchanged from last quarter. Convenient stores remain our largest industry at 9.8% of rental revenue, down 20 basis points from last quarter. Our second largest industry is Dollar Stores at 9.5%, down 10 basis points from last quarter.
As many of you know the competition between Dollar Tree and Dollar General to purchase Family Dollar recently ended with Family Dollar shareholders approving the merger with Dollar Tree. Family Dollar is our fifth largest tenant at 4.5% of rental revenues. We view this outcome as an incremental positive, given the minimal portfolio overlap Family Dollar has with Dollar Tree and there will be no impact on our tenant diversification metrics. The FTC is currently reviewing the merger, but we remain confident that the performance and long lease duration of our Family Dollar locations should ensure that the divestitures have no impact on our rental revenue.
We continue to have excellent credit quality in the portfolio, with 46% of our rental revenue generated from investment-grade-rated tenants. Again, we define an investment-grade-rated company as having an investment-grade rating by one or more of the 3 major rating agencies. This revenue percentage is up from 40% a year ago. 
We continued to generate solid rental growth from these investment-grade tenants. Nearly 70% of our investment-grade leases as a percentage of rental revenues have rental rate increases in them, which average approximately 1.4% annually, which is consistent with our historical portfolio of rental growth rate. Overall, investment-grade tenant rental growth is about 1%. 
In addition to tenant credit, the store level performance of our retail tenants remains positive. Our weighted average rent coverage ratio in our retail properties is 2.6x on a four-wall basis. And importantly, the median is 2.7x.
Moving on to acquisitions. We continue to see a very high volume of sourced acquisition opportunities. During the quarter, we sourced nearly $4 billion in acquisition opportunities. And for the year, we sourced $24 billion, making this our second most active year ever for sourced transactions. There continues to be a lot of capital in pursuing these transactions, and we continue to remain selective in our investment strategy, investing at attractive risk-adjusted returns and investment spreads for our shareholders.
During the quarter, we completed $158 million in property level acquisitions at a cash cap rate of 7.1%, bringing us to $1.4 billion in acquisitions for the year at an initial cash cap rate of 7.1% as well. Our investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital continues to be well above our historical average. Today, we are investing at spreads over 250 basis points above our weighted average cost of capital.
Given the active environment we are seeing, we are raising our 2015 acquisitions guidance. We now expect acquisitions volume of $700 million to $1 billion, an increase from our initial acquisitions guidance for the year of $500 million to $800 million.
As expected, we had a very active quarter for dispositions as we sold 18 properties for $53 million during the fourth quarter. During the year, we sold 46 properties for $107 million, more than double our initial expectation of $50 million at the beginning of the year. And we are again reiterating our initial disposition guidance for 2015 of approximately $50 million. 
Now let me hand it over to Sumit, to discuss in more detail our acquisitions and dispositions. Sumit?"

During the fourth quarter of 2014, we invested $158 million in 82 properties, approximately $1.9 million per property, located in 26 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 7.1% and with a weighted average lease term of 14.6 years.",700,"Thank you, John. During the fourth quarter of 2014, we invested $158 million in 82 properties, approximately $1.9 million per property, located in 26 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 7.1% and with a weighted average lease term of 14.6 years. As a reminder, our initial cash cap rates are cash and not GAAP, which tend to be higher due to straight lining of rent. We define cash cap rates as contractual cash net operating income for the first 12 months of each lease following the acquisition date, divided by the total cost of the property, including all expenses borne by Realty Income.
On a revenue basis, 32% of total acquisitions are from investment-grade tenants and 68% of the revenues are from non-investment-grade retail tenants. 87% of the revenues are generated from retail and 13% are from industrial and distribution. These assets are leased to 23 different tenants in 19 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented are quick-service restaurants, grocery stores and drugstores.
For the year 2014, we invested $1.4 billion in 506 properties, which equates to approximately 2.8 million of properties, located in 42 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 7.1% and with a weighted average lease term of 12.8 years. Of the total amount, approximately $434 million was invested in non-investment-grade retail properties.
On a revenue basis, 66% of total acquisitions are from investment-grade tenants. 86% of the revenues are generated from retail, 8% are from industrial, distribution and manufacturing and 6% are from office. These assets are leased to 62 different tenants in 32 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented our Dollar Stores, home improvement and drugstores. Of the 80 independent transactions closed in 2014, only 3 transactions were above $50 million. 
Transaction flow continues to remain healthy. We sourced approximately $4 billion in the fourth quarter. For 2014, we have sourced more than $24 billion in potential transaction opportunities. 2014 was the year with the second largest volume sourced in our company's history. Of these opportunities, 82% of the volumes sourced were portfolios and 18%, or approximately $5 billion, were one-off assets.
Investment-grade opportunities represented 49% for the fourth quarter. Of the $158 million in acquisitions closed in the fourth quarter, approximately 33% were one-off transactions. 88% of the transactions closed in the fourth quarter were relationship-driven. We remain selective and disciplined in our investment approach, closing on less than 6% of deals sourced and continue to capitalize on our extensive industry relationships developed over our extended operating history.
As to pricing, cap rates remains tight in the fourth quarter, with investment-grade properties trading from low-5% to high-6% cap rate range, and non-investment-grade properties trading from high-5% to low-8% cap rate range.
As John highlighted, our disposition activities remained active. During the quarter, we sold 18 properties for $53.4 million at a net cash cap rate of 5.7% and realized an unlevered IRR of just over 12%.
For 2014, we sold 46 properties for $106.6 million at a net cash cap rate of 6.9% and realized an unlevered IRR of 11.6%. Our investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital were very healthy, averaging 211 basis points in the fourth quarter and 195 basis points in 2014, which was significantly above our historical average spreads. We define investment spread as initial cash yield less our nominal first-year weighted average cost of capital. 
In conclusion, the fourth quarter investments remained solid at $158 million. For the year 2014, we invested $1.4 billion, while sourcing more than $24 billion in transactions. Our spreads remained comfortably above our historical level as the tight cap rate environment in the fourth quarter was more than offset by our improving cost of capital. We continue to be very selective in pursuing opportunities that are in line with our long-term strategic objectives and within our acquisition parameters. We also took advantage of an aggressive pricing environment to accelerate disposition of assets that are no longer a strategic fit. 
As John mentioned, we are raising our acquisition guidance for 2015 from $500 million to $800 million, to $700 million to $1 billion. With that, I'd like to hand it back to John."

Our 2014 FFO and AFFO per share of $2.58 and $2.57, represented increases of 7.1% and 6.6%, respectively, from a year ago. We are reiterating our 2015 FFO per share guidance range of $2.67 to $2.72, an increase of 3.5% to 5.4% over 2014 FFO per share. As mentioned earlier, we are also reiterating our AFFO per share guidance of $2.66 to $2.71, an increase of 3.5% to 5.4% over 2014 per share figures.
Our focus continues to be the payment of reliable monthly dividends that grow over time. We have increased our dividend every year since the company's listing in 1994, growing the dividend at a compounded average annual rate of 4.7%. Our track record was recognized last month with our addition to the S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrat index, which measures the performance of companies in the S&P Composite 1500 that have increased their dividend every year for at least 20 consecutive years. We are one of only 6 REITs included in this index, and we remain committed to consistent growth of the dividend.
Our payout ratio is 84.5% based on a net point of our 2015 AFFO guidance, which is a level we continue to be comfortable with. This compares similarly with our 2014 AFFO payout ratio of 85.3%. 
Finally, to wrap it up, we are pleased with our performance for 2014, and we remain quite optimistic for 2015. As reflected in our increased acquisitions guidance, we continue to see healthy volumes of acquisition opportunities, but we will remain selective and disciplined with our investment strategy. 
We remain well positioned to execute on opportunities, with just over $1.1 billion available on the credit facility today. Additionally, our cost of capital advantage continues to support our ability to drive healthy earnings accretion for our shareholders.

The most active we've been in our history over the last 5 years, and buying non-investment-grade retail. So we'll continue to do that, going forward. As far as acquisitions guidance, the first part of your question, we are seeing both more one-off and small portfolio sourcing opportunities as well as some larger portfolios. So the driver in our acquisitions guidance change has been more activity, continued risk sourcing activity. It's given us more confidence for the year, and therefore, we raised the midpoint of our acquisitions guidance by $200 million. Now I'll add that we did not adjust our AFFO per share estimates because we believe this activity, incremental activity, will be more back-end loaded and will have more of an impact in 2016 than 2015."

So as usual, I will briefly comment on our financial statements and provide some highlights of our financial results for the quarter and the year, starting with the income statement. Total revenue increased 14.5% for the quarter and 19.6% for the year. This increase reflects our growth primarily from new acquisitions over the past year as well as same-store rent growth. Our annualized rental revenue at December 31 was approximately $920 million.
On the expense side, depreciation and amortization expense increased to $96.5 million in the quarter as depreciation expenses, obviously, increased with our portfolio growth. Interest expense increased in the quarter to $59.1 million. This increase was primarily due to our 2 recent bond offerings, a $350 million 10-year notes we issued in June, and the $250 million 12-year notes issued in September. On a related note, our coverage ratios both remain strong, with interest coverage at 3.8x and fixed charge coverage at 3.4x.
General and administrative, or G&A expenses, were approximately $15.6 million for the quarter and $51.1 million for the year. Both were decreases from last year, due to lower acquisition transaction cost as well as lower stock compensation cost. Overall, our total G&A in 2014 as a percentage of total rental and other revenues represented only 5.7% of revenues. Our projection for G&A expenses in 2015 is approximately $55 million or about 5.5% of revenues.
Property expenses, which were not reimbursed by tenant, totaled $4.2 million for the quarter and $16.8 million for the year. Our current projection for property expenses that we will be responsible for in 2015 is approximately $20 million. Income taxes, consist of income taxes paid to various states and cities by the company, they were approximately $1.1 million for the quarter and $3.5 million for the year.
Provisions for impairment of approximately $2 million during the quarter includes impairments we recorded on one sold property and 2 properties held for sale at December 31. Note that approximately $510,000 of this impairment is recognized in discontinued operations on the income statement, an accounting treatment that is necessary because the property was held for sale at the end of last year, when the disc ops accounting rules changed.
Gain on sales were approximately $25 million in the quarter and $42 million for the year. And just a reminder, as always, we do not include property sales gains in our FFO or AFFO. Funds from operations, or FFO per share, was $0.64 for the quarter, a 4.9% increase versus the year ago and $2.58 for the year, a 7.1% increase over 2013.
Adjusted funds from operations, or AFFO or the actual cash we have available for distribution at dividend, was $0.65 per share for the quarter, a 4.8% increase versus a year ago. It came in at $2.57 for the year, a 6.6% increase over 2013.
Dividends paid increased 2.1% in 2014, an improvement as we announced last month, we declared a 3% increase to our cash monthly dividend, which was paid to shareholders this month. Our monthly dividend now equates to a current annualized amount of approximately $2.268 per share.
Briefly turning to the balance sheet. We've continued to maintain our conservative and safe capital structure. As previously disclosed, we redeemed our $220 million of preferred E stock, which had a coupon of 6.75% back in October. Recall, that in mid-September, we issued $250 million of 12-year bonds, priced at a yield of 4.178% to prefund this preferred redemption. This transaction overall resulted in annual cash expense savings of almost $5.7 million.
Obviously, we are pleased with our continued access to low-cost, long-term capital in the bond market. Our bonds, which are all unsecured and fixed-rate and continue to be rated Baa1, BBB+, have a weighted average maturity of 7.2 years. Our $1.5 billion acquisition credit facility had a $223 million balance at December 31. And currently, we have $382 million of borrowings on the line. We do not assume any mortgages during the quarter. We did pay off some at maturity, so our outstanding net mortgage debt at year-end decreased to approximately $836 million.
Not including our credit facility, the only variable rate debt exposure to rising interest rates that we have is on just $39 million of this mortgage debt. And our overall debt maturity schedule remains in very good shape with only $120 million of mortgages and $150 million of bonds coming due in 2015, and our maturity schedule as well laddered thereafter. Currently, our debt-to-total market capitalization is approximately 30% and our preferred stock outstanding is less than 2.5% of our capital structure. And our debt-to-EBITDA at year-end was only 5.8x.

I'll begin with an overview of the portfolio, which is performing well and continues to generate a tenable cash flow for our shareholders.

I'll begin with an overview of the portfolio, which is performing well and continues to generate a tenable cash flow for our shareholders. Occupancy increased 10 basis points from last quarter and 20 basis points year-over-year to 98.4% based on the number of properties, with 70 properties available for lease, out of over 4,300 properties in our portfolio. This is the highest our occupancy had been since 2007. Occupancy based on square footage was 99.2%, a 10 basis points improvement from last quarter and 20 basis points year-over-year. Economic occupancy was also 99.2%, a 10 basis points improvement from both last quarter and year-over-year. 
2014 has been one of our most active years ever for lease rollover activity with leases expiring on 220 properties. Of these properties, we re-leased 173 to existing tenants and 30 to new tenants, recapturing 99.3% of expiring rents on the properties that were re-leased. In addition, we sold 17 vacant properties during the year. 
In the fourth quarter, we experienced 54 lease rollovers. Of these, we re-leased 40 to existing tenants and 10 to new tenants, recapturing approximately 97% of expiring rents on the properties that were re-leased. 8 vacant properties were sold during the fourth quarter. 
Our same-store rent increased 1.7% during the quarter and 1.5% in 2014. The industry is contributing most to our quarterly same-store rent growth were convenience stores, health and fitness and quick service restaurants. We expect same-store rent growth to remain at about 1.5% for the foreseeable future.
Our portfolio continues to be diversified by tenant, industry, geography and to a certain extent, property type. At the end of the fourth quarter, our properties were leased to 234 commercial tenants and 47 different industries located in 49 states and Puerto Rico, 79% of our rental revenues from our traditional retail properties, while 21% is from non-retail properties, the largest component being industrial and distribution.
This diversification continues to enhance the predictability of our cash flow. We continue to focus on retail properties leased to tenants with a service, nondiscretionary and/or a low price point component to their business. Today, more than 90% of our retail revenues come from businesses with these characteristics, which better position them to successfully operate in all economic environments and to compete with e-commerce.
At the end of the fourth quarter, our top 10 and top 20 tenants represented 37% and 53% of rental revenue, respectively. The tenants in our top 20 continue to capture nearly every tenant representing more than 1% of our rental revenue. There were no changes to the composition of our tenants and our Top 25 since last quarter.
None of the Top 20 tenants have investment grade credit ratings. The rental revenue from these non-investment-grade-rated tenants represents over 1/2 of the rent from our Top 20 tenants. Within our portfolio, no single tenant accounts for more than 5.4% of our rental revenue. The diversification by tenant remains favorable. 
Walgreens continues to be our largest tenant at 5.4% of rental revenue, unchanged from last quarter. FedEx remains our second largest tenant at 5.1% of rental revenue, which is also unchanged from last quarter. Convenience stores remain our largest industry at 9.8% of rental revenue, down 20 basis points from last quarter. Our second largest industry is Dollar Stores at 9.5%, down 10 basis points from last quarter.
As many of you know the competition between Dollar Tree and Dollar General to purchase Family Dollar recently ended with Family Dollar shareholders approving the merger with Dollar Tree. Family Dollar is our fifth largest tenant at 4.5% of rental revenues. We view this outcome as an incremental positive, given the minimal portfolio overlap Family Dollar has with Dollar Tree and there will be no impact on our tenant diversification metrics. The FTC is currently reviewing the merger, but we remain confident that the performance and long lease duration of our Family Dollar locations should ensure that the divestitures have no impact on our rental revenue.
We continue to have excellent credit quality in the portfolio, with 46% of our rental revenue generated from investment-grade-rated tenants. Again, we define an investment-grade-rated company as having an investment-grade rating by one or more of the 3 major rating agencies. This revenue percentage is up from 40% a year ago. 
We continued to generate solid rental growth from these investment-grade tenants. Nearly 70% of our investment-grade leases as a percentage of rental revenues have rental rate increases in them, which average approximately 1.4% annually, which is consistent with our historical portfolio of rental growth rate. Overall, investment-grade tenant rental growth is about 1%. 
In addition to tenant credit, the store level performance of our retail tenants remains positive. Our weighted average rent coverage ratio in our retail properties is 2.6x on a four-wall basis. And importantly, the median is 2.7x.
Moving on to acquisitions. We continue to see a very high volume of sourced acquisition opportunities. During the quarter, we sourced nearly $4 billion in acquisition opportunities. And for the year, we sourced $24 billion, making this our second most active year ever for sourced transactions. There continues to be a lot of capital in pursuing these transactions, and we continue to remain selective in our investment strategy, investing at attractive risk-adjusted returns and investment spreads for our shareholders.
During the quarter, we completed $158 million in property level acquisitions at a cash cap rate of 7.1%, bringing us to $1.4 billion in acquisitions for the year at an initial cash cap rate of 7.1% as well. Our investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital continues to be well above our historical average. Today, we are investing at spreads over 250 basis points above our weighted average cost of capital.
Given the active environment we are seeing, we are raising our 2015 acquisitions guidance. We now expect acquisitions volume of $700 million to $1 billion, an increase from our initial acquisitions guidance for the year of $500 million to $800 million.
As expected, we had a very active quarter for dispositions as we sold 18 properties for $53 million during the fourth quarter. During the year, we sold 46 properties for $107 million, more than double our initial expectation of $50 million at the beginning of the year. And we are again reiterating our initial disposition guidance for 2015 of approximately $50 million. 
Now let me hand it over to Sumit, to discuss in more detail our acquisitions and dispositions. Sumit?"

During the fourth quarter of 2014, we invested $158 million in 82 properties, approximately $1.9 million per property, located in 26 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 7.1%, and with a weighted average lease term of 14.6 years.",699,"Thank you, John. During the fourth quarter of 2014, we invested $158 million in 82 properties, approximately $1.9 million per property, located in 26 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 7.1%, and with a weighted average lease term of 14.6 years. As a reminder, our initial cash cap rates are cash and not GAAP, which tend to be higher due to straight-lining of rent. We define cash cap rates as contractual cash net operating income for the first 12 months of each lease following the acquisition date, divided by the total cost of the property, including all expenses borne by Realty Income.
On a revenue basis, 32% of total acquisitions are from investment-grade tenants and 68% of the revenues are from non-investment-grade retail tenants. 87% of the revenues are generated from retail and 13% are from industrial and distribution. These assets are leased to 23 different tenants in 19 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented are quick-service restaurants, grocery stores and drugstores.
For the year 2014, we invested $1.4 billion in 506 properties, which equates to approximately 2.8 million of properties, located in 42 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 7.1% and with a weighted average lease term of 12.8 years. Of the total amount, approximately $434 million was invested in non-investment-grade retail properties.
On a revenue basis, 66% of total acquisitions are from investment-grade tenants. 86% of the revenues are generated from retail, 8% are from industrial, distribution and manufacturing, and 6% are from office. These assets are leased to 62 different tenants in 32 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented our Dollar Stores, home improvement and drugstores. Of the 80 independent transactions closed in 2014, only 3 transactions were above $50 million. 
Transaction flow continues to remain healthy. We sourced approximately $4 billion in the fourth quarter. For 2014, we have sourced more than $24 billion in potential transaction opportunities. 2014 was the year with the second largest volume sourced in our company's history. Of these opportunities, 82% of the volumes sourced were portfolios and 18%, or approximately $5 billion, were one-off assets.
Investment-grade opportunities represented 49% for the fourth quarter. Of the $158 million in acquisitions closed in the fourth quarter, approximately 33% were one-off transactions. 88% of the transactions closed in the fourth quarter were relationship-driven. We remain selective and disciplined in our investment approach, closing on less than 6% of deals sourced and continue to capitalize on our extensive industry relationships developed over our extended operating history.
As to pricing, cap rates remains tight in the fourth quarter, with investment-grade properties trading from low-5% to high-6% cap rate range, and non-investment-grade properties trading from high-5% to low-8% cap rate range.
As John highlighted, our disposition activities remained active. During the quarter, we sold 18 properties for $53.4 million at a net cash cap rate of 5.7% and realized an unlevered IRR of just over 12%.
For 2014, we sold 46 properties for $106.6 million at a net cash cap rate of 6.9% and realized an unlevered IRR of 11.6%. Our investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital were very healthy, averaging 211 basis points in the fourth quarter and 195 basis points in 2014, which was significantly above our historical average spreads. We define investment spread as initial cash yield less our nominal first-year weighted average cost of capital. 
In conclusion, the fourth quarter investments remained solid at $158 million. For the year 2014, we invested $1.4 billion, while sourcing more than $24 billion in transactions. Our spreads remained comfortably above our historical level as the tight cap rate environment in the fourth quarter was more than offset by our improving cost of capital. We continue to be very selective in pursuing opportunities that are in line with our long-term strategic objectives and within our acquisition parameters. We also took advantage of an aggressive pricing environment to accelerate disposition of assets that are no longer a strategic fit. 
As John mentioned, we are raising our acquisition guidance for 2015 from $500 million to $800 million, to $700 million to $1 billion. With that, I'd like to hand it back to John."

Our fourth quarter FFO and AFFO per share of $0.64 and $0.65, represented increases of 4.9% and 4.8%, respectively, from a year ago. Our 2014 FFO and AFFO per share of $2.58 and $2.57, represented increases of 7.1% and 6.6%, respectively, from a year ago. We are reiterating our 2015 FFO per share guidance range of $2.67 to $2.72, an increase of 3.5% to 5.4% over 2014 FFO per share. As mentioned earlier, we are also reiterating our AFFO per share guidance of $2.66 to $2.71, an increase of 3.5% to 5.4% over 2014 per share figures.
Our focus continues to be the payment of reliable monthly dividends that grow over time. We have increased our dividend every year since the company's listing in 1994, growing the dividend at a compounded average annual rate of 4.7%. Our track record was recognized last month with our addition to the S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrat index, which measures the performance of companies in the S&P Composite 1500 that have increased their dividend every year for at least 20 consecutive years. We are one of only 6 REITs included in this index, and we remain committed to consistent growth of the dividend.
Our payout ratio is 84.5% based on a net point of our 2015 AFFO guidance, which is a level we continue to be comfortable with. This compares similarly with our 2014 AFFO payout ratio of 85.3%. 
Finally, to wrap it up, we are pleased with our performance for 2014, and we remain quite optimistic for 2015. As reflected in our increased acquisitions guidance, we continue to see healthy volumes of acquisition opportunities, but we will remain selective and disciplined with our investment strategy. 
We remain well positioned to execute on opportunities, with just over $1.1 billion available on the credit facility today. Additionally, our cost of capital advantage continues to support our ability to drive healthy earnings accretion for our shareholders. 
At this time, I would now like to open it up for questions. Operator?"

And mission critical or significant locations with investments at or around replacement cost, at or around long term -- at or around market rents, with growth -- with a long-term lease. So that's typically the profile of what we're seeing and cap rates for that product range from probably the mid-5s right now to the high-6s.

And we've never gotten away from that business. We supplemented it with the investment-grade strategy, but we continue to be very active. The most active we've been in our history over the last 5 years in buying non-investment-grade retail. So we'll continue to do that, going forward. As far as acquisitions guidance, the first part of your question, we are seeing both more one-off and small portfolio sourcing opportunities as well as some larger portfolios. So the driver in our acquisitions guidance change has been more activity, continued risk sourcing activity. It's given us more confidence for the year, and therefore, we raised the midpoint of our acquisitions guidance by $200 million. Now I'll add that we did not adjust our AFFO per share estimates because we believe this activity, incremental activity, will be more back-end loaded and will have more of an impact in 2016 than 2015."

So you'll look at that -- you look at the fourth quarter and you'll see lease terms that were longer than they were in the third quarter. And that's reflected in the cap rate, the longer lease terms, you're going to be at more aggressive cap rates. And then on the development side, it constituted more activity in the third quarter and that's reflected -- those are higher yields and that's reflected in our average cap rate for the third quarter. So it's really hard to sort of extrapolate trends there because the mix shifts each quarter. I think it's better to look at the long-term trend. And while we did see some cap rate compression last year towards the end of the year, it kind of -- it slowed down, Cedrik.

As usual, I will comment and provide some brief highlights regarding our financial results for the quarter starting with the income statement. Total revenue increased 11.4% for the quarter. This increase reflects our growth primarily from new acquisitions over the past year, as well as same-store rent growth. Our annualized rental revenue at March 31 was approximately $936 million. On the expense side, interest expense increased in the quarter to $58.5 million. This increase was primarily due to our 2 recent bond offerings. The $350 million 10-year notes we issued last June and the $250 million 12-year notes issued in September. We also recognized a noncash $1.1 million loss on interest rate swaps during the quarter. 
On a related note, our coverage ratios both remained strong with interest coverage at 3.9x and fixed charge coverage at 3.4x. General and administrative or G&A expenses were approximately $12.9 million for the quarter, essentially unchanged from the prior year. Included in G&A expenses, approximately $94,000 in acquisition costs. Our G&A as a percentage of total rental and other revenues is only 5.4%. And our projection for G&A expenses in 2015 remains the same at approximately $55 million. Property expenses, which were not reimbursed by tenant, totaled $4 million for the quarter. Our current projection for property expenses that we will be responsible for in 2015 remains approximately $20 million. Provisions from impairment of approximately $2.1 million during the quarter, includes impairments we recorded on 1 sold property, 1 property classified as held-for-sale and 1 property where the building was replaced. Gain on sales were approximately $7.2 million in the quarter. And just a reminder, as always, we do not include property sales gains in our FFO or in our AFFO. Funds from operations or FFO per share was $0.68 for the quarter, a 4.6% increase versus a year ago, and adjusted funds from operations or AFFO, where the actual cash we have available for distribution as dividends, was $0.67 per share the quarter, a 4.7% versus a year ago. Dividends paid increased 2.6% in Q1, and we again increased our cash monthly dividend this quarter. Our monthly dividend now equates to a current annualized amount of approximately $2.274 per share. 
Briefly turning to the balance sheet. We continue to maintain our current conservative and safe capital structure. As you know, in early April, we raised approximately $276 million of new equity capital in conjunction to the S&P 500 Index. The index inclusion was an excellent opportunity to raise capital at very low costs by offering shares to the index fund needing to buy stock on that specific day. Our bonds, which are all unsecured and fixed-rate and continue to be rated Baa1 BBB+ have a weighted average maturity of 7 years. Our $1.5 billion acquisition credit facility had a $370 million balance at March 31. After the equity offering and our acquisition activity in April, the facility balance today is approximately $400 million. We did not assume any mortgages during the quarter. We did pay off some at maturity. So our outstanding net mortgage debt at quarter end decreased to approximately $785 million. Not including our credit facility, the only variable rate debt exposure to rising interest rates that we have is on just $15.5 million of mortgage debt. And our overall debt maturity schedule remains in very good shape with only $68 million of mortgages and $150 million of bonds coming due in 2015, and our maturity schedule is well laddered thereafter. Currently, our debt to total market capitalization is approximately 29% and our preferred stock outstanding is only 2.5% of our capital structure. And our debt-to-EBITDA at quarter end was approximately 5.7x.

Occupancy days on a number of properties was 98%, a 40 basis points decline from last quarter. At the end of the quarter, we had 86 properties available for lease out of nearly 4400 properties in our portfolio. Economic occupancy was 99.1%, a 10 basis points decline from last quarter and a 10 basis points improvement year-over-year. Occupancy based on square footage was 98.7%. We had a number of properties come off leased during the first quarter which impacted primarily our physical occupancy. Our leasing team will continue to address these properties as part of our standard portfolio management process. We continue to expect our occupancy to remain around 98% through 2015. Of the 43 properties we released during the quarter, 30 were leased to existing tenants and 13 were leased to new tenants. We're capturing 99.2% of expiring rents. Additionally, 5 vacant properties were sold during the quarter. 
Our same-store rent increased 1.4% during the quarter. The industry's contributing most to our quarterly same-store rent growth where convenience stores, health and fitness and quick service restaurants. We expect same-store rent growth to remain about 1.4% for the foreseeable future. 
Our portfolio continues to be diversified by tenant, industry, geography, and to a certain extent, property type. At the end of the first quarter, our properties were leased to 236 commercial tenants and 47 different industries located in 49 states and Puerto Rico. 78% of our rental revenues from our traditional retail properties. The largest component outside of retail is industrial and distribution properties at 11%. Our diversification contributes to the predictability of our cash flow. We continue to focus on retail on properties these attendance with a service, nondiscretionary and/or low price point component to the business. Today, more than 90% of our retail revenue comes from businesses with these characteristics, which better positions them to successfully operate in a variety of economic environment and compete with e-commerce. At the end of the first quarter, our top 20 tenants represent 54% of rental revenue. The tenants in our top 20 continue to capture nearly every tenant, representing more than 1% of our rental revenue. With Circle K's acquisition of the pantry, 2 of our top 20 tenants consolidated into 1 allowing the U.S. government to enter our top 20 at 1.2% of rent. Now 10 of our top 20 tenants have investment-grade credit ratings. The rental revenue from these 10 investment-grade rated tenants represent 60% of the rent from our top 20 tenants. Within our portfolio, no single tenant accounts for more than 5.5% of rental revenue. So diversification by tenant remains favorable. Walgreens continues to be our largest tenant at 5.5% of rental revenue. FedEx remains our second largest tenant at 5.2% of rental revenue. Drug stores and convenience stores of our 2 largest industries, each at 9.6% of rental revenue. Drugstores are up 10 basis points from last quarter, while convenience stores were down 20 basis points from last quarter. Our third largest industry is Dollar Store is at 9.3%, down 20 basis points from last quarter. As many of you know, Dollar Tree is expected to close its acquisition at Family Dollar later in the second quarter. The FCC has substantially completed its review of the acquisition and identified 340 of the combined 14,000 stores for divestiture. We continue to expect no  financial impact on our rental revenue given the minimal portfolio overlap at our Family Dollar locations at Dollar Tree and the long lease durations our locations. 
We continue to have excellent credit quality in the portfolio with 48% of our rental revenue generated from investment-grade rated tenants. This revenue percentage is up from 46% at the end of the 2014 primarily as a result of acquisition of the Pantry. Converting the Pantry, our former [ph] 15th largest tenant for non-investment grade to investment grade status. However, this percentage have moved down a bit to the mid-40s later in the second quarter as a result of Dollar Tree's pending acquisition in the Family Dollar. In addition to tenant credit, the store-level performance of our retail tenants remains positive. Our weighted average rent coverage ratio on our retail properties is 2.6x on a four wall [ph] basis. And importantly, the median is also 2.6x. 
Moving on to acquisitions, we continue to see high-volume of acquisition opportunities. During the quarter, we sourced about $9.5 billion in acquisition opportunities and completed the $210 million at a cash cap rate of 6.9%. So we remain selective in our investment strategy. There continues to be a lot of capital pursuing these transactions and we continue to keep cap rates tick down a bit from the higher quality properties we are pursuing. However, our investment spreads relative to our cost of capital continue to be quite attractive. Subsequent to the first quarter end, we closed an additional $302 million in acquisitions, bringing us to a total of $512 million in acquisitions for the first 4 months of the year. We expect acquisitions volume for 2015 to be at the high end of our previous acquisitions guidance range of $700 million to $1 billion given what we're seeing today. We continue to selectively sell assets and redeploy debt capital and the properties that better fit our investment strategy. During the quarter, we sold 9 properties for $22.1 million. We continue to anticipate dispositions to be around $50 million for 2015. 
I'll hand it over to Sumit to discuss our acquisitions and dispositions in more detail now. Sumit?"

As a reminder, our initial cap rates are cash and not GAAP, which tend to be higher due to straight lining of rent. We define cash cap rates as contractual cash net operating income for the first 12 months of each lease following the acquisition date divided by the total cost of the property, including all expenses drawn by Realty income. On a revenue basis, 60% of total acquisitions are from investment-grade tenants. And the rest of the revenue of from retail tenants that are non-investment-grade or not rated. 74% of the revenues are generated from retail and 26% off from industrial and distribution assets. 
These assets lead [ph] to 15 different tenants and 12 industries [ph] some of the most significant industries represented are Diversified Industrial, Quick Service Restaurants and Automotive Services. Of the 9 independent transactions closed in the first quarter, only 1 transaction was above $50 million. Transaction flow continues to remain healthy. We sourced more than $9 billion in the first quarter. Of these opportunities, 54% of the volumes sourced were portfolios and 46% or approximately $4 billion were one-off assets. Investment-grade opportunities represented 55% for the first quarter.

Our surprising cap rates continue to remain tight in the first quarter with investment-grade properties trading from low 5% to high 6% cap rate range, and noninvestment grade properties trading from high 5% to low 8% cap rate range. 
As John highlighted, our disposition activities remained active. During the quarter, we sold 9 properties for $22 million at a net cash cap rate of 7.7%, and realized an unlevered internal rate of return of over 12.5%. Our investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital were very healthy, averaging 248 basis points the first quarter, which was significantly above our historical average rates. We define investment spreads as initial cash yield less our nominal weighted average cost of capital. 
In conclusion, the first quarter investments remained solid at $210 million, while sourcing more than $9 billion in transactions. Our spreads remained comfortably above historical level as the tight cap rate environment in the first quarter was more than offset by our improving cost of capital. We remain selective in pursuing opportunities that are in line with our long-term strategic objectives and within our acquisition revenues. We continue to stick advantage of an aggressive pricing environment to accelerate position of assets that are no longer a strategic fit. As John mentioned, we believe that our acquisitions for 2015 will be at the high end of our presuppositions guidance range of $700 million to $1 billion. 
With that, I would like hand it back to John."

As usual, I will comment and provide some brief highlights regarding our financial results for the quarter starting with the income statement. Total revenue increased 11.4% for the quarter. This increase reflects our growth primarily from new acquisitions over the past year as well as same-store rent growth. Our annualized rental revenue at March 31 was approximately $936 million. On the expense side, interest expense increased in the quarter to $58.5 million. This increase was primarily due to our 2 recent bond offerings: The $350 million 10-year notes we issued last June and the $250 million 12-year notes issued in September. We also recognized a noncash $1.1 million loss on interest rate swaps during the quarter. 
On a related note, our coverage ratios both remained strong with interest coverage at 3.9x and fixed charge coverage at 3.4x. General and administrative, or G&A expenses, were approximately $12.9 million for the quarter, essentially unchanged from the prior year. Included in G&A expense is approximately $94,000 in acquisition costs. Our G&A as a percentage of total rental and other revenues is only 5.4%. And our projection for G&A expenses in 2015 remains the same at approximately $55 million. Property expenses, which were not reimbursed by tenants, totaled $4 million for the quarter. Our current projection for property expenses that we will be responsible for in 2015 remains approximately $20 million. Provisions for impairment of approximately $2.1 million during the quarter, includes impairments we recorded on one sold property, one property classified as held for sale and one property where the building was replaced. Gain on sales were approximately $7.2 million in the quarter. And just a reminder, as always, we do not include property sales gains in our FFO or in our AFFO. Funds from operations, or FFO per share, was $0.68 for the quarter, a 4.6% increase versus a year ago, and adjusted funds from operations, or AFFO, or the actual cash we have available for distribution as dividend, was $0.67 per share for the quarter, a 4.7% versus a year ago. Dividends paid increased 2.6% in Q1, and we again increased our cash monthly dividend this quarter. Our monthly dividend now equates to a current annualized amount of approximately $2.274 per share. 
Briefly turning to the balance sheet. We've continued to maintain our current conservative and safe capital structure. As you know, in early April, we raised approximately $276 million of new equity capital in conjunction [ph] to the S&P 500 Index. The index inclusion was an excellent opportunity to raise capital at very low cost by offering shares to the index fund needing to buy stock on that specific day. Our bonds, which are all unsecured and fixed-rate and continue to be rated Baa1, BBB+, have a weighted average maturity of 7 years. Our $1.5 billion acquisition credit facility had a $370 million balance at March 31. After the equity offering and our acquisition activity in April, the facility balance today is approximately $400 million. We did not assume any mortgages during the quarter. We did pay off some at maturity. So our outstanding net mortgage debt at quarter end decreased to approximately $785 million. Not including our credit facility, the only variable rate debt exposure to rising interest rates that we have is on just $15.5 million of mortgage debt. And our overall debt maturity schedule remains in very good shape with only $68 million of mortgages and $150 million of bonds coming due in 2015, and our maturity schedule is well laddered thereafter. Currently, our debt-to-total market capitalization is approximately 29% and our preferred stock outstanding is only 2.5% of our capital structure. And our debt-to-EBITDA at quarter end was approximately 5.7x. 
Now let me turn the call back over to John, who will give you more background on the quarter."

Occupancy based on the number of properties was 98%, a 40 basis points decline from last quarter. At the end of the quarter, we had 86 properties available for lease out of nearly 4,400 properties in our portfolio. Economic occupancy was 99.1%, a 10 basis points decline from last quarter and a 10 basis points improvement year-over-year. Occupancy based on square footage was 98.7%. We had a number of properties come off lease during the first quarter, which impacted primarily our physical occupancy. Our leasing team will continue to address these properties as part of our standard portfolio management process. We continue to expect our occupancy to remain around 98% through 2015. Of the 43 properties we re-leased during the quarter, 30 were leased to existing tenants and 13 were leased to new tenants, recapturing 99.2% of expiring rents. Additionally, 5 vacant properties were sold during the quarter. 
Our same-store rent increased 1.4% during the quarter. The industries contributing most to our quarterly same-store rent growth were convenience stores, health and fitness and quick service restaurants. We expect same-store rent growth to remain about 1.4% for the foreseeable future. 
Our portfolio continues to be diversified by tenant, industry, geography, and to a certain extent, property type. At the end of the first quarter, our properties were leased to 236 commercial tenants and 47 different industries located in 49 states and Puerto Rico. 78% of our rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties. The largest component outside of retail is industrial and distribution properties at 11%. Our diversification contributes to the predictability of our cash flow. We continue to focus on retail properties leased to tenants with a service, nondiscretionary and/or low price point component to the business. Today, more than 90% of our retail revenue comes from businesses with these characteristics, which better positions them to successfully operate in a variety of economic environments and compete with e-commerce. At the end of the first quarter, our top 20 tenants represented 54% of rental revenue. The tenants in our top 20 continue to capture nearly every tenant, representing more than 1% of our rental revenue. With Circle K's acquisition of The Pantry, 2 of our top 20 tenants consolidated into one, allowing the U.S. government to enter our top 20 at 1.2% of rent. Now 10 of our top 20 tenants have investment grade credit ratings. The rental revenue from these 10 investment-grade-rated tenants represent 60% of the rent from our top 20 tenants. Within our portfolio, no single tenant accounts for more than 5.5% of rental revenue. So diversification by tenant remains favorable.
Walgreens continues to be our largest tenant at 5.5% of rental revenue. FedEx remains our second largest tenant at 5.2% of rental revenue. Drugstores and convenience stores are our 2 largest industries, each at 9.6% of rental revenue. Drugstores are up 10 basis points from last quarter, while convenience stores are down 20 basis points from last quarter. Our third largest industry is Dollar Stores at 9.3%, down 20 basis points from last quarter. As many of you know, Dollar Tree is expected to close its acquisition of Family Dollar later in the second quarter. The FTC has substantially completed its review of the acquisition and identified 340 of the combined 14,000 stores for divestiture. We continue to expect no financial impact on our rental revenue, given the minimal portfolio overlap that our Family Dollar locations have with Dollar Tree and the long lease durations of our locations. 
We continue to have excellent credit quality in the portfolio, with 48% of our rental revenue generated from investment-grade-rated tenants. This revenue percentage is up from 46% at the end of the 2014, primarily as a result of Couche-Tard's acquisition of The Pantry, converting The Pantry, our former 15th largest tenant, from non-investment grade to investment grade status. However, this percentage should move down a bit to the mid-40s later in the second quarter as a result of Dollar Tree's pending acquisition of the Family Dollar. In addition to tenant credit, the store-level performance of our retail tenants remains positive. Our weighted average rent coverage ratio on our retail properties is 2.6x on a four wall basis. And importantly, the median is also 2.6x. 
Moving on to acquisitions, we continue to see a high volume of acquisition opportunities. During the quarter, we sourced about $9.5 billion in acquisition opportunities and completed $210 million at a cash cap rate of 6.9%. So we remain selective in our investment strategy. There continues to be a lot of capital pursuing these transactions, and we continue to see cap rates tick down a bit for the higher quality properties we are pursuing. However, our investment spreads relative to our cost of capital continue to be quite attractive. Subsequent to the first quarter end, we closed an additional $302 million in acquisitions, bringing us to a total of $512 million in acquisitions for the first 4 months of the year. We expect acquisitions volume for 2015 to be at the high end of our previous acquisition's guidance range of $700 million to $1 billion, given what we're seeing today. We continue to selectively sell assets and redeploy debt capital into properties that better fit our investment strategy. During the quarter, we sold 9 properties for $22.1 million. We continue to anticipate dispositions to be around $50 million for 2015. 
I'll hand it over to Sumit to discuss our acquisitions and dispositions in more detail now. Sumit?"

During the first quarter of 2015, we invested $210 million in 83 properties, approximately $2.5 million per property, located in 24 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.9% and with a weighted average lease term of 15.5 years. A",541,"Thank you, John. During the first quarter of 2015, we invested $210 million in 83 properties, approximately $2.5 million per property, located in 24 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.9% and with a weighted average lease term of 15.5 years. As a reminder, our initial cap rates are cash and not GAAP, which tend to be higher due to straight-lining of rent. We define cash cap rates as contractual cash net operating income for the first 12 months of each lease following the acquisition date, divided by the total cost of the property, including all expenses borne by Realty Income. On a revenue basis, 60% of total acquisitions are from investment grade tenants. And the rest of the revenues are from retail tenants that are non-investment-grade or not rated. 74% of the revenues are generated from retail and 26% are from industrial and distribution assets. 
These assets are leased to 15 different tenants in 12 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented are diversified industrial, quick service restaurants and automotive services. Of the 9 independent transactions closed in the first quarter, only one transaction was above $50 million. Transaction flow continues to remain healthy. We sourced more than $9 billion in the first quarter. Of these opportunities, 54% of the volume sourced were portfolios and 46%, or approximately $4 billion, were one-off assets.
Investment-grade opportunities represented 55% for the first quarter. Of the $210 million in acquisitions closed in the first quarter, approximately 41% were one-off transactions. 94% of the transactions closed were relationship-driven. We remain selective and disciplined in our investment approach, closing on less than 3% of deals sourced and continue to capitalize on our extensive industry relationships developed over our 46-year operating history. Our surprising cap rates continue to remain tight in the first quarter, with investment-grade properties trading from low 5% to high 6% cap rate range, and non-investment grade properties trading from high 5% to low 8% cap rate range. 
As John highlighted, our disposition activities remained active. During the quarter, we sold 9 properties for $22 million at a net cash cap rate of 7.7% and realized an unlevered internal rate of return of over 12.5%. Our investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital were very healthy, averaging 248 basis points in the first quarter, which was significantly above our historical average spreads. We defined investment spreads as initial cash yield less our nominal first-year weighted average cost of capital. 
In conclusion, the first quarter investments remained solid at $210 million, while sourcing more than $9 billion in transactions. Our spreads remained comfortably above historical level as the tight cap rate environment in the first quarter was more than offset by our improving cost of capital. We remain selective in pursuing opportunities that are in line with our long-term strategic objectives and within our acquisition parameters. We continue to take advantage of an aggressive pricing environment to accelerate disposition of assets that are no longer a strategic fit. As John mentioned, we believe that our acquisitions for 2015 will be at the high end of our previous acquisition's guidance range of $700 million to $1 billion. 
With that, I would like to hand it back to John."

Our payout ratio in the first quarter was 83.7%, which is a level we continue to be comfortable with. 
Finally, to wrap it up, we're pleased with the results for the quarter and with the investment opportunities we continue to see in the acquisitions market. We remain well positioned to execute on acquisitions, with approximately $1.1 billion available on the credit facility today. Our cost of capital advantage continues to support our ability to drive healthy earnings accretion for our shareholders.

And then the retailers are a bit larger in this particular quarter was a whole back of some funds that we had set aside in an acquisition that was returned to us in the first quarter, that the tenant did not need for some tenant improvements they had planned to do on a property that we were acquiring towards the end of last year. So that popped it up a little bit more than usual."

As usual, I will comment and provide some brief highlights regarding our financial results for the quarter starting with the income statement. Total revenue increased 11.4% for the quarter. This increase reflects our growth primarily from new acquisitions over the past year as well as same-store rent growth. Our annualized rental revenue at March 31 was approximately $936 million. On the expense side, interest expense increased in the quarter to $58.5 million. This increase was primarily due to our 2 recent bond offerings: The $350 million 10-year notes we issued last June and the $250 million 12-year notes issued in September. We also recognized a noncash $1.1 million loss on interest rate swaps during the quarter. 
On a related note, our coverage ratios both remained strong with interest coverage at 3.9x and fixed charge coverage at 3.4x. General and administrative, or G&A expenses, were approximately $12.9 million for the quarter, essentially unchanged from the prior year. Included in G&A expense is approximately $94,000 in acquisition costs. Our G&A as a percentage of total rental and other revenues is only 5.4%. And our projection for G&A expenses in 2015 remains the same at approximately $55 million. Property expenses, which were not reimbursed by tenants, totaled $4 million for the quarter. Our current projection for property expenses that we will be responsible for in 2015 remains approximately $20 million. Provisions for impairment of approximately $2.1 million during the quarter, includes impairments we recorded on one sold property, one property classified as held for sale and one property where the building was replaced. Gain on sales were approximately $7.2 million in the quarter. And just a reminder, as always, we do not include property sales gains in our FFO or in our AFFO. Funds from operations, or FFO per share, was $0.68 for the quarter, a 4.6% increase versus a year ago, and adjusted funds from operations, or AFFO, or the actual cash we have available for distribution as dividend, was $0.67 per share for the quarter, a 4.7% increase versus a year ago. Dividends paid increased 2.6% in Q1, and we again increased our cash monthly dividend this quarter. Our monthly dividend now equates to a current annualized amount of approximately $2.274 per share. 
Briefly turning to the balance sheet. We've continued to maintain a conservative and safe capital structure. As you know, in early April, we raised approximately $276 million of new equity capital in [Audio gap] to the S&P 500 Index. The index inclusion was an excellent opportunity to raise capital at very low cost by offering shares to the index fund needing to buy stock on that specific day. Our bonds, which are all unsecured and fixed-rate and continue to be rated Baa1, BBB+, have a weighted average maturity of 7 years. Our $1.5 billion acquisition credit facility had a $370 million balance at March 31. After the equity offering and our acquisition activity in April, the facility balance today is approximately $400 million. We did not assume any mortgages during the quarter. We did pay off some at maturity. So our outstanding net mortgage debt at quarter end decreased to approximately $785 million. Not including our credit facility, the only variable rate debt exposure to rising interest rates that we have is on just $15.5 million of mortgage debt. And our overall debt maturity schedule remains in very good shape with only $68 million of mortgages and $150 million of bonds coming due in 2015, and our maturity schedule is well laddered thereafter. Currently, our debt-to-total market capitalization is approximately 29% and our preferred stock outstanding is only 2.5% of our capital structure. And our debt-to-EBITDA at quarter end was approximately 5.7x.

At the end of the quarter, we had 86 properties available for le",931,"Thanks, Paul. I'll begin with an overview of the portfolio, which continues to perform well. Occupancy based on the number of properties was 98%, a 40 basis points decline from last quarter. At the end of the quarter, we had 86 properties available for lease out of nearly 4,400 properties in our portfolio. Economic occupancy was 99.1%, a 10 basis points decline from last quarter and a 10 basis points improvement year-over-year. Occupancy based on square footage was 98.7%. We had a number of properties come off lease during the first quarter, which impacted primarily our physical occupancy. Our leasing team will continue to address these properties as part of our standard portfolio management process. We continue to expect our occupancy to remain around 98% through 2015. Of the 43 properties we re-leased during the quarter, 30 were leased to existing tenants and 13 were leased to new tenants, recapturing 99.2% of expiring rents. Additionally, 5 vacant properties were sold during the quarter. 
Our same-store rent increased 1.4% during the quarter. The industries contributing most to our quarterly same-store rent growth were convenience stores, health and fitness and quick service restaurants. We expect same-store rent growth to remain about 1.4% for the foreseeable future. 
Our portfolio continues to be diversified by tenant, industry, geography, and to a certain extent, property type. At the end of the first quarter, our properties were leased to 236 commercial tenants and 47 different industries located in 49 states and Puerto Rico. 78% of our rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties. The largest component outside of retail is industrial and distribution properties at 11%. Our diversification contributes to the predictability of our cash flow. We continue to focus on retail properties leased to tenants with a service, nondiscretionary and/or low price point component to their business. Today, more than 90% of our retail revenue comes from businesses with these characteristics, which better positions them to successfully operate in a variety of economic environments and to compete with e-commerce. At the end of the first quarter, our top 20 tenants represented 54% of rental revenue. The tenants in our top 20 continue to capture nearly every tenant representing more than 1% of our rental revenue. With Circle K's acquisition of The Pantry, 2 of our top 20 tenants consolidated into one, allowing the U.S. government to enter our top 20 at 1.2% of rent. Now 10 of our top 20 tenants have investment grade credit ratings. The rental revenue from these 10 investment grade-rated tenants represents 60% of the rent from our top 20 tenants. Within our portfolio, no single tenant accounts for more than 5.5% of rental revenue. So diversification by tenant remains favorable.
Walgreens continues to be our largest tenant at 5.5% of rental revenue. FedEx remains our second largest tenant at 5.2% of rental revenue. Drugstores and convenience stores are our 2 largest industries, each at 9.6% of rental revenue. Drugstores are up 10 basis points from last quarter, while convenience stores are down 20 basis points from last quarter. Our third largest industry is Dollar Stores at 9.3%, down 20 basis points from last quarter. As many of you know, Dollar Tree is expected to close its acquisition of Family Dollar later in the second quarter. The FTC has substantially completed its review of the acquisition and identified 340 of the combined 14,000 stores for divestiture. We continue to expect no financial impact on our rental revenue, given the minimal portfolio overlap that our Family Dollar locations have with Dollar Tree and the long lease durations of our locations. 
We continue to have excellent credit quality in the portfolio, with 48% of our rental revenue generated from investment grade-rated tenants. This revenue percentage is up from 46% at the end of the 2014, primarily as a result of Couche-Tard's acquisition of The Pantry, converting The Pantry, our former 15th largest tenant, from non-investment grade to investment grade status. However, this percentage should move down a bit to the mid-40s later in the second quarter as a result of Dollar Tree's pending acquisition of the Family Dollar. In addition to tenant credit, the store-level performance of our retail tenants remains positive. Our weighted average rent coverage ratio on our retail properties is 2.6x on a four wall basis. And importantly, the median is also 2.6x. 
Moving on to acquisitions, we continue to see a high volume of acquisition opportunities. During the quarter, we sourced about $9.5 billion in acquisition opportunities and completed $210 million at a cash cap rate of 6.9%. So we remain selective in our investment strategy. There continues to be a lot of capital pursuing these transactions, and we continue to see cap rates tick down a bit for the higher quality properties we are pursuing. However, our investment spreads relative to our cost of capital continue to be quite attractive. Subsequent to the first quarter end, we closed an additional $302 million in acquisitions, bringing us to a total of $512 million in acquisitions for the first 4 months of the year. We expect acquisitions volume for 2015 to be at the high end of our previous acquisitions guidance range of $700 million to $1 billion, given what we're seeing today. We continue to selectively sell assets and redeploy that capital into properties that better fit our investment strategy. During the quarter, we sold 9 properties for $22.1 million. We continue to anticipate dispositions to be around $50 million for 2015. 
I'll hand it over to Sumit to discuss our acquisitions and dispositions in more detail now. Sumit?"

During the first quarter of 2015, we invested $210 million in 83 properties, approximately $2.5 million per property, located in 24 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.9% and with a weighted average lease term of 15.5 years. A",542,"Thank you, John. During the first quarter of 2015, we invested $210 million in 83 properties, approximately $2.5 million per property, located in 24 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.9% and with a weighted average lease term of 15.5 years. As a reminder, our initial cap rates are cash and not GAAP, which tend to be higher due to straight-lining of rent. We define cash cap rates as contractual cash net operating income for the first 12 months of each lease following the acquisition date, divided by the total cost of the property, including all expenses borne by Realty Income. On a revenue basis, 60% of total acquisitions are from investment grade tenants. And the rest of the revenues are from retail tenants that are non-investment grade or not rated. 74% of the revenues are generated from retail and 26% are from industrial and distribution assets. 
These assets are leased to 15 different tenants in 12 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented are diversified industrial, quick service restaurants and automotive services. Of the 9 independent transactions closed in the first quarter, only one transaction was above $50 million. Transaction flow continues to remain healthy. We sourced more than $9 billion in the first quarter. Of these opportunities, 54% of the volume sourced were portfolios and 46%, or approximately $4 billion, were one-off assets.
Investment-grade opportunities represented 55% for the first quarter. Of the $210 million in acquisitions closed in the first quarter, approximately 41% were one-off transactions. 94% of the transactions closed were relationship-driven. We remain selective and disciplined in our investment approach, closing on less than 3% of deals sourced and continue to capitalize on our extensive industry relationships developed over our 46-year operating history. Our surprising cap rates continue to remain tight in the first quarter, with investment-grade properties trading from low 5% to high 6% cap rate range, and non-investment grade properties trading from high 5% to low 8% cap rate range. 
As John highlighted, our disposition activities remained active. During the quarter, we sold 9 properties for $22 million at a net cash cap rate of 7.7% and realized an unlevered internal rate of return of over 12.5%. Our investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital were very healthy, averaging 248 basis points in the first quarter, which was significantly above our historical average spreads. We defined investment spreads as initial cash yield less our nominal first-year weighted average cost of capital. 
In conclusion, the first quarter investments remained solid at $210 million, while sourcing more than $9 billion in transactions. Our spreads remained comfortably above historical level as the tight cap rate environment in the first quarter was more than offset by our improving cost of capital. We remain selective in pursuing opportunities that are in line with our long-term strategic objectives and within our acquisition parameters. We continue to take advantage of an aggressive pricing environment to accelerate disposition of assets that are no longer a strategic fit. As John mentioned, we believe that our acquisitions for 2015 will be at the high end of our previous acquisitions guidance range of $700 million to $1 billion. 
With that, I would like to hand it back to John."

Our activities continue to result in healthy per share earnings growth, which supports the payment of reliable monthly dividends that increase over time.

Our payout ratio in the first quarter was 83.7%, which is a level we continue to be comfortable with. 
Finally, to wrap it up, we're pleased with the results for the quarter and with the investment opportunities we continue to see in the acquisitions market. We remain well positioned to execute on acquisitions, with approximately $1.1 billion available on the credit facility today. Our cost of capital advantage continues to support our ability to drive healthy earnings accretion for our shareholders.

In January, we were added to the S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats Index as a result of increasing our dividend every year for 20 consecutive years. In addition, we raised $379 million in equity capital at an attractive cost to fund our acquisitions activity. 
Now we'll hand it over to Paul to provide an overview of our financial results. Paul?"

As usual, I will comment and provide some brief highlights regarding our financial results for the quarter starting with the income statement. Total revenue increased 11.4% for the quarter. This increase reflects our growth primarily from new acquisitions over the past year as well as same-store rent growth. Our annualized rental revenue at March 31 was approximately $936 million. On the expense side, interest expense increased in the quarter to $58.5 million. This increase was primarily due to our 2 recent bond offerings: The $350 million 10-year notes we issued last June and the $250 million 12-year notes issued in September. We also recognized a noncash $1.1 million loss on interest rate swaps during the quarter. 
On a related note, our coverage ratios both remained strong with interest coverage at 3.9x and fixed charge coverage at 3.4x. General and administrative, or G&A expenses, were approximately $12.9 million for the quarter, essentially unchanged from the prior year. Included in G&A expense is approximately $94,000 in acquisition costs. Our G&A as a percentage of total rental and other revenues is only 5.4%. And our projection for G&A expenses in 2015 remains the same at approximately $55 million. Property expenses, which were not reimbursed by tenants, totaled $4 million for the quarter. Our current projection for property expenses that we will be responsible for in 2015 remains approximately $20 million. Provisions for impairment of approximately $2.1 million during the quarter, includes impairments we recorded on one sold property, one property classified as held for sale and one property where the building was replaced. Gain on sales were approximately $7.2 million in the quarter. And just a reminder, as always, we do not include property sales gains in our FFO or in our AFFO. Funds from operations, or FFO per share, was $0.68 for the quarter, a 4.6% increase versus a year ago, and adjusted funds from operations, or AFFO, or the actual cash we have available for distribution as dividend, was $0.67 per share for the quarter, a 4.7% increase versus a year ago. Dividends paid increased 2.6% in Q1, and we again increased our cash monthly dividend this quarter. Our monthly dividend now equates to a current annualized amount of approximately $2.274 per share. 
Briefly turning to the balance sheet. We've continued to maintain a conservative and safe capital structure. As you know, in early April, we raised approximately $276 million of new equity capital in [Audio gap] to the S&P 500 Index. The index inclusion was an excellent opportunity to raise capital at very low cost by offering shares to the index fund needing to buy stock on that specific day. Our bonds, which are all unsecured and fixed-rate and continue to be rated Baa1, BBB+, have a weighted average maturity of 7 years. Our $1.5 billion acquisition credit facility had a $370 million balance at March 31. After the equity offering and our acquisition activity in April, the facility balance today is approximately $400 million. We did not assume any mortgages during the quarter. We did pay off some at maturity. So our outstanding net mortgage debt at quarter end decreased to approximately $785 million. Not including our credit facility, the only variable rate debt exposure to rising interest rates that we have is on just $15.5 million of mortgage debt. And our overall debt maturity schedule remains in very good shape with only $68 million of mortgages and $150 million of bonds coming due in 2015, and our maturity schedule is well laddered thereafter. Currently, our debt-to-total market capitalization is approximately 29% and our preferred stock outstanding is only 2.5% of our capital structure. And our debt-to-EBITDA at quarter end was approximately 5.7x. 
Now let me turn the call back over to John, who will give you more background on the quarter."

At the end of the quarter, we had 86 properties available for le",931,"Thanks, Paul. I'll begin with an overview of the portfolio, which continues to perform well. Occupancy based on the number of properties was 98%, a 40 basis points decline from last quarter. At the end of the quarter, we had 86 properties available for lease out of nearly 4,400 properties in our portfolio. Economic occupancy was 99.1%, a 10 basis points decline from last quarter and a 10 basis points improvement year-over-year. Occupancy based on square footage was 98.7%. We had a number of properties come off lease during the first quarter, which impacted primarily our physical occupancy. Our leasing team will continue to address these properties as part of our standard portfolio management process. We continue to expect our occupancy to remain around 98% through 2015. Of the 43 properties we re-leased during the quarter, 30 were leased to existing tenants and 13 were leased to new tenants, recapturing 99.2% of expiring rents. Additionally, 5 vacant properties were sold during the quarter. 
Our same-store rent increased 1.4% during the quarter. The industries contributing most to our quarterly same-store rent growth were convenience stores, health and fitness and quick service restaurants. We expect same-store rent growth to remain about 1.4% for the foreseeable future. 
Our portfolio continues to be diversified by tenant, industry, geography, and to a certain extent, property type. At the end of the first quarter, our properties were leased to 236 commercial tenants and 47 different industries located in 49 states and Puerto Rico. 78% of our rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties. The largest component outside of retail is industrial and distribution properties at 11%. Our diversification contributes to the predictability of our cash flow. We continue to focus on retail properties leased to tenants with a service, nondiscretionary and/or low price point component to their business. Today, more than 90% of our retail revenue comes from businesses with these characteristics, which better positions them to successfully operate in a variety of economic environments and to compete with e-commerce. At the end of the first quarter, our top 20 tenants represented 54% of rental revenue. The tenants in our top 20 continue to capture nearly every tenant representing more than 1% of our rental revenue. With Circle K's acquisition of The Pantry, 2 of our top 20 tenants consolidated into one, allowing the U.S. government to enter our top 20 at 1.2% of rent. Now 10 of our top 20 tenants have investment grade credit ratings. The rental revenue from these 10 investment grade-rated tenants represents 60% of the rent from our top 20 tenants. Within our portfolio, no single tenant accounts for more than 5.5% of rental revenue. So diversification by tenant remains favorable.
Walgreens continues to be our largest tenant at 5.5% of rental revenue. FedEx remains our second largest tenant at 5.2% of rental revenue. Drugstores and convenience stores are our 2 largest industries, each at 9.6% of rental revenue. Drugstores are up 10 basis points from last quarter, while convenience stores are down 20 basis points from last quarter. Our third largest industry is Dollar Stores at 9.3%, down 20 basis points from last quarter. As many of you know, Dollar Tree is expected to close its acquisition of Family Dollar later in the second quarter. The FTC has substantially completed its review of the acquisition and identified 340 of the combined 14,000 stores for divestiture. We continue to expect no financial impact on our rental revenue, given the minimal portfolio overlap that our Family Dollar locations have with Dollar Tree and the long lease durations of our locations. 
We continue to have excellent credit quality in the portfolio, with 48% of our rental revenue generated from investment grade-rated tenants. This revenue percentage is up from 46% at the end of the 2014, primarily as a result of Couche-Tard's acquisition of The Pantry, converting The Pantry, our former 15th largest tenant, from non-investment grade to investment grade status. However, this percentage should move down a bit to the mid-40s later in the second quarter as a result of Dollar Tree's pending acquisition of the Family Dollar. In addition to tenant credit, the store-level performance of our retail tenants remains positive. Our weighted average rent coverage ratio on our retail properties is 2.6x on a four wall basis. And importantly, the median is also 2.6x. 
Moving on to acquisitions, we continue to see a high volume of acquisition opportunities. During the quarter, we sourced about $9.5 billion in acquisition opportunities and completed $210 million at a cash cap rate of 6.9%. So we remain selective in our investment strategy. There continues to be a lot of capital pursuing these transactions, and we continue to see cap rates tick down a bit for the higher quality properties we are pursuing. However, our investment spreads relative to our cost of capital continue to be quite attractive. Subsequent to the first quarter end, we closed an additional $302 million in acquisitions, bringing us to a total of $512 million in acquisitions for the first 4 months of the year. We expect acquisitions volume for 2015 to be at the high end of our previous acquisitions guidance range of $700 million to $1 billion, given what we're seeing today. We continue to selectively sell assets and redeploy that capital into properties that better fit our investment strategy. During the quarter, we sold 9 properties for $22.1 million. We continue to anticipate dispositions to be around $50 million for 2015. 
I'll hand it over to Sumit to discuss our acquisitions and dispositions in more detail now. Sumit?"

During the first quarter of 2015, we invested $210 million in 83 properties, approximately $2.5 million per property, located in 24 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.9% and with a weighted average lease term of 15.5 years. A",542,"Thank you, John. During the first quarter of 2015, we invested $210 million in 83 properties, approximately $2.5 million per property, located in 24 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.9% and with a weighted average lease term of 15.5 years. As a reminder, our initial cap rates are cash and not GAAP, which tend to be higher due to straight-lining of rent. We define cash cap rates as contractual cash net operating income for the first 12 months of each lease following the acquisition date, divided by the total cost of the property, including all expenses borne by Realty Income. On a revenue basis, 60% of total acquisitions are from investment grade tenants. And the rest of the revenues are from retail tenants that are non-investment grade or not rated. 74% of the revenues are generated from retail and 26% are from industrial and distribution assets. 
These assets are leased to 15 different tenants in 12 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented are diversified industrial, quick service restaurants and automotive services. Of the 9 independent transactions closed in the first quarter, only one transaction was above $50 million. Transaction flow continues to remain healthy. We sourced more than $9 billion in the first quarter. Of these opportunities, 54% of the volume sourced were portfolios and 46%, or approximately $4 billion, were one-off assets.
Investment-grade opportunities represented 55% for the first quarter. Of the $210 million in acquisitions closed in the first quarter, approximately 41% were one-off transactions. 94% of the transactions closed were relationship-driven. We remain selective and disciplined in our investment approach, closing on less than 3% of deals sourced and continue to capitalize on our extensive industry relationships developed over our 46-year operating history. Our surprising cap rates continue to remain tight in the first quarter, with investment-grade properties trading from low 5% to high 6% cap rate range, and non-investment grade properties trading from high 5% to low 8% cap rate range. 
As John highlighted, our disposition activities remained active. During the quarter, we sold 9 properties for $22 million at a net cash cap rate of 7.7% and realized an unlevered internal rate of return of over 12.5%. Our investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital were very healthy, averaging 248 basis points in the first quarter, which was significantly above our historical average spreads. We defined investment spreads as initial cash yield less our nominal first-year weighted average cost of capital. 
In conclusion, the first quarter investments remained solid at $210 million, while sourcing more than $9 billion in transactions. Our spreads remained comfortably above historical level as the tight cap rate environment in the first quarter was more than offset by our improving cost of capital. We remain selective in pursuing opportunities that are in line with our long-term strategic objectives and within our acquisition parameters. We continue to take advantage of an aggressive pricing environment to accelerate disposition of assets that are no longer a strategic fit. As John mentioned, we believe that our acquisitions for 2015 will be at the high end of our previous acquisitions guidance range of $700 million to $1 billion. 
With that, I would like to hand it back to John."

Finally, to wrap it up, we're pleased with the results for the quarter and with the investment opportunities we continue to see in the acquisitions market.

As usual, I will provide some brief highlights of our financial results for the quarter, starting with the income statement. Total revenue increased 11.1% for the quarter. This increase reflects our growth primarily from new acquisitions over the past year, as well as same-store rent growth. Our annualized rental revenue at June 30 was approximately $983 million. In the expense side, interest expense increased in the quarter to $58.7 million. This increase was primarily due to our 2 bond offerings last year, the $350 million 10 year notes issued in June and the $250 million 12 year notes issued in September. We also recognized a noncash loss of approximately $900,000 on interest rate swaps during the quarter. On a related note, our coverage ratios both remained strong, with interest coverage at 4.0x and fixed charge coverage at 3.6x. 
General and administrative, or G&A expenses, were approximately $12.6 million for the quarter. Included in G&A expense is approximately $192,000 in acquisition costs. And note that we do include these acquisition costs in our calculations of both FFO and AFFO. Year-to-date, our G&A as a percentage of total rental and other revenue is only 5.3%. Our projection for G&A expenses in 2015 is now approximately $52 million, down from our prior estimate of $55 million as we realized lower-than-expected expense growth given the efficiencies of our business. Property expenses, which were not reimbursed by tenants, totaled $3.3 million [ph] for the quarter and our current projection for property expenses that we will be responsible for in 2015 remains unchanged at approximately $20 million. Provisions for impairment of approximately $3.2 million during the quarter includes impairments we recorded on 3 properties classified as held for sale and 2 properties classified as held for investment. 
Gain on sales were approximately $3.7 million in the quarter. And just a reminder, we do not include property sales gains in our FFO or AFFO. Funds from operations, or FFO per share, was $0.69 for the quarter, a 7.8% increase versus a year ago. Adjusted funds from operations, or AFFO, or the actual cash we have available for distribution as dividend, was $0.68 per share for the quarter, a 6.3% increase versus a year ago. Dividends paid increased 4% in the second quarter, and we again increased our cash monthly dividend this quarter. Our monthly dividend now equates to a current annualized amount of $2.28 per share. 
Now let me briefly turn to the balance sheet. We have continued to maintain our conservative capital structure. As you know, in early April, we raised approximately $276 million of new equity capital in conjunction with our addition to the S&P 500 Index. The index inclusion was an excellent opportunity to raise capital at a very low cost by offering shares to the index fund needed to buy our stock that day. We raised an additional $106 million of equity capital during the quarter to our direct stock purchase and. Our bonds, which are all unsecured and fixed-rate and continue to be rated Baa1, BBB+, have a weighted average maturity of 6.7 years. At the end of the second quarter quarter, we recast and expanded our unsecured acquisition credit facility from $1.5 billion to $2.25 billion, comprised of a $2 billion revolving credit facility and a $250 million term loan which is due in 2020 when we have no scheduled unsecured debt maturities. At our current BBB+ Baa1 rating, the borrowing rate on the revolver is LIBOR plus 20 basis points with a facility commitment fee of 15 basis points, which overall represents a 20 basis point reduction to the all-in drawn borrowing rate of the previous facility. We very much appreciate the capital commitment from the 21 banks who participated in the syndication of this larger facility for us. Our new $2 billion credit facility have a $430 million balance at June 30. We do not assume any mortgages during the quarter. We didn't pay off some of the maturity to our outstanding net mortgage debt at quarter end decreased to approximately $757 million. Not including our credit facility, the only variable rate debt exposure we have is on just $15.5 million of mortgage debt. And our overall debt maturity schedule remains in very good shape, with only $40 million of mortgages and $150 million of bonds coming due in 2015. And our maturity schedule is well-laddered thereafter. Currently, our debt to total market capitalization is approximately 32% and our preferred stock outstanding is only 2.5% of our capital structure. And our debt-to-EBITDA at quarter end was approximately 5.9x. 
Now let me turn the call back over to John, who will give you more background on the quarter."

Occupancy based on the number of properties was 98.2%, a 20 basis point improvement from last quarter. At the end of the quarter, we had 81 properties available for lease out of 4,452 properties in our portfolio. Economic occupancy was 99.2% and occupancy based on square footage was 98.8%, both up 10 basis points from last quarter. We continue to see good leasing activity and expect our occupancy to remain around current levels for the end of the year. We have leases expire on 80 properties during the quarter and released 81 properties. 73 of those properties were released to existing tenants and 8 were released to new tenants, recapturing 106% of expiring rents. This compares favorably to our historical recapture rate of approximately 98% of expiring rents. Additionally, 4 vacant properties were sold during the quarter. Our same-store rent increased 1.5% during the quarter and 1.4% year-to-date. The industries contributing most to our quarterly same-store rent growth were health and fitness and motor vehicle dealerships. We expect same-store rent growth to remain about 1.4% for the foreseeable future. 90% of our leases have contractual rent increases, so we remain pleased with the growth we are able to achieve from our properties leased to both our investment-grade and on investment grade tenants. Approximately 75% of our investment-grade leases have rental rate growth that averages about 1.3%. 
Our portfolio continues to be diversified by tenant, industry, geography, and, to a certain extent, property type. At the end of the second quarter, our properties were leased to 235 commercial tenants and 47 different industries located in 49 states in Puerto Rico. Our diversification contributes to the stability of our cash flow. 79% of our rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties. The largest component outside of retail is industrial properties at 13%. This quarter, we reclassified 14 assets previously classified as manufacturing properties, representing approximately 2% of rent to our investor category, which better reflects these properties'  uses and better qualify our portfolio composition. We continue to focus on retail properties leased to tenants with a service, nondiscretionary and/or low price point component to the business. Today, more than 90% of our retail revenue comes from businesses with these characteristics, which better positions them to successfully operate in a variety of economic environments and to compete with e-commerce. 
At the end of the second quarter, our top 20 tenants continue to capture nearly every tenant representing more than 1% of our rental revenues. Our largest tenant as Walgreens, which now accounts for 7.1% of rental revenue, the increase from 5.5% at the end of last quarter. We continue to like Walgreens business as high-quality real estate locations and the rent growth we receive. We also are confident in the strength of these properties given the visibility we have into their unit level performance. FedEx remains our second largest tenant at 4.9% of rental revenues. This quarter, we added [indiscernible] to our top 20 tenants. Lifetime Fitness Is now our 13th largest tenant, representing 2% of [indiscernible]. During the second quarter, we executed a sale leaseback transaction with Lifetime Fitness. Lifetime Fitness is a tenant we have [indiscernible] and pursuing for about 10 years now. We followed them through challenging and favorable economic conditions and have been impressed with the performance of their business. We also believe they're well-located real estate and excellent surrounding demographics and the service orientation of their business make them a great addition to our portfolio. Drugstores remain our largest industry at 10.7% of rental revenue, an increase from 9.6% at the end of the first quarter. The drugstore industry continues to be an area we favor given the aging of our population and today's health care trends. Convenience store industry is our second largest at 9.4% of rental revenue. Dollar stores are at 9.1%, down 20 basis points from last quarter. As many of you may know, Dollar Tree completed its acquisition of Family Dollar this month, subsequent to our second quarter end. As part of the transaction, the FTC identified 330 of the combined 14,000 stores with divestiture. There was no financial impact on our rental revenues as results of these divestitures. Pro forma, Dollar Tree will represent 4.3% of rental revenue. Health and fitness is our fourth largest industry and 7.2% of rental revenue, a 40 basis points increase from last quarter. Health and fitness is a sector we have been invested since 1998 and it has performed very well for us. We continue to like health and fitness given the favorable demographic supporting this industry.  We continue to have excellent credit quality in the portfolio with 48% of our rental revenue generated from investment-grade rated tenants. The store level performance of our retail tenants remains sound. Our weighted average rent coverage ratio of the retail properties is 2.6x on a 4-wall basis, and importantly, the media is also 2.6x. 
Moving on to acquisitions, we had a very active second quarter, investing $721 million at an initial cash cap rate of 6.3% and initial average lease term of over 18 years. This is the second highest quarterly volume of property level acquisitions in the company's history. Our straight-line cap rate during the quarter was 7%, which reflects the attractive rent growth of the acquisition. For the first half of the year, we completed $931 million in acquisitions, at an initial cash cap rate of 6.4% and an initial average lease term of nearly 18 years. Cap rates remain aggressive but stable. However, our investment spreads continue to be favorable and remain above their historical norms. We continue to see a high volume of acquisition opportunities. During the quarter, we sourced about $10.5 billion in acquisition opportunities, which brings us to $20 billion in sourced opportunities for the year. Given our acquisitions activity to date and high volume of opportunities, we continue to see we are increasing our acquisitions guidance for 2015 to approximately $1.25 billion from our previous estimate of $1 billion. We continue to selectively sell nonstrategic assets and redeploy that capital into properties that better fit our investment strategy. During the first half of the year, we sold 14 properties for $30.5 million. We sold our least, nonstrategic assets at a cap rate of 7.8%. We continue to expect the minimum of $50 million in dispositions for 2015 and that figure could go up a bit. 
Now I'll hand it over to Sumit to discuss our acquisitions and dispositions in more detail."

During the second quarter of 2015, we invested $721 million in 100 [ph] properties located in 33 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.3% and with a weighted average lease term of 18.2 years. We define cash cap rates as contractual cash net operating income for the first 12 months following the acquisition date, divided by the total cost of the property, including all expenses borne by Realty Realty Income. On a revenue basis, 49% of total acquisitions are from investment-grade tenants and the rest of the revenues are from retail tenants that are noninvestment grade or not rated. 98% of the revenues are generated from retail and 2% are from industrial. These assets are leased to 21 different tenants in 13 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented are health and fitness, drugstores and home improvement. Of the 16 independent transactions closed in the second quarter, 2 transactions were about $50 million. Year-to-date second quarter 2015 we invested $931 million in 166 properties located in 35 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.4% and with a weighted average lease term of 17.5 years. On a revenue basis, 52% of total acquisitions are from investment-grade tenants and the rest of the revenues are from retail tenants that are noninvestment grade or not rated. 92% of these revenues are generated from retail and 8% are from industrial. These assets are leased to 27 different tenants in 16 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented are health and fitness, drugstores and quick service restaurants. Of the 25 independent transactions closed year-to-date, 3 transactions were about $50 million. Transaction flow continues to remain healthy. We sourced more than $10 billion in the second quarter. Year-to-date, we have sourced approximately $20 billion in potential transaction opportunities. Of these opportunities, 66% of the volumes sourced were portfolios and 34% are approximately $7 billion were one-off assets. Investment-grade opportunities represented 21% for the year-to-date. Of the $721 million in acquisitions closed in the second quarter, approximately 5% were one-off transactions. We remain selective and disciplined in our investment approach closing a less than 7% of deals sourced and continue to capitalize on our extensive industry relationships. As to pricing, cap rates continue to remain tight in the second quarter with investment-grade properties trading from around 5% to high 6% cap rate range and non-investment-grade properties trading from high 5% to low 8% cap rate range. 
As John highlighted, our disposition program remained active. During the quarter, we sold 5 properties for $8 million at a net cash cap rate of 8.1% and realized an unlevered IRR of 11.6%. This brings us to 14 properties sold year-to-date for $30.1 million at a net cash cap rate of 7.8% and realized an unlevered IRR of 12.3%. Our investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital were healthy averaging 140 basis points in the second quarter, which were around our historical average spreads. We define investment spread as initial cash yield less nominal first-year weighted average cost of capital. Year-to-date, based on a weighted average cost of long-term capital raised, our estimated investment spread were approximately 200 basis points, notably above our historical average. 
In conclusion, the second quarter investments remained solid at $721 million, while sourcing more than $10 billion in transactions. Our year-to-date spreads remained above historical levels. We continue to be very selective in pursuing opportunities that are in line with our long-term strategic objectives and within our acquisition parameters. We're also taking advantage of an aggressive pricing environment to dispose of assets that are no longer a strategic fit. As John mentioned, we are raising our acquisition guidance for 2015 to approximately $1.25 billion. 
With that, I'd like to hand it back to John."

Additionally, our new $2 billion revolving credit facility was recapped at a lower rate than our previous revolver and provides for additional financial flexibility as we continue to grow our company. Our sector leading cost of capital continues to allow us to drive earnings growth while investing in high-quality assets. We increased the dividends paid this quarter by 4% on a year-over-year basis. We have increased our dividend every year since the company's listing in 1994, growing the dividend at a compound average annual rate of almost 5%. Our payout ratio in the second quarter was 83.7%, which is a level we continue to be comfortable with. 
Finally, to wrap it up, we continue to maintain excellent momentum in our business. We continue to have very active dialogues regarding potential acquisition opportunities with existing and perspective tenants.

It was well-structured with strong cash flow coverage of 3.2x and a drop in sales to breakeven on our properties of 45%. If you look at the last recession, the Great Recession, lifetime same-store revenues fell by just under 3% in 2008 and about 7% in 2009 and then turned positive insects subsequent years. So we performed quite well during some very challenging times. The property that we own are located in [indiscernible] markets with high average household incomes of $74,000 within a 5-mile radius and densely populated areas with 217,000 people within a 5-mile radius of our properties.

As we look at the transaction, we really view it more as something -- I mean, we asked for 10 years of financial and operating history and our credit research team analyzed it quite thoroughly. And we were convinced that this will continue to be operated as health and fitness clubs. If there had to be a residual use, the most likely residual use would be office. If they could not be used as health clubs. But there are other companies that have operated large health clubs of this size, including Club Core, Equinox and [indiscernible]. So they could be potential tenants as well. So if we were to convert this to office, you're probably looking at something from $50 to $75 a foot to make these office properties.

As usual, I will provide some brief highlights of our financial results for the quarter, starting with the income statement. Total revenue increased 11.1% for the quarter. This increase reflects our growth primarily from new acquisitions over the past year, as well as healthy same-store rent growth. Our annualized rental revenue at June 30 was approximately $983 million. 
On the expense side, interest expense increased in the quarter to $58.7 million. This increase was primarily due to our 2 bond offerings last year: the $350 million 10-year notes issued in June; and the $250 million 12-year notes issued in September. We also recognized a noncash loss of approximately $900,000 on interest rate swaps during the quarter. On a related note, our coverage ratios both remained strong, with interest coverage at 4.0x and fixed charge coverage at 3.6x. 
General and administrative, or G&A, expenses were approximately $12.6 million for the quarter. Included in G&A expense is approximately $192,000 in acquisition costs. And note that we do include these acquisition costs in our calculations of both FFO and AFFO. Year-to-date, our G&A as a percentage of total rental and other revenue is only 5.3%. Our projection for G&A expenses in 2015 is now approximately $52 million, down from our prior estimate of $55 million as we realized lower-than-expected expense growth given the efficiencies of our business. 
Property expenses, which were not reimbursed by tenants, totaled $3.3 million for the quarter. And our current projection for property expenses that we will be responsible for in 2015 remains unchanged at approximately $20 million. Provisions for impairment of approximately $3.2 million during the quarter includes impairments we recorded on 3 properties classified as held for sale and 2 properties classified as held for investment. 
Gain on sales were approximately $3.7 million in the quarter. And just a reminder, we do not include property sales gains in our FFO or AFFO. Funds from operations, or FFO per share, was $0.69 for the quarter, a 7.8% increase versus a year ago. Adjusted funds from operations, or AFFO, or the actual cash we have available for distribution as dividend, was $0.68 per share for the quarter, a 6.3% increase versus a year ago. Dividends paid increased 4% in the second quarter, and we again increased our cash monthly dividend this quarter. Our monthly dividend now equates to a current annualized amount of $2.28 per share. 
Now let me briefly turn to the balance sheet. We have continued to maintain our conservative capital structure. As you know, in early April, we raised approximately $276 million of new equity capital in conjunction with our addition to the S&P 500 Index. The index inclusion was an excellent opportunity to raise capital at a very low cost by offering shares to the index fund meaning to buy our stock that day. 
We raised an additional $106 million of equity capital during the quarter through our direct stock purchase plan. Our bonds, which are all unsecured and fixed rate, and continue to be rated Baa1, BBB+, have a weighted average maturity of 6.7 years. At the end of the quarter, we recast and expanded our unsecured acquisition credit facility from $1.5 billion to $2.25 billion, comprised of a $2 billion revolving credit facility and a $250 million term loan which is due in 2020 when we have no scheduled unsecured debt maturities. 
At our current BBB+, Baa1 rating, the borrowing rate on the revolver is LIBOR plus 90 basis points with a facility commitment fee of 15 basis points, which overall represents a 20 basis point reduction to the all-in drawn borrowing rate of the previous facility. We very much appreciate the capital commitments from the 21 banks who participated in the syndication of this larger facility for us. 
Our new $2 billion credit facility have a $430 million balance at June 30. We do not assume any mortgages during the quarter. We did pay off some at maturity, so our outstanding net mortgage debt at quarter end decreased to approximately $757 million. Not including our credit facility, the only variable rate debt exposure we have is on just $15.5 million of mortgage debt. And our overall debt maturity schedule remains in very good shape, with only $40 million of mortgages and $150 million of bonds coming due in 2015. And our maturity schedule is well-laddered thereafter. Currently, our debt to total market capitalization is approximately 32% and our preferred stock outstanding is only 2.5% of our capital structure. And our debt-to-EBITDA at quarter end was approximately 5.9x. 
Now let me turn the call back over to John, who will give you more background on the quarter."

Occupancy based on the number of properties was 98.2%, a 20 basis points improvement from last quarter. At the end of the quarter, we had 81 properties available for lease out of 4,452 properties in our portfolio. 
Economic occupancy was 99.2% and occupancy based on square footage was 98.8%, both up 10 basis points from last quarter. We continue to see good leasing activity and expect our occupancy to remain around current levels for the end of the year. We have leases expire on 80 properties during the quarter and we re-leased 81 properties. 73 of those properties were re-leased to existing tenants and 8 were re-leased to new tenants, recapturing 106% of expiring rents. This compares favorably to our historical recapture rate of approximately 98% of expiring rents. 
Additionally, 4 vacant properties were sold during the quarter. Our same-store rent increased 1.5% during the quarter and 1.4% year-to-date. The industries contributing most to our quarterly same-store rent growth were health and fitness and motor vehicle dealerships. We expect same-store rent growth to remain about 1.4% for the foreseeable future. 90% of our leases have contractual rent increases, so we remain pleased with the growth we were able to achieve from our properties leased to both our investment-grade and on investment grade tenants. Approximately 75% of our investment-grade leases have rental rate growth that averages about 1.3%. 
Our portfolio continues to be diversified by tenant, industry, geography and, to a certain extent, property type. At the end of the second quarter, our properties were leased to 235 commercial tenants and 47 different industries located in 49 states in Puerto Rico. Our diversification contributes to the stability of our cash flow. 79% of our rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties. The largest component outside of retail is industrial properties at 13%. This quarter, we reclassified 14 assets previously classified as manufacturing properties, representing approximately 2% of rent to our investor category, which better reflects these properties'  uses and better clarifies our portfolio composition. 
We continue to focus on retail properties leased to tenants with a service, nondiscretionary and/or low price point component to the business. Today, more than 90% of our retail revenue comes from businesses with these characteristics, which better positions them to successfully operate in a variety of economic environments and to compete with e-commerce. 
At the end of the second quarter, our top 20 tenants continue to capture nearly every tenant representing more than 1% of our rental revenues. Our largest tenant is Walgreens, which now accounts for 7.1% of rental revenue, it increased from 5.5% at the end of last quarter. We continue to like Walgreens business at high-quality real estate locations and the rent growth we receive. We also are confident in the strength of these properties given the visibility we have into their unit level performance. 
FedEx remains our second largest tenant at 4.9% of rental revenues. This quarter, we added a new name to our top 20 tenants. Life Time Fitness is now our 13th largest tenant, representing 2% of rent. During the second quarter, we executed a sale leaseback transaction with Life Time Fitness. Life Time Fitness is a tenant we have been meeting with and pursuing for about 10 years now. We followed them through challenging and favorable economic conditions and have been impressed with the performance of their business.  We also believe their well-located real estate and excellent surrounding demographics and the service orientation of their business make them a great addition to our portfolio. 
Drugstores remain our largest industry at 10.7% of rental revenue, an increase from 9.6% at the end of the first quarter. The drugstore industry continues to be an area we favor, given the aging of our population and today's health care trends. The convenience store industry is our second largest at 9.4% of rental revenue. Dollar stores are at 9.1%, down 20 basis points from last quarter. As many of you may know, Dollar Tree completed its acquisition of Family Dollar this month, subsequent to our second quarter end. As part of the transaction, the FTC identified 330 of the combined 14,000 stores for the divestiture. There was no financial impact on our rental revenues as a result of these divestitures. Pro forma, Dollar Tree will represent 4.3% of rental revenue. 
Health and fitness is our fourth largest industry at 7.2% of rental revenue, a 40 basis points increase from last quarter. Health and fitness is a sector we have been invested in since 1998 and it has performed very well for us. We continue to like health and fitness given the favorable demographic supporting this industry.  We continue to have excellent credit quality in the portfolio with 48% of our rental revenue generated from investment-grade rated tenants. The store level performance of our retail tenants remains sound. Our weighted average rent coverage ratio of the retail properties is 2.6x on a 4-wall basis, and importantly, the median is also 2.6x. 
Moving on to acquisitions. We had a very active second quarter, investing $721 million at an initial cash cap rate of 6.3% and initial average lease term of over 18 years. This is the second highest quarterly volume of property level acquisitions in the company's history. Our straight-line cap rate during the quarter was 7%, which reflects the attractive rent growth of the acquisition. For the first half of the year, we completed $931 million in acquisitions, at an initial cash cap rate of 6.4% and an initial average lease term of nearly 18 years. Cap rates remain aggressive but stable. 
However, our investment spreads continue to be favorable and remain above their historical norms. We continue to see a high volume of acquisition opportunities. During the quarter, we sourced about $10.5 billion in acquisition opportunities, which brings us to $20 billion in sourced opportunities for the year. Given our acquisitions activity to date and the high volume of opportunities we continue to see, we are increasing our acquisitions guidance for 2015 to approximately $1.25 billion from our previous estimate of $1 billion. 
We continue to selectively sell nonstrategic assets and redeploy that capital into properties that better fit our investment strategy. During the first half of the year, we sold 14 properties for $30.5 million. We sold our least, nonstrategic assets at a cap rate of 7.8%. We continue to expect a minimum of $50 million in dispositions for 2015 and that figure could go up a bit. 
Now I'll hand it over to Sumit to discuss our acquisitions and dispositions in more detail."

During the second quarter of 2015, we invested $721 million in 100 properties located in 33 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.3% and with a weighted average lease term of 18.2 years. We define cash cap rates as contractual cash net operating income for the first 12 months following the acquisition date, divided by the total cost of the property, including all expenses borne by Realty Income. 
On a revenue basis, 49% of total acquisitions are from investment-grade tenants and the rest of the revenues are from retail tenants that are non-investment grade or not rated. 98% of the revenues are generated from retail and 2% are from industrial. These assets are leased to 21 different tenants in 13 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented are health and fitness, drugstores and home improvement. 
Of the 16 independent transactions closed in the second quarter, 2 transactions were about $50 million. Year-to-date second quarter, 2015 we invested $931 million in 166 properties located in 35 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.4% and with a weighted average lease term of 17.5 years. On a revenue basis, 52% of total acquisitions are from investment-grade tenants and the rest of the revenues are from retail tenants that are non-investment grade or not rated. 92% of these revenues are generated from retail and 8% are from industrial. These assets are leased to 27 different tenants in 16 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented are health and fitness, drugstores and quick service restaurants. Of the 25 independent transactions closed year-to-date, 3 transactions were about $50 million. 
Transaction flow continues to remain healthy. We sourced more than $10 billion in the second quarter. Year-to-date, we have sourced approximately $20 billion in potential transaction opportunities. Of these opportunities, 66% of the volumes sourced were portfolios and 34% or approximately $7 billion were one-off assets. Investment-grade opportunities represented 21% for the year-to-date. Of the $721 million in acquisitions closed in the second quarter, approximately 5% were one-off transactions. 
We remain selective and disciplined in our investment approach closing on less than 7% of deals sourced and continue to capitalize on our extensive industry relationships. As to pricing, cap rates continue to remain tight in the second quarter with investment-grade properties trading from around 5% to high 6% cap rate range and non-investment-grade properties trading from high 5% to low 8% cap rate range. 
As John highlighted, our disposition program remain active. During the quarter, we sold 5 properties for $8 million at a net cash cap rate of 8.1% and realized an unlevered IRR of 11.6%. This brings us to 14 properties sold year-to-date for $30.1 million at a net cash cap rate of 7.8% and realized an unlevered IRR of 12.3%. Our investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital were healthy averaging 140 basis points in the second quarter, which were around our historical average spreads. 
We define investment spread as initial cash yield less our nominal first-year weighted average cost of capital. Year-to-date, based on the weighted average cost of long-term capital raised, our estimated investment spread were approximately 200 basis points, notably above our historical average. 
In conclusion, the second quarter investments remained solid at $721 million, while sourcing more than $10 billion in transactions. Our year-to-date spreads remained above historical levels. We continue to be very selective in pursuing opportunities that are in line with our long-term strategic objectives and within our acquisition parameters. We're also taking advantage of an aggressive pricing environment to dispose assets that are no longer a strategic fit. As John mentioned, we are raising our acquisition guidance for 2015 to approximately $1.25 billion. 
With that, I'd like to hand it back to John."

Additionally, our new $2 billion revolving credit facility was recapped at a lower rate than our previous revolver and provides for additional financial flexibility as we continue to grow our company. Our sector-leading cost of capital continues to allow us to drive earnings growth while investing in high-quality assets. 
We increased the dividends paid this quarter by 4% on a year-over-year basis. We have increased our dividend every year since the company's listing in 1994, growing the dividend at a compound average annual rate of almost 5%. Our payout ratio in the second quarter was 83.7%, which is a level we continue to be comfortable with. 
Finally, to wrap it up, we continue to maintain excellent momentum in our business. We continue to have very active dialogues regarding potential acquisition opportunities with existing and prospective tenants.

There continues to be a secular shift to healthy lifestyles and we're seeing that in the health and fitness facilities. We see that with both baby boomers and millennials and health club usage continues to rise. We saw attractive risk-adjusted returns in this investment. It was well-structured with a strong cash flow coverage of 3.2x and a drop in sales to breakeven on our properties of 45%. If you look at the last recession, the Great Recession, lifetime same-store revenues fell by just under 3% in 2008 and about 7% in 2009 and then turned positive in subsequent years. So they performed quite well during some very challenging times. The property that we own are located in full-rent dense markets with high average household incomes of $74,000 within a 5-mile radius and densely populated areas with 217,000 people within a 5-mile radius of our properties. We were able to execute this transaction at about a 20% discount to replacement cost and have a portfolio of properties that are well above the average sales and EBITDAR levels of the overall [indiscernible], so we were quite pleased with it. The going-in cap rate was 6.5%. The straight-line cap rate, which would reflect the growth and the cash growth and the lease over the lease term was about 8%. So we were pleased with the growth. As we look at the transaction, we really view it more as something -- I mean, we asked for 10 years of financial and operating history and our credit research team analyzed it quite thoroughly. And we were convinced that this will continue to be operated as health and fitness clubs. If there had to be a residual use, the most likely residual use would be office, if they could not be used as health clubs. But there are other companies that have operated large health clubs of this size, including ClubCorp, Equinox and Bay Club. So they could be potential tenants as well. So if you were to convert this to office, you're probably looking at something from $50 to $75 a foot to make these office properties, but that's not really how we look at it."

And this increase reflects our growth primarily from new acquisitions",779,"Thanks, John. As usual, I will provide some brief highlights of our financial results for the quarter, starting with the income statement. Total revenue increased 11.1% for the quarter. And this increase reflects our growth primarily from new acquisitions over the past year, as well as healthy same-store rent growth. Our annualized rental revenue at June 30 was approximately $983 million. 
On the expense side, interest expense increased in the quarter to $58.7 million. This increase was primarily due to our 2 bond offerings last year: the $350 million 10-year notes issued in June; and the $250 million 12-year notes issued in September. We also recognized a noncash loss of approximately $900,000 on interest rate swaps during the quarter. On a related note, our coverage ratios both remain strong, with interest coverage at 4.0x and fixed charge coverage at 3.6x. 
General and administrative, or G&A, expenses were approximately $12.6 million for the quarter. Included in G&A expense is approximately $192,000 in acquisition costs. And note that we do include these acquisition costs in our calculations of both FFO and AFFO. Year-to-date, our G&A as a percentage of total rental and other revenues is only 5.3%. Our projection for G&A expenses in 2015 is now approximately $52 million, down from our prior estimate of $55 million as we realized lower-than-expected expense growth given the efficiencies of our business. 
Property expenses, which were not reimbursed by tenants, totaled $3.3 million for the quarter. And our current projection for property expenses that we will be responsible for in 2015 remains unchanged at approximately $20 million. Provisions for impairment of approximately $3.2 million during the quarter includes impairments we recorded on 3 properties classified as held for sale and 2 properties classified as held for investment. 
Gain on sales were approximately $3.7 million in the quarter. And just a reminder, we do not include property sales gains in our FFO or AFFO. Funds from operations, or FFO per share, was $0.69 for the quarter, a 7.8% increase versus a year ago. Adjusted funds from operations, or AFFO, or the actual cash we have available for distribution as dividends, was $0.68 per share for the quarter, a 6.3% increase versus a year ago. Dividends paid increased 4% in the second quarter, and we again increased our cash monthly dividend this quarter. Our monthly dividend now equates to a current annualized amount of $2.28 per share. 
Now let me briefly turn to the balance sheet. We have continued to maintain our conservative capital structure. As you know, in early April, we raised approximately $276 million of new equity capital in conjunction with our addition to the S&P 500 Index. The index inclusion was an excellent opportunity to raise capital at a very low cost by offering shares to the index funds meaning to buy our stock that day. 
We raised an additional $106 million of equity capital during the quarter through our direct stock purchase plan. Our bonds, which are all unsecured and fixed rate, and continue to be rated Baa1, BBB+, have a weighted average maturity of 6.7 years. At the end of the quarter, we recast and expanded our unsecured acquisition credit facility from $1.5 billion to $2.25 billion, comprised of a $2 billion revolving credit facility and a $250 million term loan which is due in 2020 when we have no scheduled unsecured debt maturities. 
At our current BBB+, Baa1 credit rating, the borrowing rate on the revolver is LIBOR plus 90 basis points with a facility commitment fee of 15 basis points, which overall represents a 20 basis point reduction to the all-in drawn borrowing rate of the previous facility. We very much appreciate the capital commitments from the 21 banks who participated in the syndication of this larger facility for us. 
Our new $2 billion credit facility had a $430 million balance at June 30. We did not assume any mortgages during the quarter. We did pay off some at maturity, so our outstanding net mortgage debt at quarter end decreased to approximately $757 million. Not including our credit facility, the only variable rate debt exposure we have is on just $15.5 million of mortgage debt. And our overall debt maturity schedule remains in very good shape, with only $40 million of mortgages and $150 million of bonds coming due in 2015. And our maturity schedule is well laddered thereafter. Currently, our debt to total market capitalization is approximately 32% and our preferred stock outstanding is only 2.5% of our capital structure. And our debt-to-EBITDA at quarter end was approximately 5.9x. 
Now let me turn the call back over to John, who will give you more background on the quarter."

Occupancy based on the number of properties was 98.2%, a 20 basis points improvement from last quarter. At the end of the quarter, we had 81 properties available for lease out of 4,452 properties in our portfolio. 
Economic occupancy was 99.2% and occupancy based on square footage was 98.8%, both up 10 basis points from last quarter. We continue to see good leasing activity and expect our occupancy to remain around current levels for the end of the year. We had leases expire on 80 properties during the quarter and we re-leased 81 properties. 73 of those properties were re-leased to existing tenants and 8 were re-leased to new tenants, recapturing 106% of expiring rents. This compares favorably to our historical recapture rate of approximately 98% of expiring rents. 
Additionally, 4 vacant properties were sold during the quarter. Our same-store rent increased 1.5% during the quarter and 1.4% year-to-date. The industries contributing the most to our quarterly same-store rent growth were health and fitness and motor vehicle dealerships. We expect same-store rent growth to remain about 1.4% for the foreseeable future. 90% of our leases have contractual rent increases, so we remain pleased with the growth we were able to achieve from our properties leased to both our investment grade and non-investment grade tenants. Approximately 75% of our investment grade leases had rental rate growth that averages about 1.3%. 
Our portfolio continues to be diversified by tenant, industry, geography and, to a certain extent, property type. At the end of the second quarter, our properties were leased to 235 commercial tenants in 47 different industries located in 49 states and Puerto Rico. Our diversification contributes to the stability of our cash flows. 79% of our rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties. The largest component outside of retail is industrial properties, at 13%. This quarter, we reclassified 14 assets previously classified as manufacturing properties, representing approximately 2% of rent to our investor category, which better reflects these properties' uses and better clarifies our portfolio composition. 
We continue to focus on retail properties leased to tenants with a service, nondiscretionary and/or low price point component to their business. Today, more than 90% of our retail revenue comes from businesses with these characteristics, which better positions them to successfully operate in a variety of economic environments and to compete with e-commerce. 
At the end of the second quarter, our top 20 tenants continued to capture nearly every tenant representing more than 1% of our rental revenues. Our largest tenant is Walgreens, which now accounts for 7.1% of rental revenue, the increase from 5.5% at the end of last quarter. We continue to like Walgreens' business at high-quality real estate locations and the rent growth we receive. We also are confident in the strength of these properties, given the visibility we have into their unit level performance. 
FedEx remains our second largest tenant at 4.9% of rental revenues. This quarter, we added a new name to our top 20 tenants. Life Time Fitness is now our 13th largest tenant, representing 2% of rent. During the second quarter, we executed a sale-leaseback transaction with Life Time Fitness. Life Time Fitness is a tenant we have been meeting with and pursuing for about 10 years now. We followed them through challenging and favorable economic conditions and have been impressed with the performance of their business. We also believe their well-located real estate and excellent surrounding demographics and the service orientation of their business make them a great addition to our portfolio. 
Drugstores remain our largest industry at 10.7% of rental revenue, an increase from 9.6% at the end of the first quarter. The drugstore industry continues to be an area we favor, given the aging of our population and today's health care trends. The convenience store industry is our second largest at 9.4% of rental revenues. Dollar stores are at 9.1%, down 20 basis points from last quarter. As many of you may know, Dollar Tree completed its acquisition of Family Dollar this month, subsequent to our second quarter end. As part of the transaction, the FTC identified 330 of the combined 14,000 stores for divestiture. There was no financial impact on our rental revenue as a result of these divestitures. Pro forma, Dollar Tree will represent 4.3% of rental revenues. 
Health and fitness is our fourth largest industry at 7.2% of rental revenues, a 40 basis points increase from last quarter. Health and fitness is a sector we have been invested in since 1998 and it has performed very well for us. We continue to like health and fitness given the favorable demographics supporting this industry.  We continue to have excellent credit quality in the portfolio with 48% of our rental revenue generated from investment grade rated tenants. The store level performance of our retail tenants remains sound. Our weighted average rent coverage ratio of the retail properties is 2.6x on a 4-wall basis, and importantly, the median is also 2.6x. 
Moving on to acquisitions. We had a very active second quarter, investing $721 million at an initial cash cap rate of 6.3% and initial average lease term of over 18 years. This is the second highest quarterly volume of property level acquisitions in the company's history. Our straight-line cap rate during the quarter was 7%, which reflects the attractive rent growth of the acquisitions. For the first half of the year, we completed $931 million in acquisitions, at an initial cash cap rate of 6.4% and an initial average lease term of nearly 18 years. Cap rates remain aggressive but stable. 
However, our investment spreads continue to be favorable and remain above their historical norms. We continue to see a high volume of acquisition opportunities. During the quarter, we sourced about $10.5 billion in acquisition opportunities, which brings us to $20 billion in sourced opportunities for the year. Given our acquisitions activity to date and the high volume of opportunities we continue to see, we are increasing our acquisitions guidance for 2015 to approximately $1.25 billion from our previous estimate of $1 billion. 
We continue to selectively sell nonstrategic assets and redeploy that capital into properties that better fit our investment strategies. During the first half of the year, we sold 14 properties for $30.5 million. We sold our least, nonstrategic assets at a cap rate of 7.8%. We continue to expect a minimum of $50 million in dispositions for 2015 and that figure could go up a bit. 
Now I'll hand it over to Sumit to discuss our acquisitions and dispositions in more detail."

Of the 16 independent transactions closed in the second quarter, 2 transactions were above $50 million. Year-to-date second quarter 2015, we invested $931 million in 166 properties located in 35 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.4% and with a weighted average lease term of 17.5 years. On a revenue basis, 52% of total acquisitions are from investment grade tenants and the rest of the revenues are from retail tenants that are non-investment grade or not rated. 92% of these revenues are generated from retail and 8% are from industrial. These assets are leased to 27 different tenants in 16 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented are health and fitness, drugstores and quick service restaurants. Of the 25 independent transactions closed year-to-date, 3 transactions were above $50 million. 
Transaction flow continues to remain healthy. We sourced more than $10 billion in the second quarter. Year-to-date, we have sourced approximately $20 billion in potential transaction opportunities. Of these opportunities, 66% of the volume sourced were portfolios and 34%, or approximately $7 billion, were one-off assets. investment grade opportunities represented 21% for the year-to-date. Of the $721 million in acquisitions closed in the second quarter, approximately 5% were one-off transactions. 
We remain selective and disciplined in our investment approach, closing on less than 7% of deals sourced and continue to capitalize on our extensive industry relationships. As to pricing, cap rates continued to remain tight in the second quarter with investment grade properties trading from around 5% to a high 6% cap rate range and non-investment grade properties trading from high 5% to low 8% cap rate range. 
As John highlighted, our disposition programs remained active. During the quarter, we sold 5 properties for $8 million at a net cash cap rate of 8.1% and realized an unlevered IRR of 11.6%. This brings us to 14 properties sold year-to-date for $30.1 million at a net cash cap rate of 7.8% and realized an unlevered IRR of 12.3%. Our investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital were healthy, averaging 140 basis points in the second quarter, which were around our historical average spreads. 
We define investment spread as initial cash yields less a nominal first-year weighted average cost of capital. Year-to-date, based on the weighted average cost of long-term capital raised, our estimated investment spreads were approximately 200 basis points, notably above our historical average. 
In conclusion, the second quarter investments remained solid at $721 million, while sourcing more than $10 billion in transactions. Our year-to-date spreads remained above historical levels. We continue to be very selective in pursuing opportunities that are in line with our long-term strategic objectives and within our acquisition parameters. We are also taking advantage of an aggressive pricing environment to dispose assets that are no longer a strategic fit. As John mentioned, we are raising our acquisition guidance for 2015 to approximately $1.25 billion. 
With that, I'd like to hand it back to John."

We are pleased to have taken advantage of the capital market conditions during the first half of the year to satisfy the majority of our capital needs for our acquisitions year-to-date, raising $484 million in equity capital at an average per share price of approximately $50 and issuing a $250 million unsecured term loan at 2.7%. Additionally, our new $2 billion revolving credit facility was recast at a lower rate than our previous revolver and provides for additional financial flexibility as we continue to grow our company. Our sector-leading cost of capital continues to allow us to drive earnings growth while investing in high-quality assets. 
We increased the dividends paid this quarter by 4% on a year-over-year basis. We have increased our dividend every year since the company's listing in 1994, growing the dividend at a compound average annual rate of almost 5%. Our payout ratio in the second quarter was 83.7%, which is a level we continue to be comfortable with. 
Finally, to wrap it up, we continue to maintain excellent momentum in our business. We continue to have very active dialogues regarding potential acquisition opportunities with existing and prospective tenants. We remain well positioned to execute on acquisitions, with approximately $1.6 billion available on our new $2 billion revolving line of credit. 
At this time, I'd like to open it up for questions. Operator?"

There continues to be a secular shift to healthy lifestyles and we're seeing that in the health and fitness facilities. We see that with both baby boomers and the millennials, and health club usage continues to rise. We saw attractive risk-adjusted returns in this investment. It was well structured, with a strong cash flow coverage at 3.2x and a drop in sales to breakeven on our properties of 45%. If you look at the last recession, the Great Recession, Life Time same-store revenues fell by just under 3% in 2008 and about 7% in 2009 and then turned positive in subsequent years. So they performed quite well during some very challenging times. The properties that we own are located in affluent, dense markets with high average household incomes of $74,000 within a 5-mile radius, and densely populated areas with 217,000 people within a 5-mile radius of our properties. We were able to execute this transaction at about a 20% discount to replacement cost and have a portfolio of properties that are well above the average sales and EBITDAR levels of the overall club [ph], so we were quite pleased with it. The going-in cap rate was 6.5%. The straight-line cap rate, which would reflect the growth and the cash -- the cash growth in the lease over the lease term was about 8%. So we were pleased with the growth. As we look at the transaction, we really viewed it more as something -- I mean, we asked for 10 years of financial and operating history and our credit research team analyzed that quite thoroughly. And we were convinced that these would continue to be operated as health and fitness clubs. If there had to be a residual use, the most likely residual use would be office, if they could not be used as health clubs. But there are other companies that have operated large health clubs of this size, including ClubCorp, Equinox and Bay Club. So they could be potential tenants as well. So if you were to convert this to office, you're probably looking at something from $50 to $75 a foot to make these office properties, but that's not really how we looked at it."

Along with FedEx, we are also doing investments in AMCs. That continues to be a good investment. And we do have some build-to-suit on the retail side that I do not wish to disclose the name at this point. But those continue to be a higher-yielding form of our investment opportunity set."

As usual, I will provide a few highlights on our financial statements for the quarter and begin with the income statement. Total revenue increased 9.8% for the quarter. This increase reflects our growth primarily from new acquisitions over the past year, as well as same-store rent growth. Our annualized rental revenue at September 30 was approximately $992 million. Interest expense increased in the quarter to $64 million. This increase was due to the $250 million 12 year notes we issued in September of last year and a $250 million term loan issued at the end of last quarter, as well as lower amortization of mortgage premiums as our outstanding mortgage balance continues to decline. We also did recognize a noncash loss of approximately $5.2 million on interest rate swaps during the quarter. As a reminder, we entered into an interest rate swap on the term loan issued in June which led to the larger noncash loss this quarter. On a related note, our coverage ratios both remain strong, with interest coverage at 4.2x and fixed charge coverage at 3.8x. Both of these metrics are pro forma for the paydown of the credit facility balance with proceeds from our common stock offering earlier this month. General and administrative, or G&A, expenses were approximately $10.9 million for the quarter. Included in G&A expense this quarter is approximately $70,000 in acquisition costs, and a reminder that we include these acquisition costs in our calculation of both FFO and AFFO. 
Year-to-date, our G&A as a percentage of total rental and other revenues is only 5%. We estimate that 5% will remain our approximate win [ph] rate for G&A for the remainder of the year as efficiencies in our business model continue to drive improving EBITDA margin. Property expenses, which are not reimbursed by tenants, totaled $3.4 million for the quarter. Year-to-date, our property expenses as a percentage of total rental and other revenues is only  1.5%. We estimate this  1.5% will remain our approximately run rate for property expenses for the remainder of the year as these expenses continued to come in lower this year, with lower portfolio vacancy, faster releasing of vacant properties, lower property churn premiums and fewer onetime maintenance expenses. Provisions of impairment of approximately $3.9 million for the quarter included impairments on 1 property held-for-sale, 1 held for investment and 2 sold properties. Gain on sales were approximately $6.2 million in the quarter, and just a reminder, we do not include property sales gains in our FFO or AFFO. Adjusted funds from operations, or AFFO were the actual cash we have available for distribution of dividend were $0.70 per share for the quarter, a 9.4% increase versus a year ago. We again increased our cash flow dividend this quarter and now increased to a current annualized amount of $2.286 per share. 
Briefly turning to the balance sheet, we continue to maintain our conservative capital structure. In September, we established an ATM, or at-the-market equity distribution program, to offer and sell up to 12 million shares, giving us the ability to issue equity capital on an opportunistic basis. Through quarter end, we have not yet issued any equity through this program. During the quarter, we did raise $152 million of equity capital through our direct stock purchase plan. And earlier this month, we raised $517 million in net proceeds in a common stock offering. We use the proceeds to pay down all outstanding borrowings on our $2 billion unsecured revolving credit facility. Our bonds, which are all unsecured and fixed rate, continue to be rated Baa1 BBB+ at a weighted average maturity of 6.5 years. We again did not assume any mortgages during the quarter. We did pay off some of maturities, so our outstanding net mortgage net at quarter end decreased to approximately $695 million. Not including our credit facility is only variable rate debt exposure we have is only just $15.5 million of mortgage debt. And our overall debt maturity schedule remains in very good shape, with only $2 million of mortgages and $150 million of bonds coming due for the balance of this year and our maturity schedule is well-laddered thereafter. Currently our debt to total market capitalization is approximately 28% and our preferred stock outstanding is only 2% of our capital structure. And our debt-to-EBITDA ratio after the equity offering is approximately 5.1x. 
Now let me turn the call back over to John, who will give you more background on these results."

Additionally, 5 vacant properties were sold during the quarter, so our vacant property count decreased by 7 properties relative to last quarter. 86 properties were re-leased to existing tenants and 11 were re-leased to new tenants. We recaptured 99% of expiring rents without any spending on tenant improvements as is typical for us.  We have a lot of experience in this area of our business. Over the last 20 years, we have re-leased or sold more than 2,000 properties with expired leases. 
Our same-store rent increased 1.1% during the quarter and 1.3% year-to-date. We expect annual same-store rent growth to be approximately 1.3% this year and next year. As many of you know, the timing of our rent increases are irregular and will vary from quarter-to-quarter. 90% of our leases have contractual rent increases, so we remain pleased with the growth we are able to achieve from our properties. Approximately 75% of our investment-grade leases have rental rate growth that averages about 1.3%. Our portfolio continues to be diversified by tenant, industry, geography and to a certain extent, property type. At the end of the third quarter, our properties were leased to 236 commercial tenants, operating in 47 different industries located in 49 states and Puerto Rico. Our diversification contributes to the stability of our cash flow. 79% of our rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties. The largest component outside of retail is industrial properties at 13% of rental revenue. There was really not much movement in the composition of our top tenants and industries during the third quarter. Walgreens remains our largest tenant at 7% of rental revenue; and drugstores remain our largest industry at 11% of rental revenue. 
We continue to have excellent credit quality in the portfolio, with 44% of our rental revenue generated from investment-grade tenants. This dropped from 48% last quarter due to the completion of Dollar Tree's acquisition of Family Dollar in July, which is now rated BB. This percentage will continue to fluctuate and will be positively impacted by 2 pending acquisitions of our noninvestment grade rated tenants by investment grade-rated tenants.  Store level performance of our retail tenants remains sound. Our weighted average rent coverage ratio for the retail properties continues to be 2.6x on a [indiscernible] basis and [indiscernible] is also 2.6x. 
Moving on to acquisitions, during the quarter, we completed $124 million in acquisitions and we continue to see a high volume of sourced acquisition opportunities. Year-to-date, we have sourced $24 billion in acquisition opportunities and we are on track for our second most active year ever for source volume. We remain disciplined in our investment strategy, acquiring less than 5% or $1.1 billion of the amount sourced year-to-date. A large portion of the acquisitions completed so far this year occur earlier than we had originally expected, which has had a positive impact on our 2015 earnings growth. We continue to expect approximately $1.25 billion in acquisitions volume for 2015. Our initial guidance for 2016 acquisitions is approximately $750 million, which consequently reflects our typical flow business and does not account for any large-scale transaction. 
I'll hand it over to Sumit to discuss our acquisitions and its positions. Sumit?"

During the third quarter of 2015, we invested $124 million in 47 properties located in 22 states, at an average initial cash cap rate of 7% and with the weighted average lease term of 10.9 years. On a revenue basis, 35% of total acquisitions are from investment-grade tenants. 52% of the revenues are generated from retail and 48% are from industrial. These assets are leased to 18 different tenants in 13 different industries. Some of the most significant industries represented our transportation services, motor vehicle dealerships and quick service restaurants. We closed 10 independent transactions in the third quarter and the average investment of property was approximately $2.6 million. Year-to-date 2015, we invested $1.1 billion in 195 properties located in 36 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.5% and with a weighted average lease term of 16.7 years. On a revenue basis, 50% of total acquisitions are from investment-grade tenants, 87% of the revenues are generated from retail and 13% are from industrial. These assets are leased to 35 different tenants in 18 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented are health and fitness, drugstores and quick service restaurants. Of the 35 independent transactions closed year-to-date, 3 transactions were above $50 million [ph]. 
The transaction flow continues to remain healthy. We sourced more than $4 billion in the third quarter. Year-to-date, we have sourced more than $24 billion in potential transaction opportunities. Of these opportunities, 62% of the volume sourced were portfolios and 38% or approximately $9 billion were one-off assets. Investment grade opportunities represented 26% [ph] for the third quarter. Of the $124 million in acquisitions closed in the third quarter, 77% were one-off transactions. We continue to capitalize on our extensive industry relationships developed over our 46-year operating history. As to pricing, cap rates remain flat in the third quarter, with investment-grade properties trading from around 5% to high 6% cap rate range and noninvestment grade properties trading from high 5% to low 8% cap rate range. 
Our disposition program remained active. During the quarter, we sold 8 properties for $21.5 million at a net cash cap rate of 7.2% and realized an unlevered IRR of 14.2%. This brings us to 22 properties sold year-to-date for approximately $52 million at a net cash cap rate of 7.6% and realized an unlevered IRR of 13%. Our investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital were healthy, averaging 212 basis points in the third quarter which were above our historical average spreads. We define investment spreads as initial cash yield less our nominal first-year weighted average cost of capital. 
In conclusion, we remain confident of reaching our acquisition and dispositions goals of approximately $1.25 billion and $65 million respectively for 2015. With that, I'd like to hand it back to John."

Our sector leading cost of capital continues to allow us to drive earnings growth while investing in high-quality assets. We increased the dividends paid this quarter by 4% on a year-over-year basis. We have increased our dividend every year since the company's listing in 1994, growing the dividend at a compound average annual rate of just under 5%. Our AFFO payout ratio in the third quarter was 81.4%, which is a level we are quite comfortable with. 
To wrap it up, our portfolio is performing well and we are pleased with where we stand as we head into the end of the year and into 2016. We continue to realize the efficiencies associated with our size and the economies of scale of our net lease business. We believe our EBITDA margin is the highest in the sector at 93%.

Now when you obviously translate it on a price per square feet, basis, et cetera, industrial we're looking at high-quality asset-light around $70 to $75 per square feet ZIP code. In retail, once again, depending on whether it's a Walgreens or whether it's a similar investment grade rated, let's call it, although in general they're going to have a different range, anywhere between 175 up 225, 250."

As usual, I will provide a few highlights on our financial statements for the quarter and begin with the income statement. Total revenue increased 9.8% for the quarter. This increase reflects our growth primarily from new acquisitions over the past year, as well as same-store rent growth. Our annualized rental revenue at September 30 was approximately $992 million. Interest expense increased in the quarter to $64 million. This increase was due to the $250 million 12-year notes we issued in September of last year and a $250 million term loan issued at the end of last quarter, as well as lower amortization of mortgage premiums, as our outstanding mortgage balance continues to decline. We also did recognize a noncash loss of approximately $5.2 million on interest rate swaps during the quarter. As a reminder, we entered into an interest rate swap on the new term loan issued in June, which led to the larger noncash loss this quarter. On a related note, our coverage ratios both remained strong, with interest coverage at 4.2x and fixed charge coverage at 3.8x. Both of these metrics are pro forma for the paydown of the credit facility balance, with proceeds from our common stock offering earlier this month. General and administrative or  A, expenses were approximately $10.9 million for the quarter. Included in G&A expense this quarter is approximately $70,000 in acquisition cost, and a reminder that we include these acquisition cost in our calculation of both FFO and AFFO. 
Year-to-date, our G&A as a percentage of total rental and other revenues is only 5%. We estimate that 5% will remain our approximate run rate for G&A for the remainder of the year, as efficiencies in our business model continue to drive improving EBITDA margin. Property expenses, which are not reimbursed by tenants, totaled $3.4 million for the quarter. Year-to-date, our property expenses as a percentage of total rental and other revenues is only 1.5%. We estimate this 1.5% will remain our approximate run rate for property expenses for the remainder of the year, as these expenses have continued to come in lower this year, with lower portfolio vacancy, faster releasing of vacant properties, lower property churn premiums and fewer onetime maintenance expenses. Provisions for impairment of approximately $3.9 million during the quarter included impairments on 1 property held-for-sale, 1 held for investment and 2 sold properties. Gain on sales were approximately $6.2 million in the quarter, and just a reminder, we do not include property sales gains in our FFO or AFFO. Adjusted funds from operations or AFFO or the actual cash we have available for distribution of dividend was $0.70 per share for the quarter, a 9.4% increase versus a year ago. We again increased our cash monthly dividend this quarter and it now equates to a current annualized amount of $2.286 per share. 
Briefly turning to the balance sheet. We've continued to maintain our conservative capital structure. In September, we established an ATM or at-the-market equity distribution program to offer and sell up to 12 million shares, giving us the ability to issue equity capital on an opportunistic basis. Through quarter end, we have not yet issued any equity through this program. During the quarter, we did raise $152 million of equity capital through our direct stock purchase plan. And earlier this month, we raised $517 million in net proceeds in a common stock offering. We used the proceeds to pay down all outstanding borrowings on our $2 billion unsecured revolving credit facility. Our bonds, which are all unsecured and fixed rate, and continue to be rated Baa1 BBB+ at a weighted average maturity of 6.5 years. We again did not assume any mortgages during the quarter. We did pay off some of the maturities, so our outstanding net mortgage debt at quarter end decreased to approximately $695 million. Not including our credit facility, the only variable rate debt exposure we have is only just $15.5 million of mortgage debt. And our overall debt maturity schedule remains in very good shape, with only $2 million of mortgages and $150 million of bonds coming due for the balance of this year, and our maturity schedule is well-laddered thereafter. Currently our debt to total market capitalization is approximately 28% and our preferred stock outstanding is only 2% of our capital structure, and our debt-to-EBITDA ratio after the equity offering is approximately 5.1x. 
Now let me turn the call back over to John, who will give you more background on these results."

Occupancy, based on the number of properties, was 98.3%, a 10 basis points improvement from last quarter. At the end of the quarter, we had 74 properties that are available for lease out of 4,473 properties in our portfolio. Economic occupancy was 99.3%, and occupancy based on square footage was 99%, increasing 10 basis points and 20 basis points respectively from last quarter. We continue to see an active leasing environment, and expect our occupancy to remain around current levels through the end of the year. We had leases expire on 95 properties during the quarter, and we re-leased 97 properties. Additionally, 5 vacant properties were sold during the quarter, so our vacant property count decreased by 7 properties relative to last quarter. 86 properties were re-leased to existing tenants and 11 were re-leased to new tenants. We recaptured 99% of expiring rents without any spending on tenant improvements as is typical for us.  We have a lot of experience in this area of our business. Over the last 20 years, we have re-leased or sold more than 2,000 properties with expired leases. 
Our same-store rent increased 1.1% during the quarter and 1.3% year-to-date. We expect annual same-store rent growth to be approximately 1.3% this year and next year. As many of you know, the timing of our rent increases are irregular and will vary from quarter-to-quarter. 90% of our leases have contractual rent increases, so we remain pleased with the growth we are able to achieve from our properties. Approximately 75% of our investment-grade leases have rental rate growth that averages about 1.3%. Our portfolio continues to be diversified by tenant, industry, geography, and to a certain extent, property type. At the end of the third quarter, our properties were leased to 236 commercial tenants, operating in 47 different industries located in 49 states and Puerto Rico. Our diversification contributes to the stability of our cash flow. 79% of our rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties. The largest component outside of retail is industrial properties at 13% of rental revenue. There was really not much movement in the composition of our top tenants and industries during the third quarter. Walgreens remains our largest tenant at 7% of rental revenue; and drugstores remain our largest industry at 11% of rental revenue. 
We continue to have excellent credit quality in the portfolio, with 44% of our rental revenue generated from investment-grade tenants. This dropped from 48% last quarter due to the completion of Dollar Tree's acquisition of Family Dollar in July, which is now rated BB. This percentage will continue to fluctuate and will be positively impacted by 2 pending acquisitions of our non-investment grade rated tenants by investment grade-rated tenants.  Store level performance of our retail tenants remains sound. Our weighted average rent coverage ratio for the retail properties continues to be 2.6x on a four-wall basis and the median is also 2.6x. 
Moving on to acquisitions. During the quarter, we completed $124 million in acquisitions, and we continue to see a high volume of sourced acquisition opportunities. Year-to-date, we have sourced $24 billion in acquisition opportunities, and we are on track for our second most active year ever for source volume. We remain disciplined in our investment strategy, acquiring less than 5% or $1.1 billion of the amount sourced year-to-date. A large portion of the acquisitions completed so far this year occurred earlier than we had originally expected, which has had a positive impact on our 2015 earnings growth. We continue to expect approximately $1.25 billion in acquisitions volume for 2015. Our initial guidance for 2016 acquisitions is approximately $750 million, which principally reflects our typical flow business, and does not account for any large-scale transactions.
I'll hand it over to Sumit to discuss our acquisitions and dispositions. Sumit?"

During the third quarter of 2015, we invested $124 million in 47 properties located in 22 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 7%, and with a weighted average lease term of 10.9 years. On a revenue basis, 35% of total acquisitions are from investment-grade tenants. 52% of the revenues are generated from retail and 48% are from industrial. These assets are leased to 18 different tenants in 13 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented our transportation services, motor vehicle dealerships and quick service restaurants. We closed 10 independent transactions in the third quarter, and the average investment for property was approximately $2.6 million. Year-to-date 2015, we invested $1.1 billion in 195 properties located in 36 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.5% and with a weighted average lease term of 16.7 years. On a revenue basis, 50% of total acquisitions are from investment-grade tenants. 87% of the revenues are generated from retail and 13% are from industrial. These assets are leased to 35 different tenants in 18 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented are health and fitness, drugstores and quick service restaurants. Of the 35 independent transactions closed year-to-date, 3 transactions were above $50 million.
The transaction flow continues to remain healthy. We sourced more than $4 billion in the third quarter. Year-to-date, we've sourced more than $24 billion in potential transaction opportunities. Of these opportunities, 62% of the volume sourced were portfolios and 38% or approximately $9 billion were one-off assets. Investment grade opportunities represented 26% for the third quarter. Of the $124 million in acquisitions closed in the third quarter, 77% were one-off transactions. We continue to capitalize on our extensive industry relationships developed over our 46-year operating history. As to pricing, cap rates remain flat in the third quarter, with investment-grade properties trading from around 5% to high 6% cap rate range, and non-investment grade properties trading from high 5% to low 8% cap rate range. 
Our disposition program remained active. During the quarter, we sold 8 properties for $21.5 million at a net cash cap rate of 7.2%, and realized an unlevered IRR of 14.2%. This brings us to 22 properties sold year-to-date or approximately $52 million at a net cash cap rate of 7.6% and realized an unlevered IRR of 13%. Our investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital were healthy, averaging 212 basis points in the third quarter which were above our historical average spreads. We define investment spreads as initial cash yield less our nominal first-year weighted average cost of capital. 
In conclusion, we remain confident of reaching our acquisition and dispositions goals of approximately $1.25 billion and $65 million respectively for 2015. With that, I'd like to hand it back to John."

We have increased our dividend every year since the company's listing in 1994, growing the dividend at a compound average annual rate of just under 5%. Our AFFO payout ratio in the third quarter was 81.4%, which is a level we are quite comfortable with. 
To wrap it up, our portfolio is performing well and we are pleased with where we stand as we head into the end of the year and into 2016.

We have put on a negative outlook. Well, S&P rates to see how you execute and finance the transaction. There'll be no impact on our revenue as a result of the -- any possible divestitures. Walgreens will have the contractual obligation to pay the rent through the term. The pungence in the market over the last 2 days have estimated that anywhere from 0 to 400 stores would be closed, so that's quite a range. But on our Walgreens assets, we have an average lease term of 13 years. On our RiteAid assets, we have an average lease terms of 9 yes, and there's really little property overlap in the 2 portfolios. Of the 58 RiteAid locations we own, 15 of those are within a 2-mile radius of a Walgreens store, and the average lease term, I believe, is about 8 years. So we feel really good about that, and we're pleased with both companies' performance. It will take our -- depending on acquisitions, between now and the end of next year, it will take exposure or our percentage of revenues from Walgreens up to somewhere in the high 8s probably, right around 9%. But if we're going to have a tenant, that's a little higher than we typically like the tenant concentrations to be. But if we're going to have a tenant there, we like that it's Walgreens.

As announced in yesterday's press release, we are raising and tightening the range of our AFFO per share guidance for 2015 from $2.69 to $2.73 to the new range of $2.72 to $2.74 given the company's strong year-to-date performance and the continued scalability of our business platform. A very high percentage of our revenue continues to flow to the bottom line.

As usual, I will provide a few highlights on our financial statements for the quarter and begin with the income statement. Total revenue increased 9.8% for the quarter. This increase reflects our growth primarily from new acquisitions over the past year, as well as same-store rent growth. Our annualized rental revenue at September 30 was approximately $992 million. Interest expense increased in the quarter to $64 million. This increase was due to the $250 million 12-year notes we issued in September of last year and a $250 million term loan issued at the end of last quarter, as well as lower amortization of mortgage premiums, as our outstanding mortgage balance continues to decline. We also did recognize a noncash loss of approximately $5.2 million on interest rate swaps during the quarter. As a reminder, we entered into an interest rate swap on the new term loan issued in June, which led to the larger noncash loss this quarter. On a related note, our coverage ratios both remained strong, with interest coverage at 4.2x and fixed charge coverage at 3.8x. Both of these metrics are pro forma for the paydown of the credit facility balance, with proceeds from our common stock offering earlier this month. General and administrative, or G&A, expenses were approximately $10.9 million for the quarter. Included in G&A expense this quarter is approximately $70,000 in acquisition cost, and a reminder that we include these acquisition costs in our calculation of both FFO and AFFO. 
Year-to-date, our G&A as a percentage of total rental and other revenues is only 5%. We estimate that 5% will remain our approximate run rate for G&A for the remainder of the year, as efficiencies in our business model continue to drive improving EBITDA margin. Property expenses, which are not reimbursed by tenants, totaled $3.4 million for the quarter. Year-to-date, our property expenses as a percentage of total rental and other revenues is only 1.5%. We estimate this 1.5% will remain our approximate run rate for property expenses for the remainder of the year, as these expenses have continued to come in lower this year, with lower portfolio vacancy, faster re-leasing of vacant properties, lower property insurance premiums and fewer onetime maintenance expenses. Provisions for impairment of approximately $3.9 million during the quarter included impairments on 1 property held-for-sale, 1 held for investment and 2 sold properties. Gain on sales were approximately $6.2 million in the quarter, and just a reminder, we do not include property sales gains in our FFO or AFFO. Adjusted funds from operations or AFFO or the actual cash we have available for distribution of dividend was $0.70 per share for the quarter, a 9.4% increase versus a year ago. We again increased our cash monthly dividend this quarter and it now equates to a current annualized amount of $2.286 per share. 
Briefly turning to the balance sheet. We've continued to maintain our conservative capital structure. In September, we established an ATM or at-the-market equity distribution program to offer and sell up to 12 million shares, giving us the ability to issue equity capital on an opportunistic basis. Through quarter end, we have not yet issued any equity through this program. During the quarter, we did raise $152 million of equity capital through our direct stock purchase plan. And earlier this month, we raised $517 million in net proceeds in a common stock offering. We used the proceeds to pay down all outstanding borrowings on our $2 billion unsecured revolving credit facility. Our bonds, which are all unsecured and fixed rate, and continue to be rated Baa1 BBB+ had a weighted average maturity of 6.5 years. We again did not assume any mortgages during the quarter. We did pay off some of the maturities, so our outstanding net mortgage debt at quarter end decreased to approximately $695 million. Not including our credit facility, the only variable rate debt exposure we have is on just $15.5 million of mortgage debt. And our overall debt maturity schedule remains in very good shape, with only $2 million of mortgages and $150 million of bonds coming due for the balance of this year, and our maturity schedule is well-laddered thereafter. Currently, our debt to total market capitalization is approximately 28% and our preferred stock outstanding is only 2% of our capital structure, and our debt-to-EBITDA ratio after the equity offering is approximately 5.1x. 
Now let me turn the call back over to John, who will give you more background on these results."

Occupancy, based on the number of properties, was 98.3%, a 10 basis points improvement from last quarter. At the end of the quarter, we had 74 properties that are available for lease out of 4,473 properties in our portfolio. Economic occupancy was 99.3%, and occupancy based on square footage was 99%, increasing 10 basis points and 20 basis points, respectively, from last quarter. We continue to see an active leasing environment, and expect our occupancy to remain around current levels through the end of the year. We had leases expire on 95 properties during the quarter, and we re-leased 97 properties. Additionally, 5 vacant properties were sold during the quarter, so our vacant property count decreased by 7 properties relative to last quarter. 86 properties were re-leased to existing tenants and 11 were re-leased to new tenants. We recaptured 99% of expiring rents without any spending on tenant improvements as is typical for us.  We have a lot of experience in this area of our business. Over the last 20 years, we have re-leased or sold more than 2,000 properties with expired leases. 
Our same-store rent increased 1.1% during the quarter and 1.3% year-to-date. We expect annual same-store rent growth to be approximately 1.3% this year and next year. As many of you know, the timing of our rent increases are irregular and will vary from quarter-to-quarter. 90% of our leases have contractual rent increases, so we remain pleased with the growth we are able to achieve from our properties. Approximately 75% of our investment-grade leases have rental rate growth that averages about 1.3%. Our portfolio continues to be diversified by tenant, industry, geography, and to a certain extent, property type. At the end of the third quarter, our properties were leased to 236 commercial tenants operating in 47 different industries located in 49 states and Puerto Rico. Our diversification contributes to the stability of our cash flow. 79% of our rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties. The largest component outside of retail is industrial properties at 13% of rental revenue. There was really not much movement in the composition of our top tenants and industries during the third quarter. Walgreens remains our largest tenant at 7% of rental revenue; and drugstores remain our largest industry at 11% of rental revenue. 
We continue to have excellent credit quality in the portfolio, with 44% of our rental revenue generated from investment-grade tenants. This dropped from 48% last quarter due to the completion of Dollar Tree's acquisition of Family Dollar in July, which is now rated BB. This percentage will continue to fluctuate and will be positively impacted by 2 pending acquisitions of our non-investment grade-rated tenants by investment grade-rated tenants.  Store level performance of our retail tenants remains sound. Our weighted average rent coverage ratio for the retail properties continues to be 2.6x on a four-wall basis and the median is also 2.6x. 
Moving on to acquisitions. During the quarter, we completed $124 million in acquisitions, and we continue to see a high volume of sourced acquisition opportunities. Year-to-date, we have sourced $24 billion in acquisition opportunities, and we are on track for our second most active year ever for source volume. We remain disciplined in our investment strategy, acquiring less than 5% or $1.1 billion of the amount sourced year-to-date. A large portion of the acquisitions completed so far this year occurred earlier than we had originally expected, which has had a positive impact on our 2015 earnings growth. We continue to expect approximately $1.25 billion in acquisitions volume for 2015. Our initial guidance for 2016 acquisitions is approximately $750 million, which principally reflects our typical flow business, and does not account for any large-scale transactions.
I'll hand it over to Sumit to discuss our acquisitions and dispositions. Sumit?"

During the third quarter of 2015, we invested $124 million in 47 properties located in 22 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 7%, and with a weighted average lease term of 10.9 years. On a revenue basis, 35% of total acquisitions are from investment-grade tenants. 52% of the revenues are generated from retail and 48% are from industrial. These assets are leased to 18 different tenants in 13 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented our transportation services, motor vehicle dealerships and quick service restaurants. We closed 10 independent transactions in the third quarter, and the average investment for property was approximately $2.6 million. Year-to-date 2015, we invested $1.1 billion in 195 properties located in 36 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.5% and with a weighted average lease term of 16.7 years. On a revenue basis, 50% of total acquisitions are from investment-grade tenants. 87% of the revenues are generated from retail and 13% are from industrial. These assets are leased to 35 different tenants in 18 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented are health and fitness, drugstores and quick service restaurants. Of the 35 independent transactions closed year-to-date, 3 transactions were above $50 million.
The transaction flow continues to remain healthy. We sourced more than $4 billion in the third quarter. Year-to-date, we've sourced more than $24 billion in potential transaction opportunities. Of these opportunities, 62% of the volume sourced were portfolios and 38% or approximately $9 billion were one-off assets. Investment-grade opportunities represented 26% for the third quarter. Of the $124 million in acquisitions closed in the third quarter, 77% were one-off transactions. We continue to capitalize on our extensive industry relationships developed over our 46-year operating history. As to pricing, cap rates remain flat in the third quarter, with investment-grade properties trading from around 5% to high 6% cap rate range, and non-investment grade properties trading from high 5% to low 8% cap rate range. 
Our disposition program remained active. During the quarter, we sold 8 properties for $21.5 million at a net cash cap rate of 7.2%, and realized an unlevered IRR of 14.2%. This brings us to 22 properties sold year-to-date or approximately $52 million at a net cash cap rate of 7.6% and realized an unlevered IRR of 13%. Our investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital were healthy, averaging 212 basis points in the third quarter which were above our historical average spreads. We define investment spreads as initial cash yield less our nominal first-year weighted average cost of capital. 
In conclusion, we remain confident of reaching our acquisition and dispositions goals of approximately $1.25 billion and $65 million respectively for 2015. With that, I'd like to hand it back to John."

Our sector leading cost of capital continues to allow us to drive earnings growth, while investing in high-quality assets. We increased the dividends paid this quarter by 4% on a year-over-year basis. We have increased our dividend every year since the company's listing in 1994, growing the dividend at a compound average annual rate of just under 5%. Our AFFO payout ratio in the third quarter was 81.4%, which is a level we are quite comfortable with. 
To wrap it up, our portfolio is performing well and we are pleased with where we stand as we head into the end of the year and into 2016. We continue to realize the efficiencies associated with our size and the economies of scale of our net lease business. We believe our EBITDA margin is the highest in the sector at 93%.

We have put on a negative outlook. Well, S&P rates to see how you execute and finance the transaction. There'll be no impact on our revenue as a result of the -- any possible divestitures. Walgreens will have the contractual obligation to pay the rent through the term. The pundits in the market over the last 2 days have estimated that anywhere from 0 to 400 stores would be closed, so that's quite a range. But on our Walgreens assets, we have an average lease term of 13 years. On our Rite Aid assets, we have an average lease terms of 9 yes, and there's really little property overlap in the 2 portfolios. Of the 58 Rite Aid locations we own, 15 of those are within a 2-mile radius of a Walgreens store, and the average lease term, I believe, is about 8 years. So we feel really good about that, and we're pleased with both companies' performance. It will take our -- depending on acquisitions, between now and the end of next year, it will take our exposure or our percentage of revenues from Walgreens up to somewhere in the high 8s probably, right around 9%. But if we're going to have a tenant, that's a little higher than we typically like the tenant concentrations to be. But if we're going to have a tenant there, we like that it's Walgreens.

It's reducing our property expense obligations the company is responsible for. We're also helping drive that as much quicker resolution of lease rollovers. We improved our property insurance premiums as well, as we’ve become a larger company with scale. And on the G&A front, if you go back and look at kind of our headcount, about 3 years ago, we had some pretty significant additions in headcount, and then a year after that, they were fairly significant, and we are really positioning the company to handle the growth that we had anticipated, and we had hoped would continue, and those earnings have fallen each year. We put really skillful people in place, I think, and have a more efficient organizational structure and more efficient systems, which allow us to have better G&A margins. So there's some other items related to that, but that's what's it's really about. So when we budgeted this year, we budgeted for some headcount that we did not end up having to add to the company, which helped us come in at $2 million to $4 million below where we thought we were going to be on that item.

As usual, I will provide a few highlights on our financial statements for the quarter and begin with the income statement. Total revenue increased 9.8% for the quarter. This increase reflects our growth primarily from new acquisitions over t",750,"Thanks, John. As usual, I will provide a few highlights on our financial statements for the quarter and begin with the income statement. Total revenue increased 9.8% for the quarter. This increase reflects our growth primarily from new acquisitions over the past year as well as same-store rent growth. Our annualized rental revenue at September 30 was approximately $992 million. Interest expense increased in the quarter to $64 million. This increase was due to the $250 million 12-year notes we issued in September of last year and a $250 million term loan issued at the end of last quarter as well as lower amortization of mortgage premiums, as our outstanding mortgage balance continues to decline. We also did recognize a noncash loss of approximately $5.2 million on interest rate swaps during the quarter. As a reminder, we entered into an interest rate swap on the new term loan issued in June, which led to the larger noncash loss this quarter. On a related note, our coverage ratios both remained strong, with interest coverage at 4.2x and fixed charge coverage at 3.8x. Both of these metrics are pro forma for the paydown of the credit facility balance, with proceeds from our common stock offering earlier this month. General and administrative, or G&A, expenses were approximately $10.9 million for the quarter. Included in G&A expense this quarter is approximately $70,000 in acquisition cost, and a reminder that we include these acquisition costs in our calculation of both FFO and AFFO. 
Year-to-date, our G&A as a percentage of total rental and other revenues is only 5%. We estimate that 5% will remain our approximate run rate for G&A for the remainder of the year, as efficiencies in our business model continue to drive improving EBITDA margin. Property expenses, which are not reimbursed by tenants, totaled $3.4 million for the quarter. Year-to-date, our property expenses as a percentage of total rental and other revenues is only 1.5%. We estimate this 1.5% will remain our approximate run rate for property expenses for the remainder of the year, as these expenses have continued to come in lower this year, with lower portfolio vacancy, faster re-leasing of vacant properties, lower property insurance premiums and fewer onetime maintenance expenses. Provisions for impairment of approximately $3.9 million during the quarter included impairments on 1 property held-for-sale, 1 held for investment and 2 sold properties. Gain on sales were approximately $6.2 million in the quarter, and just a reminder, we do not include property sales gains in our FFO or AFFO. Adjusted funds from operations or AFFO or the actual cash we have available for distribution of dividend was $0.70 per share for the quarter, a 9.4% increase versus a year ago. We again increased our cash monthly dividend this quarter and it now equates to a current annualized amount of $2.286 per share. 
Briefly turning to the balance sheet. We've continued to maintain our conservative capital structure. In September, we established an ATM or at-the-market equity distribution program to offer and sell up to 12 million shares, giving us the ability to issue equity capital on an opportunistic basis. Through quarter end, we have not yet issued any equity through this program. During the quarter, we did raise $152 million of equity capital through our direct stock purchase plan. And earlier this month, we raised $517 million in net proceeds in a common stock offering. We used the proceeds to pay down all outstanding borrowings on our $2 billion unsecured revolving credit facility. Our bonds, which are all unsecured and fixed rate, and continue to be rated Baa1 BBB+ had a weighted average maturity of 6.5 years. We again did not assume any mortgages during the quarter. We did pay off some of the maturities, so our outstanding net mortgage debt at quarter end decreased to approximately $695 million. Not including our credit facility, the only variable rate debt exposure we have is on just $15.5 million of mortgage debt. And our overall debt maturity schedule remains in very good shape, with only $2 million of mortgages and $150 million of bonds coming due for the balance of this year, and our maturity schedule is well-laddered thereafter. Currently, our debt to total market capitalization is approximately 28% and our preferred stock outstanding is only 2% of our capital structure, and our debt-to-EBITDA ratio after the equity offering is approximately 5.1x.

Occupancy, based on the number of properties, was 98.3%, a 10 basis points improvement from last quarter. At the end of the quarter, we had 74 properties that are available for lease out of 4,473 properties in our portfolio. Economic occupancy was 99.3%, and occupancy based on square footage was 99%, increasing 10 basis points and 20 basis points, respectively, from last quarter. We continue to see an active leasing environment, and expect our occupancy to remain around current levels through the end of the year. We had leases expire on 95 properties during the quarter, and we re-leased 97 properties. Additionally, 5 vacant properties were sold during the quarter, so our vacant property count decreased by 7 properties relative to last quarter. 86 properties were re-leased to existing tenants and 11 were re-leased to new tenants. We recaptured 99% of expiring rents without any spending on tenant improvements as is typical for us. We have a lot of experience in this area of our business. Over the last 20 years, we have re-leased or sold more than 2,000 properties with expired leases. 
Our same-store rent increased 1.1% during the quarter and 1.3% year-to-date. We expect annual same-store rent growth to be approximately 1.3% this year and next year. As many of you know, the timing of our rent increases are irregular and will vary from quarter-to-quarter. 90% of our leases have contractual rent increases, so we remain pleased with the growth we are able to achieve from our properties. Approximately 75% of our investment-grade leases have rental rate growth that averages about 1.3%. Our portfolio continues to be diversified by tenant, industry, geography, and to a certain extent, property type. At the end of the third quarter, our properties were leased to 236 commercial tenants operating in 47 different industries located in 49 states and Puerto Rico. Our diversification contributes to the stability of our cash flow. 79% of our rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties. The largest component outside of retail is industrial properties at 13% of rental revenue. There was really not much movement in the composition of our top tenants and industries during the third quarter. Walgreens remains our largest tenant at 7% of rental revenue; and drugstores remain our largest industry at 11% of rental revenue. 
We continue to have excellent credit quality in the portfolio, with 44% of our rental revenue generated from investment-grade tenants. This dropped from 48% last quarter due to the completion of Dollar Tree's acquisition of Family Dollar in July, which is now rated BB. This percentage will continue to fluctuate and will be positively impacted by 2 pending acquisitions of our non-investment grade-rated tenants by investment grade-rated tenants. Store level performance of our retail tenants remains sound. Our weighted average rent coverage ratio for the retail properties continues to be 2.6x on a four-wall basis and the median is also 2.6x. 
Moving on to acquisitions. During the quarter, we completed $124 million in acquisitions, and we continue to see a high volume of sourced acquisition opportunities. Year-to-date, we have sourced $24 billion in acquisition opportunities, and we are on track for our second most active year ever for source volume. We remain disciplined in our investment strategy, acquiring less than 5% or $1.1 billion of the amount sourced year-to-date. A large portion of the acquisitions completed so far this year occurred earlier than we had originally expected, which has had a positive impact on our 2015 earnings growth. We continue to expect approximately $1.25 billion in acquisitions volume for 2015. Our initial guidance for 2016 acquisitions is approximately $750 million, which principally reflects our typical flow business, and does not account for any large-scale transactions.
I'll hand it over to Sumit to discuss our acquisitions and dispositions. Sumit?"

During the third quarter of 2015, we invested $124 million in 47 properties located in 22 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 7%, and with a weighted average lease term of 10.9 years. On a revenue basis, 35% of total acquisitions are from investment-grade tenants. 52% of the revenues are generated from retail and 48% are from industrial. These assets are leased to 18 different tenants in 13 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented our transportation services, motor vehicle dealerships and quick service restaurants. We closed 10 independent transactions in the third quarter, and the average investment for property was approximately $2.6 million. Year-to-date 2015, we invested $1.1 billion in 195 properties located in 36 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.5% and with a weighted average lease term of 16.7 years. On a revenue basis, 50% of total acquisitions are from investment-grade tenants. 87% of the revenues are generated from retail and 13% are from industrial. These assets are leased to 35 different tenants in 18 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented are health and fitness, drugstores and quick service restaurants. Of the 35 independent transactions closed year-to-date, 3 transactions were above $50 million.
The transaction flow continues to remain healthy. We sourced more than $4 billion in the third quarter. Year-to-date, we've sourced more than $24 billion in potential transaction opportunities. Of these opportunities, 62% of the volume sourced were portfolios and 38% or approximately $9 billion were one-off assets. Investment-grade opportunities represented 26% for the third quarter. Of the $124 million in acquisitions closed in the third quarter, 77% were one-off transactions. We continue to capitalize on our extensive industry relationships developed over our 46-year operating history. As to pricing, cap rates remain flat in the third quarter, with investment-grade properties trading from around 5% to high 6% cap rate range, and non-investment grade properties trading from high 5% to low 8% cap rate range. 
Our disposition program remained active. During the quarter, we sold 8 properties for $21.5 million at a net cash cap rate of 7.2%, and realized an unlevered IRR of 14.2%. This brings us to 22 properties sold year-to-date or approximately $52 million at a net cash cap rate of 7.6% and realized an unlevered IRR of 13%. Our investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital were healthy, averaging 212 basis points in the third quarter which were above our historical average spreads. We define investment spreads as initial cash yield less our nominal first-year weighted average cost of capital. 
In conclusion, we remain confident of reaching our acquisition and dispositions goals of approximately $1.25 billion and $65 million respectively for 2015. With that, I'd like to hand it back to John."

Our sector leading cost of capital continues to allow us to drive earnings growth, while investing in high-quality assets. We increased the dividends paid this quarter by 4% on a year-over-year basis. We have increased our dividend every year since the company's listing in 1994, growing the dividend at a compound average annual rate of just under 5%. Our AFFO payout ratio in the third quarter was 81.4%, which is a level we are quite comfortable with. 
To wrap it up, our portfolio is performing well and we are pleased with where we stand as we head into the end of the year and into 2016. We continue to realize the efficiencies associated with our size and the economies of scale of our net lease business. We believe our EBITDA margin is the highest in the sector at 93%.

S&P affirmed the BBB rating yesterday, but did put them -- put Walgreens, on a negative outlook, which is normal in these M&A situations, as you recall, when we bought ARCT. We have put on a negative outlook. Well, S&P rates to see how you execute and finance the transaction. There'll be no impact on our revenue as a result of the -- any possible divestitures. Walgreens will have the contractual obligation to pay the rent through the term. The pundits in the market over the last 2 days have estimated that anywhere from 0 to 400 stores would be closed, so that's quite a range. But on our Walgreens assets, we have an average lease term of 13 years. On our Rite Aid assets, we have an average lease terms of 9 yes, and there's really little property overlap in the 2 portfolios. Of the 58 Rite Aid locations we own, 15 of those are within a 2-mile radius of a Walgreens store, and the average lease term, I believe, is about 8 years. So we feel really good about that, and we're pleased with both companies' performance. It will take our -- depending on acquisitions, between now and the end of next year, it will take our exposure or our percentage of revenues from Walgreens up to somewhere in the high 8s probably, right around 9%. But if we're going to have a tenant, that's a little higher than we typically like the tenant concentrations to be. But if we're going to have a tenant there, we like that it's Walgreens.

This year, we thought they were going to be more back-end-loaded given a couple of larger portfolios we were working on, and hearing when those tenants wanted to close and then 2 changed. And all of a sudden, we went from expecting a back-end-loaded acquisitions year that switched to front-end loaded acquisition year. It's really difficult to predict. So in our model right now, we just have that $750 million at -- based on a pro rata structure throughout the year, and it won't happen that way. There'll be quarters where there's big numbers, and there'll be quarters where there are small numbers, and unfortunately, I'm not smart enough to tell you which ones -- which quarters are going to be big and which quarters are going to be small."

Under certain circumstances, we would be comfortable going above that. But over the long run, we'd like to manage our exposure back down because the diversification is highly important to us and our strategy. So you'll see that we kind of -- assuming the Walgreens-Rite Aid transaction closes, we'll have a tenant that's in the upper-8s in terms of percentage of revenues. So that will be a tenant that we look very, very closely at in terms of increasing our exposure. In fact, we would not want to increase the exposure in -- it was just something exceptional in terms of an incredibly attractive investment opportunity, and then we have discussions with our team here, and with our board to see if we even wanted to do that. On the industry side, it's always been kind of in the lower double digits, in the sort of 10% to 12% range, and we want to remain in that area, and right now, we're in that area, but the diversification is something that we think is important in our type of business."
