First, as you all know,, we announced last week that effective May 5, I would be retiring as CEO of Bristol-Myers Squibb. While remaining on our Board of Directors and becoming the Committee Chairman, Jim Cornelius. Jim's role in our company has been transformational and outstanding and I feel honored to have worked with him for many years and to take over from him as Chairman. I'm very pleased that Giovanni, Giovanni Caforio, will be my successor as CEO. Giovanni's a global business leader with broad industry and management experience, including a solid background in oncology. He is also a trained physician who brings into his work an important perspective and certain insights. Importantly, Giovanni has not only been a key player in developing our strategy these past several years, he's also been one of the driving forces executing against it. So I feel very good about leaving our company in his very capable hands. 
I'm going to ask Giovanni and Charlie to walk you through our fourth quarter results. But before I do that I will speak for a few minutes about some of the highlights for the past year because 2014 was, without question, an important year for Bristol-Myers Squibb. 
I'm very pleased and very proud at the company. In 2014, we accelerated our evolution to being a diversified specialty BioPharma company. Beginning with the completion of the divestiture of our [indiscernible] business. Under Giovanni's leadership, we will refocus our commercial organization towards global brands and key markets. This allowed us to drive strong sales across our portfolio and across the world. In fact, our commercial organization had a good year delivering 6% sales growth, excluding the [indiscernible] franchise. These changes position us well for continued success with our portfolio of marketed and pipeline products. Under Francis' leadership, our organization -- our [indiscernible] organization also had a good year. Most notably, with respect to our immuno-oncology portfolio. Pending approval of Opdivo in the U.S. for melanoma and with the early stoppage of 2 of [indiscernible] in [indiscernible] due to very positive results. These developments underscore the strength of our ISO strategy and our I-O programs and importance of continuing to apply the same strategy. 
Beyond I-O, we've made good progress across the rest of our diversified portfolio, just to mention a few examples, we obtained an important label expansion for Eliquis. We continue to develop interesting early assets in neuroscience and HIV. We executed several business development transactions to make our I-O portfolio even stronger and to build the rest of our specialty portfolio in areas like fibrosis and genetically design diseases. 
We committed significant resources to increase our biologics capacity, announcing strategic investments to expand our [indiscernible] Massachusetts facility and build a new plant, a totally new plant in Ireland. Biologics now comprise about 50% of our R&D portfolio and that number will continue to grow. 
So taking them all together, 2014 was a good important year for us and it [indiscernible] a strong foundation our future. Financially, commercially, clinically, by every indication, Bristol-Myers Squibb is well positioned. We will, of course, continue to face challenges such as the [indiscernible] losses of [indiscernible] and this very competitive marketplace, but we have the right products, there right plan and the right people to fight our way through it all. With that, I have no doubt. And because we are in such a good position, such good position, I feel that my decision to retire as CEO and to accept the proposal from our board to become Chairman comes at the right time. And again, I'm very confident with Giovanni ability to leave Bristol-Myers Squibb to lead our success over the past several years and to take our company forward with the support of the outstanding management team that [indiscernible] pleasure to put them together [indiscernible]. 
So with that, I will turn the floor over to Giovanni to provide our Q4 results. Giovanni?"
25798,280140619,749152,"Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2015",2015-01-27,"Earnings Calls","Bristol-Myers Squibb Company","Executives","Thank you, Lamberto, and good morning, everyone.

Let me begin by thanking Lamberto for his kind words of support and more generally, his exceptional leadership over the last several years. He has led our company at a pivotal task, navigating us through a challenging but exciting BioPharma transformation leaving us to our current position of strength. I'm looking forward to continuing our work together as we transition into our new roles. 
So as Lamberto discussed, 2014 was a very good year that ended on a very good note. During the fourth quarter, we delivered 9% sales growth across our diversified portfolio and across our key markets, excluding our diabetes franchise and the impact of foreign exchange. 
Let me touch on some of the highlights. First, Yervoy had a very good quarter with a 41% increase. In the U.S., this strong performance was driven by continued penetration in the community setting. Outside the U.S., it was driven largely by its first line indication and improved access. Even with our success in 2014, we've recognized that the melanoma market dynamics will continue to evolve following the launch of Opdivo. While this may impact Yervoy's short-term trends, we are very well positioned. In monotherapy, both our products have demonstrated overall survival. And and in combination, they have the potential to offer long-term survival with the largest number of patients. 
Eliquis had its best quarter ever, $281 million in sales. In the U.S., the expansion of the label was a key reason why sales grew 20% over the previous quarter. And we continued to make good progress in new-to-brand prescriptions by cardiologists. Outside the U.S. we also made good progress, particularly in Germany and Japan. Looking forward, we have every reason to believe that Eliquis' strong performance trends will continue. 
Regarding hepatitis C, we had a really good quarter. Generally speaking, our strategy is to focus on difficult-to-treat patients and the unique medical need of each market. We made important progress. In Japan with our Dual Regiment and in Europe, with [indiscernible] approved in combination including [indiscernible]. In the U.S., we are working with the FDA and expect to be able to resubmit Daklinza based on data from completed and ongoing studies. 
And lastly, we are very excited about the U.S. approval of Opdivo. Our commercial organization was more than ready to go at the time of approval. Achievements were ready at years end and Opdivo have hit the ground running. We are leveraging Yervoy's established commercial presence building on our strong relationships with physicians and payers. In fact, our commercial organization is actively promoting Opdivo. And within the first 2 weeks, we reached nearly 100% of the top accounts and already have a 70% share of voice within the melanoma market. And while it is early, we are making good progress with access. 
Although we are primarily focused on Opdivo for melanoma in the U.S. and hopefully, soon in Europe, following our 063 and 017 announcements, we are also preparing for potential approvals in [indiscernible] later this year. Charlie will talk about our 2014 financials and our outlook for 2015. 
Let me close with a few words about the coming year. Clearly, 2015, like every year, will have its challenges and it's opportunities, that's a given. But I am confident that we will successfully find our way through it all by continuing to execute against our strategy and by maintaining our balanced approach of driving results today while setting the stage for tomorrow. That means growth of our marketed products, strong product launches and continued investments in our portfolio of the future. And that means continuing to focus on leadership in immuno-oncology as a priority. Also remembering that we are a diversified specialty BioPharma company, one with multiple products across multiple therapeutic areas. And with that, I will turn the floor over to Charlie."

Good morning, everyone. I will discuss a few items from our fourth quarter non-GAAP P&L and our outlook for 2015.

I will discuss a few items from our fourth quarter non-GAAP P&L and our outlook for 2015. 
As Giovanni covered some of the highlights on sales, I will make just a few additional comments regarding revenues during the quarter. First, Eliquis sales were reduced by approximately $15 million in gross to net addition for the Medicare coverage gap. Sustiva benefited from a $30 million annual equity share true-up related to Atripla. And finally, our net revenues for Plavix and [indiscernible] which are captured under mature products, benefited from a $36 million reduction in our returns reserve. 
With the dollar strengthening, foreign exchange had an unfavorable impact on both the top and bottom line. Compared to the same quarter last year, the negative impacts was 3% on sales and approximately $0.03 on EPS. 
Gross margin was 78% during the quarter, up 440 basis points compared to the same period last year mostly due to product mix following the divestiture of our global diabetes business. Marketing, selling and admin expenses increased about 9% of the quarter due in part to increased investments in key brands including Eliquis, Yervoy, Opdivo and our HCV franchise. R&D expenses increased primarily due to timing of spending across our R&D portfolio. 
Our non-GAAP tax rate was 10% during the quarter compared to almost 18% during the same period last year, our Q4 represents a full year of the R&D tax credit which was just extended in December. 
Now I'd like to spend a few moments discussing capital allocation. We will continue our balanced approach to using our capital. We feel good about the strength of our balance sheet and the flexibilities these resources give us to make important investment decisions. the continue to see business development as a top priority and also remain committed to the dividend, which was recently increased for the 5th year in a row. 
Regarding business development, we believe that innovation must be sourced both internally and externally. We continue to look for BD opportunities that can help deliver long-term growth within our core areas of interest. We are committed to fully advancing our leading immuno-oncology portfolio. Our clinical collaboration strategy reflects far belief that combination therapy will be a key component of I-O in the future and that we are open to exploring external I-O opportunities. 
Since the end of Q3, we have announced 4 additional medical collaborations including Opdivo. Overall, we are -- we have 9 clinical collaborations to study Opdivo in more than a dozen tumor types. In addition to these I-O collaboration, we also find several deals that will strengthen our specialty portfolio. We will continue to develop and diversify our our R&D and commercial portfolios, focusing on high-quality opportunities that are closely aligned to our diversified specialty BioPharma strategy. 
I'll now move to 2015 guidance. We are setting our non-GAAP EPS guidance range at $1.55 to $1.70. This range assumes current exchange rates and continuation of the R&D tax credit in 2015. As a reminder, there are several factors to keep in mind, which will have an impact on our 2015 revenues. Our rights to Abilify in the U.S. and most remaining international market expire in April. Abilify is a high margin product as we record our share of revenues without [indiscernible] associated cost. You will see a full year's impact on BARACLUDE sales in the U.S. due to the loss of exclusivity last year. As we previously mentioned, we expect a negative impact on EPS of roughly $0.10 in 2015. 
As I commented during our October earnings call, revenues from mature products and other non core assets will decline significantly this year due to a one-time step down of about $400 million related to expiring agreements. In addition, I'd remind you that this is a declining business. 
As you all know,, the U.S. dollar has strengthened against almost all currencies from 2014 average rates quite a bit just in January. Based on current FX rates, this will negatively impact our 2015 revenues by approximately $800 million and $0.12 to $0.14 on earnings per share. 
On the other hand, we expect continued growth in 2015 from the rest of our portfolio where we are seeing strong exit trends that we believe will continue. We are also very encouraged by the accelerated approval of Opdivo to treat advanced melanoma in the U.S. and hope to receive approvals in other countries and other tumors in 2015. 
We expect our full year gross margin to be approximately 74% in 2015. Our gross margin continues to be largely driven by product mix, [indiscernible] exclusivity and the structure of our copromotion agreement for Eliquis. We expect these downward pressures to be partially offset by the growth of new products, including Opdivo and our HCV portfolio. 
You will see our line item guidance for AMP and SNA and R&D in our press release. Our operating expense projections reflect our net operating model, following the divestiture of our Global Diabetes alliance early last year. We remain committed to investing the key opportunities, building our late-stage pipeline and the launch of Opdivo in the U.S. in advanced melanoma and potential subsequent launches in other regions and indications. We also continue to drive growth of our [indiscernible] brands, including Yervoy, Eliquis, [indiscernible] and SPRYCEL. We will, however, continue to be prudent with our resources on our older brands and leverage our specialty model. Our operating expenses outside the U.S. will also be affected by prevailing exchange rates. On the R&D side, we expect to spend less in 2015, primarily due to decreased spending on diabetes clinical trials. 
Now we'd be happy to address your questions."

We also have a first line study under way, that a bit of a year ago if you PD-L1 positive patients and it's our intent to go do beat chemotherapy, double it in first-line as we have already been done in melanoma and in non squamous. So just to round out, I did mention that we will be starting a comprehensive study in first line with our combination in this half of the year. So a very broad program. I'm confident by the end of this next 12 months, we are going to have a approval in lung and that we will have increasing submissions around the world. Thank you very much."

So with respect launches and expectations for [indiscernible] let me start by saying, we're really excited about the approval we have received at the end of December in advanced melanoma for Opdivo. And we started working on the launch and executing the launch immediately after the approval by year-end. We already have shipments in the market and our teams were actively promoting. And while it clearly, is early, we're very pleased that we have already reached about 100% of our most important targets, and we have a very high 70% market -- share of voice in melanoma. That reflects the fact that we have been successfully commercializing Yervoy over the last years, and we've gained a lot of experience in immuno-oncology and in the U.S. market in particular. So as we think about the future, obviously, we are ready for potential future launches later this year in lung in the U.S., but we are also ready for launches in melanoma and lung in Europe as another key market. And we've made a lot of the investments needed in order to ensure that our teams were properly staffed and ready to go. And obviously, we would follow a very similar strategy of educating physicians of Opdivo immunotherapy and the strength of our data. I think it's important to remember that there is a significant percentage of the land prescribing community which is different from the melanoma prescribing community and as a result of that, those physicians are probably at the beginning of their learning curve with respect to immuno-oncology and I think it would be important for us to do the same education we did 4 years ago when we launched in melanoma. When you put all of those things together, we're very optimistic about the future, but we, obviously, realized that there is significant variability in 2015. Because timing of potential launches, the evolution of the label and the speed of uptake in different tumor types."

And if there is an opportunity in your view, perhaps, Giovanni could answer this one, to see that move forward. And then, separately, on a bigger picture perspective, perhaps, both Lamberto and Francis could comment on this a bit, but the focus on immuno-oncology has been extremely successful.

First, as you all know,, we announced last week that effective May 5, I would be retiring as CEO of Bristol-Myers Squibb. While remaining on our Board of Directors and becoming its Chairman, replacing Jim Cornelius. Jim's role in our company has been transformational and outstanding, and I feel honored to have worked with him for many years and now take over from him as Chairman. I am very pleased that Giovanni, Giovanni Caforio, will be my successor as CEO. Giovanni is a global business leader with broad industry and management experience, including a solid background in oncology. He is also a trained physician who brings to his work an important perspective and certain insights. Importantly, Giovanni has not only been a key player in developing our strategy these past several years, he's also been one of the driving forces executing against it. So I feel very good about leaving our company in his very capable hands. 
I am going to ask Giovanni and Charlie to walk you through our fourth quarter results. But before I do that, I will speak for a few minutes about some of the highlights for the past year because 2014 was, without question, an important year for Bristol-Myers Squibb. 
I'm very pleased and very proud about it. In 2014, we accelerated our evolution to being a diversified specialty biopharma company, beginning with the completion of the divestiture of our diabetes business. Under Giovanni's leadership, we will refocus our commercial organization to optimize global brands and key markets. This allowed us to drive strong sales across our portfolio and across the world. In fact, our commercial organization had a good year, delivering 6% sales growth, excluding the diabetes franchise. These changes position us well for continued success with our portfolio of marketed and pipeline products. Under Francis' leadership, our organization, R&D organization, also had a good year, most notably, with respect to our immuno-oncology portfolio, gaining approval of Opdivo in the U.S. for melanoma and with the early stoppage of 2 Opdivo studies in melanoma and lung due to very positive results. These developments underscore the strength of our I-O strategy and our I-O programs and the importance of continuing to apply the same strategy. 
Beyond I-O, we made good progress across the rest of our diversified portfolio. Just to mention a few examples, we obtained an important label expansion for Eliquis. We continue to develop interesting early assets in neuroscience and HIV. We executed several business development transactions to make our I-O portfolio even stronger and to build the rest of our specialty portfolio in areas like fibrosis and genetically defined diseases. 
And we committed significant resources to increase our biologics capacity, announcing strategic investments to expand our Devens, Massachusetts facility and build a new plant, totally new plant, in Ireland. Biologics now comprise about 50% of our R&D portfolio and that number will continue to grow. 
So taking them both together, 2014 was a good important year for us and it's set a strength -- a strong foundation for our future. Financially, commercially, clinically, by every indication, Bristol-Myers Squibb is well positioned. We will, of course, continue to face challenges such as the upcoming losses of exclusivity in a very competitive marketplace, but we have the right products, the right plans and the right people to fight our way through it all. In that, I have no doubt. And because we are in such a good position, such good position, I feel that my decision to retire as CEO and to accept the proposal from our board to become Chairman comes at the right time. And again, I'm very confident with Giovanni's ability to lead Bristol-Myers Squibb to build on our success over the past several years and to take our company forward with the support of the outstanding management team that I've had the pleasure of putting together and lead.
So with that, I will turn the floor over to Giovanni to provide our Q4 results. Giovanni?"

Let me begin by thanking Lamberto for his kind words of support, and more generally, for his exceptional leadership over the last several years. He has led our company at a pivotal time, navigating us through a challenging but exciting biopharma transformation and leading us to our current position of strength. I'm looking forward to continuing our work together as we transition into our new roles. 
So as Lamberto discussed, 2014 was a very good year that ended on a very good note. During the fourth quarter, we delivered 9% sales growth across our diversified portfolio and across our key markets, excluding our diabetes franchise and the impact of foreign exchange.
Let me touch on some of the highlights. First, Yervoy had a very good quarter with a 41% increase. In the U.S., this strong performance was driven by continued penetration in the community setting. Outside the U.S., it was driven largely by its first-line indication and improved access. Even with our success in 2014, we recognized that the melanoma market dynamics will continue to evolve following the launch of Opdivo. While this may impact Yervoy's short-term trends, we are very well positioned. In monotherapy, both our products have demonstrated overall survival, and in combination, they have the potential to offer long-term survival to the largest number of patients. 
Eliquis had its best quarter ever with $281 million in sales. In the U.S., the expansion of the label was a key reason why sales grew 20% over the previous quarter. And we continued to make good progress in new-to-brand prescriptions by cardiologists. Outside the U.S., we also made good progress, particularly in Germany and Japan. Looking forward, we have every reason to believe that Eliquis' strong performance trends will continue. 
Regarding hepatitis C, we had a really good quarter. Generally speaking, our strategy is to focus on difficult-to-treat patients and the unique medical need of each market. We made important progress in Japan with our Dual Regimen, and in Europe, where Daklinza is approved in combinations, including Sovaldi. In the U.S., we are working with the FDA and expect to be able to resubmit Daklinza based on data from completed and ongoing studies. 
And lastly, we are very excited about the U.S. approval of Opdivo. Our commercial organization was more than ready to go at the time of approval. Shipments were ready by year's end and our Opdivo have hit the ground running. We are leveraging Yervoy's established commercial presence, building on our strong relationships with physicians and payers. In fact, our commercial organization is actively promoting Opdivo, and within the first 2 weeks, we reached nearly 100% of the top accounts and already have a 70% share of voice within the melanoma market. And while it is early, we are making good progress with access. 
Although we are primarily focused on Opdivo for melanoma in the U.S., and hopefully, soon in Europe, following our 063 and 017 announcements, we are also preparing for potential approvals in lung later this year. Charlie will talk about our 2014 financials and our outlook for 2015. 
But let me close with a few words about the coming year. Clearly, 2015, like every year, will have its challenges and its opportunities, that's a given, but I am confident that we will successfully find our way through it all by continuing to execute against our strategy and by maintaining our balanced approach of driving results today while setting the stage for tomorrow. That means growth of our marketed products, strong product launches and continued investments in our portfolio of the future. And that means continuing to focus on leadership in immuno-oncology as a priority, but also remembering that we are a diversified specialty biopharma company, one with multiple products across multiple therapeutic areas.
And with that, I will turn the floor over to Charlie."

Good morning, everyone. I will discuss a few items from our fourth quarter non-GAAP P&L and our outlook for 2015.

I will discuss a few items from our fourth quarter non-GAAP P&L and our outlook for 2015. 
As Giovanni covered some of the highlights on sales, I will make just a few additional comments regarding revenues during the quarter. First, Eliquis sales were reduced by approximately $15 million in gross-to-net adjustments for the Medicare coverage gap. SUSTIVA benefited from a $30 million annual equity share true-up related to ATRIPLA. And finally, our net revenues for Plavix and Avapro/Avalide, which are captured under mature products, benefited from a $36 million reduction in our returns reserve. 
With the dollar strengthening, foreign exchange had an unfavorable impact on both the top and bottom line. Compared to the same quarter last year, the negative impact was 3% on sales and approximately $0.03 on EPS. 
Gross margin was 78% during the quarter, up 440 basis points compared to the same period last year, mostly due to product mix following the divestiture of our global diabetes business. Marketing, selling and admin expenses increased about 9% in the quarter due in part to increased investments in key brands, including Eliquis, Yervoy, Opdivo and our HCV franchise. R&D expenses increased primarily due to timing of spending across our R&D portfolio. 
Our non-GAAP tax rate was 10% during the quarter compared to almost 18% during the same period last year. Our Q4 rate reflects a full year of the R&D tax credit, which was just extended in December. 
Now I'd like to spend a few moments discussing capital allocation. We will continue our balanced approach to using our capital. We feel good about the strength of our balance sheet and the flexibilities these resources give us to make important investment decisions. We continue to see business development as a top priority and also remain committed to the dividend, which was recently increased for the sixth year in a row. 
And regarding the business development, we believe that innovation must be sourced both internally and externally. We continue to look for BD opportunities that can help deliver long-term growth within our core areas of interest. We are committed to fully advancing our leading immuno-oncology portfolio. Our clinical collaboration strategy reflects our belief that combination therapy will be a key component of I-O in the future and that we are open to exploring external I-O opportunities. 
Since the end of Q3, we have announced 4 additional medical collaborations, including Opdivo. Overall, we are -- we have 9 clinical collaborations to study Opdivo in more than a dozen tumor types. In addition to these I-O collaborations, we also find several deals that will strengthen our specialty portfolio. We will continue to develop and diversify our R&D and commercial portfolios, focusing on high-quality opportunities that are closely aligned with our diversified specialty BioPharma strategy. 
I will now move to 2015 guidance. We are setting our non-GAAP EPS guidance range at $1.55 to $1.70. This range assumes current exchange rates and continuation of the R&D tax credit in 2015. As a reminder, there are several factors to keep in mind, which will have an impact on our 2015 revenues. Our rights to Abilify in the U.S. and most remaining international markets expire in April. Abilify is a high-margin product as we record our share of revenues without any meaningful associated costs. We will see a full year's impact on BARACLUDE sales in the U.S. due to the loss of exclusivity last year. As we previously mentioned, we expect a negative impact on EPS of roughly $0.10 in 2015. 
As I commented during our October earnings call, revenues from mature products and other non-core assets will decline significantly this year due to a onetime step-down of about $400 million related to expiring agreements. In addition, I'll remind you that this is a declining business. 
As you all know, the U.S. dollar has strengthened against almost all currencies from 2014 average rates and quite a bit just in January. Based on current FX rates, this will negatively impact our 2015 revenues by approximately $800 million and $0.12 to $0.14 on earnings per share. 
On the other hand, we expect continued growth in 2015 from the rest of our portfolio where we are seeing strong exit trends that we believe will continue. We are also very encouraged by the accelerated approval of Opdivo to treat advanced melanoma in the U.S. and hope to receive approvals in other countries and other tumors in 2015. 
We expect our full year gross margin to be approximately 74% in 2015. Our gross margin continues to be largely driven by product mix, loss of exclusivity and the structure of our co-promotion agreement for Eliquis. We expect these downward pressures to be partially offset by the growth of new products, including Opdivo and our HCV portfolio. 
You will see our line item guidance for A&P, MS&A and R&D in our press release. Our operating expense projections reflect our new operating model, following the divestiture of our global Diabetes Alliance early last year. We remain committed to investing in key opportunities, including our late-stage pipeline and the launch of Opdivo in the U.S. in advanced melanoma and potential subsequent launches in other regions and indications. We also continue to drive growth of our priority brands, including Yervoy, Eliquis, ORENCIA and SPRYCEL. We will, however, continue to be prudent with our resources on our older brands and leverage our specialty model. Our operating expenses outside the U.S. will also be affected by prevailing exchange rates. On the R&D side, we expect to spend less in 2015, primarily due to decreased spending on diabetes clinical trials. 
Now we'd be happy to address your questions."

And as far as the earlier studies in other -- the other 4 compounds we have in development, what I would say is they are progressing. There's exposure to studies. We will be seeing data this year.

And while I'm really glad to see the potential of immunotherapy coming to fruition, first with Yervoy and now with Opdivo, some are the strategic choices that we made when we shaped our development program are putting up now in what we believe is a very strong competitive position. We have always felt that it was important to address the broader set of patients as possible. We also always believed in the importance of demonstrating overall survival as it is what counts to patients, physicians and payers. And at the same time, we have built -- our R&D people have built optionality into our clinical trials. So while the trials were designed to show survival, overall survival, we have flexibility in evaluating other endpoints when they can accelerate the program.

Thank you for your comments. With respect to the PBMs and fighting and access in general, first of all, let me say that we've been operating in an environment where the headwinds from a pricing and reimbursement perspective for quite some time. We understand that will continue, including the U.S. A good example for us is Yervoy where, over the last few years, we were able to work with payers around the world very proactively and effectively, and Yervoy today is really reimbursed in every market around the world according to label, and access for patients has not been an issue. So when we think about this issue going forward, obviously, the first starting point is to have truly differentiating data and product profiles and that's one of the reasons why, for example, as Lamberto mentioned, we are focused on overall survival as an endpoint for our trials. The second one really is working collaboratively with payers around the world. We have a very strong history of having done that in the past, and we continue to look at that as a priority for us.

As you know, we have 10 ongoing studies. We have an 11th just about to start at the first-line combination study. And it's basically all populations, all histology, all lines of therapy in both PD-L1 positive and negative. So it's a very comprehensive study, and I think it's important to note that we have actually made significant progress over the last year. I think I told you all a year ago it's going to a big year for data for Opdivo and we would know a lot more about Opdivo at the end of the year, and I think we've shown that, particularly the last few weeks, which have been very exciting. So we completed early submission for the third-line study in the United States. And just to remind you, we did make a submission, having validated in Europe around the middle of the year. As you've heard on the call a couple of weeks ago, we announced that the squamous study had been stopped because Opdivo was superior in terms of overall survival. And overall survival, we believe, is the gold standard in cancer and a very important attribute, we believe, of bio agents such as Opdivo. And of course, this marks the first time that any PD-1 has shown overall survival in cancer. It's not the first time we've shown superiority. We, of course, showed it earlier last year in melanoma as well. And as I just noted before, we are moving forward with the events proceeding in the non-squamous population and we would --we should, if our projections are right, get to that by the middle of the year. We also have a first-line study underway. That started about a year ago in PD-L1 positive patients, and it's our intent to go to beat chemotherapy, double it in first line as we have already done in melanoma and in second-line squamous. And just to -- just to round it out, I did mention that we will be starting a comprehensive study in first line with our combination in this half of the year. So a very broad program. I'm confident by the end of this next 12 months, we are going to have an approval in lung and that we will have increasing submissions around the world. Thank you very much."

So with respect to launches and expectations for uptake, let me maybe start by saying we're really excited about the approval we have received at the end of December in advanced melanoma for Opdivo. And we started working on the launch and executing the launch immediately after the approval by year-end. We already have shipments in the market and our teams were actively promoting. And while it clearly is early, we are very pleased that we have already reached about 100% of our most important targets, and we have a very high 70% market -- share of voice in melanoma. That reflects the fact that we have been successfully commercializing Yervoy over the last few years, and we've gained a lot of experience in immuno-oncology and in the U.S. market in particular. So as we think about the future, obviously, we are ready for potential future launches later this year in lung in the U.S., but we are also ready for launches in melanoma and lung in Europe as another key market. And we've made a lot of the investments needed in order to make sure that our teams were properly staffed and ready to go. And obviously, we will follow a very similar strategy of educating physicians on Opdivo immunotherapy and the strength of our data. I think it's important to remember that there is a significant percentage of the lung prescribing community, which is different from the melanoma prescribing community, and as a result of that, those physicians are probably at the beginning of their learning curve with respect to immuno-oncology. And I think it will be important for us to do the same education we did 4 years ago when we launched in melanoma. When you put all of those things together, we're very optimistic about the future, but we, obviously, realized that there is significant variability in 2015 because of timing of potential launches, the evolution of the label and the speed of uptake in different tumor types."

Can you talk a little bit about the -- how that typically lines up without an FDA label and if there is an opportunity in your view, perhaps Giovanni could answer this one, to see that move forward? And then, separately, on a bigger picture perspective, perhaps both Lamberto and Francis could comment on this a bit, but the focus on immuno-oncology has been extremely successful. If you -- as you seek to build out in other areas, what are the areas of focus? We've seen GDD, the genetic disorders, as a focus or derived diseases as a focus and also fibrosis.

First has to do with your I-O franchise. Certainly, with you having a clinical development lead, one advantage you potentially have is survival data, not only in melanoma, but potentially in lung, possibly renal in the future. Can you help me understand how long you might have that benefit because you did run well-controlled Phase III clinical trials? And having survival versus competitor that doesn't have survival data, how does that play with oncologists in the marketplace? Second question has to do with Eliquis, just on new-to-brand share with cardiologists, can you articulate a percentage there? You mentioned that broadening of the label was important in terms of expanding that, and is that surpassing Xarelto now? And then last question just has to do with M&A very quickly. Can you maybe give some additional color, especially since you're potentially being viewed as not as diversified as you historically have been?

Good morning, everyone. First, as you all know, we announced last week that effective May 5, I will be retiring as CEO of Bristol-Myers Squibb, while remaining on our Board of Directors and becoming its Chairman, replacing Jim Cornelius. 
Jim's role in our company has been transformational and outstanding, and I feel honored to have worked with him for many years and now to take over from him as Chairman. I am very pleased that Giovanni, Giovanni Caforio, will be my successor as CEO. Giovanni is a global business leader with broad industry and management experience, including a solid background in oncology. He is also a trained physician who brings to his work an important perspective and certain insights. Importantly, Giovanni has not only been a key player in developing our strategy these past several years, he has also been one of the driving forces executing against it. So I feel very good about leaving our company in his very capable hands. 
I am going to ask Giovanni and Charlie to walk you through our fourth quarter results. But before I do that, I will speak for a few minutes about some of the highlights for the past year because 2014 was, without question, an important year for Bristol-Myers Squibb. I'm very pleased and very proud about it. 
In 2014, we accelerated our evolution to being a diversified specialty biopharma company, beginning with the completion of the divestiture of our diabetes business. Under Giovanni's leadership, we refocused our commercial organization to optimize global brands and key markets. This allowed us to drive strong sales across our portfolio and across the world. In fact, our commercial organization had a good year, delivering 6% sales growth, excluding the diabetes franchise. These changes position us well for continued success with our portfolio of marketed and pipeline products. 
Under Francis' leadership, our organization, R&D organization, also had a good year, most notably, with respect to our immuno-oncology portfolio, gaining approval of Opdivo in the U.S. for melanoma and with the early stoppage of 2 Opdivo studies in melanoma and lung due to very positive results. These developments underscore the strength of our I-O strategy and our I-O programs and the importance of continuing to apply the same strategy. 
Beyond I-O, we made good progress across the rest of our diversified portfolio. Just to mention a few examples, we obtained an important label expansion for Eliquis. We continue to develop interesting early assets in neuroscience and HIV. We executed several business development transactions to make our I-O portfolio even stronger and to build the rest of our specialty portfolio in areas like fibrosis and genetically defined diseases. 
And we committed significant resources to increase our biologics capacity, announcing strategic investments to expand our Devens, Massachusetts facility and build a new plant, totally new plant, in Ireland. Biologics now comprise about 50% of our R&D portfolio and that number will continue to grow. 
So taking them both together, 2014 was a good important year for us and it set a strength -- a strong foundation for our future. Financially, commercially, clinically, by every indication, Bristol-Myers Squibb is well positioned. We will, of course, continue to face challenges such as the upcoming losses of exclusivity and a very competitive marketplace, but we have the right products, the right plans and the right people to find our way through it all. In that, I have no doubt. And because we are in such a good position, such good position, I feel that my decision to retire as CEO and to accept the proposal from our board to become Chairman comes at the right time. And again, I'm very confident in Giovanni's ability to lead Bristol-Myers Squibb to build on our success over the past several years and to take our company forward with the support of the outstanding management team that I've had the pleasure of putting together and lead.
So with that, I will turn the floor over to Giovanni to provide our Q4 results. Giovanni?"
25798,280140619,749402,"Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2015",2015-01-27,"Earnings Calls","Bristol-Myers Squibb Company","Executives","Thank you, Lamberto, and good morning, everyone.

Let me begin by thanking Lamberto for his kind words of support, and more generally, for his exceptional leadership over the last several years. He has led our company at a pivotal time, navigating us through a challenging but exciting biopharma transformation and leading us to our current position of strength. I'm looking forward to continuing our work together as we transition into our new roles. 
So as Lamberto discussed, 2014 was a very good year that ended on a very good note. During the fourth quarter, we delivered 9% sales growth across our diversified portfolio and across our key markets, excluding our diabetes franchise and the impact of foreign exchange.
Let me touch on some of the highlights. First, Yervoy had a very good quarter with a 41% increase. In the U.S., this strong performance was driven by continued penetration in the community setting. Outside the U.S., it was driven largely by its first-line indication and improved access. Even with our success in 2014, we recognized that the melanoma market dynamics will continue to evolve following the launch of Opdivo. While this may impact Yervoy's short-term trends, we are very well positioned. In monotherapy, both our products have demonstrated overall survival, and in combination, they have the potential to offer long-term survival to the largest number of patients. 
Eliquis had its best quarter ever with $281 million in sales. In the U.S., the expansion of the label was a key reason why sales grew 20% over the previous quarter. And we continued to make good progress in new-to-brand prescriptions by cardiologists. Outside the U.S., we also made good progress, particularly in Germany and Japan. Looking forward, we have every reason to believe that Eliquis' strong performance trends will continue. 
Regarding hepatitis C, we had a really good quarter. Generally speaking, our strategy is to focus on difficult-to-treat patients and the unique medical need of each market. We made important progress in Japan with our Dual Regimen, and in Europe, where Daklinza is approved in combinations, including Sovaldi. In the U.S., we are working with the FDA and expect to be able to resubmit Daklinza based on data from completed and ongoing studies. 
And lastly, we are very excited about the U.S. approval of Opdivo. Our commercial organization was more than ready to go at the time of approval. Shipments were ready by year's end and our people have hit the ground running. We are leveraging Yervoy's established commercial presence, building on our strong relationships with physicians and payers. In fact, our commercial organization is actively promoting Opdivo, and within the first 2 weeks, we reached nearly 100% of the top accounts and already have a 70% share of voice within the melanoma market. And while it is early, we are making good progress with access. 
Although we are primarily focused on Opdivo for melanoma in the U.S. and hopefully soon in Europe, following our 063 and 017 announcements, we are also preparing for potential approvals in lung later this year. Charlie will talk about our 2014 financials and our outlook for 2015, but let me close with a few words about the coming year. 
Clearly, 2015, like every year, will have its challenges and its opportunities, that's a given, but I am confident that we will successfully find our way through it all by continuing to execute against our strategy and by maintaining our balanced approach of driving results today, while setting the stage for tomorrow. That means growth of our marketed products, strong product launches and continued investments in our portfolio of the future. And that means continuing to focus on leadership in immuno-oncology as a priority, but also remembering that we are a diversified specialty biopharma company, one with multiple products across multiple therapeutic areas.
And with that, I will turn the floor over to Charlie."
25798,280140619,749402,"Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2015",2015-01-27,"Earnings Calls","Bristol-Myers Squibb Company","Executives","Thank you, Giovanni. Good morning, everyone. I will discuss a few items from our fourth quarter non-GAAP P&L and our outlook for 2015. As Giovanni covered some of the highlights on sales, I will make just a few additional comments regarding revenues dur",944,"Thank you, Giovanni. Good morning, everyone. I will discuss a few items from our fourth quarter non-GAAP P&L and our outlook for 2015. 
As Giovanni covered some of the highlights on sales, I will make just a few additional comments regarding revenues during the quarter. First, Eliquis sales were reduced by approximately $15 million in gross-to-net adjustments for the Medicare coverage gap. SUSTIVA benefited from a $30 million annual equity share true-up related to ATRIPLA. And finally, our net revenues for Plavix and Avapro/Avalide, which are captured under mature products, benefited from a $36 million reduction in our returns reserve. 
With the dollar strengthening, foreign exchange had an unfavorable impact on both the top and bottom line. Compared to the same quarter last year, the negative impact was 3% on sales and approximately $0.03 on EPS. 
Gross margin was 78% during the quarter, up 440 basis points compared to the same period last year, mostly due to product mix following the divestiture of our global diabetes business. Marketing, selling and admin expenses increased about 9% in the quarter due, in part, to increased investments in key brands, including Eliquis, Yervoy, Opdivo and our HCV franchise. R&D expenses increased primarily due to timing of spending across our R&D portfolio. 
Our non-GAAP tax rate was 10% during the quarter compared to almost 18% during the same period last year. Our Q4 rate reflects a full year of the R&D tax credit, which was just extended in December. 
Now I'd like to spend a few moments discussing capital allocation. We will continue our balanced approach to using our capital. We feel good about the strength of our balance sheet and the flexibilities these resources give us to make important investment decisions. We continue to see business development as a top priority and also remain committed to the dividend, which was recently increased for the sixth year in a row. 
In regard to business development, we believe that innovation must be sourced both internally and externally. We continue to look for BD opportunities that can help deliver long-term growth within our core areas of interest. We are committed to fully advancing our leading immuno-oncology portfolio. Our clinical collaboration strategy reflects our belief that combination therapy will be a key component of I-O in the future and that we are open to exploring external I-O opportunities. 
Since the end of Q3, we have announced 4 additional medical collaborations, including Opdivo. Overall, we are -- we have 9 clinical collaborations to study Opdivo in more than a dozen tumor types. In addition to these I-O collaborations, we also signed several deals that will strengthen our specialty portfolio. We will continue to develop and diversify our R&D and commercial portfolios, focusing on high-quality opportunities that are closely aligned with our diversified specialty BioPharma strategy. 
I will now move to 2015 guidance. We are setting our non-GAAP EPS guidance range at $1.55 to $1.70. This range assumes current exchange rates and continuation of the R&D tax credit in 2015. As a reminder, there are several factors to keep in mind, which will have an impact on our 2015 revenues. Our rights to Abilify in the U.S. and most remaining international markets expire in April. Abilify is a high-margin product as we record our share of revenues without any meaningful associated costs. We will see a full year's impact on BARACLUDE sales in the U.S. due to the loss of exclusivity last year. As we previously mentioned, we expect a negative impact on EPS of roughly $0.10 in 2015. 
As I commented during our October earnings call, revenues from mature products and other non-core assets will decline significantly this year due to a onetime step-down of about $400 million related to expiring agreements. In addition, I remind you that this is a declining business. 
As you all know, the U.S. dollar has strengthened against almost all currencies from 2014 average rates and quite a bit just in January. Based on current FX rates, this will negatively impact our 2015 revenues by approximately $800 million and $0.12 to $0.14 on earnings per share. 
On the other hand, we expect continued growth in 2015 from the rest of our portfolio where we are seeing strong exit trends that we believe will continue. We are also very encouraged by the accelerated approval of Opdivo to treat advanced melanoma in the U.S. and hope to receive approvals in other countries and other tumors in 2015. 
We expect our full year gross margin to be approximately 74% in 2015. Our gross margin continues to be largely driven by product mix, loss of exclusivity and the structure of our co-promotion agreement for Eliquis. We expect these downward pressures to be partially offset by the growth of new products, including Opdivo and our HCV portfolio. 
You will see our line item guidance for A&P, MS&A and R&D in our press release. Our operating expense projections reflect our new operating model, following the divestiture of our global Diabetes Alliance early last year. We remain committed to investing in key opportunities, including our late-stage pipeline and the launch of Opdivo in the U.S. in advanced melanoma and potential subsequent launches in other regions and indications. We also continue to drive growth of our priority brands, including Yervoy, Eliquis, ORENCIA and SPRYCEL. We will, however, continue to be prudent with our resources on our older brands and leverage our specialty model. Our operating expenses outside the U.S. will also be affected by prevailing exchange rates. On the R&D side, we expect to spend less in 2015, primarily due to decreased spending on diabetes clinical trials. 
Now we'd be happy to address your questions."

And we believe this combination does have the potential to provide incremental benefit across the broad lung cancer population. And as far as the earlier studies in other -- the other 4 compounds we have in development, what I would say is they are progressing, those exploratory studies. We will be seeing data this year. We've not decided yet whether we will actually share that data publicly because of the intense competitive situation. But obviously, like we have during last year, if we see interesting data, we would be moving fast to potentially registrational studies, and of course, you'll be able to see that in clinical trials.

And while I'm really glad to see the potential of immunotherapy coming to fruition, first with Yervoy and now with Opdivo, some are the strategic choices that we made when we shaped our development program are putting us now in what we believe is a very strong competitive position. We have always felt that it was important to address the broader set of patients as possible. We have also always believed in the importance of demonstrating overall survival and this is what counts for patients, physicians and payers. And at the same time, we have built -- our R&D people have built optionality into our clinical trials. So while the trials were designed to show survival, overall survival, we have flexibility in evaluating other endpoints when they can accelerate the program. And finally, we have also always believed in the important role for both monotherapy and combination regimens. I said all these because I believe that the recent results of our studies are validating our strategy. And now, Francis, do you want to answer the question of 056 -- of 057 and [indiscernible]?"

As far as 057 is concerned, as you are aware, this is an event-driven study, which means that the patients -- the interim study will be triggered once we've reached the right number of events. It's also a different population to the squamous population in the sense that there are more therapeutic options for these patients and they tend to do better with chemotherapy. So that's running behind -- that's why that's running behind the 017 study. We obviously remain very confident about our trial design and the potential for Opdivo in lung cancer.

Thank you for your comments. With respect to the PBMs and fighting and access in general, first of all, let me say that we've been operating in an environment with headwinds from a pricing and reimbursement perspective for quite some time. We understand that will continue, including the U.S. A good example for us is Yervoy where, over the last few years, we were able to work with payers around the world very proactively and effectively, and Yervoy today is really reimbursed in every market around the world according to label, and access for patients has not been an issue. So when we think about this issue going forward, obviously, the first starting point is to have truly differentiating data and product profiles and that's one of the reasons why, for example, as Lamberto mentioned, we are focused on overall survival as an endpoint for our trials. The second one really is working collaboratively with payers around the world. We have a very strong history of having done that in the past, and we continue to look at that as a priority for us. The third one is we price our products based on the value they offer to patients and the health care system. And as importantly, we have in the U.S. and other parts of the world one of the most comprehensive and most effective reimbursement and patient support program in oncology and in the industry. So we are very focused on pricing and access. We are investing in this area, and we are going to be proactively addressing every one of the area I mentioned."

As you know, we have 10 ongoing studies. We have an 11th just about to start; that's the first-line combination study. And it's basically all populations, all histology, all lines of therapy in both PD-L1 positive and negative. So it's a very comprehensive study, and I think it's important to note that we have actually made significant progress over the last year. I think I told you all a year ago it's going to a big year for data for Opdivo and we would know a lot more about Opdivo at the end of the year, and I think we've shown that, particularly the last few weeks, which have been very exciting. So we completed the rolling submission for the third-line study in the United States. And just to remind you, we did make a submission, having validated in Europe around the middle of the year. As you've heard on the call a couple of weeks ago, we announced that the squamous study had been stopped because Opdivo was superior in terms of overall survival. And overall survival, we believe, is the gold standard in cancer and a very important attribute, we believe, of bio agents such as Opdivo. And of course, this marks the first time that any PD-1 has shown overall survival in cancer. It's not the first time we've shown superiority. We, of course, showed it earlier last year in melanoma as well. And as I just noted before, we are moving forward with the events proceeding in the non-squamous population and we would --we should, if our projections are right, get to that by the middle of the year. We also have a first-line study underway. That started about a year ago. It is in PD-L1 positive patients, and it's our intent to go to beat chemotherapy doublets in first line, as we have already done in melanoma and in second-line squamous. And just to -- just to round it out, I did mention again, we will be starting a comprehensive study in first line with our combination in this half of the year. So a very broad program. I'm confident by the end of this next 12 months, we are going to have a approval in lung and that we will have increasing submissions around the world. Thank you very much."

So with respect to launches and expectations for uptake, let me maybe start by saying we're really excited about the approval we have received at the end of December in advanced melanoma for Opdivo. And we started working on the launch and executing the launch immediately after the approval. By year-end, we already had shipments in the market and our teams were actively promoting. And while it clearly is early, we are very pleased that we have already reached about 100% of our most important targets, and we have a very high 70% market -- share of voice in melanoma. That reflects the fact that we have been successfully commercializing Yervoy over the last few years, and we've gained a lot of experience in immuno-oncology and in the U.S. market in particular. So as we think about the future, obviously, we are ready for potential future launches later this year in lung in the U.S., but we are also ready for launches in melanoma and lung in Europe as another key market. And we've made a lot of the investments needed in order to make sure that our teams were properly staffed and ready to go. And obviously, we will follow a very similar strategy of educating physicians on Opdivo immunotherapy and the strength of our data. I think it's important to remember that there is a significant percentage of the lung-prescribing community, which is different from the melanoma-prescribing community, and as a result of that, those physicians are probably at the beginning of their learning curve with respect to immuno-oncology. And I think it will be important for us to do the same education we did 4 years ago when we launched in melanoma. When you put all of those things together, we're very optimistic about the future, but we, obviously, realized that there is significant variability in 2015 because of timing of potential launches, the evolution of the label and the speed of uptake in different tumor types."

And then my second question, following up on the earlier one on the expense side. Just wondering if you can maybe help break up some of these moving parts here. You mentioned the diabetes impact this year, also on [indiscernible] currency having an impact this year and then some of those might be more broader structural changes that might be more ongoing impacts we see in the expense line. So is there any way to just sort of quantify that the expense numbers are quite a bit below what you're expecting? So how much of it is more of these onetime-type things for this year and how much might more of an impact going forward?"

As I mentioned in my comments, we are doing everything to invest in our opportunity in our new launches as well as the critical brands within our key portfolio, but we've also, with the -- following the exit of the diabetes business, we also took the opportunity to reorganize and take expenses out, particularly in our mature brands.

So we have the really strong base there. I would say that we expect the melanoma market to be evolving rapidly over the last -- next 12 to 24 months. And obviously, as a result of that, like I mentioned earlier, we see some uncertainty and volatility in the short term, but we actually feel very good, very well about our prospects in melanoma because we have 2 agents, which, in monotherapy, both have demonstrated survival. And we have a combination strategy, which really has the potential to provide long-term survival to a very significant percentage of patients.

Let me begin by thanking Lamberto for his kind words of support and for his years of leadership.

Let me begin by thanking Lamberto for his kind words of support and for his years of leadership. I, too, am glad that we will continue working together.
So as Lamberto noted, we just finished a very good quarter. Performance across the organization was strong, and we had some very important clinical and regulatory advances in our immuno-oncology portfolio. During the first quarter, we delivered 6% sales growth. Excluding the impact from our diabetes divestiture, we delivered a 10% increase over the first quarter last year. This was due to solid double-digit growth across our new and inline brands. Here are some highlights: First, regarding Eliquis. We continue to see strong performance. We had $355 million in global sales in the first 3 months of the year with good growth in both cardiology and primary care. This is more than double the first quarter of last year. Along with our alliance partner, Pfizer, we continue to focus on our goal of establishing Eliquis as the leading oral anticoagulant within its approved indications. In the U.S., Eliquis is now the #1 anticoagulant in new-to-brand prescriptions among cardiologists and the #1 anticoagulant across all physicians for atrial fibrillation. In addition to progress in atrial fibrillation, the label expansion into VTE has helped our performance overall. Internationally, our business was very strong. In Europe, Eliquis trends across most markets remain very positive. And we are also doing well in Japan, where Eliquis is the #1 anticoagulant in new-to-brand prescriptions across all prescribers.
Regarding hepatitis C, global sales were strong at $264 million, primarily driven by the performance of our Daklinza+Sunvepra combination regimen in Japan. In Europe, we have launched in several markets, and commercial execution has been good despite increased competition. In the U.S., we completed our resubmission of Daklinza to the FDA February for genotype 3 patients, and we have a PDUFA date in Q3.
We also have presented interesting data on the combination of Daklinza with Sovaldi in HIV co-infected patients as well as more recently in posttransplant patients.
Moving to immuno-oncology. We had a very good quarter, commercial as well as in R&D. Let me first talk about Yervoy. Yervoy continues to do well with 2 of our net sales for the quarter of $325 million, a 20% increase over the same period last year. We had strong performance across all geographies. In the U.S., we saw growth in the community setting. While internationally, growth was driven by first line. As we continue to advance our immuno-oncology portfolio, Yervoy certainly remains an important treatment option for patients. However, as we have mentioned before, the introduction of new immuno-oncology agents such as Opdivo in melanoma will likely create some variability in Yervoy sales. We're also looking at Yervoy in earlier stages of melanoma. We recently announced the filing of study -029 in which Yervoy showed a benefit in adjuvant treatment with patients with Stage 3 melanoma who are at high risk of recurrence. And we just presented data from Study -069 at the AACR Conference, which showed encouraging data of the combination of Yervoy+Opdivo. We believe that this regimen have the potential to further transform the treatment of melanoma, and we are anticipating a submission to the FDA by midyear.
Regarding Opdivo, as Lamberto mentioned, the last few months have been very exciting for all of us at BMS, but most importantly, for patients across multiple tumors. In addition to the early U.S. approval in melanoma late last year and the early approval in second-line squamous lung cancer in early March, we recently announced the early stoppage of study -057, the Phase III study of Opdivo in second-line, non-squamous lung cancer. Opdivo has once again demonstrated a survival advantage over the standard of care in advanced lung cancer, and we will be providing this data through health authorities as quickly as possible. With the early approval in lung cancer, we have the first PD-1 to market in this area of high unmet need. Our commercial organization was ready, and we were able to start treating patients within 48 hours. It has been very encouraging to see that we have nearly 100% access for Opdivo in the approved indications. And we are seeing an acceleration of usage in both the academic and community setting.
In addition to the U.S. approvals, just last week, the European Medicines Agency adopted a positive opinion recommending that Opdivo be granted approval for use in patients with metastatic melanoma. This is the first positive opinion from the CHMP for a PD-1 therapy and will now be reviewed by the European commission, which typically renders a decision within 60 days. And we are hopeful that we could be approved in lung cancer in the EU by the end of the year. There is more to come with our immuno-oncology portfolio.
ASCO will be an important meeting for us. We will be presenting 2 Phase III overall survival studies in lung cancer. Study 017, and we are excited to say, we were able to secure a spot for Study 572. In addition to new data in lung cancer, we're looking forward to presenting new data in melanoma, more mature data from ongoing reno studies and new data in new tumor types, such as hepatocellular carcinoma, small cell lung cancer and glioblastoma. We will also be presenting the results for the elotuzumab Phase III study in relapsed refractory multiple myeloma. And we expect to continue to have important data readouts over the next 12 to 18 months in several tumor types.
So taken together, we are very pleased with our first quarter results, strong commercial performance, important clinical, regulatory and business development advances. These balanced approach driving results today, while laying the foundation for tomorrow, continues to serve as well.
And with that, I will turn the floor over to Charlie, who can provide more specifics around our Q1 results."

In addition, SPRYCEL and ORENCIA both had a good quarter, each up 10% compared to Q1 last year. Sales of Opdivo were $40 million for the quarter, which included some inventory stocking. Overall, while early, we're seeing encouraging trends.
With ABILIFY, our U.S. sales in Q1 were higher than prior quarters due to the way revenues are shared in our agreement with Otsuka. The formula is based on a tiered structure. And as our right to ABILIFY in the U.S. expired in April, all of the U.S. revenues we recorded this year are at the 50% tier as compared with the blended annual rate of 33% for all of last year.
You may have seen that we recently agreed to transfer our North American Erbitux rightns to Lilly. We will continue to commercialize Erbitux and book sales until the transition to Lilly, which we expect will be completed in the fourth quarter. After the transition, Lilly will pay us royalties on net sales, which will be accounted for as other income. The transaction is not expected to have a significant impact on our non-GAAP earnings.
Gross margin was 80% during the quarter, up 410 basis points compared to the same period last year. The favorability was mostly due to the FX impact on international inventory sold. If rates remain constant, we expect this favorability in gross margin to normalize. Gross margin was also impacted by a onetime benefit from a restructured royalty agreement.
ANP and MSNA were both down versus prior year due in part to FX and lower spending on diabetes and ABILIFY. This was partially offset by increased investments in key brands, including Eliquis, Yervoy, Opdivo and our hep C franchise.
R&D expenses were down about 5% primarily due to timing of R&D spend and FX. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 21% during the quarter, which does not include the R&D tax credit, as it's not been extended yet to 2015. This was an active quarter for business development as we continually look for opportunities that can help deliver long-term growth within our core areas of interests. Within I-O, we recently added 2 new programs that expand our portfolio with the acquisition of the IPO in PDO program from Flexus and the [indiscernible] the TGF-beta program from Rigel. With these programs, we had compounds that address the tumor microenvironment, which we think can act synergistically with our I-O assets in multiple tumor types.
We're also expanding our specialty portfolio through business development. Our recent agreement with uniQure brings out exclusive access to uniQure gene therapy technology platform for multiple targets and cardiovascular diseases, including a program for congestive heart failure. The agreement also allows us to collaborate in other therapeutic areas.
Moving to guidance. We are adjusting our non-GAAP EPS guidance range to $1.60 to $1.70. This range assumes current foreign exchange rates and continuation of the R&D tax credit in 2015. When studying guidance in January, we expected a negative impact of $0.12 to $0.14 on full year EPS due to FX rates at that time. Our updated guidance range incorporates an additional $0.02 negative impact based on current FX rates.
While we are not changing line item guidance, in thinking about operating expenses for the remainder of the year, we are very enthusiastic about our position in I-O and are committed to maximizing our opportunity. And as you might expect, we are continuously evaluating new investment opportunities. And we have identified several, both commercially and within R&D, that are now in process of being reviewed. Now, we will be happy to address your questions."

And maybe just compare and contrast the PD-L1 biomarker and its relevance to response rate versus overall survival. And then the last question.

As you've heard for our company for R&D and important for patients. I must say, I'm particularly gratified that the many strategic choices we made 2 to 3 years ago that shaped our development program are now coming to fruition. For our initial tumors, we focused on lung as well as the traditional immunological tumors, melanoma and renal cell, and we initiated broad programs in these 2 and characterize the benefit in terms of overall survival in Phase III studies going head to head with chemotherapy with the standard of care. We built optionality into our trials. We accelerated the results and we moved quickly to explore the combination therapy. Now the recent positive data from the studies in lung and melanoma, including combination therapy, together with the early U.S. approval in melanoma late last year, the rapid approval in lung cancer and advanced squamous lung cell small cell lung cancer in early March. And last week, the positive opinion in the Euro for Opdivo with a broad label in melanoma, really, I believe, puts us in a very strong, competitive position. So moving to your question on -057. We're very excited about the data, which you heard will be presented at ASCO. I can't comment specifically on the submission. There are a number of steps we need to take to complete the analysis for the submission, and we're working as quickly as possible to share these data, of course, with the regulators around the world. But as we've shown recently, we are confident we'll work together and as quickly as possible with the FDA and other health authorities to broaden our label and to bring Opdivo to non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer patients as soon as it's practical. Now moving to your PD-L1 biomarker question, I want to remind you that from the beginning, our strategy has been to characterize the PD-L1 expression in a broad population as possible so that as many patients as possible can benefit from I-O therapy. Now our scientific goal has been twofold, to learn about the relationship between PD-L1 expression and clinical outcomes. Importantly, as you said, or you asked, overall survival as well as objective response and also to understand the science underlying PD-L1 expression in tumors and how it's affected by various factors, including Yervoy and Opdivo. I think you'll have to wait until ASCO to hear more specific information about the relationship between objective response and overall survival. But I will say, we're very excited about the fact that we're the only company that really has been able to show that relationship because as well as the total population, we have done some analyses looking at PD-L1 positive and negative in both squamous in both studies in second-line squamous and non-squamous. So I just wanted to -- let me finish by saying, we continue to design studies including all patients, regardless of PD-L1 status. And we will follow the science and the clinical data that we generate regarding the use of this biomarker. I think it's important -- my final point, to say we have developed a high-quality validated diagnostic test with data, which will be quickly available, should we need it either for approval or labeling. Thank you."

Let me answer the Opdivo question first and then I will go to Eliquis. With respect Opdivo, we mentioned earlier, we were approved in lung cancer, squamous second-line lung cancer the beginning of March. We have obviously ensured that despite the very rapid regulatory review that our teams were fully resourced and ready to launch. We were ready to launch right away. We actually started treating patients within 48 hours. I think what has happened since launch is very encouraging and reinforces our belief in the potential of Opdivo in lung cancer. We've seen, at this point, virtually 100% access with no barriers within the approved indications by any payers. We've seen a lot of interest in our data. And we are seeing a rapid increase in penetration in both the academic institutions and the community. One of the things that we look at is as a leading indicator performance is really how our trial has grown. And we are seeing week over week really good trend in terms of trialists. With respect to our performance, I would also say we are really looking at what we call the dynamic segment in terms of new patients coming on therapy. And we are very pleased that we are actually at this point at approximately a 50% share in value of the PD-1 marker right now. To your question regarding usage beyond the label, all I can say, obviously, is we are promoting within our 2 label approved indications. And we have seen that approximately 75% of claims are really in label with respect to the totality of our business at this point. So what we are seeing really reinforces our belief that the data is very strong. There's a lot of interest in it. And obviously, we think that survival data and the ability to promote a Phase III randomized trial with survival data which is clearly a hard endpoint resonates extremely well with providers and payers. And to Eliquis, let me just echo your comments. The performance is very strong. We had a really good quarter. We had a good quarter in the U.S. where we continue to see a growth in both our direct share and our new-to-brand prescription share. We were able to grow both TRx and NBRx volume by approximately 20% in the quarter compared to other brands, which declined during the same period. And we also saw really good performance internationally, with Japan, Germany and all key markets in Europe. Eliquis is a very important asset for us. It is growing to be a really important product. And obviously, as you know, cardiovascular is one of our priority areas. We have a number of early programs in cardiovascular disease. We actually, as Charlie mentioned, signed an agreement with uniQure, which is a potential target in heart failure. So Eliquis is one product that we are committed to the area."

Obviously, the data we presented at AACR was very positive in terms of the high response rate. And I believe it was really exciting, it's not only the response rate of the range of 60%, but also that over 20% of patients have a complete response. So we continue to believe that the use of the combination of Yervoy and Opdivo can really transform melanoma because obviously is the difference we are seeing in terms of the response rate translates into the potential for survival for a significant number of patients in a disease that progresses very rapidly. The other point that I would like to make is that we are reassured by the fact that physicians are able to manage the side effect profile of Yervoy in over 80% of cases with the treatment algorithms that we've used since launch of Yervoy. And they're a significant percentage of even those patients that may stop therapy early. Almost 70% actually see responses. So we think there's a lot of value in the regimen. And obviously, as we get ready to present some data from the Phase III Study 067 in ASCO. We are very focused on that. From the perspective of price, I think that our experience is that payers and providers are very interested in data that demonstrate significant incremental value for patients. That really was our experience with Yervoy from the very beginning. And obviously, we believe it continues to be what makes a difference there. It's important to remember that, obviously, the induction phase with Yervoy is something that physicians are very familiar with. And obviously, the maintenance phase with Opdivo beyond the first 12 weeks is really something that is only happening for patients that have responders. And as you know, there is a very high value in terms of potential survival in the long term to our response that payers traditionally have been very receptive to."

Specifically, around the Flexus asset, we now have a chance to look at the data following the successful completion of patients of the HSR process. We're very happy with what we've seen. I'm not going to go into the specifics of the moment about what differentiates it, but it's a very -- it's an exciting lead compound, but also represents a program in IDO and behind-it programs in IDO and TPO. All of which, together with some other areas in the tumor microenvironment, we think, is going to be very important. As far as timing, we're moving well towards serving the data we need for an IND, and we are hoping to be in the clinic at the end of the year or the beginning of next year. Let me just finish by talking generally about the combination, to reinforce what Giovanni said.

First of all, there is really some wrong momentum for Eliquis in the market. We are seeing very significant growth in TRxs and NBRx us. And obviously, we've established a leadership position in new-to-brand shares across all indications in cardiology and in atrial fibrillation across the total market. That's important in negotiating with payers. The second point that I would say is we are in a very strong position from access perspective. We have over 90% access in both the commercial and Medicare space. On the commercial space, our preferred status is approaching 70%. And in Medicare, it's about [ph] 80%. So while the category will continue to be managed, and obviously, we are very focused on it, the fact that we are emerging as the leading agent in terms of the overall momentum positions us strongly with payers. With respect to the use of Opdivo and how the update is going in the community versus the academic institutions, obviously, that's very different in melanoma versus lung. Because as you know, about 50% of melanoma is treated in the hospital and academic setting and only 50% in the community. When you look at lung, that's very different, with over 80% of patients treated in the community. So while at the beginning, it is logical that the uptake is passed in the academic and hospital setting, we are actually seeing with Opdivo already a very significant increase of uptake in community, which is clearly very important. And it makes us feel optimistic about the overall opportunity for Opdivo in the community setting."

But we do think underlying this is an opportunity with combination of Opdivo and Yervoy to treat more patients. Clearly, looking at lung cancer population, we understand that it's a different population and we think in lung -- non-small cell lung cancer there may be slightly different tolerability. That being said, we've learned a lot from the ongoing combination studies together with the second-line studies.

But before they do it, I just want to say, again, that I feel very good about what we have done to transform Bristol-Myers Squibb into a diversified specialty biopharma company. And I also feel very good that Giovanni will be my successor as CEO. He's a trained physician, a global business leader with broad industry experience and a senior BMS executive who has been instrumental in driving the execution of our strategy over the past several years. There is no question that Giovanni is the right person at the right time, and will bring to the position the right mix of experience, passion, vision and energy.
And lastly, I am looking forward to my new role as Chairman of the Board. Again, it's a bittersweet transition in that I will miss working alongside Jim Cornelius, who has played a transformative role at BMS for the past several years, but I am glad that I will be able to continue to work with the board and Giovanni and his leadership team.
And with that, I will turn the floor over to Giovanni and Charlie. Thank you."

Let me begin by thanking Lamberto for his kind words of support and for his years of leadership. I, too, am glad that we will continue working together.So as Lamberto noted, we just finished a very good q",990,"Thank you, Lamberto, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin by thanking Lamberto for his kind words of support and for his years of leadership. I, too, am glad that we will continue working together.
So as Lamberto noted, we just finished a very good quarter. Performance across the organization was strong, and we had some very important clinical and regulatory advances in our immuno-oncology portfolio. During the first quarter, we delivered 6% sales growth. Excluding the impact from our diabetes divestiture, we delivered a 10% increase over the first quarter last year. This was due to solid double-digit growth across our new and inline brands. Here are some highlights: First, regarding Eliquis. We continue to see strong performance. We had $355 million in global sales in the first 3 months of the year with good growth in both cardiology and primary care. This is more than double the first quarter of last year. Along with our alliance partner, Pfizer, we continue to focus on our goal of establishing Eliquis as the leading oral anticoagulant within its approved indications. In the U.S., Eliquis is now the #1 anticoagulant in new-to-brand prescriptions among cardiologists and the #1 anticoagulant across all physicians for atrial fibrillation. In addition to progress in atrial fibrillation, the label expansion into VTE has helped our performance overall. Internationally, our business was very strong. In Europe, Eliquis trends across most markets remain very positive. And we are also doing well in Japan, where Eliquis is the #1 anticoagulant in new-to-brand prescriptions across all prescribers.
Regarding hepatitis C, global sales were strong at $264 million, primarily driven by the performance of our Daklinza+Sunvepra combination regimen in Japan. In Europe, we have launched in several markets, and commercial execution has been good despite increased competition. In the U.S., we completed our resubmission of Daklinza to the FDA in February for genotype 3 patients, and we have a PDUFA date in Q3.
We also have presented interesting data on the combination of Daklinza with Sovaldi in HIV co-infected patients as well as more recently in cirrhotic and post-transplant patients.
Moving to immuno-oncology. We had a very good quarter, commercially as well as in R&D. Let me first talk about Yervoy. Yervoy continues to do well with global net sales for the quarter of $325 million, a 20% increase over the same period last year. We had strong performance across all geographies. In the U.S., we saw growth in the community setting, while internationally, growth was driven by first line. As we continue to advance our immuno-oncology portfolio, Yervoy certainly remains an important treatment option for patients. However, as we have mentioned before, the introduction of new immuno-oncology agents such as Opdivo in melanoma will likely create some variability in Yervoy sales. We are also looking at Yervoy in earlier stages of melanoma. We recently announced the filing of Study -029 in which Yervoy showed a benefit in adjuvant treatment for patients with Stage 3 melanoma who are at high risk of recurrence. And we just presented data from Study -069 at the AACR Conference, which showed encouraging data of the combination of Yervoy+Opdivo. We believe that this regimen has the potential to further transform the treatment of melanoma, and we are anticipating a submission to the FDA by midyear.
Regarding Opdivo, as Lamberto mentioned, the last few months have been very exciting for all of us at BMS, but most importantly, for patients across multiple tumors. In addition to the early U.S. approval in melanoma late last year and the early approval in second-line squamous lung cancer in early March, we recently announced the early stoppage of Study -057, the Phase III study of Opdivo in second-line, non-squamous lung cancer. Opdivo has once again demonstrated a survival advantage over the standard of care in advanced lung cancer, and we will be providing this data to health authorities as quickly as possible. With the early approval in lung cancer, we have the first PD-1 to market in this area of high unmet need. Our commercial organization was ready, and we were able to start treating patients within 48 hours. It has been very encouraging to see that we have nearly 100% access for Opdivo in the approved indications. And we are seeing an acceleration of usage in both the academic and community setting.
In addition to the U.S. approvals, just last week, the European Medicines Agency adopted a positive opinion recommending that Opdivo be granted approval for use in patients with metastatic melanoma. This is the first positive opinion from the CHMP for a PD-1 therapy and will now be reviewed by the European commission, which typically renders a decision within 60 days. And we are hopeful that we could be approved in lung cancer in the EU by the end of the year. There is more to come with our immuno-oncology portfolio.
ASCO will be an important meeting for us. We will be presenting 2 Phase III overall survival studies in lung cancer. Study 017 and we are excited to say, we were able to secure a spot for Study 57 2. In addition to new data on lung cancer, we are looking forward to presenting new data in melanoma, more mature data from ongoing renal studies and data in new tumor types, such as hepatocellular carcinoma, small cell lung cancer and glioblastoma. We will also be presenting the results for the elotuzumab Phase III study in relapsed refractory multiple myeloma. And we expect to continue to have important data readouts over the next 12 to 18 months in several tumor types.
So taken together, we are very pleased with our first quarter results, strong commercial performance, important clinical, regulatory and business development advances. This balanced approach driving results today, while laying the foundation for tomorrow, continues to serve as well.
And with that, I will turn the floor over to Charlie, who can provide more specifics around our Q1 results."

Good morning, everyone. As Lamberto and Giovanni mentioned, we had a very good quarter, which was driven by strong sales growth of 6% or 13% excluding the impact of foreign exchange.

As Lamberto and Giovanni mentioned, we had a very good quarter, which was driven by strong sales growth of 6% or 13% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Overall, FX had a slightly negative impact on EPS of about $0.01. Despite headwind from FX, we had a strong sales performance from our key growth drivers, including Eliquis, Yervoy and hep C. In addition, SPRYCEL and ORENCIA both had a good quarter, each up 10% compared to Q1 last year. Sales of Opdivo were $40 million for the quarter, which included some inventory stocking. Overall, while early, we are seeing encouraging trends.
With ABILIFY, our U.S. sales in Q1 were higher than prior quarters due to the way revenues are shared in our agreement with Otsuka. The formula is based on a tiered structure. And as our right to ABILIFY in the U.S. expired in April, all of the U.S. revenues we recorded this year are at the 50% tier as compared with the blended annual rate of 33% for all of last year.
You may have seen that we recently agreed to transfer our North American Erbitux rights to Lilly. We will continue to commercialize Erbitux and book sales until the transition to Lilly, which we expect will be completed in the fourth quarter. After the transition, Lilly will pay us royalties on net sales, which will be accounted for as other income. The transaction is not expected to have a significant impact on our non-GAAP earnings.
Gross margin was 80% during the quarter, up 410 basis points compared to the same period last year. The favorability was mostly due to the FX impact on international inventory sold. If rates remain constant, we expect this favorability in gross margin to normalize. Gross margin was also impacted by a onetime benefit from a restructured royalty agreement.
ANP and MSNA were both down versus prior year due in part to FX and lower spending on diabetes and ABILIFY. This was partially offset by increased investments in key brands, including Eliquis, Yervoy, Opdivo and our hep C franchise.
R&D expenses were down about 5% primarily due to timing of R&D spend and FX. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 21% during the quarter, which does not include the R&D tax credit, as it's not been extended yet in 2015. This was an active quarter for business development as we continually look for opportunities that can help deliver long-term growth within our core areas of interest. Within I-O, we recently added 2 new programs that expand our portfolio with the acquisition of the IDO and TDO program from Flexus and the inlicense of the TGF beta program from Rigel. With these programs, we add compounds that address the tumor microenvironment, which we think can act synergistically with our I-O assets in multiple tumor types.
We are also expanding our specialty portfolio through business development. Our recent agreement with uniQure brings out exclusive access to uniQure's gene therapy technology platform for multiple targets and cardiovascular diseases, including a program for congestive heart failure. The agreement also allows us to collaborate in other therapeutic areas.
Moving to guidance. We are adjusting our non-GAAP EPS guidance range to $1.60 to $1.70. This range assumes current foreign exchange rates and continuation of the R&D tax credit in 2015. When studying guidance in January, we expected a negative impact of $0.12 to $0.14 on full year EPS due to FX rates at that time. Our updated guidance range incorporates an additional $0.02 negative impact based on current FX rates.
While we are not changing line item guidance, in thinking about operating expenses for the remainder of the year, we are very enthusiastic about our position in I-O and are committed to maximizing our opportunity. And as you might expect, we are continuously evaluating new investment opportunities. And we have identified several, both commercially and within R&D, that are in the process of being reviewed. Now, we will be happy to address your questions."

And maybe just compare and contrast the PD-L1 biomarker and its relevance to response rate versus overall survival. And then the last question, Charlie, you had a very interesting comment there about BD and potential, additional commercial opportunities.

As you've heard for our company for R&D and importantly for patients. I must say, I am particularly gratified that the many strategic choices we made 2 to 3 years ago that shaped our development program are now coming to fruition. For our initial tumors, we focused on lung as well as the traditional immunological tumors, melanoma and renal cell, and we initiated broad programs in these tumors and characterized the benefit in terms of overall survival in Phase III studies, going head to head with chemotherapy when it's standard of care. We built optionality into our trials. We accelerate the results and we moved quickly to explore the combination therapy. Now the recent positive data from these studies in lung and melanoma, including combination therapy, together with the early U.S. approval in melanoma late last year, the rapid approval in lung cancer and advanced squamous non-small cell lung cancer in early March. And last week, the positive opinion in the EU for Opdivo with a broad label in melanoma, really, I believe, puts us in a very strong competitive position. So moving to your question on -057. We are very excited about the data, which you've heard will be presented at ASCO. I can't comment specifically on the submission. There are a number of steps we need to take to complete the analysis for the submission, and we're working as quickly as possible to share these data, of course, with the regulators around the world. But as we've shown recently, we are confident we'll work together and as quickly as possible with the FDA and other health authorities to broaden our label and to bring Opdivo to non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer patients as soon as it's practical. Now moving to your PD-L1 biomarker question, I want to remind you that from the beginning, our strategy has been to characterize the PD-L1 expression in a broad population as possible, so that as many patients as possible can benefit from I-O therapy. Now our scientific goals have been twofold: To learn about the relationship between PD-L1 expression and clinical outcomes. Importantly, as you said, or you asked, overall survival as well as objective response; and also to understand the science underlying PD-L1 expression in tumors and how it's affected by various factors, including Yervoy and Opdivo. I think you'll have to wait until ASCO to hear more specific information about the relationship between objective response and overall survival. But I will say, we are very excited about the fact that we're the only company that really has been able to show that relationship, because as well as the total population, we have done some analyses looking at PD-L1 positive and negative in both squamous, in both studies in second-line squamous and non-squamous. So I just wanted to -- let me finish by saying, we continue to design studies to include all patients, regardless of PD-L1 status. And we will follow the science and the clinical data that we generate regarding the use of this biomarker. I think it's important -- my final point, to say we have developed a high-quality validated diagnostic test with data, which will be quickly available, should we need it either for approval or labeling. Thank you."

Let me answer the Opdivo question first, and I will go to Eliquis. With respect to Opdivo, as we mentioned earlier, we were approved in lung cancer, squamous second-line lung cancer at the beginning of March. We had obviously ensured that despite the very rapid regulatory review that our teams were fully resourced and ready to launch. We were ready to launch right away. We actually started treating patients within 48 hours. I think what has happened since launch is very encouraging and reinforces our belief in the potential of Opdivo in lung cancer. We've seen, at this point, virtually 100% access with no barriers within approved indications by any payers. We've seen a lot of interest in our data. And we are seeing a rapid increase in penetration in both the academic institutions and the community. One of the things that we look at is, as a leading indicator of performance, is really how our trial has grown. And we are seeing week over week, a really good trend in terms of trialists. With respect to our performance, I would also say we are really looking at what we call the dynamic segment, in terms of new patients coming on therapy. And we're very pleased that we are actually, at this point, at approximately a 50% share in value of the PD-1 market right now. To your question regarding usage beyond the label, all I can say, obviously, is we are promoting within our 2 labeled and approved indications, and we have seen that approximately 75% of claims are really in label with respect to the totality of our business at this point. So what we are seeing really reinforces our belief that the data is very strong. There is a lot of interest in it. Obviously, we think survival data and the ability to promote a Phase III randomized trial with survival data which is clearly a hard endpoint resonates extremely well with providers and payers. And to Eliquis, let me just echo your comments. The performance is very strong. We had a really good quarter. We had a good quarter in the U.S., where we continue to see growth in both our TRx share and our new-to-brand prescription share. We were able to grow both TRx and NBRx volume by approximately 20% in the quarter compared to other brands, which declined during the same period. And we also saw really good performance internationally, with Japan, Germany and all key markets in Europe. Eliquis is a very important asset for us. It is growing to be a really important product. And obviously, as you know, cardiovascular is one of our priority areas. We have a number of early programs in cardiovascular disease. We actually, as Charlie mentioned, signed an agreement with uniQure, which has a potential target in heart failure. So Eliquis is one product that we are committed to the area."

Obviously, the data we presented at AACR was very positive in terms of the high response rate. And I believe it was really exciting, is not only the response rate in the range of 60%, but also that over 20% of patients have a complete response. So we continue to believe that the use of the combination of Yervoy and Opdivo can really transform melanoma, because obviously the difference we are seeing in terms of the response rate translates into the potential for survival for a significant number of patients in a disease that progresses very rapidly. The other point that I would like to make is that we are reassured by the fact that physicians are able to manage the side effect profile of Yervoy in over 80% of cases with the treatment algorithms that we've used since the launch of Yervoy. And they -- a significant percentage of even those patients that may stop therapy early. Almost 70% actually see responses. So we think there is a lot of value in the regimen. And obviously, as we get ready to present some data from the Phase III Study 067 at ASCO, we are very focused on that. From the perspective of price, I think that our experience is that payers and providers are very interested in data that demonstrates a significant incremental value for patients. That clearly was our experience with Yervoy from the very beginning. And obviously, we believe it continues to be what makes a difference there. It's important to remember that obviously, the induction phase with Yervoy is something that physicians are very familiar with. And obviously, the maintenance phase with Opdivo beyond the first 12 weeks is really something that is only happening for patients that have responders. And as you know, there is a very high value in terms of potential survival in the long term to our response that payers traditionally have been very receptive to."

Specifically, around the Flexus asset, we have now had a chance to look at the data following the successful completion of the HSR process. We're very happy with what we've seen. I'm not going to go into the specifics at the moment about what differentiates it, but it's a very -- it's an exciting lead compound, but also represents a program in IDO and behind-it programs in IDO/TPO. All of which, together with some other areas in the tumor microenvironment, we think, is going to be very important. As far as timing, we're moving well towards serving the data we need for an IND, and we are hoping to be in the clinic at the end of the year or the beginning of next year.

We believe that, first of all, it is very important to have Phase III data, and it is very important to have overall survival data. Oncologists have traditionally, really value the opportunity to look at a couple of Meier curves and understand the survival impact of a new -- the new treatment for patients. And what we are very excited about is not only the fact that we have 2 Phase III trials, obviously, you'll see those at ASCO, in that those are in all comers, but also our ability to characterize the response in PD-L1-positive and PD-L1-negative patients. So our data set is very strong. And clearly, survival is important for both physicians and payers. From a commercial perspective, just to conclude, we are obviously aware that this is a very competitive space. We are making all of the right investments to be competitive. We have invested in our commercial infrastructure in the U.S. early in order to be able and ready to launch. We have leading share of voice in both the melanoma market and the lung market at this point, and we will continue to make the investments that are needed in order to drive very competitive performance from our portfolio."

And based on that, I'm confident we are going to have a very competitive label in second-line non-small cell lung. I'm very impressed by -- about the progress of our comprehensive program in lung cancer. And just to remind you, this has generated strong data in overall survival in second-line lung, both in a broad population and also has sub-analyses for both PD-L1-positive and negative patients, and you'll be seeing that data at ASCO. I think as far as the combination with chemotherapy, we set out to go head to head with chemotherapy. And as I've said, we've shown very impressive data, which you'll have a chance to see. I would remind as well as our approval in the U.S., approval -- we also have an ongoing registration review in Europe for squamous lung cell cancer. And we have a number of collaborations in chemotherapy, where at least, we will be able to get some indication in addition to the I-O combination, which will be starting very soon in chemotherapy. So overall, I'm very confident in our broad program. You'll have a chance to see the second-line studies at ASCO. We certainly have first-line therapy, again, going head-to-head with chemotherapy.

And in theory, the incremental contribution margin of your I-O franchise should be dramatically in excess of the overall company EBIT margin or operating margin today.

How much of the I-O sales will you allow to drop down to the bottom line? I realize -- we all realize you're not going to give specific guidance.

First of all, there is really strong momentum for Eliquis in the market. We are seeing very significant growth in TRxs and NBRxs. And obviously, we've established a leadership position in new-to-brand shares across all indications in cardiology and in atrial fibrillation across the total market. That's important in negotiating with payers. The second point that I would say is we are in a very strong position from an access perspective. We have over 90% access in both the commercial and Medicare space. On the commercial space, our preferred status is approaching 70%. And in Medicare, it's about 80%. So while the category will continue to be managed, and obviously, we are very focused on it, the fact that we are emerging as the leading agent in terms of the overall momentum positions us strongly with payers. With respect to the use of Opdivo, and how the update is going in the community versus the academic institutions, obviously, that's very different in melanoma versus lung. Because as you know, about 50% of melanoma is treated in the hospital and academic setting and only 50% in the community. When you look at lung, that's very different, with over 80% of patients treated in the community. So while at the beginning, it is logical that the uptake is passed in the academic and hospital setting, we are actually seeing, with Opdivo, already a very significant increase of uptake in community, which is clearly very important.

Just thinking about your ongoing lung program with the combination, what are the learnings, in terms of dose modification, scheduling, patient selection or monitoring and treatment? That can put into place that make a more -- a better tolerated regimen within the Phase III lung indication? Second, I wonder, would you could comment on anticipated patent term expansion for Eliquis, how long it will take you until and when you will have confirmation of that? And then finally, for Francis. If there is no difference in response rate between the PD-L1 positive and negative type groups in 017, what would that tell you about your diagnostic?"

So first of all, let me just say, we believe the combinations do have an added effect. We think that's been shown very nicely in melanoma. And I think they have the potential to meaningfully increase the survival expectations for more patients than monotherapy alone. So I think, obviously, one kinds of always extrapolates between tumors, either in terms of efficacy or safety. We've seen differences there. But we do think underlying this is an opportunity with a combination of Opdivo and Yervoy to treat more patients. Clearly, looking at lung cancer population, we understand that it's a different population, and we think in lung -- non-small cell lung cancer, there may be slightly different tolerability. That being said, we've learned a lot from the ongoing combination studies, together with the second-line studies. And so we really think the first-line combination studies that's about to start really does have a good chance of understanding the potential of combination in lung cancer. As far as the 017 study and the assay, let me just say that I think our assay is a good assay. It's validated. It's ready to go in terms of the need for approval or labeling. And you'll have the opportunity to see the data, which is very strong, I think, across 017 and 057 in terms of documenting the different patient populations."

Well, this is my last earnings call as CEO of Bristol-Myers Squibb, and I am pleased that my last full quarter was one of our best. For the past few years, we have evolved and strengthened our company. We have delivered on our strategy, and we have set a solid foundation for our future, building a robust product portfolio, innovative pipeline that positions us well for the future. As a result, Bristol-Myers Squibb is now in a very strong position. And during the last quarter, we had solid performance across much of our portfolio as well as important clinical and regulatory developments. I just want to note how excited we are that Opdivo become the first PD-1 inhibitor approved for lung cancer in the U.S. and that a positive opinion was adopted last week in Europe for melanoma. These were not just important milestones for our company. These are important developments that have potential to improve the lives of thousands of lung cancer patients in the U.S. and melanoma patients in Europe. Giovanni and Charlie will walk you through the highlights of the quarter in just a moment. But before they do it, I just want to say, again, that I feel very good about what we have done to transform Bristol-Myers Squibb into a diversified specialty biopharma company. And I also feel very good that Giovanni will be my successor as CEO. He's a trained physician, a global business leader with broad industry experience and a senior BMS executive who has been instrumental in driving the execution of our strategy over the past several years. There is no question that Giovanni is the right person at the right time, and will bring to the position the right mix of experience, passion, vision and energy.
And lastly, I am looking forward to my new role as Chairman of the Board. Again, it's a bittersweet transition in that I will miss working alongside Jim Cornelius, who has played a transformative role at BMS for the past several years, but I am glad that I will be able to continue to work with the board and Giovanni and his leadership team.
And with that, I will turn the floor over to Giovanni and Charlie. Thank you."

Let me begin by thanking Lamberto for his kind words of support and for his years of leadership. I, too, am glad that we will continue working together.
So as Lamberto noted, we just finished a very good quarter. Performance across the organization was strong, and we had some very important clinical and regulatory advances in our immuno-oncology portfolio. During the first quarter, we delivered 6% sales growth. Excluding the impact from our diabetes divestiture, we delivered a 10% increase over the first quarter last year. This was due to solid double-digit growth across our new and inline brands. Here are some highlights: First, regarding Eliquis. We continue to see strong performance. We had $355 million in global sales in the first 3 months of the year with good growth in both cardiology and primary care. This is more than double the first quarter of last year. Along with our alliance partner, Pfizer, we continue to focus on our goal of establishing Eliquis as the leading oral anticoagulant within its approved indications. In the U.S., Eliquis is now the #1 anticoagulant in new-to-brand prescriptions among cardiologists and the #1 anticoagulant across all physicians for atrial fibrillation. In addition to progress in atrial fibrillation, the label expansion into VTE has helped our performance overall. Internationally, our business was very strong. In Europe, Eliquis trends across most markets remain very positive. And we are also doing well in Japan, where Eliquis is the #1 anticoagulant in new-to-brand prescriptions across all prescribers.
Regarding hepatitis C, global sales were strong at $264 million, primarily driven by the performance of our Daklinza+Sunvepra combination regimen in Japan. In Europe, we have launched in several markets, and commercial execution has been good despite increased competition. In the U.S., we completed our resubmission of Daklinza to the FDA in February for genotype 3 patients, and we have a PDUFA date in Q3.
We also have presented interesting data on the combination of Daklinza with Sovaldi in HIV co-infected patients as well as more recently in cirrhotic and post-transplant patients.
Moving to immuno-oncology. We had a very good quarter, commercially as well as in R&D. Let me first talk about Yervoy. Yervoy continues to do well with global net sales for the quarter of $325 million, a 20% increase over the same period last year. We had strong performance across all geographies. In the U.S., we saw growth in the community setting, while internationally, growth was driven by first line. As we continue to advance our immuno-oncology portfolio, Yervoy certainly remains an important treatment option for patients. However, as we have mentioned before, the introduction of new immuno-oncology agents such as Opdivo in melanoma will likely create some variability in Yervoy sales. We are also looking at Yervoy in earlier stages of melanoma. We recently announced the filing of Study -029 in which Yervoy showed a benefit in adjuvant treatment for patients with Stage 3 melanoma who are at high risk of recurrence. And we just presented data from Study -069 at the AACR Conference, which showed encouraging data of the combination of Yervoy+Opdivo. We believe that this regimen has the potential to further transform the treatment of melanoma, and we are anticipating a submission to the FDA by midyear.
Regarding Opdivo, as Lamberto mentioned, the last few months have been very exciting for all of us at BMS, but most importantly, for patients across multiple tumors. In addition to the early U.S. approval in melanoma late last year and the early approval in second-line squamous lung cancer in early March, we recently announced the early stoppage of Study -057, the Phase III study of Opdivo in second-line, non-squamous lung cancer. Opdivo has once again demonstrated a survival advantage over the standard of care in advanced lung cancer, and we will be providing this data to health authorities as quickly as possible. With the early approval in lung cancer, we have the first PD-1 to market in this area of high unmet need. Our commercial organization was ready, and we were able to start treating patients within 48 hours. It has been very encouraging to see that we have nearly 100% access for Opdivo in the approved indications. And we are seeing an acceleration of usage in both the academic and community setting.
In addition to the U.S. approvals, just last week, the European Medicines Agency adopted a positive opinion recommending that Opdivo be granted approval for use in patients with metastatic melanoma. This is the first positive opinion from the CHMP for a PD-1 therapy and will now be reviewed by the European commission, which typically renders a decision within 60 days. And we are hopeful that we could be approved in lung cancer in the EU by the end of the year. There is more to come with our immuno-oncology portfolio.
ASCO will be an important meeting for us. We will be presenting 2 Phase III overall survival studies in lung cancer, Study 017 and, we are excited to say, we were able to secure a spot for Study -057 too. In addition to new data on lung cancer, we are looking forward to presenting new data in melanoma, more mature data from ongoing renal studies and data in new tumor types, such as hepatocellular carcinoma, small cell lung cancer and glioblastoma. We will also be presenting the results for the elotuzumab Phase III study in relapsed refractory multiple myeloma. And we expect to continue to have important data readouts over the next 12 to 18 months in several tumor types.
So taken together, we are very pleased with our first quarter results, strong commercial performance, important clinical, regulatory and business development advances. This balanced approach driving results today, while laying the foundation for tomorrow, continues to serve as well.
And with that, I will turn the floor over to Charlie, who can provide more specifics around our Q1 results."

As Lamberto and Giovanni mentioned, we had a very good quarter, which was driven by strong sales growth of 6% or 13% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Overall, FX had a slightly negative impact on EPS of about $0.01. Despite headwind from FX, we had a strong sales performance from our key growth drivers, including Eliquis, Yervoy and hep C. In addition, SPRYCEL and ORENCIA both had a good quarter, each up 10% compared to Q1 last year. Sales of Opdivo were $40 million for the quarter, which included some inventory stocking. Overall, while early, we are seeing encouraging trends.
With ABILIFY, our U.S. sales in Q1 were higher than prior quarters due to the way revenues are shared in our agreement with Otsuka. The formula is based on a tiered structure. And as our right to ABILIFY in the U.S. expired in April, all of the U.S. revenues we recorded this year are at the 50% tier as compared with the blended annual rate of 33% for all of last year.
You may have seen that we recently agreed to transfer our North American Erbitux rights to Lilly. We will continue to commercialize Erbitux and book sales until the transition to Lilly, which we expect will be completed in the fourth quarter. After the transition, Lilly will pay us royalties on net sales, which will be accounted for as other income. The transaction is not expected to have a significant impact on our non-GAAP earnings.
Gross margin was 80% during the quarter, up 410 basis points compared to the same period last year. The favorability was mostly due to the FX impact on international inventory sold. If rates remain constant, we expect this favorability in gross margin to normalize. Gross margin was also impacted by a onetime benefit from a restructured royalty agreement.
ANP and MSNA were both down versus prior year due in part to FX and lower spending on diabetes and ABILIFY. This was partially offset by increased investments in key brands, including Eliquis, Yervoy, Opdivo and our hep C franchise.
R&D expenses were down about 5% primarily due to timing of R&D spend and FX. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 21% during the quarter, which does not include the R&D tax credit, as it's not been extended yet in 2015. This was an active quarter for business development as we continually look for opportunities that can help deliver long-term growth within our core areas of interest. Within I-O, we recently added 2 new programs that expand our portfolio with the acquisition of the IDO and TDO program from Flexus and the inlicense of the TGF beta program from Rigel. With these programs, we add compounds that address the tumor microenvironment, which we think can act synergistically with our I-O assets in multiple tumor types.
We are also expanding our specialty portfolio through business development. Our recent agreement with uniQure brings out exclusive access to uniQure's gene therapy technology platform for multiple targets and cardiovascular diseases, including a program for congestive heart failure. The agreement also allows us to collaborate in other therapeutic areas.
Moving to guidance. We are adjusting our non-GAAP EPS guidance range to $1.60 to $1.70. This range assumes current foreign exchange rates and continuation of the R&D tax credit in 2015. When studying guidance in January, we expected a negative impact of $0.12 to $0.14 on full year EPS due to FX rates at that time. Our updated guidance range incorporates an additional $0.02 negative impact based on current FX rates.
While we are not changing line item guidance, in thinking about operating expenses for the remainder of the year, we are very enthusiastic about our position in I-O and are committed to maximizing our opportunity. And as you might expect, we are continuously evaluating new investment opportunities. And we have identified several, both commercially and within R&D, that are in the process of being reviewed. Now, we will be happy to address your questions."

As you've heard for our company for R&D and importantly for patients. I must say, I am particularly gratified that the many strategic choices we made 2 to 3 years ago that shaped our development program are now coming to fruition. For our initial tumors, we focused on lung as well as the traditional immunological tumors, melanoma and renal cell, and we initiated broad programs in these tumors and characterized the benefit in terms of overall survival in Phase III studies, going head to head with chemotherapy when it's standard of care. We built optionality into our trials. We accelerate the results and we moved quickly to explore the combination therapy. Now the recent positive data from these studies in lung and melanoma, including combination therapy, together with the early U.S. approval in melanoma late last year, the rapid approval in lung cancer and advanced squamous non-small cell lung cancer in early March. And last week, the positive opinion in the EU for Opdivo with a broad label in melanoma, really, I believe, puts us in a very strong competitive position. So moving to your question on -057. We are very excited about the data, which you've heard will be presented at ASCO. I can't comment specifically on the submission. There are a number of steps we need to take to complete the analysis for the submission, and we're working as quickly as possible to share these data, of course, with the regulators around the world. But as we've shown recently, we are confident we'll work together and as quickly as possible with the FDA and other health authorities to broaden our label and to bring Opdivo to non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer patients as soon as it's practical. Now moving to your PD-L1 biomarker question, I want to remind you that from the beginning, our strategy has been to characterize the PD-L1 expression in a broad population as possible, so that as many patients as possible can benefit from I-O therapy. Now our scientific goals have been twofold: To learn about the relationship between PD-L1 expression and clinical outcomes. Importantly, as you said, or as you asked, overall survival as well as objective response; and also to understand the science underlying PD-L1 expression in tumors and how it's affected by various factors, including Yervoy and Opdivo. I think you'll have to wait until ASCO to hear more specific information about the relationship between objective response and overall survival. But I will say, we are very excited about the fact that we're the only company that really has been able to show that relationship, because as well as the total population, we have done some analyses looking at PD-L1 positive and negative in both squamous, in both studies in second-line squamous and non-squamous. So I just wanted to -- let me finish by saying, we continue to design studies to include all patients, regardless of PD-L1 status. And we will follow the science and the clinical data that we generate regarding the use of this biomarker. I think it's important -- my final point, to say we have developed a high-quality validated diagnostic test with data, which will be quickly available, should we need it either for approval or labeling. Thank you."

Good morning. This is Giovanni. Let me answer the Opdivo question first, and I will go to Eliquis.

Let me answer the Opdivo question first, and I will go to Eliquis. With respect to Opdivo, as we mentioned earlier, we were approved in lung cancer, squamous second-line lung cancer at the beginning of March. We had obviously ensured that despite the very rapid regulatory review that our teams were fully resourced and ready to launch. We were ready to launch right away. We actually started treating patients within 48 hours. I think what has happened since launch is very encouraging and reinforces our belief in the potential of Opdivo in lung cancer. We've seen, at this point, virtually 100% access with no barriers within approved indications by any payers. We've seen a lot of interest in our data. And we are seeing a rapid increase in penetration in both the academic institutions and the community. One of the things that we look at is, as a leading indicator of performance, is really how our trial has grown. And we are seeing week over week, a really good trend in terms of trialists. With respect to our performance, I would also say we are really looking at what we call the dynamic segment, in terms of new patients coming on therapy. And we're very pleased that we are actually, at this point, at approximately a 50% share in value of the PD-1 market right now. To your question regarding usage beyond the label, all I can say, obviously, is we are promoting within our 2 labeled and approved indications, and we have seen that approximately 75% of claims are really in label with respect to the totality of our business at this point. So what we are seeing really reinforces our belief that the data is very strong. There is a lot of interest in it. Obviously, we think survival data and the ability to promote a Phase III randomized trial with survival data which is clearly a hard endpoint resonates extremely well with providers and payers. And to Eliquis, let me just echo your comments. The performance is very strong. We had a really good quarter. We had a good quarter in the U.S., where we continue to see growth in both our TRx share and our new-to-brand prescription share. We were able to grow both TRx and NBRx volume by approximately 20% in the quarter compared to other brands, which declined during the same period. And we also saw really good performance internationally, with Japan, Germany and all key markets in Europe. Eliquis is a very important asset for us. It is growing to be a really important product. And obviously, as you know, cardiovascular is one of our priority areas. We have a number of early programs in cardiovascular disease. We actually, as Charlie mentioned, signed an agreement with uniQure, which has a potential target in heart failure. So Eliquis is one product that we are committed to the area."

Obviously, the data we presented at AACR was very positive in terms of the high response rate. And I believe it was really exciting, is not only the response rate in the range of 60%, but also that over 20% of patients have a complete response. So we continue to believe that the use of the combination of Yervoy and Opdivo can really transform melanoma, because obviously the difference we are seeing in terms of the response rate translates into the potential for survival for a significant number of patients in a disease that progresses very rapidly. The other point that I would like to make is that we are reassured by the fact that physicians are able to manage the side effect profile of Yervoy in over 80% of cases with the treatment algorithms that we've used since the launch of Yervoy. And they -- a significant percentage of even those patients that may stop therapy early. Almost 70% actually see responses. So we think there is a lot of value in the regimen. And obviously, as we get ready to present some data from the Phase III Study 067 at ASCO, we are very focused on that. From the perspective of price, I think that our experience is that payers and providers are very interested in data that demonstrates a significant incremental value for patients. That clearly was our experience with Yervoy from the very beginning. And obviously, we believe it continues to be what makes a difference there. It's important to remember that obviously, the induction phase with Yervoy is something that physicians are very familiar with. And obviously, the maintenance phase with Opdivo beyond the first 12 weeks is really something that is only happening for patients that have responders. And as you know, there is a very high value in terms of potential survival in the long term to our response that payers traditionally have been very receptive to."

Specifically, around the Flexus asset, we have now had a chance to look at the data following the successful completion of the HSR process. We're very happy with what we've seen. I'm not going to go into the specifics at the moment about what differentiates it, but it's a very -- it's an exciting lead compound, but also represents a program in IDO and behind it programs in IDO/TPO. All of which, together with some other areas in the tumor microenvironment, we think, is going to be very important. As far as timing, we're moving well towards serving the data we need for an IND, and we are hoping to be in the clinic at the end of the year or the beginning of next year. Let me just finish by talking generally about the combination, to reinforce what Giovanni said. We find that -- we feel that the compelling results we saw at the AACR really reinforce our belief in the combinations and an opportunity to really expand the benefits beyond the patients who are treated presently with monotherapy.

So in the commercial environment, what do you see as the significance or relevance of having that broader label? And then a question for you, Francis. Roche has started 4 chemo combination trials of PD-L1 antibody in Phase III for lung cancer. And Bristol has been less committed to a chemo combination trial. I think that you've decided not to go ahead in Phase III. Clearly, they are making a very large investment in this combination. What do you think they see that you don't?"

So our data set is very strong. And clearly, survival is important for both physicians and payers.

So while the category will continue to be managed, and obviously, we are very focused on it, the fact that we are emerging as the leading agent in terms of the overall momentum positions us strongly with payers. With respect to the use of Opdivo, and how the update is going in the community versus the academic institutions, obviously, that's very different in melanoma versus lung. Because as you know, about 50% of melanoma is treated in the hospital and academic setting and only 50% in the community. When you look at lung, that's very different, with over 80% of patients treated in the community. So while at the beginning, it is logical that the uptake is passed in the academic and hospital setting, we are actually seeing, with Opdivo, already a very significant increase of uptake in community, which is clearly very important. And it makes us feel optimistic about the overall opportunity for Opdivo in the community setting."

So I think, obviously, one kinds of always extrapolates between tumors, either in terms of efficacy or safety. We've seen differences there. But we do think underlying this is an opportunity with a combination of Opdivo and Yervoy to treat more patients. Clearly, looking at lung cancer population, we understand that it's a different population, and we think in lung -- non-small cell lung cancer, there may be slightly different tolerability. That being said, we've learned a lot from the ongoing combination studies, together with the second-line studies. And so we really think the first-line combination studies that's about to start really does have a good chance of understanding the potential of combination in lung cancer. As far as the 017 study and the assay, let me just say that I think our assay is a good assay. It's validated. It's ready to go in terms of the need for approval or labeling. And you'll have the opportunity to see the data, which is very strong, I think, across 017 and -057 in terms of documenting the different patient populations."

We have delivered on our strategy, and we have set a solid foundation for our future, building a robust product portfolio, innovative pipeline that positions us well for the future. As a result, Bristol-Myers Squibb is now in a very strong position. And during the last quarter, we had solid performance across much of our portfolio as well as important clinical and regulatory developments. I just want to note how excited we are that Opdivo become the first PD-1 inhibitor approved for lung cancer in the U.S. and that a positive opinion was adopted last week in Europe for melanoma. These were not just important milestones for our company. These are important developments that have potential to improve the lives of thousands of lung cancer patients in the U.S. and melanoma patients in Europe.

Let me begin by thanking Lamberto for his kind words of support and for his years of leadership.

Let me begin by thanking Lamberto for his kind words of support and for his years of leadership. I, too, am glad that we will continue working together.
So as Lamberto noted, we just finished a very good quarter. Performance across the organization was strong, and we had some very important clinical and regulatory advances in our immuno-oncology portfolio. During the first quarter, we delivered 6% sales growth. Excluding the impact from our diabetes divestiture, we delivered a 10% increase over the first quarter last year. This was due to solid double-digit growth across our new and inline brands. Here are some highlights: First, regarding Eliquis. We continue to see strong performance. We had $355 million in global sales in the first 3 months of the year with good growth in both cardiology and primary care. This is more than double the first quarter of last year. Along with our alliance partner, Pfizer, we continue to focus on our goal of establishing Eliquis as the leading oral anticoagulant within its approved indications. In the U.S., Eliquis is now the #1 anticoagulant in new-to-brand prescriptions among cardiologists and the #1 anticoagulant across all physicians for atrial fibrillation. In addition to progress in atrial fibrillation, the label expansion into VTE has helped our performance overall. Internationally, our business was very strong. In Europe, Eliquis trends across most markets remain very positive. And we are also doing well in Japan, where Eliquis is the #1 anticoagulant in new-to-brand prescriptions across all prescribers.
Regarding hepatitis C, global sales were strong at $264 million, primarily driven by the performance of our Daklinza+Sunvepra combination regimen in Japan. In Europe, we have launched in several markets, and commercial execution has been good despite increased competition. In the U.S., we completed our resubmission of Daklinza to the FDA in February for genotype 3 patients, and we have a PDUFA date in Q3.
We also have presented interesting data on the combination of Daklinza with Sovaldi in HIV co-infected patients as well as more recently in cirrhotic and post-transplant patients.
Moving to immuno-oncology. We had a very good quarter, commercially as well as in R&D. Let me first talk about Yervoy. Yervoy continues to do well with global net sales for the quarter of $325 million, a 20% increase over the same period last year. We had strong performance across all geographies. In the U.S., we saw growth in the community setting, while internationally, growth was driven by first line. As we continue to advance our immuno-oncology portfolio, Yervoy certainly remains an important treatment option for patients. However, as we have mentioned before, the introduction of new immuno-oncology agents such as Opdivo in melanoma will likely create some variability in Yervoy sales. We are also looking at Yervoy in earlier stages of melanoma. We recently announced the filing of Study -029 in which Yervoy showed a benefit in adjuvant treatment for patients with Stage 3 melanoma who are at high risk of recurrence. And we just presented data from Study -069 at the AACR Conference, which showed encouraging data of the combination of Yervoy+Opdivo. We believe that this regimen has the potential to further transform the treatment of melanoma, and we are anticipating a submission to the FDA by midyear.
Regarding Opdivo, as Lamberto mentioned, the last few months have been very exciting for all of us at BMS, but most importantly, for patients across multiple tumors. In addition to the early U.S. approval in melanoma late last year and the early approval in second-line squamous lung cancer in early March, we recently announced the early stoppage of Study -057, the Phase III study of Opdivo in second-line, non-squamous lung cancer. Opdivo has once again demonstrated a survival advantage over the standard of care in advanced lung cancer, and we will be providing this data to health authorities as quickly as possible. With the early approval in lung cancer, we have the first PD-1 to market in this area of high unmet need. Our commercial organization was ready, and we were able to start treating patients within 48 hours. It has been very encouraging to see that we have nearly 100% access for Opdivo in the approved indications. And we are seeing an acceleration of usage in both the academic and community setting.
In addition to the U.S. approvals, just last week, the European Medicines Agency adopted a positive opinion recommending that Opdivo be granted approval for use in patients with metastatic melanoma. This is the first positive opinion from the CHMP for a PD-1 therapy and will now be reviewed by the European commission, which typically renders a decision within 60 days. And we are hopeful that we could be approved in lung cancer in the EU by the end of the year. There is more to come with our immuno-oncology portfolio.
ASCO will be an important meeting for us. We will be presenting 2 Phase III overall survival studies in lung cancer, Study 017 and, we are excited to say, we were able to secure a spot for Study -057 too. In addition to new data on lung cancer, we are looking forward to presenting new data in melanoma, more mature data from ongoing renal studies and data in new tumor types, such as hepatocellular carcinoma, small cell lung cancer and glioblastoma. We will also be presenting the results for the elotuzumab Phase III study in relapsed refractory multiple myeloma. And we expect to continue to have important data readouts over the next 12 to 18 months in several tumor types.
So taken together, we are very pleased with our first quarter results, strong commercial performance, important clinical, regulatory and business development advances. This balanced approach driving results today, while laying the foundation for tomorrow, continues to serve as well.
And with that, I will turn the floor over to Charlie, who can provide more specifics around our Q1 results."

As Lamberto and Giovanni mentioned, we had a very good quarter, which was driven by strong sales growth of 6% or 13% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Overall, FX had a slightly negative impact on EPS of about $0.01. Despite headwind from FX, we had a strong sales performance from our key growth drivers, including Eliquis, Yervoy and hep C. In addition, SPRYCEL and ORENCIA both had a good quarter, each up 10% compared to Q1 last year. Sales of Opdivo were $40 million for the quarter, which included some inventory stocking. Overall, while early, we are seeing encouraging trends.
With ABILIFY, our U.S. sales in Q1 were higher than prior quarters due to the way revenues are shared in our agreement with Otsuka. The formula is based on a tiered structure. And as our right to ABILIFY in the U.S. expired in April, all of the U.S. revenues we recorded this year are at the 50% tier as compared with the blended annual rate of 33% for all of last year.
You may have seen that we recently agreed to transfer our North American Erbitux rights to Lilly. We will continue to commercialize Erbitux and book sales until the transition to Lilly, which we expect will be completed in the fourth quarter. After the transition, Lilly will pay us royalties on net sales, which will be accounted for as other income. The transaction is not expected to have a significant impact on our non-GAAP earnings.
Gross margin was 80% during the quarter, up 410 basis points compared to the same period last year. The favorability was mostly due to the FX impact on international inventory sold. If rates remain constant, we expect this favorability in gross margin to normalize. Gross margin was also impacted by a onetime benefit from a restructured royalty agreement.
ANP and MSNA were both down versus prior year due in part to FX and lower spending on diabetes and ABILIFY. This was partially offset by increased investments in key brands, including Eliquis, Yervoy, Opdivo and our hep C franchise.
R&D expenses were down about 5% primarily due to timing of R&D spend and FX. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 21% during the quarter, which does not include the R&D tax credit, as it's not been extended yet in 2015. This was an active quarter for business development as we continually look for opportunities that can help deliver long-term growth within our core areas of interest. Within I-O, we recently added 2 new programs that expand our portfolio with the acquisition of the IDO and TDO program from Flexus and the inlicense of the TGF beta program from Rigel. With these programs, we add compounds that address the tumor microenvironment, which we think can act synergistically with our I-O assets in multiple tumor types.
We are also expanding our specialty portfolio through business development. Our recent agreement with uniQure brings out exclusive access to uniQure's gene therapy technology platform for multiple targets and cardiovascular diseases, including a program for congestive heart failure. The agreement also allows us to collaborate in other therapeutic areas.
Moving to guidance. We are adjusting our non-GAAP EPS guidance range to $1.60 to $1.70. This range assumes current foreign exchange rates and continuation of the R&D tax credit in 2015. When studying guidance in January, we expected a negative impact of $0.12 to $0.14 on full year EPS due to FX rates at that time. Our updated guidance range incorporates an additional $0.02 negative impact based on current FX rates.
While we are not changing line item guidance, in thinking about operating expenses for the remainder of the year, we are very enthusiastic about our position in I-O and are committed to maximizing our opportunity. And as you might expect, we are continuously evaluating new investment opportunities. And we have identified several, both commercially and within R&D, that are in the process of being reviewed. Now, we will be happy to address your questions."

As you've heard for our company for R&D and importantly for patients. I must say, I am particularly gratified that the many strategic choices we made 2 to 3 years ago that shaped our development program are now coming to fruition. For our initial tumors, we focused on lung as well as the traditional immunological tumors, melanoma and renal cell, and we initiated broad programs in these tumors and characterized the benefit in terms of overall survival in Phase III studies, going head to head with chemotherapy when it's standard of care. We built optionality into our trials. We accelerate the results and we moved quickly to explore the combination therapy. Now the recent positive data from these studies in lung and melanoma, including combination therapy, together with the early U.S. approval in melanoma late last year, the rapid approval in lung cancer and advanced squamous non-small cell lung cancer in early March. And last week, the positive opinion in the EU for Opdivo with a broad label in melanoma, really, I believe, puts us in a very strong competitive position. So moving to your question on -057.

But as we've shown recently, we are confident we'll work together and as quickly as possible with the FDA and other health authorities to broaden our label and to bring Opdivo to non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer patients as soon as it's practical. Now moving to your PD-L1 biomarker question, I want to remind you that from the beginning, our strategy has been to characterize the PD-L1 expression in a broad population as possible, so that as many patients as possible can benefit from I-O therapy. Now our scientific goals have been twofold: To learn about the relationship between PD-L1 expression and clinical outcomes. Importantly, as you said, or as you asked, overall survival as well as objective response; and also to understand the science underlying PD-L1 expression in tumors and how it's affected by various factors, including Yervoy and Opdivo. I think you'll have to wait until ASCO to hear more specific information about the relationship between objective response and overall survival. But I will say, we are very excited about the fact that we're the only company that really has been able to show that relationship, because as well as the total population, we have done some analyses looking at PD-L1 positive and negative in both squamous, in both studies in second-line squamous and non-squamous. So I just wanted to -- let me finish by saying, we continue to design studies to include all patients, regardless of PD-L1 status. And we will follow the science and the clinical data that we generate regarding the use of this biomarker. I think it's important -- my final point, to say we have developed a high-quality validated diagnostic test with data, which will be quickly available, should we need it either for approval or labeling. Thank you."

Let me answer the Opdivo question first, and I will go to Eliquis. With respect to Opdivo, as we mentioned earlier, we were approved in lung cancer, squamous second-line lung cancer at the beginning of March. We had obviously ensured that despite the very rapid regulatory review that our teams were fully resourced and ready to launch. We were ready to launch right away. We actually started treating patients within 48 hours. I think what has happened since launch is very encouraging and reinforces our belief in the potential of Opdivo in lung cancer. We've seen, at this point, virtually 100% access with no barriers within approved indications by any payers. We've seen a lot of interest in our data. And we are seeing a rapid increase in penetration in both the academic institutions and the community. One of the things that we look at is, as a leading indicator of performance, is really how our trial has grown. And we are seeing week over week, a really good trend in terms of trialists. With respect to our performance, I would also say we are really looking at what we call the dynamic segment, in terms of new patients coming on therapy. And we're very pleased that we are actually, at this point, at approximately a 50% share in value of the PD-1 market right now. To your question regarding usage beyond the label, all I can say, obviously, is we are promoting within our 2 labeled and approved indications, and we have seen that approximately 75% of claims are really in label with respect to the totality of our business at this point. So what we are seeing really reinforces our belief that the data is very strong. There is a lot of interest in it. Obviously, we think survival data and the ability to promote a Phase III randomized trial with survival data which is clearly a hard endpoint resonates extremely well with providers and payers. And to Eliquis, let me just echo your comments. The performance is very strong. We had a really good quarter. We had a good quarter in the U.S., where we continue to see growth in both our TRx share and our new-to-brand prescription share. We were able to grow both TRx and NBRx volume by approximately 20% in the quarter compared to other brands, which declined during the same period. And we also saw really good performance internationally, with Japan, Germany and all key markets in Europe. Eliquis is a very important asset for us. It is growing to be a really important product. And obviously, as you know, cardiovascular is one of our priority areas. We have a number of early programs in cardiovascular disease. We actually, as Charlie mentioned, signed an agreement with uniQure, which has a potential target in heart failure. So Eliquis is one product that we are committed to the area."

Obviously, the data we presented at AACR was very positive in terms of the high response rate. And I believe it was really exciting, is not only the response rate in the range of 60%, but also that over 20% of patients have a complete response. So we continue to believe that the use of the combination of Yervoy and Opdivo can really transform melanoma, because obviously the difference we are seeing in terms of the response rate translates into the potential for survival for a significant number of patients in a disease that progresses very rapidly. The other point that I would like to make is that we are reassured by the fact that physicians are able to manage the side effect profile of Yervoy in over 80% of cases with the treatment algorithms that we've used since the launch of Yervoy. And they -- a significant percentage of even those patients that may stop therapy early. Almost 70% actually see responses. So we think there is a lot of value in the regimen. And obviously, as we get ready to present some data from the Phase III Study 067 at ASCO, we are very focused on that. From the perspective of price, I think that our experience is that payers and providers are very interested in data that demonstrates a significant incremental value for patients. That clearly was our experience with Yervoy from the very beginning. And obviously, we believe it continues to be what makes a difference there. It's important to remember that obviously, the induction phase with Yervoy is something that physicians are very familiar with. And obviously, the maintenance phase with Opdivo beyond the first 12 weeks is really something that is only happening for patients that have responders. And as you know, there is a very high value in terms of potential survival in the long term to our response that payers traditionally have been very receptive to."

Specifically, around the Flexus asset, we have now had a chance to look at the data following the successful completion of the HSR process. We're very happy with what we've seen. I'm not going to go into the specifics at the moment about what differentiates it, but it's a very -- it's an exciting lead compound, but also represents a program in IDO and behind it programs in IDO/TPO. All of which, together with some other areas in the tumor microenvironment, we think, is going to be very important. As far as timing, we're moving well towards serving the data we need for an IND, and we are hoping to be in the clinic at the end of the year or the beginning of next year. Let me just finish by talking generally about the combination, to reinforce what Giovanni said. We find that -- we feel that the compelling results we saw at the AACR really reinforce our belief in the combinations and an opportunity to really expand the benefits beyond the patients who are treated presently with monotherapy. And we are planning to be in a position to have a submission for the combination to the FDA by the middle of the year. Thank you."

First of all, there is really strong momentum for Eliquis in the market. We are seeing very significant growth in TRxs and NBRxs. And obviously, we've established a leadership position in new-to-brand shares across all indications in cardiology and in atrial fibrillation across the total market. That's important in negotiating with payers. The second point that I would say is we are in a very strong position from an access perspective. We have over 90% access in both the commercial and Medicare space. On the commercial space, our preferred status is approaching 70%. And in Medicare, it's about 80%. So while the category will continue to be managed, and obviously, we are very focused on it, the fact that we are emerging as the leading agent in terms of the overall momentum positions us strongly with payers. With respect to the use of Opdivo, and how the update is going in the community versus the academic institutions, obviously, that's very different in melanoma versus lung. Because as you know, about 50% of melanoma is treated in the hospital and academic setting and only 50% in the community. When you look at lung, that's very different, with over 80% of patients treated in the community. So while at the beginning, it is logical that the uptake is passed in the academic and hospital setting, we are actually seeing, with Opdivo, already a very significant increase of uptake in community, which is clearly very important. And it makes us feel optimistic about the overall opportunity for Opdivo in the community setting."

So I think, obviously, one kinds of always extrapolates between tumors, either in terms of efficacy or safety. We've seen differences there. But we do think underlying this is an opportunity with a combination of Opdivo and Yervoy to treat more patients. Clearly, looking at lung cancer population, we understand that it's a different population, and we think in lung -- non-small cell lung cancer, there may be slightly different tolerability. That being said, we've learned a lot from the ongoing combination studies, together with the second-line studies. And so we really think the first-line combination studies that's about to start really does have a good chance of understanding the potential of combination in lung cancer. As far as the 017 study and the assay, let me just say that I think our assay is a good assay. It's validated. It's ready to go in terms of the need for approval or labeling.

Building on our success over the past few years,",1092,"Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. It is a privilege to be here as CEO to lead today's call with you and to tell you how excited I am about our future, about the opportunities we have before us. 
Building on our success over the past few years, we are beginning an exciting new chapter, one characterized by the opportunity for growth, for leading a transformation in the way cancer is treated and for strengthening and expanding our diversified portfolio of specialty medicines. 
And we are starting this next chapter from a position of strength. We have an established, proven strategy, we have a strong portfolio of marketed products, we have a promising pipeline and exceptional talent. I am fully confident that we are well positioned to build on and further strengthen our leadership position in immuno-oncology through Opdivo. 
I'm also confident we can deliver on the promise of our portfolio and our pipeline within immuno-oncology and beyond immuno-oncology. 
As I mentioned, we are about to begin a period of growth. Over the next 5 years, we expect growth to come primarily from Opdivo and Eliquis with important contribution from the rest of our existing portfolio of innovative medicines. 
With Opdivo, we will leverage our leadership position in lung, melanoma and renal cancers. In non-small cell lung, we are extremely well positioned, given the 2 positive Phase III studies demonstrating improved overall survival. 
In melanoma, Opdivo + Yervoy are currently marketed, and we believe the combination regimen will be an important treatment option for patients. 
In renal cancer, the early stop of Study 25 announced this Monday due to an advantage in overall survival confirms the promise of Opdivo in this important disease where unmet need remains high and where we have a significant time advantage versus other competitors. 
This morning, we announced that the European Commission validated 2 Opdivo applications: One for non-squamous cell lung cancer and the other, in combination with Yervoy for metastatic melanoma. 
Additionally, as you know, our Opdivo development program is extremely broad with a number of ongoing studies across many tumors. We are confident this will add to the opportunity over time. 
With Eliquis, given the breadth of its label and the strength of its prescription trends, we are very encouraged and look to build in our momentum. 
And regarding the rest of our marketed products, trends are good, and we have the right resources in place to continue to compete and grow. 
Longer term, we are committed to diversify portfolio. This starts with and includes diversification within immuno-oncology into new mechanisms and new combinations as well as outside of I-O, being key areas such as fibrosis, heart failure, immunology and certain genetically-defined diseases. 
Over the last several months, I have reviewed our growth opportunities, and they are, for us, unprecedented. 
I've also focused on what we need to do to maximize them, and I'm fully committed to making the right strategic investments. 
In that context and as indicated in April, we have identified areas of incremental investments beginning in the second half of the year. Investments in commercial to make sure we are well resourced globally to compete, specifically for Opdivo, Eliquis and elotuzumab. And investments in R&D, particularly in I-O. In development to accelerate and broaden programs where possible, in early discovery to accelerate new mechanisms and combinations and in our medical organization.  In terms of new data generation and increasing field medical resources. 
Now with respect to our second quarter. I am very pleased with our performance. Sales were strong, and we had significant and meaningful clinical and regulatory milestones in the quarter. We delivered 7% overall sales growth year-over-year, demonstrating the strength of our products across all market. Charlie will describe key elements of our performance in more detail. 
Let me spend a moment on immuno-oncology. For Opdivo, we have had an incredible year so far, with 3 early study stops, significant data presented at ASCO, 3 filings, 3 approvals and commercial launches in both the U.S. and Europe. 
In the U.S., we are seeing early encouraging trends for Opdivo in terms of access, reimbursement and adoption. And I feel really good about where we are headed. 
Lung cancer is a very important opportunity for our company. We were first to market with squamous cell and Opdivo has already been added to NCCN Guidelines for non-squamous. 
In Europe, we have received approval for Opdivo in both first and second line metastatic melanoma.  Just this week, we were also approved for squamous lung cancer. 
While the vast majority of data from our program in I-O to date have been positive, we know that not everything we study will be successful as evidenced by the 2 studies for Yervoy in prostate and small cell lung cancer that didn't meet their primary endpoints. Francis can comment further as we are firmly committed to Yervoy, which is an important part of our immuno-oncology strategy in combination with Opdivo in multiple tumors. 
Just a couple of additional immuno-oncology highlights. In the coming weeks, we expect to complete the filing of 57 data in the U.S. and Europe, and we are working on submissions for elotuzumab based on ELOQUENT-2. 
I want to spend a moment now on hepatitis C. Here, we had a very strong second quarter. Performance was good in both Japan and Europe, and we had a onetime impact from previously deferred revenues in France. 
Additionally, we have made significant progress in the U.S. We have filed Daklinza in combination with sofosbuvir for the treatment of genotype 3 [indiscernible] and PDUFA date is August 30. And we plan to add supplemental filings later this year in other difficult to treat areas. 
The hepatitis C market continues to evolve rapidly. Given our focus strategy and the evolving competitive landscape, we do not plan to seek regulatory approval for our triple regimen or TRIA in the U.S. or Europe. We will continue to evaluate our filing strategy on a country-by-country basis and we'll make decisions based upon the specific needs of patients in each country. 
Going forward, we expect competitive launches later this year to affect our business, particularly in Japan. That said, we will continue to execute our HCV strategy, focused on addressing the needs of specific challenging to treat HCV patient populations, which may vary by market. 
So with all of that, let me now turn the floor over to Charlie, who will walk you through key elements of our key performance in Q2 as well as the financial implications reflected in our updated guidance."

As Giovanni mentioned, we have a very good quarter, which was driven by strong sales growth of 7% or 16%, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. 
Overall, FX had a negative impact on EPS of approximately $0.06. 
Let me provide a few highlights. Eliquis sales were $437 million, up 23% sequentially from the first quarter with good growth both in the U.S. and international.  We continue to see strong new to brand prescription trends with both cardiologists and primary care physicians across the broad market. 
Opdivo sales were $122 million for the quarter. We are seeing strong performance metrics with the approval in lung cancer with encouraging early trends in terms of access, reimbursement and abandonment of chemo and second line squamous lung cancer in the U.S. 
Additionally, we received EU approval in both first and second line melanoma last month and have launched in Germany where early trends are strong. 
And as noted by Giovanni, we just received approval for squamous lung cancer in the EU as well.  Opdivo has now been approved in over 30 countries. 
Yervoy sales in the U.S. were $136 million in the second quarter, a 21% decrease from prior year. Outside the U.S., sales totaled $160 million, which is a 28% increase excluding FX. 
As expected, we are seeing an impact on Yervoy from the PD-1 class in the U.S. This will likely continue in the short term until the Opdivo + Yervoy company should is approved later this year. 
Longer term, we believe Opdivo could have an important role to play in combination with Opdivo in multiple tumors. 
Hep C sales were very strong for the quarter at $479 million. Included in sales for the quarter is a onetime positive impact of $170 million related to an early access program in France that have previously been deferred until pricing was finalized. This now happens in Q2. 
Hep C sales performance in Japan was strong, but as you know, the competitive landscape continues to evolve. 
We continue to see strong solid growth from both Orencia and Sprycel, which grew 15% and 10%, respectively. 
HIV sales were down 14% as the HIV market increasingly competitive having an impact on our business. 
Now let me highlight a couple of items from our non-GAAP P&L. Gross margin was favorable 80 basis points compared to prior year, primarily due to the positive impact from foreign exchange, partially offset by product mix related to higher sales of Eliquis and lower sales of ABILIFY. 
Compared with our first quarter, gross margin is down 360 basis points.  Recall that last quarter, we had a onetime benefit of previously accrued royalties and a full quarter of ABILIFY sales. 
Operating expenses were somewhat higher than last year as we have been investing behind Eliquis, hep C and Opdivo. 
Our tax rate for the quarter is 2 percentage points higher than last year. Our quarterly tax rate will fluctuate based on earnings mix and remember that the R&D tax credit is yet to be passed by Congress. 
Now let me provide some comments on our revised guidance. For revenues, we have increased our guidance range based on strong overall sales trends with our key growth products, including Eliquis, hep C, Orencia and Opdivo. In thinking through sales for the remainder of the year them at 2015, I would like to highlight a few dynamics. 
In hep C, I mentioned there was a onetime positive impact of $170 million from France. This will not recur. 
Additionally, hep C will become increasingly competitive for us, particularly in Japan, where we expected significant impact on our sales going forward. 
And as I commented earlier on Yervoy, we are seeing an impact on the U.S. business from the PD-1 
class. 
Also remember that we've restructured our Erbitux agreement. We expect Lilly to take over full commercialization in October at which point, we will no longer for sales but will instead record the royalties to be received in other income. 
I will now move on to operating expenses for the remainder of this year. As Giovanni mentioned, we are committed to making the right investments to capitalize on what we think are real growth opportunity. 
And as you recall, I mentioned in April that we're in the process of reviewing additional new investments. We have since made strategic choices investing programs that we feel are necessary to maintain the leadership position at immuno-oncology as well as to support other important growth products, including Eliquis and elotuzumab.  These investments are included in our revised guidance. 
Commercially, we are adding resources globally to fully support the launches of Opdivo and elotuzumab and also to support continued strong growth. 
For Opdivo, we are making additional investments in R&D, medical, AFT, and we are increasing investments to accelerate Opdivo development programs where possible and also to accelerate the development of new mechanisms and additional combination of regimen. 
We are adding resources in our medical organization, which include additional trials to generate data and also increase the field of medical resources, which will be important for driving awareness to Opdivo both in the U.S. and around the world. 
These investments are not discrete, these are programs that are beginning in the second half of this year but will continue into 2016. 
In summary, we are encouraged by our good clinical results and strong underlying sales trends and metrics from our key brands that are important our future growth outlook and part of capital is in our growth opportunity, we're making the right strategic investments. I'd be happy now to address your questions."

It's Francis Cuss here. So thank you very much for the question. We have not seen any difficulty in recruiting patients for any of our studies with Opdivo or, indeed, the combination and said it's not related to the ability to look for PD-L1 expression or not. I would say as a physician, obviously, the less one has to do to be able to treat the patient and really have a good idea, the benefits that makes a lot of sense. So we are very happy that we're heading towards broad labels for the tumors we're looking at, and we're fully characterized the PD-L1 expression. Moving to the combinations with chemotherapy, we believe we have very comprehensive data set now with various chemotherapy combinations. Probably with the longest follow-up in the industry. Based on our comprehensive data from CheckMate -012, combinations of Opdivo with conventional chemo regimens may sometimes achieve high and durable responses. But we've seen with longer follow-up that the survival of 1 year was actually no different from Opdivo combinations, the chemo compared to Opdivo monotherapy. In effect, what we saw was as it is but non durable response rates at the cost of additional toxicity. Now just to put this in context, we showed at ASCO last time, 1 year survival for Opdivo [indiscernible] is about 70% to 85% regardless of PD-L1 expression. So we are focused on the Opdivo + Yervoy combo and we'll  -- in addition, continue to expire or other scientifically driven combinations to advance our first line strategy and our position. We are additionally interested in nontraditional chemo combo regimens, including innovative approaches to sequences and maintenance. So let me just remind you, our strategy for first line is to improve survival and replace platinum doublets. And to do this, we are exploring multiple Opdivo combinations as well as monotherapy and earlier IOX is targeted therapies and chemo, both internally and externally."

Now I think it's also fair to say that based on the preclinical science and advancing clinical data we've seen our strategy is rapidly evolving to study and combinations of Opdivo + Yervoy in multiple tumors. So just to talk about small cell for a moment, we presented data at ASCO thus the CheckMate -032 study that showed activity in platinum sensitive and resistant patients in both monotherapy but in combination and with very good total tolerability. And I think it's also important to say we've showed activity in prostate cancer with Yervoy, even though we actually didn't meet our primary endpoint. So, let me say, that they think we believe in the importance of the complementary mechanism of actions in I-O. We are firmly committed to Yervoy, which I think is a very important part of our combination strategy, combined with Opdivo and multiple tumors. And I think it's important to say that we're making very good progress of the moment in melanoma with validation of our EU combo filing just this week, and we have the upcoming PDUFA date at the end of September for the U.S. post 069 filing.

And as I said at the beginning, when we think about the next period of growth between now and 2020, the next 5 years, our growth will come disproportionately from Opdivo and Eliquis. And within Opdivo, obviously, there is an element of diversification as well because our starting strategy is really focused on melanoma and renal cell, but then we are expanding into a large number of other tumor opportunities. Longer term, we believe we have an exciting early pipeline within immuno-oncology and in a select number of areas, in which we have focused that can drive our growth and a medium and the long-term. And the areas are the ones we discussed before. So CV with a focus on [indiscernible] failure, immunology and the areas of fibrosis and genetically defined diseases. In all of those areas, we have ongoing programs, which are early, but are potentially transformative. And with respect to how we complement that, how our business development strategy does not change, and it's really the strategy that we articulated before. I think that one of our core strength as a company is really our ability to complement internal R&D with business development. We've clearly demonstrated that in fibrosis with the recent agreements we had and even in CV through our deal with uniQure. So you will see us continue to execute our strategy and business development to complement our internal programs there."

We have 2 studies in first line, 2 registration potential studies: One in monotherapy, the 026 and PD-L1 expressing patients.

As you noted, we do have registration study of Opdivo + Yervoy together, which is started in both expresses and non-expresses of PD-L1, that's the next likely potential positive study. So we believe that Opdivo will be foundational and then the Opdivo combos will have the biggest impact to survival and replace chemotherapy as Giovanni mentioned earlier. Now, obviously, earlier, we have program in combination with Opdivo that's an early-stage testing. We hope to see some data on that next year. And behind that, we have a bold initiative to bring forward 6 additional assets into the clinic in the next 18 months and some of these would be certainly natural to expect to combine with Nivolumab.

And then the last question just in terms of how uptake is actually occurring in the market today. What data, if you do have it available, can you share with us with regard to the mix? So what percentage of Opdivo patients are in melanoma patients, what percent are squamous lung, and what percent are non-squamous? And then if I could just one final question.

As far as the efficacy is concerned, as you know, we focus pretty much on the durability of responses or overall survival or 1 year landmark survival. As I said, we have 6 months survival for all patients in this study and its maturing. So it's really about this therapeutic index, both tolerability and efficacy. In terms of the chemo data, I believe we have presented some of that. Obviously, as it's important with these explorative studies, the data matures and continues to become more important with time.

What we are seeing now is that we are about at parity with KEYTRUDA in the community setting, and we're gaining good market share in the institutional setting. I will say in melanoma, we're also seeing some off label usage since ASCO of PD-1 inhibitors in frontline. As you recall, from Charlie and Giovanni's remark that put some pressure on Yervoy. But Opdivo is seeing list on the non-promoted sitting there and in a lung we've really had a very rapid penetration of the squamous second lien market. We're gaining about 2/3 of new patients there and that happened very rapidly. And then since NCCN updated June 12, post ASCO, we've also seen a very nice uptake in lung overall. Clearly that's another off label indication given that we're only promoting in squamous right now.

And I think having a broad understanding of how immune checkpoint inhibitors work the safety profile being particularly good with nivolumab have helped us have a rapid penetration and community, and so I think we expect that to continue with broadening indications. In Europe, we're very encouraged by what we've seen, as Giovanni mentioned in Germany. I would say that the enthusiasm and interest in second line squamous and in first and second line melanoma is very high.

Building on our success over the past few years, we are beginning an exciting new chapter, one characterized by the opportunity for growth, for leading a transformation in the way cancer is treated and for strengthening and expanding our diversified portfolio of specialty medicines, and we are starting this next chapter from a position of strength. We have an established, proven strategy. We have a strong portfolio of marketed products. We have a promising pipeline and exceptional talent. 
I am fully  confident that we are well positioned to build on and further strengthen our leadership position in immuno-oncology through Opdivo. I'm also confident we can deliver on the promise of our portfolio and our pipeline within immuno-oncology and beyond immuno-oncology. As I mentioned, we are about to begin a period of growth. Over the next 5 years, we expect growth to come primarily from Opdivo and Eliquis, with important contribution from the rest of our existing portfolio of innovative medicines. 
With Opdivo, we will leverage our leadership position in lung, melanoma and renal cancers. In non-small cell lung, we are extremely well positioned given the 2 positive Phase III studies demonstrating improved overall survival. In melanoma, Opdivo and Yervoy are currently marketed, and we believe the combination regimen will be an important treatment option for patients. In renal cancer, the early stop of study -025 announced this Monday due to an advantage in overall survival confirms the promise of Opdivo in this important disease, where unmet need remains high and where we have a significant time advantage versus other competitors. 
This morning, we announced that the European Commission validated 2 Opdivo applications: one for non-squamous cell lung cancer and the other in combination with Yervoy for metastatic melanoma. Additionally, as you know, our Opdivo development program is extremely broad, with a number of ongoing studies across many tumors. We are confident this will add to the opportunity over time. 
With Eliquis, given the breadth of its label and the strength of its prescription trends, we are very encouraged and look to build on our momentum. And regarding the rest of our marketed products, trends are good, and we have the right resources in place to continue to compete and grow.  Longer term, we are committed to diversify portfolio. This starts with and includes diversification within immuno-oncology into new mechanisms and new combinations as well as outside of I-O, in key areas such as fibrosis, heart failure, immunology and certain genetically defined diseases. 
Over the last several months, I have reviewed our growth opportunities, and they are, for us, unprecedented. I have also focused on what we need to do to maximize them, and I am fully committed to making the right strategic investments. In that context and as indicated in April, we have identified areas of incremental investment beginning in the second half of the year: investments in commercial to make sure we are well resourced globally to compete, specifically for Opdivo, Eliquis and elotuzumab, and investments in R&D, particularly in I-O; in development to accelerate and broaden programs where possible; in early discovery to accelerate new mechanisms and combinations; and in our medical organization in terms of new data generation and increasing field medical resources. 
Now with respect to our second quarter, I am very pleased with our performance. Sales were strong, and we had significant and meaningful clinical and regulatory milestones in the quarter. We delivered 7% overall sales growth year-over-year, demonstrating the strength of our products across all markets. Charlie will describe key elements of our performance in more detail. 
Let me spend a moment on immuno-oncology. For Opdivo, we have had an incredible year so far, with 3 early study stops, significant data presented at ASCO, 3 filings, 3 approvals and commercial launches in both the U.S. and Europe. In the U.S., we are seeing early encouraging trends for Opdivo in terms of access, reimbursement and adoption, and I feel really good about where we are headed. Lung cancer is a very important opportunity for our company. We were first to market with squamous cell, and Opdivo has already been added to NCCN Guidelines for non-squamous. In Europe, we have received approval for Opdivo in both first- and second-line metastatic melanoma. Just this week, we were also approved for squamous lung cancer. 
While the vast majority of data from our programs in I-O to date has been positive, we know that not everything we study will be successful as evidenced by the 2 studies for Yervoy in prostate and small cell lung cancer that did not meet their primary endpoints. Francis can comment further as we are firmly committed to Yervoy, which is an important part of our immuno-oncology strategy in combination with Opdivo in multiple tumors. 
Just a couple of additional immuno-oncology highlights. In the coming weeks, we expect to complete the filing of 57 data in the U.S. and Europe, and we are working on submissions for elotuzumab based on ELOQUENT-2. 
I want to spend a moment now on hepatitis C. Here, we had a very strong second quarter. Performance was good in both Japan and Europe, and we had a onetime impact from previously deferred revenues in France. Additionally, we have made significant progress in the U.S. We have filed Daklinza in combination with sofosbuvir for the treatment of genotype 3 patients, our and PDUFA date is August 13. And we plan to add supplemental filings later this year in other difficult-to-treat areas. 
The hepatitis C market continues to evolve rapidly. Given our focused strategy and the evolving competitive landscape, we do not plan to seek regulatory approval for our triple regimen or trio in the U.S. or Europe. We will continue to evaluate our filing strategy on a country-by-country basis, and we'll make decisions based upon the specific needs of patients in each country. Going forward, we expect competitive launches later this year to affect our business, particularly in Japan. That said, we will continue to execute our HCV strategy, focused on addressing the needs of specific challenging-to-treat HCV patient populations, which may vary by market. 
So with all of that, let me now turn the floor over to Charlie, who will walk you through key elements of our performance in Q2 as well as the financial implications reflected in our updated guidance."
25798,304350132,836891,"Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 23, 2015",2015-07-23,"Earnings Calls","Bristol-Myers Squibb Company","Executives","Thank you, Giovanni, and good morning, everyone. As Giovanni mentioned, we had a very good quarter, which was driven by strong sales growth of 7% or 16% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Overall, FX had a negative impact on EPS of approximately $0",934,"Thank you, Giovanni, and good morning, everyone. As Giovanni mentioned, we had a very good quarter, which was driven by strong sales growth of 7% or 16% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Overall, FX had a negative impact on EPS of approximately $0.06. 
Let me provide a few highlights. Eliquis sales were $437 million, up 23% sequentially from the first quarter, with good growth both in the U.S. and international. We continue to see strong new-to-brand prescription trends with both cardiologists and primary care physicians across the broad market. 
Opdivo sales were $122 million for the quarter. We are seeing strong performance metrics with the approval in lung cancer, with encouraging early trends in terms of access, reimbursement and abandonment of chemo in second-line squamous lung cancer in the U.S.  Additionally, we received EU approval in both first- and second-line melanoma last month and have launched in Germany, where early trends are strong. And as noted by Giovanni, we just received approval for squamous lung cancer in the EU as well. Opdivo has now been approved in over 30 countries. 
Yervoy sales in the U.S. were $136 million in the second quarter, a 21% decrease from prior year. Outside the U.S., sales totaled $160 million, which is a 28% increase excluding FX. As expected, we are seeing an impact on Yervoy from the PD-1 class in the U.S. This will likely continue in the short term until the Opdivo plus Yervoy combination regimen is approved later this year. Longer term, we believe Yervoy could have an important role to play in combination with Opdivo in multiple tumors. 
Hep C sales were very strong for the quarter at $479 million. Included in sales for the quarter is a onetime positive impact of $170 million related to an early access program in France that has previously been deferred until pricing was finalized. This now happened in Q2. Hep C sales performance in Japan was strong, but as you know, the competitive landscape continues to evolve.  
We continue to see strong solid growth from both Orencia and Sprycel, which grew 15% and 10%, respectively. HIV sales were down 14% as the HIV market is increasingly competitive, having an impact on our business. 
Now let me highlight a couple of items from our non-GAAP P&L. Gross margin was favorable 80 basis points compared to prior year, primarily due to the positive impact from foreign exchange, partially offset by product mix related to higher sales of Eliquis and lower sales of ABILIFY. 
Compared with our first quarter, gross margin is down 360 basis points.  Recall that last quarter, we had a onetime benefit of previously accrued royalties and a full quarter of ABILIFY sales. 
Operating expenses were somewhat higher than last year as we have been investing behind Eliquis, hep C and Opdivo. Our tax rate for the quarter is 2 percentage points higher than last year. Our quarterly tax rate will fluctuate based on earnings mix, and remember that the R&D tax credit is yet to be passed by Congress. 
Now let me provide some comments on our revised guidance. For revenues, we have increased our guidance range based on strong overall sales trends with our key growth products, including Eliquis, hep C, Orencia and Opdivo. In thinking through sales for the remainder of 2015, I would like to highlight a few dynamics. In hep C, I mentioned there was a onetime positive impact of $170 million from France. This will not recur. Additionally, hep C will become increasingly competitive for us, particularly in Japan, where we expect a significant impact on our sales going forward. 
And as I commented earlier on Yervoy, we are seeing an impact on the U.S. business from the PD-1 class. Also remember that we have restructured our Erbitux agreement. We expect Lilly to take over full commercialization in October. At which point, we will no longer book sales but will instead record the royalties we receive in other income. 
I will now move on to operating expenses for the remainder of this year. As Giovanni mentioned, we are committed to making the right investments to capitalize on what we think are real growth opportunities. And as you recall, I mentioned in April that we are in the process of reviewing additional new investments. We have since made strategic choices to invest in programs that we feel are necessary to maintain the leadership position in immuno-oncology as well as to support other important growth products, including Eliquis and elotuzumab. These investments are included in our revised guidance. 
Commercially, we are adding resources globally to fully support the launches of Opdivo and elotuzumab and also behind Eliquis to support continued strong growth. For Opdivo, we are making additional investments in R&D, medical, A&P, and we are increasing investments to accelerate Opdivo development programs where possible and also to accelerate the development of new mechanisms and additional combination regimen. We are adding resources in our medical organization, which include additional trials to generate data and also increase the field medical resources, which will be important for driving awareness of Opdivo both in the U.S. and around the world. These investments are not discrete. These are programs that are beginning in the second half of this year but will continue into 2016. 
In summary, we are encouraged by our good clinical results and strong underlying sales trends and metrics from our key brands that are important to our future growth outlook. And in order to capitalize on our growth opportunities, we are making the right strategic investments. We'd be happy now to address your questions."

First, in Bristol's all-comer trials versus its PD-L1 selected trials, is there a meaningful difference in the rate of patient enrollment?

So thank you very much for that question. We have not seen any difficulty in recruiting patients for any of our studies with Opdivo or, indeed, the combination, and certainly, it's not related to the ability to look for PD-L1 expression or not. I would say, as a physician, obviously, the less one has to do to be able to treat the patient and really have a good idea of the benefits, that makes a lot of sense. So we are very happy that we're heading towards broad labels for the tumors we're looking at, and we fully characterize the PD-L1 expression. Moving to the combinations with chemotherapy, we believe we have very comprehensive dataset now with various chemotherapy, nivo combinations, probably with the longest follow-up in the industry. Based on our comprehensive data from CheckMate -012, combinations of Opdivo with conventional chemo regimens may sometimes achieve high and durable responses. But we've seen, with longer follow-up, that the survival, it's a year, was actually no different for Opdivo combinations -- chemo compared to Opdivo monotherapy. In effect, what we saw was as it is but nondurable response rates at the cost of additional toxicity. Now just to put this in context, we showed at ASCO last time, 1 year survival for Opdivo monotherapy was about 70% to 85% regardless of PD-L1 expression. So we are focused on the Opdivo,Yervoy combo, and we'll , in addition, continue to explore other scientifically driven combinations to advance our first-line strategy and our position. We are additionally interested in nontraditional chemo combo regimens, including innovative approaches to sequences and maintenance. So let me just remind you, our strategy for first line is to improve survival and replace platinum doublets. And to do this, we are exploring multiple Opdivo combinations as well as monotherapy and earlier I-O assets, targeted therapies and chemo, both internally and externally."

And with respect to your chemotherapy question, just to add, again, to what Francis said, what's really interesting that we are seeing in the marketplace in the very early days of our launch in second line is the speed at which chemotherapy is being abandoned. There is clearly concerns with the limitations in terms of long-term efficacy, and obviously, the side effects are something that physicians and patients are actually being really excited about abandoning as well. So I think that's an important first early learning from the marketplace."

Second, I saw some commentary that potentially the ARISTOTLE data may allow for approval in some subtypes of bilateral AF, which is not possible for your competitors in that space. To what extent do you intend to prosecute this? And could it be used as an additional competitive tool in that market?

And I think it's really important to say, we never expected that every I-O agent in every tumor was going to be successful. But again, we're here to follow the science and generate the data. Now I think it's also fair to say that based on the preclinical science and the promising clinical data we've seen, our strategy is rapidly evolving to studying combinations of Yervoy and Opdivo in multiple tumors. So just to talk about small cell for a moment, we presented data at ASCO versus CheckMate -032 study that showed activity in platinum-sensitive and resistant patients in both monotherapy, but even more interesting, in combination and with very good tolerability. And I think it's also important to say we've shown activity in prostate cancer with Yervoy, even though we didn't actually meet our primary endpoints. So let me say that I think we believe in the importance of the complementary mechanism of actions in I-O. We are firmly committed to Yervoy, which I think is a very important part of our combination strategy, combined with Opdivo in multiple tumors. And I think it's important to say that we're making very good progress at the moment in melanoma with validation of our EU combo filing just this week, and we have the upcoming PDUFA date at the end of September for the U.S. post -069 filing. Turning to the ARISTOTLE data. I'm not going to get into the details of our regulatory strategy around this, but we are looking at every opportunity to use what we believe is a very important dataset, talking to KOLs and the regulatory authorities in terms of providing additional information for this very important area."

Let me just ask the first -- answer the first question on diversification, and then Francis will make some comments on combination strategies. So my perspective is that, obviously, at the center of our strategy is immuno-oncology. And as I said at the beginning, when we think about the next period of growth between now and 2020, the next 5 years, our growth will come disproportionately from Opdivo and Eliquis. And within Opdivo, obviously, there is an element of diversification as well because our starting strategy is really focused on lung, melanoma and renal cell, but then we are expanding into a large number of other tumor opportunities. Longer term, we believe we have an exciting early pipeline within immuno-oncology and in a select number of areas in which we are focused that can drive our growth in the medium and the long term. And the areas are the ones we've discussed before, so CV with a focus on heart failure, immunology and the areas of fibrosis and genetically defined diseases. In all of those areas, we have ongoing programs, which are early but are potentially transformative. And with respect to how we complement that, our business development strategy is -- does not change, and it's really the strategy that we've articulated before. I think that one of our core strengths as a company is really our ability to complement internal R&D with business development. We've clearly demonstrated that in fibrosis with the recent agreements we had and even in CV through our deal with uniQure. So you will see us continue to execute our strategy in business development to complement our internal programs there."

It's -- we have 2 studies in first line, 2 registration-potential studies: one in monotherapy, the -026 in PD-L1-expressing patients. And this provides the quickest way to bring Opdivo to first-line patients. And I think based on the data we presented at ASCO, that we are very enthusiastic about that study. As you noted, we do have a registration study of Opdivo and Yervoy together, which has started in both expressers and non-expressers of PD-L1, and that's the next likely potential positive study. So we believe that Opdivo will be foundational and that its nivo combos have the best potential to further improve survival and to replace chemotherapy, as Giovanni mentioned earlier. Now obviously, earlier, we have a LAG-3 program in combination with nivo. That's in early-stage testing. We hope to see some data on that next year. And behind that, we have a bold initiative to bring forward 6 additional assets into the clinic in the next 18 months, and some of these would be certainly natural to expect to combine with nivolumab.

As it relates to bottom line and how we potentially see leverage, we -- to seize on that opportunity, as we continue to see the evolution of data and not only that but our performance in the market, we see that it's required to continue to invest to maximize that opportunity. And I don't necessarily see that a leverage -- I can't comment on 2016, but as I look further out to the back end of this decade, I will say that, that will ultimately improve our leverage."

So we will work, obviously, very closely with each of the payers in Europe to help them understand the full breadth of the data. As Giovanni has highlighted, we are in a position to describe the efficacy of Opdivo across a broad range of second-line patients and across a broad range of histologies.

But Opdivo is seeing lifts in a non-promoted setting there. And in lung, we've really had a very rapid penetration of the squamous second-line market. We're gaining about 2/3 of new patients there, and that happened very rapidly. And then since NCCN updated June 12, post-ASCO, we've also seen a very nice uptick in lung overall.

So we think it's very important to understand, as we are with I-O agents, the sequence and actually explore exactly what the right approach to this might be. Those studies are ongoing. We don't have any plans at the moment. We have no data, but no plans to present yet. But obviously, some time in the future, we will be doing that."

I think that when we look at our business, the period between now and 2020, the next 5 years, the growth, as I said, is clearly -- will clearly come disproportionately from the growth of Opdivo and the potential of Eliquis. Within Opdivo, there is a degree of diversification. Long term, as we think about a second cycle, we are thinking about our early pipeline generating opportunities that are more diversified for us within immuno-oncology because, as Francis mentioned, we have, clearly, assets in the clinics. We're bringing 6 more assets into the clinic. So there is an element of diversification, which is already within immuno-oncology, but then we have exciting early programs so -- in the other areas. So it is a concept that does not require us to change our approach, and in fact, what I mentioned at the beginning importantly, is that our business development strategy remains pretty much the same. Let me ask Murdo to give you some perspective on payers."

It is a privilege to be here as CEO to lead today's call with you and to tell you how excited I am about our future, about the opportunities we have before us. Building on our success over the past few years,",1092,"Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. It is a privilege to be here as CEO to lead today's call with you and to tell you how excited I am about our future, about the opportunities we have before us. 
Building on our success over the past few years, we are beginning an exciting new chapter, one characterized by the opportunity for growth, for leading a transformation in the way cancer is treated and for strengthening and expanding our diversified portfolio of specialty medicines. And we are starting this next chapter from a position of strength. We have an established, proven strategy. We have a strong portfolio of marketed products. We have a promising pipeline and exceptional talent. 
I am fully confident that we are well positioned to build on and further strengthen our leadership position in immuno-oncology through Opdivo. I'm also confident we can deliver on the promise of our portfolio and our pipeline, within immuno-oncology and beyond immuno-oncology. As I mentioned, we are about to begin a period of growth. Over the next 5 years, we expect growth to come primarily from Opdivo and Eliquis, with important contribution from the rest of our existing portfolio of innovative medicines. 
With Opdivo, we will leverage our leadership position in lung, melanoma and renal cancers. In non-small cell lung, we are extremely well positioned given the 2 positive Phase III studies demonstrating improved overall survival. In melanoma, Opdivo and Yervoy are currently marketed, and we believe the combination regimen will be an important treatment option for patients. In renal cancer, the early stop of study -025 announced this Monday due to an advantage in overall survival confirms the promise of Opdivo in this important disease, where unmet need remains high and where we have a significant time advantage versus other competitors. 
This morning, we announced that the European Commission validated 2 Opdivo applications: one for non-squamous cell lung cancer and the other in combination with Yervoy for metastatic melanoma. Additionally, as you know, our Opdivo development program is extremely broad, with a number of ongoing studies across many tumors. We are confident this will add to the opportunity over time. 
With Eliquis, given the breadth of its label and the strength of its prescription trends, we are very encouraged and look to build on our momentum. And regarding the rest of our marketed products, trends are good, and we have the right resources in place to continue to compete and grow.  Longer term, we are committed to a diversified portfolio. This starts with and includes diversification within immuno-oncology into new mechanisms and new combinations as well as outside of I-O, in key areas such as fibrosis, heart failure, immunology and certain genetically defined diseases. 
Over the last several months, I have reviewed our growth opportunities, and they are, for us, unprecedented. I have also focused on what we need to do to maximize them, and I am fully committed to making the right strategic investments. In that context and as indicated in April, we have identified areas of incremental investment beginning in the second half of the year: investments in commercial to make sure we are well resourced globally to compete, specifically for Opdivo, Eliquis and elotuzumab, and investments in R&D, particularly in I-O; in development to accelerate and broaden programs where possible; in early discovery to accelerate new mechanisms and combinations; and in our medical organization in terms of new data generation and increasing field medical resources. 
Now with respect to our second quarter, I am very pleased with our performance. Sales were strong, and we had significant and meaningful clinical and regulatory milestones in the quarter. We delivered 7% overall sales growth year-over-year, demonstrating the strength of our products across all markets. Charlie will describe key elements of our performance in more detail. 
Let me spend a moment on immuno-oncology. For Opdivo, we have had an incredible year so far, with 3 early study stops, significant data presented at ASCO, 3 filings, 3 approvals and commercial launches in both the U.S. and Europe. In the U.S., we are seeing early encouraging trends for Opdivo in terms of access, reimbursement and adoption, and I feel really good about where we are headed. Lung cancer is a very important opportunity for our company. We were first to market with squamous cell, and Opdivo has already been added to NCCN Guidelines for non-squamous. In Europe, we have received approval for Opdivo in both first- and second-line metastatic melanoma. Just this week, we were also approved for squamous lung cancer. 
While the vast majority of data from our programs in I-O to date has been positive, we know that not everything we study will be successful, as evidenced by the 2 studies for Yervoy in prostate and small cell lung cancer that did not meet their primary endpoints. Francis can comment further, as we are firmly committed to Yervoy, which is an important part of our immuno-oncology strategy in combination with Opdivo in multiple tumors. 
Just a couple of additional immuno-oncology highlights. In the coming weeks, we expect to complete the filing of -057 data in the U.S. and Europe, and we are working on submissions for elotuzumab based on ELOQUENT-2. 
I want to spend a moment now on hepatitis C. Here, we had a very strong second quarter. Performance was good in both Japan and Europe, and we had a onetime impact from previously deferred revenues in France. Additionally, we have made significant progress in the U.S. We have filed Daklinza in combination with sofosbuvir for the treatment of genotype 3 patients, and our PDUFA date is August 13. And we plan to add supplemental filings later this year in other difficult-to-treat areas. 
The hepatitis C market continues to evolve rapidly. Given our focused strategy and the evolving competitive landscape, we do not plan to seek regulatory approval for our triple regimen, or TRIO, in the U.S. or Europe. We will continue to evaluate our filing strategy on a country-by-country basis, and we'll make decisions based upon the specific needs of patients in each country. Going forward, we expect competitive launches later this year to affect our business, particularly in Japan. That said, we will continue to execute our HCV strategy, focused on addressing the needs of specific challenging-to-treat HCV patient populations, which may vary by market. 
So with all of that, let me now turn the floor over to Charlie, who will walk you through key elements of our performance in Q2 as well as the financial implications reflected in our updated guidance."

As Giovanni mentioned, we had a very good quarter, which was driven by strong sales growth of 7%, or 16% excluding the impact of foreign exchange.

As Giovanni mentioned, we had a very good quarter, which was driven by strong sales growth of 7%, or 16% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Overall, FX had a negative impact on EPS of approximately $0.06. 
Let me provide a few highlights. Eliquis sales were $437 million, up 23% sequentially from the first quarter, with good growth both in the U.S. and international. We continue to see strong new-to-brand prescription trends with both cardiologists and primary care physicians across the broad market. 
Opdivo sales were $122 million for the quarter. We are seeing strong performance metrics with the approval in lung cancer, with encouraging early trends in terms of access, reimbursement and abandonment of chemo in second-line squamous lung cancer in the U.S.  Additionally, we received EU approval in both first- and second-line melanoma last month and have launched in Germany, where early trends are strong. And as noted by Giovanni, we just received approval for squamous lung cancer in the EU as well. Opdivo has now been approved in over 30 countries. 
Yervoy sales in the U.S. were $136 million in the second quarter, a 21% decrease from prior year. Outside the U.S., sales totaled $160 million, which is a 28% increase excluding FX. And as expected, we are seeing an impact on Yervoy from the PD-1 class in the U.S. This will likely continue in the short term until the Opdivo plus Yervoy combination regimen is approved later this year. Longer term, we believe Yervoy could have an important role to play in combination with Opdivo in multiple tumors. 
Hep C sales were very strong for the quarter at $479 million. Included in sales for the quarter is a onetime positive impact of $170 million related to an early access program in France that had previously been deferred until pricing was finalized. This now happened in Q2. Hep C sales performance in Japan was strong, but as you know, the competitive landscape continues to evolve.  
We continue to see solid growth from both Orencia and Sprycel, which grew 15% and 10%, respectively. HIV sales were down 14%, as the HIV market is increasingly competitive, having an impact on our business. 
Now let me highlight a couple of items from our non-GAAP P&L. Gross margin was favorable 80 basis points compared to prior year, primarily due to the positive impact from foreign exchange, partially offset by product mix related to higher sales of Eliquis and lower sales of ABILIFY. 
Compared with our first quarter, gross margin is down 360 basis points.  Recall that last quarter, we had a onetime benefit of previously accrued royalties and a full quarter of ABILIFY sales. 
Operating expenses were somewhat higher than last year as we have been investing behind Eliquis, hep C and Opdivo. Our tax rate for the quarter is 2 percentage points higher than last year. Our quarterly tax rate will fluctuate based on earnings mix, and remember that the R&D tax credit has yet to be passed by Congress. 
Now let me provide some comments on our revised guidance. For revenues, we have increased our guidance range based on strong overall sales trends with our key growth products, including Eliquis, hep C, Orencia and Opdivo. In thinking through sales for the remainder of 2015, I would like to highlight a few dynamics. In hep C, I mentioned there was a onetime positive impact of $170 million from France. This will not recur. Additionally, hep C will become increasingly competitive for us, particularly in Japan, where we expect a significant impact on our sales going forward. 
And as I commented earlier on Yervoy, we are seeing an impact on the U.S. business from the PD-1 class. Also remember that we have restructured our Erbitux agreement. We expect Lilly to take over full commercialization in October, at which point we will no longer book sales but will instead record the royalties we receive in other income. 
I will now move on to operating expenses for the remainder of this year. As Giovanni mentioned, we are committed to making the right investments to capitalize on what we think are real growth opportunities. And as you recall, I mentioned in April that we were in the process of reviewing additional new investments. We have since made strategic choices to invest in programs that we feel are necessary to maintain a leadership position in immuno-oncology as well as to support other important growth products, including Eliquis and elotuzumab. These investments are included in our revised guidance. 
Commercially, we are adding resources globally to fully support the launches of Opdivo and elotuzumab and also behind Eliquis to support continued strong growth. For Opdivo, we are making additional investments in R&D, medical, A&P, and we are increasing investments to accelerate Opdivo development programs where possible and also to accelerate the development of new mechanisms and additional combination regimens. We are adding resources in our medical organization, which include additional trials to generate data and also increase the field medical resources, which will be important for driving awareness of Opdivo both in the U.S. and around the world. These investments are not discrete. These are programs that are beginning in the second half of this year but will continue into 2016. 
In summary, we are encouraged by our good clinical results and strong underlying sales trends and metrics from our key brands that are important to our future growth outlook. And in order to capitalize on our growth opportunities, we are making the right strategic investments. We'd be happy now to address your questions."

So thank you very much for that question. We have not seen any difficulty in recruiting patients for any of our studies with Opdivo or, indeed, the combination, and certainly, it's not related to the ability to look for PD-L1 expression or not. I would say, as a physician, obviously, the less one has to do to be able to treat the patient and really have a good idea of the benefits, that makes a lot of sense. So we are very happy that we're heading towards broad labels for the tumors we're looking at and will fully characterize the PD-L1 expression. Moving to the combinations with chemotherapy, we believe we have very comprehensive dataset now with various chemotherapy, nivo combinations, probably with the longest follow-up in the industry. Based on our comprehensive data from CheckMate -012, combinations of Opdivo with conventional chemo regimens may sometimes achieve high and durable responses. But we've seen, with longer follow-up, that the survival at a year was actually no different for Opdivo combinations with chemo compared to Opdivo monotherapy. In effect, what we saw was additive, but nondurable, response rates at the cost of additional toxicity. Now just to put this in context, we showed at ASCO last time, one year survival for Opdivo monotherapy of about 70% to 85% regardless of PD-L1 expression. So we are focused on the Opdivo,Yervoy combo, and we'll, in addition, continue to explore other scientifically driven combinations to advance our first-line strategy and our position. We are additionally interested in nontraditional chemo combo regimens, including innovative approaches to sequences and maintenance. So let me just remind you, our strategy for first line is to improve survival and replace platinum doublets. And to do this, we are exploring multiple Opdivo combinations as well as monotherapy and earlier I-O assets, targeted therapies and chemo, both internally and externally."

And with respect to your chemotherapy question, just to add, again, to what Francis said, what's really interesting that we are seeing in the marketplace in the very early days of our launch in second line is the speed at which chemotherapy is being abandoned. There is clearly concerns with the limitations in terms of long-term efficacy, and obviously, the side effects are something that physicians and patients are actually being really excited about abandoning as well.

Now I think it's also fair to say that based on the preclinical science and the promising clinical data we've seen, our strategy is rapidly evolving to studying combinations of Yervoy and Opdivo in multiple tumors. So just to talk about small cell for a moment, we presented data at ASCO versus CheckMate -032 study that showed activity in platinum-sensitive and resistant patients in both monotherapy, but even more interestingly, in combination and with very good tolerability. And I think it's also important to say we've shown activity in prostate cancer with Yervoy, even though we didn't actually meet our primary endpoints. So let me say that I think we believe in the importance of the complementary mechanism of actions in I-O. We are firmly committed to Yervoy, which I think is a very important part of our combination strategy, combined with Opdivo, in multiple tumors.

We're starting to see the unwind of the favorable foreign exchange we see in the first half, and also remember that the expenses that both Giovanni and I spoke about earlier, by and large, accrue to us in the second half of this year."

Let me just ask the first -- answer the first question on diversification, and then Francis will make some comments on combination strategies. So my perspective is that, obviously, at the center of our strategy is immuno-oncology. And as I said at the beginning, when we think about the next period of growth, between now and 2020, the next 5 years, our growth will come disproportionately from Opdivo and Eliquis. And within Opdivo, obviously, there is an element of diversification as well because our starting strategy is really focused on lung, melanoma and renal cell, but then we are expanding into a large number of other tumor opportunities. Longer term, we believe we have an exciting early pipeline within immuno-oncology and in a select number of areas in which we are focused that can drive our growth in the medium and the long term. And the areas are the ones we've discussed before, so CV with a focus on heart failure, immunology and the areas of fibrosis and genetically defined diseases. In all of those areas, we have ongoing programs, which are early but are potentially transformative. And with respect to how we complement that, our business development strategy is -- does not change, and it's really the strategy that we've articulated before. I think that one of our core strengths as a company is really our ability to complement internal R&D with business development. We've clearly demonstrated that in fibrosis with the recent agreements we had and even in CV through our deal with uniQure. So you will see us continue to execute our strategy in business development to complement our internal programs there."

It's -- we have 2 studies in first line, 2 registration-potential studies: one in monotherapy, the -026 in PD-L1-expressing patients. And this provides the quickest way to bring Opdivo to first-line patients. And I think based on the data we presented at ASCO, that -- we are very enthusiastic about that study. As you noted, we do have a registration study of Opdivo and Yervoy together, which has started, in both expressers and non-expressers of PD-L1, and that's the next likely potential positive study. So we believe that Opdivo will be foundational and that ipi, nivo combos have the best potential to further improve survival and to replace chemotherapy, as Giovanni mentioned earlier. Now obviously, earlier, we have a LAG-3 program in combination with nivo that's in early-stage testing. We hope to see some data on that next year. And behind that, we have a bold initiative to bring forward 6 additional assets into the clinic in the next 18 months, and some of these would be certainly natural to expect to combine with nivolumab. So we have a near-, medium- and long-term opportunity to look at different approaches to first-line lung cancer and replace chemotherapy."

And so the first thing to look at in these 2 will be the tolerability. As far as the efficacy is concerned, as you know, we've focused pretty much on the durability of responses or overall survival or one-year landmark survival. And as I said, we have 6-month survival for all patients in this study and its maturing. So it's really about this therapeutic index, both tolerability and efficacy. In terms of the chemo data, I believe we have presented some of that. Obviously, as is important with these exploratory studies, the data matures and continues to become more informative with time. Can't tell you exactly when we will be presenting it, but we will be some time in the future. And just an R&D comment on the cabo data, obviously, we haven't seen the full dataset. But I think if you look at our Phase II monotherapy data for Opdivo in renal cell, I think we showed superior efficacy to TKIs, with also TKI -- sorry, with superiority in terms of tolerability also."

The initial launch in melanoma was a strong launch, obviously, in second line. What we are seeing now is that we are about at parity with KEYTRUDA in the community setting, and we're gaining good market share in the institutional setting. I will say in melanoma, we're also seeing some off-label usage since ASCO of PD-1 inhibitors in frontline. As you recall from Charlie and Giovanni's remarks, that's put some pressure on Yervoy. But Opdivo is seeing lift in a non-promoted setting there. And in lung, we've really had a very rapid penetration of the squamous second-line market. We're getting about 2/3 of new patients there, and that happened very rapidly. And then since NCCN updated June 12, post-ASCO, we've also seen a very nice uptick in lung overall. Clearly, that's another off-label indication given that we're only promoting in squamous right now. So I would say very soon, we'll see lung eclipsing our melanoma business, and we'll see some nice growth out of Opdivo this year."

In the U.S., we are seeing very balanced uptake, so we're seeing very rapid adoption in second-line squamous in the community and in the academic setting. As you may recall, we did a large amount of education around immuno-oncology when we launched Yervoy. And I think having a broad understanding about how immune checkpoint inhibitors work, the safety profile being particularly good with nivolumab has helped us have a very rapid penetration in the community, and so I think we'll expect that to continue with broadening indications. In Europe, we're very encouraged by what we've seen, as Giovanni mentioned, in Germany. I would say that the enthusiasm and interest in second-line squamous and in first- and second-line melanoma is very high. I think obviously, as you know, that the rate limiter in many European markets will be how quickly we can secure market access, and we have a lot of people on the ground working very closely with the payers and reimbursement authorities across Europe to expedite that as best as possible while still securing a good reimbursement price."

The opposite one is that you might actually be causing some immunosuppression with chemotherapy and actually reducing the benefits of I-O. And of course, what we have seen is probably better one-year survival in our exploratory studies in first line with Opdivo than with second line. There might be other features involved with that, too. So we think it's very important to understand, as we are with I-O agents, the sequence and actually explore exactly what the right approach to this might be. Those studies are ongoing. We don't have any plans at the moment. We have no data, but no plans to present yet. But obviously, some time in the future, we will be doing that."

Within Opdivo, there is a degree of diversification. Long term, as we think about a second cycle, we are thinking about our early pipeline-generating opportunities that are more diversified for us within immuno-oncology, because, as Francis mentioned, we have, clearly, assets in the clinics. We're bringing 6 more assets into the clinic. So there is an element of diversification which is already within immuno-oncology, but then we have exciting early programs so -- in the other areas. So it is a concept that does not require us to change our approach, and in fact, what I mentioned at the beginning, importantly, is that our business development strategy remains pretty much the same.

Building on our success over the past few years,",1092,"Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. It is a privilege to be here as CEO to lead today's call with you and to tell you how excited I am about our future, about the opportunities we have before us. 
Building on our success over the past few years, we are beginning an exciting new chapter, one characterized by the opportunity for growth, for leading a transformation in the way cancer is treated and for strengthening and expanding our diversified portfolio of specialty medicines. And we are starting this next chapter from a position of strength. We have an established, proven strategy. We have a strong portfolio of marketed products. We have a promising pipeline and exceptional talent. 
I am fully confident that we are well positioned to build on and further strengthen our leadership position in immuno-oncology through Opdivo. I'm also confident we can deliver on the promise of our portfolio and our pipeline, within immuno-oncology and beyond immuno-oncology. As I mentioned, we are about to begin a period of growth. Over the next 5 years, we expect growth to come primarily from Opdivo and Eliquis, with important contribution from the rest of our existing portfolio of innovative medicines. 
With Opdivo, we will leverage our leadership position in lung, melanoma and renal cancers. In non-small cell lung, we are extremely well positioned given the 2 positive Phase III studies demonstrating improved overall survival. In melanoma, Opdivo and Yervoy are currently marketed, and we believe the combination regimen will be an important treatment option for patients. In renal cancer, the early stop of study -025 announced this Monday due to an advantage in overall survival confirms the promise of Opdivo in this important disease, where unmet need remains high and where we have a significant time advantage versus other competitors. 
This morning, we announced that the European Commission validated 2 Opdivo applications: one for non-squamous cell lung cancer and the other in combination with Yervoy for metastatic melanoma. Additionally, as you know, our Opdivo development program is extremely broad, with a number of ongoing studies across many tumors. We are confident this will add to the opportunity over time. 
With Eliquis, given the breadth of its label and the strength of its prescription trends, we are very encouraged and look to build on our momentum. And regarding the rest of our marketed products, trends are good, and we have the right resources in place to continue to compete and grow.  Longer term, we are committed to a diversified portfolio. This starts with and includes diversification within immuno-oncology into new mechanisms and new combinations as well as outside of I-O, in key areas such as fibrosis, heart failure, immunology and certain genetically defined diseases. 
Over the last several months, I have reviewed our growth opportunities, and they are, for us, unprecedented. I have also focused on what we need to do to maximize them, and I am fully committed to making the right strategic investments. In that context and as indicated in April, we have identified areas of incremental investment beginning in the second half of the year: investments in commercial to make sure we are well resourced globally to compete, specifically for Opdivo, Eliquis and elotuzumab, and investments in R&D, particularly in I-O; in development to accelerate and broaden programs where possible; in early discovery to accelerate new mechanisms and combinations; and in our medical organization in terms of new data generation and increasing field medical resources. 
Now with respect to our second quarter, I am very pleased with our performance. Sales were strong, and we had significant and meaningful clinical and regulatory milestones in the quarter. We delivered 7% overall sales growth year-over-year, demonstrating the strength of our products across all markets. Charlie will describe key elements of our performance in more detail. 
Let me spend a moment on immuno-oncology. For Opdivo, we have had an incredible year so far, with 3 early study stops, significant data presented at ASCO, 3 filings, 3 approvals and commercial launches in both the U.S. and Europe. In the U.S., we are seeing early encouraging trends for Opdivo in terms of access, reimbursement and adoption, and I feel really good about where we are headed. Lung cancer is a very important opportunity for our company. We were first to market with squamous cell, and Opdivo has already been added to NCCN Guidelines for non-squamous. In Europe, we have received approval for Opdivo in both first- and second-line metastatic melanoma. Just this week, we were also approved for squamous lung cancer. 
While the vast majority of data from our programs in I-O to date has been positive, we know that not everything we study will be successful, as evidenced by the 2 studies for Yervoy in prostate and small cell lung cancer that did not meet their primary endpoints. Francis can comment further, as we are firmly committed to Yervoy, which is an important part of our immuno-oncology strategy in combination with Opdivo in multiple tumors. 
Just a couple of additional immuno-oncology highlights. In the coming weeks, we expect to complete the filing of -057 data in the U.S. and Europe, and we are working on submissions for elotuzumab based on ELOQUENT-2. 
I want to spend a moment now on hepatitis C. Here, we had a very strong second quarter. Performance was good in both Japan and Europe, and we had a onetime impact from previously deferred revenues in France. Additionally, we have made significant progress in the U.S. We have filed Daklinza in combination with sofosbuvir for the treatment of genotype 3 patients, and our PDUFA date is August 13. And we plan to add supplemental filings later this year in other difficult-to-treat areas. 
The hepatitis C market continues to evolve rapidly. Given our focused strategy and the evolving competitive landscape, we do not plan to seek regulatory approval for our triple regimen, or TRIO, in the U.S. or Europe. We will continue to evaluate our filing strategy on a country-by-country basis, and we'll make decisions based upon the specific needs of patients in each country. Going forward, we expect competitive launches later this year to affect our business, particularly in Japan. That said, we will continue to execute our HCV strategy, focused on addressing the needs of specific challenging-to-treat HCV patient populations, which may vary by market. 
So with all of that, let me now turn the floor over to Charlie, who will walk you through key elements of our performance in Q2 as well as the financial implications reflected in our updated guidance."
25798,304350132,837831,"Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 23, 2015",2015-07-23,"Earnings Calls","Bristol-Myers Squibb Company","Executives","Thank you, Giovanni, and good morning, everyone. As Giovanni mentioned, we had a very good quarter, which was driven by strong sales growth of 7%, or 16% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Overall, FX had a negative impact on EPS of approximately $",934,"Thank you, Giovanni, and good morning, everyone. As Giovanni mentioned, we had a very good quarter, which was driven by strong sales growth of 7%, or 16% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Overall, FX had a negative impact on EPS of approximately $0.06. 
Let me provide a few highlights. Eliquis sales were $437 million, up 23% sequentially from the first quarter, with good growth both in the U.S. and international. We continue to see strong new-to-brand prescription trends with both cardiologists and primary care physicians across the broad market. 
Opdivo sales were $122 million for the quarter. We are seeing strong performance metrics with the approval in lung cancer, with encouraging early trends in terms of access, reimbursement and abandonment of chemo in second-line squamous lung cancer in the U.S.  Additionally, we received EU approval in both first- and second-line melanoma last month and have launched in Germany, where early trends are strong. And as noted by Giovanni, we just received approval for squamous lung cancer in the EU as well. Opdivo has now been approved in over 30 countries. 
Yervoy sales in the U.S. were $136 million in the second quarter, a 21% decrease from prior year. Outside the U.S., sales totaled $160 million, which is a 28% increase excluding FX. And as expected, we are seeing an impact on Yervoy from the PD-1 class in the U.S. This will likely continue in the short term until the Opdivo plus Yervoy combination regimen is approved later this year. Longer term, we believe Yervoy could have an important role to play in combination with Opdivo in multiple tumors. 
Hep C sales were very strong for the quarter at $479 million. Included in sales for the quarter is a onetime positive impact of $170 million related to an early access program in France that had previously been deferred until pricing was finalized. This now happened in Q2. Hep C sales performance in Japan was strong, but as you know, the competitive landscape continues to evolve.  
We continue to see solid growth from both Orencia and Sprycel, which grew 15% and 10%, respectively. HIV sales were down 14%, as the HIV market is increasingly competitive, having an impact on our business. 
Now let me highlight a couple of items from our non-GAAP P&L. Gross margin was favorable 80 basis points compared to prior year, primarily due to the positive impact from foreign exchange, partially offset by product mix related to higher sales of Eliquis and lower sales of ABILIFY. 
Compared with our first quarter, gross margin is down 360 basis points.  Recall that last quarter, we had a onetime benefit of previously accrued royalties and a full quarter of ABILIFY sales. 
Operating expenses were somewhat higher than last year as we have been investing behind Eliquis, hep C and Opdivo. Our tax rate for the quarter is 2 percentage points higher than last year. Our quarterly tax rate will fluctuate based on earnings mix, and remember that the R&D tax credit has yet to be passed by Congress. 
Now let me provide some comments on our revised guidance. For revenues, we have increased our guidance range based on strong overall sales trends with our key growth products, including Eliquis, hep C, Orencia and Opdivo. In thinking through sales for the remainder of 2015, I would like to highlight a few dynamics. In hep C, I mentioned there was a onetime positive impact of $170 million from France. This will not recur. Additionally, hep C will become increasingly competitive for us, particularly in Japan, where we expect a significant impact on our sales going forward. 
And as I commented earlier on Yervoy, we are seeing an impact on the U.S. business from the PD-1 class. Also remember that we have restructured our Erbitux agreement. We expect Lilly to take over full commercialization in October, at which point we will no longer book sales but will instead record the royalties we receive in other income. 
I will now move on to operating expenses for the remainder of this year. As Giovanni mentioned, we are committed to making the right investments to capitalize on what we think are real growth opportunities. And as you recall, I mentioned in April that we were in the process of reviewing additional new investments. We have since made strategic choices to invest in programs that we feel are necessary to maintain a leadership position in immuno-oncology as well as to support other important growth products, including Eliquis and elotuzumab. These investments are included in our revised guidance. 
Commercially, we are adding resources globally to fully support the launches of Opdivo and elotuzumab and also behind Eliquis to support continued strong growth. For Opdivo, we are making additional investments in R&D, medical, A&P, and we are increasing investments to accelerate Opdivo development programs where possible and also to accelerate the development of new mechanisms and additional combination regimens. We are adding resources in our medical organization, which include additional trials to generate data and also increase the field medical resources, which will be important for driving awareness of Opdivo both in the U.S. and around the world. These investments are not discrete. These are programs that are beginning in the second half of this year but will continue into 2016. 
In summary, we are encouraged by our good clinical results and strong underlying sales trends and metrics from our key brands that are important to our future growth outlook. And in order to capitalize on our growth opportunities, we are making the right strategic investments. We'd be happy now to address your questions."

First, in Bristol's all-comer trials versus its PD-L1 selected trials, is there a meaningful difference in the rate of patient enrollment?

So thank you very much for that question. We have not seen any difficulty in recruiting patients for any of our studies with Opdivo or, indeed, the combination, and certainly, it's not related to the ability to look for PD-L1 expression or not. I would say, as a physician, obviously, the less one has to do to be able to treat the patient and really have a good idea of the benefits, that makes a lot of sense. So we are very happy that we're heading towards broad labels for the tumors we're looking at and will fully characterize the PD-L1 expression. Moving to the combinations with chemotherapy, we believe we have very comprehensive dataset now with various chemotherapy, nivo combinations, probably with the longest follow-up in the industry. Based on our comprehensive data from CheckMate -012, combinations of Opdivo with conventional chemo regimens may sometimes achieve high and durable responses. But we've seen, with longer follow-up, that the survival at a year was actually no different for Opdivo combinations with chemo compared to Opdivo monotherapy. In effect, what we saw was additive, but nondurable, response rates at the cost of additional toxicity. Now just to put this in context, we showed at ASCO last time, one year survival for Opdivo monotherapy of about 70% to 85% regardless of PD-L1 expression. So we are focused on the Opdivo,Yervoy combo, and we'll, in addition, continue to explore other scientifically driven combinations to advance our first-line strategy and our position. We are additionally interested in nontraditional chemo combo regimens, including innovative approaches to sequences and maintenance. So let me just remind you, our strategy for first line is to improve survival and replace platinum doublets. And to do this, we are exploring multiple Opdivo combinations as well as monotherapy and earlier I-O assets, targeted therapies and chemo, both internally and externally."

And with respect to your chemotherapy question, just to add, again, to what Francis said, what's really interesting that we are seeing in the marketplace in the very early days of our launch in second line is the speed at which chemotherapy is being abandoned. There is clearly concerns with the limitations in terms of long-term efficacy, and obviously, the side effects are something that physicians and patients are actually being really excited about abandoning as well.

And I think it's really important to say, we never expected that every I-O agent in every tumor was going to be successful. But again, we're here to follow the science and generate the data. Now I think it's also fair to say that based on the preclinical science and the promising clinical data we've seen, our strategy is rapidly evolving to studying combinations of Yervoy and Opdivo in multiple tumors. So just to talk about small cell for a moment, we presented data at ASCO versus CheckMate -032 study that showed activity in platinum-sensitive and resistant patients in both monotherapy, but even more interestingly, in combination and with very good tolerability. And I think it's also important to say we've shown activity in prostate cancer with Yervoy, even though we didn't actually meet our primary endpoints. So let me say that I think we believe in the importance of the complementary mechanism of actions in I-O. We are firmly committed to Yervoy, which I think is a very important part of our combination strategy, combined with Opdivo, in multiple tumors. And I think it's important to say that we're making very good progress at the moment in melanoma with validation of our EU combo filing just this week, and we have the upcoming PDUFA date at the end of September for the U.S. post -069 filing. Turning to the ARISTOTLE data.

Let me just ask the first -- answer the first question on diversification, and then Francis will make some comments on combination strategies. So my perspective is that, obviously, at the center of our strategy is immuno-oncology. And as I said at the beginning, when we think about the next period of growth, between now and 2020, the next 5 years, our growth will come disproportionately from Opdivo and Eliquis. And within Opdivo, obviously, there is an element of diversification as well because our starting strategy is really focused on lung, melanoma and renal cell, but then we are expanding into a large number of other tumor opportunities. Longer term, we believe we have an exciting early pipeline within immuno-oncology and in a select number of areas in which we are focused that can drive our growth in the medium and the long term. And the areas are the ones we've discussed before, so CV with a focus on heart failure, immunology and the areas of fibrosis and genetically defined diseases. In all of those areas, we have ongoing programs, which are early but are potentially transformative. And with respect to how we complement that, our business development strategy is -- does not change, and it's really the strategy that we've articulated before. I think that one of our core strengths as a company is really our ability to complement internal R&D with business development. We've clearly demonstrated that in fibrosis with the recent agreements we had and even in CV through our deal with uniQure. So you will see us continue to execute our strategy in business development to complement our internal programs there."

It's -- we have 2 studies in first line, 2 registration-potential studies: one in monotherapy, the -026 in PD-L1-expressing patients. And this provides the quickest way to bring Opdivo to first-line patients. And I think based on the data we presented at ASCO, that -- we are very enthusiastic about that study. As you noted, we do have a registration study of Opdivo and Yervoy together, which has started, in both expressers and non-expressers of PD-L1, and that's the next likely potential positive study. So we believe that Opdivo will be foundational and that ipi, nivo combos have the best potential to further improve survival and to replace chemotherapy, as Giovanni mentioned earlier. Now obviously, earlier, we have a LAG-3 program in combination with nivo that's in early-stage testing. We hope to see some data on that next year. And behind that, we have a bold initiative to bring forward 6 additional assets into the clinic in the next 18 months, and some of these would be certainly natural to expect to combine with nivolumab.

As far as the regulatory strategy, I'm not going to go into detail, but I think as you see, we've shown recently in melanoma and lung, we can work together, and very quickly, with the FDA and other health authorities. And we'll be looking to submit that data as soon as possible. Let me just talk about the other data that might be coming out. I think in addition to the 9 registration studies in the last year that we've had positive data, we have a further 25 either ongoing or planned. You mentioned some of them. As we look forward, obviously, it depends on the data, although I will say improvements is going well. But we may see information next year, in 2016, in Hodgkin's, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and bladder, potentially, and potentially some others. So it's going to be -- we're going to continue seeing differentiated data, which is what we're trying to do.

What were the features that you think were differentiated? Separately, your comments on the datasets in combination with chemotherapy are helpful. But when might we actually see that data really showing the diminution of the durable responses over time?

So what percentage of Opdivo patients are in -- are melanoma patients? What percent are squamous lung? And what percent are non-squamous? And if I could, just one final question.

And as I said, we have 6-month survival for all patients in this study and its maturing. So it's really about this therapeutic index, both tolerability and efficacy. In terms of the chemo data, I believe we have presented some of that. Obviously, as is important with these exploratory studies, the data matures and continues to become more informative with time. Can't tell you exactly when we will be presenting it, but we will be some time in the future. And just an R&D comment on the cabo data, obviously, we haven't seen the full dataset.

What we are seeing now is that we are about at parity with KEYTRUDA in the community setting, and we're gaining good market share in the institutional setting. I will say in melanoma, we're also seeing some off-label usage since ASCO of PD-1 inhibitors in frontline. As you recall from Charlie and Giovanni's remarks, that's put some pressure on Yervoy. But Opdivo is seeing lift in a non-promoted setting there. And in lung, we've really had a very rapid penetration of the squamous second-line market. We're getting about 2/3 of new patients there, and that happened very rapidly. And then since NCCN updated June 12, post-ASCO, we've also seen a very nice uptick in lung overall. Clearly, that's another off-label indication given that we're only promoting in squamous right now.

As you may recall, we did a large amount of education around immuno-oncology when we launched Yervoy. And I think having a broad understanding about how immune checkpoint inhibitors work, the safety profile being particularly good with nivolumab has helped us have a very rapid penetration in the community, and so I think we'll expect that to continue with broadening indications. In Europe, we're very encouraged by what we've seen, as Giovanni mentioned, in Germany. I would say that the enthusiasm and interest in second-line squamous and in first- and second-line melanoma is very high.

And of course, what we have seen is probably better one-year survival in our exploratory studies in first line with Opdivo than with second line. There might be other features involved with that, too.

Within Opdivo, there is a degree of diversification. Long term, as we think about a second cycle, we are thinking about our early pipeline-generating opportunities that are more diversified for us within immuno-oncology, because, as Francis mentioned, we have, clearly, assets in the clinics. We're bringing 6 more assets into the clinic. So there is an element of diversification which is already within immuno-oncology, but then we have exciting early programs so -- in the other areas.

Good morning, everyone. Last quarter, I spoke to you about the promise of our exciting new chapter and the potential for sustained growth, the tremendous opportunity we have to leading I-O and transform the way cancer is treated and our strategy to strengthen and expand our diversified portfolio of specialty medicines. During the third quarter, we made important progress across the board. It was a very good quarter. Business performance was strong. We had significant clinical and regulatory successes and we recently announced 2 business development deals. 
Regarding performance, we had $4.1 billion in sales, a 4% year-over-year increase. Opdivo and Eliquis, our key growth drivers, showed strong demand in the market. Opdivo sales were just over $300 million, reflecting a stronger take in squamous lung cancer and melanoma, particularly in the U.S. but also in Germany. Following the recent approval of non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer based on the -057 study, we now expect it to be in an even more competitive position in the U.S. Eliquis prescription trends continue to be very positive and we remain encouraged by what we are seeing in our key markets. And it was also a very good quarter for our other marketed products, namely our hepatitis C franchise, despite the increasingly competitive hep C landscape, as well ORENCIA and Sprycel. 
Regarding clinical and regulatory milestones. We also had a very strong quarter, most notably with respect to I-O. Specifically, we continue to improve on our competitive position in lung cancer. Opdivo just received another early FDA approval, expanding the label to now include non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer. We have a very strong label with a demonstrated overall survival benefit in a broad population, regardless of PD-L1 expression and no requirement for PD-L1 biomarker testing. 
In first line, we presented promising data on the Opdivo plus Yervoy combination regimen at World Lank. Based on our data, we feel confident in our first line strategy, with ongoing trials for PD-L1 expressers while we are finalizing our plans for PD-L1 non-expressers. 
In melanoma, we are very pleased to have received U.S. approval for our Opdivo plus Yervoy regimen, making it the first I-O combination therapy to be approved for any type of cancer. And with renal cell carcinoma, as you will recall, we announced in July that the -025 study was stopped early, the fourth such announcement we've been able to make with Opdivo, something for which I am very proud. 
A few weeks ago at ASCO, we presented imported data from that Phase III study, which demonstrated superior overall survival for Opdivo versus standard of care in advanced or metastatic RCC. The FDA recently granted breakthrough therapy designation for Opdivo for this potential indication, and we are working with regulators and anticipate filing in the U.S. and EU by the end of the year. 
And lastly, our application for elotuzumab for multiple myeloma was accepted by the FDA for a priority review, with a PDUFA date of February 29. These followed a similar action by the European Medicines Agency, which granted elotuzumab generated assessment. 
Given all the progress we made in immuno-oncology during the quarter, clinical, regulatory and commercial, it is clear to me that we are rapidly changing the standard of care across multiple cancers. We are strengthening our leadership position and we are successfully growing our business. 
With respect to business development, we continue to invest in building a diversified pipeline within I-O and beyond. Recently, we signed agreements to license or acquire exciting programs in I-O and fibrosis. Going forward, I expect we will continue to expand our portfolio to strengthen our leadership position in I-O, but also to enhance our non-oncology businesses. Charlie will elaborate further on our business performance and business development in has prepared remarks. 
Again, and I'm very pleased with our third quarter results and continue to feel good about where we are and where we are headed. We have an established, proven strategy. Our performance across the company from commercial through R&D is strong, and we are making the investments necessary to deliver on the promise of our exciting portfolio. We are entering our exciting next chapter from a position of strength and with a great deal of optimism. 
And with that, I will turn the floor over to Charlie. Thank you."

As Giovanni just mentioned, we had a very good quarter, driven by strong sales growth of 4% or 11%, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Overall, FX had a negative impact on EPS of approximately $0.05.",876,"Thank you, Giovanni, and good morning, everyone. As Giovanni just mentioned, we had a very good quarter, driven by strong sales growth of 4% or 11%, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Overall, FX had a negative impact on EPS of approximately $0.05. 
Let me provide a few highlights. Opdivo sales were $305 million for the quarter. In second line lung cancer, Opdivo has quickly become the standard of care. Roughly 75% of new squamous patients are being treated with Opdivo and physicians are also prescribing Opdivo in the non-squamous setting, given the updated NCCN guidelines in June. With the recent FDA approval in non-squamous and no biomarker testing requirement, we believe Opdivo is in a very strong competitive position in all second line lung patients. 
In melanoma, we are beginning to see usage in combination and expect our competitive position to be strengthened with the expected upcoming approvals for studies -- 066 and -067. Importantly, access continues to be very strong as we have nearly 100% coverage for Opdivo in the U.S. 
Internationally, Opdivo has now been approved in over 38 countries. In Europe, we have approval for both first and second line melanoma in squamous lung cancer. Our trends in Germany are strong and we are working through the reimbursement process for most other EU countries. 
Yervoy sales were $240 million in the third quarter. As we discussed, we continue to see an impact in the PD-1 in melanoma in both the U.S. and EU. We do believe Yervoy will play an important role in combination with Opdivo going forward, not only in melanoma, but potentially in many tumors, including lung and renal. Overtime, we expect the regimen, once it's launched around the world, will allow the Yervoy business to stabilize. 
Eliquis' sales were $466 [ph] million, up 7% sequentially from the second quarter. Prescription trends remain strong both in the U.S. and internationally. USTRx growth was up over 18% versus prior quarter, although sales were flat. This is primarily due to the impact of the net of care coverage GAAP for donor hold, which kicks in and around this time of the year. We continue to be encouraged by very strong brand nivo prescription trends with both cardiologists and primary care physicians. 
Hep C sales were very strong for the quarter at just over $400 million. Given the quarter, we launched Daklinza in the U.S. for combination use in genotype 3 patients and recorded $111 million in sales. While the trends are early, our sales in the quarter reflect strong demand, VA purchases and some inventory stocking. We've also filed additional indications for HIV co-infected cirrhotic and posttransplant patients. 
Our business in Japan continues to do reasonably well in the quarter, but we do see an increasingly competitive landscape there, which will impact our business going forward. 
Now let me highlight a couple of items from our non-GAAP P&L. Gross margin was unfavorable 180 basis points compared to prior year primarily due to manufacturing variances, contractual expectation of ABILIFY in the U.S. earlier of this year and higher sales of Eliquis. These negative impacts were partially offset by higher sales of Opdivo and hep C. Compared with our second quarter, gross margin is down 290 [ph] basis points. Recall that last quarter, we recognized previously deferred hep C sales in France and had roughly 1 month of ABILIFY sales. 
Overall, operating expenses were higher than last year as we are seeing the impact of the incremental investments we mentioned last quarter. These initiatives in commercial, medical and R&D, primarily behind Opdivo and Eliquis, are continuing into Q4 and 2016. 
Our tax rate for the quarter is in line with last year, and on a quarterly basis, will fluctuate based on earnings mix. Our Q3 rate does not include the R&D tax credit, which has yet to be passed by Congress. 
Moving to business development. We have recently executed against 2 early-stage opportunities, which is served to strengthen our pipeline. In fibrosis, we acquired an exclusive option to the worldwide rights of lead assets, which is being studied in 2 orphan fibrotic diseases: myelofibrosis and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, with the potential to prevent and possibly reverse fibrosis. In oncology, we licensed worldwide rights to a CSF 1 or anti-body from from [indiscernible] This agreement expand our excess of collaboration and further supports our early-stage I-O development strategy of targeting the tumor microenvironment. 
Now let me provide some comments on our revised guidance. We have increased our guidance range for both revenues and EPS due to strong sales trends, primarily from Opdivo, Eliquis and hep C that have exceeded our expectations. For tax, we expect an effective rate of 20% due to earnings mix. 
As Giovanni mentioned, we remain very confident that the growth opportunity of the company. Over the next several years, we see meaningful growth from our portfolio, which will disproportionately come from Opdivo and Eliquis. And as previously discussed, we are making strategic investments to support these important growth products. 
To conclude, we are very encouraged by our continued good clinical results, regulatory approvals and strong underlying sales trends and metrics from our key brands that are important to our future growth outlook. We would now be happy to address your questions."

So in the U.S., I think we'll see some stabilization of Yervoy between now and the end of the year. It's obviously a very early launch so we don't have historical trends. We have seen some really uptick of the regimen already in the market and, in fact, about 10% to 15% of new patients are actually receiving the regimen. So that's a good signal that there is already a demand in the market. And we're hearing positive things from community oncologists about their interest in using the regimen as well. I think when we go outside of the U.S., it's going to obviously take a little longer because it will take time to secure reimbursement, so I would expect Yervoy to continue to be under some pressure ex U.S. On hepatitis C, the Japan sales, I'll turn it over to Charlie, he can break that out for you."

You were asking us about what do we think the diagnostic dynamics is going to be in the market, what is happening with non-squamous update, and lastly, what should we be thinking about expenses going forward, which I'll turn over to Charlie. I'll take a stab at the first 2. It's really interesting, in second line lung, the good news is physicians can use Opdivo in all patient population according to our label across non-squamous and squamous. So really, the testing for Opdivo is to better inform a physician-patient dialogue on what expectations should be around response to Opdivo. But the good news is we don't have to wait for that test result before treating a patient and you don't have to inform a patient that they might not be eligible for treatment. And as I mentioned before to the previous question, the prescriber can feel confident that they'll be reimbursed for the product across a broad range of patients. So we think that in second line, having a broad all label is definitely an advantage. Now I do testing will evolve over time, but I think the ideal time to test for PD-L1 expression is going to be when tissue is taken at time of diagnosis when other things like EGFR and ALC are ascertained. So in second line, oftentimes, there's no tissue available and it's very difficult to get test results. In frontline, more likely, so I think that's where it will evolve and it will take time to see how that changes in the market. With respect to our performance in non-squamous, obviously, it's a very  recent event, so we have been promoting for just a few days now. But previous to our approval, there was some uptake in non-squamous. And at this point in time, we're probably -- and this is an estimate, we're probably in the range of about 30% to 35% of new patients receiving Opdivo in non-squamous second line non-small cell lung cancer. I'll turn it over to Charlie."

Given that we've been out promoting in the squamous histology for some time with no required testing, clearly, they are a bit confused as to why all of a sudden there's a requirement to test from other PD-1 inhibitors and, of course, we're reinforcing that there's no requirement to test with Opdivo across non-squamous and squamous.

Now we're seeing those increased levels of spend, but also greater than expected revenues coming through. So can you give us a little bit more color on when we can expect to see a greater magnitude of operating margin leverage? Are we going to start to see that in 2016, say, second half? Or do we have to wait until 2017 and beyond? If you could just get a little bit more color around that? And Francis, for you, what are the key pivotal trials that you expect to see next year in terms of either reaching information at your interim analysis or when the trials conclude?

And we are also strengthening and continuing to strengthen globally the reach and the characteristics of our reimbursement support and access systems program. With respect to the combo specifically, the value that the combination of Opdivo and Yervoy offers in for patients with melanoma is very significant. And payers are responding positively to the 60% [ph] response rate, to 17% complete response, to the durability of the response, and we have really not seen significant objections to date. Remember that during the phase in which the 2 products are used together, the cost of therapy during that induction phase is only 6% higher than Opdivo monotherapy, and only the patiets that continue on a monotherapy regimen with Opdivo after the combo period clearly continue to incur incremental costs. But those patients are typical patients that would respond, and given the durability of responses with Opdivo, the value is highest at that point. So I think that message is resonating really well."

As a result, it's got the broadest label, and as you know, it indicated for previously-treated patients both squamous and non-squamous, regardless of PD-L1 expression. And as Murdo said, there's no need, therefore, to test. Now in both those -017 and -057, Opdivo demonstrated PFS benefit versus docetaxel. And in -017, it exceeded both PD-L1 positive and negative patients. And in -057, the benefit was statistically significant at all levels of PD-L1 expression, including greater than 1%, not just 50%. [ph] So I'm very clear in my own mind about the strength of the Opdivo data, and obviously, will be able to comment in there to see when you see the KEYTRUDA data. I don't have an update on the chemotherapy data from -012 in combination with Opdivo. But, of course, what I would say is we are going forward with a number of approaches in addition to the I-O combination of Opdivo+Yervoy regimen. So we've got the large, well-controlled study in -227. We are looking at normal dosing with chemo in terms of priming and shorter-term disease control. We have collaborations with Novartis and Celgene looking at chemotherapy and targeted therapy. But we've also initiated a multi-on study, which is CheckMate 370, which is looking at Opdivo primarily in the community setting, as maintenance of the reduction chemotherapy was first-line treatment, either low or in combination with standard of care chemotherapies in advance non-small cell lung cancer. So based on [indiscernible] we are confident in our approach to exploring a broad lung approach, but also explored the role of chemotherapy combinations in first line lung."

So Opdivo has caught up quickly. I think with a regimen indications, that dynamic is still very much in play, and I think we'll see some increased usage of regimen in the market, which will further drive Opdivo share. I think the only other thing is to whether or not this is a function of dose. I think it's more a function of the early mover advantage, as you described.

So it clearly complement our growing early-stage fibrosis portfolio. and it becomes very exciting for the early data is confirmed and has the potential to be transformational in multiple fibrotic diseases.

Good morning, everyone. Last quarter, I spoke to you about the promise of our exciting new chapter and the potential for sustained growth, the tremendous opportunity we have to leading I-O and transform the way cancer is treated and our strategy to strengthen and expand our diversified portfolio of specialty medicines. During the third quarter, we made important progress across the board. It was a very good quarter. Business performance was strong. We had significant clinical and regulatory successes, and we recently announced 2 business development deals. 
Regarding performance, we had $4.1 billion in sales, a 4% year-over-year increase. Opdivo and Eliquis, our key growth drivers, showed strong demand in the market. Opdivo sales were just over $300 million, reflecting a stronger take in squamous lung cancer and melanoma, particularly in the U.S. but also in Germany. Following the recent approval of non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer based on the -057 study, we now expect it to be in an even more competitive position in the U.S. Eliquis prescription trends continue to be very positive, and we remain encouraged by what we are seeing in our key markets. And it was also a very good quarter for our other marketed products, namely our hepatitis C franchise, despite the increasingly competitive hep C landscape as well as ORENCIA and Sprycel. 
Regarding clinical and regulatory milestones. We also had a very strong quarter, most notably with respect to I-O. Specifically, we continue to improve on our competitive position in lung cancer. Opdivo just received another early FDA approval, expanding the label to now include non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer. We have a very strong label, with a demonstrated overall survival benefit in a broad population, regardless of PD-L1 expression and no requirement for PD-L1 biomarker testing. 
In first line, we presented promising data on the Opdivo+Yervoy combination regimen at World Lung. Based on our data, we feel confident in our first line strategy, with ongoing trials for PD-L1 expressers, while we are finalizing our plans for PD-L1 non-expressers. 
In melanoma, we are very pleased to have received U.S. approval for our Opdivo+Yervoy regimen, making it the first I-O combination therapy to be approved for any type of cancer. And with renal cell carcinoma, as you will recall, we announced in July that the -025 study was stopped early, the fourth such announcement we've been able to make with Opdivo, something for which I am very proud. 
A few weeks ago at ESMO, we presented important data from that Phase III study, which demonstrated superior overall survival for Opdivo versus standard of care in advanced or metastatic RCC. The FDA recently granted breakthrough therapy designation to Opdivo for this potential indication, and we are working with regulators and anticipate filing in the U.S. and the EU by the end of the year. 
And lastly, our application for elotuzumab for multiple myeloma was accepted by the FDA for a priority review, with a PDUFA date of February 29. These followed a similar action by the European Medicines Agency, which granted elotuzumab accelerated assessment. 
Given all the progress we made in immuno-oncology during the quarter, clinical, regulatory and commercial, it is clear to me that we are rapidly changing the standard of care across multiple cancers. We are strengthening our leadership position, and we are successfully growing our business. 
With respect to business development, we continue to invest in building a diversified pipeline within I-O and beyond. Recently, we signed agreements to license or acquire exciting programs in I-O and fibrosis. Going forward, I expect we will continue to expand our portfolio to strengthen our leadership position in I-O, and also to enhance our non-oncology businesses. Charlie will elaborate further on our business performance and business development in his prepared remarks. 
Again, I'm very pleased with our third quarter results, and continue to feel good about where we are and where we are headed. We have an established, proven strategy. Our performance across the company from commercial through R&D is strong, and we are making the investments necessary to deliver on the promise of our exciting portfolio. We are entering our exciting next chapter from a position of strength, and with a great deal of optimism. 
And with that, I will turn the floor over to Charlie. Thank you."

As Giovanni just mentioned, we had a very good quarter, driven by strong sales growth of 4% or 11%, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Overall, FX had a negative impact on EPS of approximately $0.05.",869,"Thank you, Giovanni, and good morning, everyone. As Giovanni just mentioned, we had a very good quarter, driven by strong sales growth of 4% or 11%, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Overall, FX had a negative impact on EPS of approximately $0.05. 
Let me provide a few highlights. Opdivo sales were $305 million for the quarter. In second line lung cancer, Opdivo has quickly become the standard of care. Roughly 75% of new squamous patients are being treated with Opdivo, and physicians are also prescribing Opdivo in the non-squamous setting, given the updated NCCN Guidelines in June. With the recent FDA approval in non-squamous and no biomarker testing requirement, we believe Opdivo is in a very strong competitive position in all second line lung patients. 
In melanoma, we are beginning to see usage in combination and expect our competitive position to be strengthened with the expected upcoming approvals for studies, -066 and -067. Importantly, access continues to be very strong as we have nearly 100% coverage for Opdivo in the U.S. 
Internationally, Opdivo has now been approved in over 38 countries. In Europe, we have approval for both first and second line melanoma in squamous lung cancer. Our trends in Germany are strong, and we are working through the reimbursement process for most other EU countries. 
Yervoy sales were $240 million in the third quarter. As we discussed, we continue to see an impact of the PD-1 in melanoma in both the U.S. and EU. We do believe Yervoy will play an important role in combination with Opdivo going forward, not only in melanoma, but potentially in many tumors, including lung and renal. Over time, we expect the regimen, once it's launched around the world, will allow the Yervoy business to stabilize. 
Eliquis' sales were $466 million, up 7% sequentially from the second quarter. Prescription trends remain strong, both in the U.S. and internationally. USTRx growth was up over 18% versus prior quarter, although sales were flat. This is primarily due to the impact of the net of care coverage GAAP for donor hold, which kicks in around this time of the year. We continue to be encouraged by very strong new-to-brand prescription trends with both cardiologists and primary care physicians. 
Hep C sales were very strong for the quarter at just over $400 million. During the quarter, we launched Daklinza in the U.S. for combination use in genotype 3 patients and recorded $111 million in sales. While the trends are early, our sales in the quarter reflect strong demand, VA purchases and some inventory stocking. We've also filed additional indications for HIV co-infected cirrhotic and post-transplant patients. 
Our business in Japan continues to do reasonably well in the quarter, but we do see an increasingly competitive landscape there, which will impact our business going forward. 
Now let me highlight a couple of items from our non-GAAP P&L. Gross margin was unfavorable 180 basis points compared to prior year, primarily due to manufacturing variances, the contractual exploration of ABILIFY in the U.S. earlier of this year and higher sales of Eliquis. These negative impacts were partially offset by higher sales of Opdivo and hep C. Compared with our second quarter, gross margin is down 290 basis points. Recall that last quarter, we recognized previously-deferred hep C sales in France, and had roughly 1 month of ABILIFY sales. 
Overall, operating expenses were higher than last year as we are seeing the impact from the incremental investments we mentioned last quarter. These initiatives in commercial, medical and R&D, primarily behind Opdivo and Eliquis, are continuing into Q4 and 2016. 
Our tax rate for the quarter is in line with last year, and on a quarterly basis, will fluctuate based on earnings mix. Our Q3 rate does not include the R&D tax credit, which is yet to be passed by Congress. 
Moving to business development. We have recently executed against 2 early-stage opportunities, which served to strengthen our pipeline. In fibrosis, we acquired an exclusive option to the worldwide rights of Promedior's lead assets, which is being studied in 2 orphan fibrotic diseases: myelofibrosis and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, with the potential to prevent and possibly reverse fibrosis. In oncology, we licensed worldwide rights to a CSF1R anti-body from Five Prime. This agreement expands our existing collaboration and further supports our early-stage I-O development strategy of targeting the tumor microenvironment. 
Now let me provide some comments on our revised guidance. We have increased our guidance range for both revenues and EPS due to strong sales trends, primarily from Opdivo, Eliquis and hep C that have exceeded our expectations. For tax, we expect an effective rate of 20% due to earnings mix. 
As Giovanni mentioned, we remain very confident in the growth opportunity of the company. Over the next several years, we see meaningful growth from our portfolio, which will disproportionately come from Opdivo and Eliquis. And as previously discussed, we are making strategic investments to support these important growth products. 
To conclude, we are very encouraged by our continued good clinical results, regulatory approvals and strong underlying sales trends and metrics from our key brands that are important to our future growth outlook. We would now be happy to address your questions."

So in the U.S., I think we'll see some stabilization of Yervoy between now and the end of the year. It's obviously a very early launch, so we don't have historical trends. We have seen some early uptake of the regimen already in the market and in fact, about 10% to 15% of new patients are actually receiving the regimen. So that's a good signal that there is already good demand in the market. And we're hearing positive things from community oncologists about their interest in using the regimen as well. I think when we go outside of the U.S., it's going to obviously take a little longer because it will take time to secure reimbursement, so I would expect Yervoy to continue to be under some pressure ex U.S. On hepatitis C, the Japan sales, I'll turn it over to Charlie, he can break that out for you."

We, also just as a reminder, we continue to have Yervoy+Opdivo as the category 2a recommendation in first and second line at the regimen in melanoma."

You were asking us about what do we think the diagnostic dynamics going to be in the market? What is happening with non-squamous uptake, and lastly, what should we be thinking about expenses going forward, which I'll turn over to Charlie. I'll take a stab at the first 2. It's really interesting, in second line lung, the good news is physicians can use Opdivo in an all-comer patient population according to our label across non-squamous and squamous. So really, the testing for Opdivo is to better inform a physician-patient dialogue on what expectations should be around response to Opdivo. But the good news is you don't have to wait for that test result before treating a patient, and you don't have to inform a patient that they might not be eligible for treatment. And as I mentioned before to the previous question, the prescriber can feel confident that they'll be reimbursed for the product across the broad range of patients. So we think that in second line, having a broad all-comer label is definitely an advantage. Now I do think testing will evolve over time, but I think the ideal time to test for PD-L1 expression is going to be when tissue is taken at time of diagnosis when other things like EGFR and ALK are ascertained. So in second line, oftentimes, there's no tissue available and it's very difficult to get test results. In frontline, more likely, so I think that's where it will evolve, and it will take time to see how that changes in the market. With respect to our performance in non-squamous, obviously, it's a very recent event, so we have been promoting for just a few days now. But previous to our approval, there was some uptake in non-squamous. And at this point in time, we're probably -- and then this is an estimate, we're probably in the range of about 30% to 35% of new patients receiving Opdivo in non-squamous second line non-small cell lung cancer. I'll turn it over to Charlie."

So I think it's hard to fix a number in terms of physicians who prefer testing over those who are agnostic to testing. I think what we're seeing is in an academic institutional setting, where reference labs have had our anti-body for some time now, they're definitely more tests. There's more testing in the institutional setting, so that the physician can ascertain what the likelihood of a response will be. I think in the community, it's much less frequent and that will obviously change, as I said earlier. But it's the minority of physicians who are aware and understand how to do the testing. Given that we've been out promoting in the squamous histology for some time with no required testing, clearly, they are a bit confused now as to why all of a sudden there's a requirement to test from other PD-1 inhibitors and of course, we're reinforcing that there's no requirement to test with Opdivo across non-squamous and squamous. When it comes to off-label use in terms of renal indication, we're not really tracking that right now in a large extent. We look at it, obviously, we look at all of our use.

But even for patients, once a patient enrolls in our patient assistance program for either drug, they are no longer required to reenroll for assistance with the next drug.

And we are also strengthening and continuing to strengthen globally the reach and the characteristics of our reimbursement support and access systems programs. With respect to the combo specifically, the value that the combination of Opdivo and Yervoy offers in for patients with melanoma is very significant. And payers are responding positively to the 60% response rate, to 17% complete response, to the durability of the response, and we have really not seen significant objections to date. Remember that during the phase in which the 2 products are used together, the cost of therapy during that induction phase is only 6% higher than Opdivo monotherapy, and only the patients that continue on a monotherapy regimen with Opdivo after the combo period, clearly continue to incur incremental costs. But those patients are typically patients that would respond, and given the durability of response with Opdivo, the value is highest at that point.

With the advent of generic Livache we're definitely going to see some pressure in the U.S. and in some markets, ex U.S. We're already seeing that in some locations like Canada. But I think given the strength of the share evolution in frontline, we're going to be able to weather that quite well. Obviously, we're also focused on the ability for the oncologists or hematologists to test patients for depths of molecular response within the first 3 months, which should allow us to be able to use a very rapid second line penetration in that market. And I think that'll be important to continue to have good Sprycel growth long term."

So as well as our major focus on checkpoint inhibitors such as Opdivo, Yervoy, anti-LAG-3 and Urelumab, we're also interested in other potentially complimentary approaches to reverse tumor-induced immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment, but also directly stimulate the immune system. So just to say, so generating optimal T-cell responses may also require T-cell receptor activations plus co-stimulations, as you know, which then can be provided through ligation of the TNF receptor family members, including anti-gator, which is just got into the clinic for us, of 40 which we expect to bring into the clinic next year and of course, Urelumab, which is  already underway. As far as the tumor microenvironment, we're actually very excited about the progress of IDO. That program we acquired from Flexus, and we're on track to have that lead molecule enter the clinic next year. Additionally, as you recall, we have the TGF beta program from Rigel, which is still preclinical and an internally-discovered anti-CD73 molecule, which we hope to be in the clinic before the end of next year, too. And of course, with the recent announcements of the Five Prime, the licensing deal, we also have a CSF1R in phase run, which is in combination with Opdivo, and we're very pleased with how that trial is progressing also. So let me just sum out. We have an expo -- number of exploratory clinical studies in addition to checkpoint inhibitors as well as other complementary nonredundant approaches to PD-1 inhibition. We will be getting data at the end of this year and through next year, and depending on the data or the timing, we will be presenting some of that next year."

But let me tell you what we do know. We do know is that Opdivo has a clear overall survival benefit, and the benefits in a broad population. As a result, it's got the broadest label, and as you know, it's indicated for previously-treated patients, both squamous and non-squamous, regardless of PD-L1 expression. And as Murdo said, there's no need, therefore, to test. Now in both those -017 and -057, Opdivo demonstrated PFS benefit versus docetaxel. And in -017, the benefit was seen in both PD-L1 positive and negative patients. And in -057, the benefit was statistically significant at all levels of PD-L1 expression, including greater than 1%, not just 50%. So I'm very clear in my own mind about the strengths of the Opdivo data, and obviously, will be able to comment. We'll be able to see when you see the KEYTRUDA data. I don't have an update on the chemotherapy data from -012 in combination with Opdivo. But what I would say is we are going forward with a number of approaches in addition to the I-O combination of Opdivo+Yervoy regimen. So we've got the large, well-controlled study in -227. We are looking at novel dosing with chemo in terms of priming and shorter-term disease control. We have collaborations with Novartis and Celgene, looking at chemotherapy and targeted therapy. But we've also initiated a multi-on study, which is CheckMate 370, which is looking at Opdivo, primarily in the community setting as maintenance after induction chemotherapy was first-line treatment, either low or in combination with standard of care chemotherapies in advance non-small cell lung cancer. So based on all of this we are confident in our approach to exploring a broad lung approach, but also exploit the role of chemotherapy combinations in first line lung."

I think with the regimen indications, that dynamic is still very much in play, and I think we'll see some increased usage of regimen in the market, which will further drive Opdivo share. I think the only other thing is to whether or not this is a function of dose. I think it's more a function of the early mover advantage, as you described.

And just to give you a bit more color, we gained the worldwide rights to PRM-151, which is a recombinant form of the human pentraxin-2 protein. This is in Phase II development as you heard for the treatment of IPF and myelofibrosis. Now what particularly struck us about the early data, which is continuing to develop in myelofibrosis, that it suggests that pentraxin-2 may be able to reverse the fibrotic process and improve the downstream events, not just stop the progression. So pentraxin-2 clearly complements our growing early-stage fibrosis portfolio, and it becomes very exciting if the early data is confirmed and it has the potential to be transformational in multiple fibrotic diseases. As far as HIV, we're continuing to bring forward 2 novel, potentially first-in-class compounds. The attachment inhibitors moved into Phase III. The -- as you saw recently, we've had some good Phase II data with the maturation inhibitor, the first in salvage therapy and of course, the second possibility for 6-dose combinations. So we think there's considerable value in both those assets, even in a very mature area like HIV."

Good morning, everyone. Last quarter, I spoke to you about the promise of our exciting new chapter and the potential for sustained growth, the tremendous opportunity we have to leading I-O and transform the way cancer is treated and our strategy to strengthen and expand our diversified portfolio of specialty medicines. During the third quarter, we made important progress across the board. It was a very good quarter. Business performance was strong. We had significant clinical and regulatory successes, and we recently announced 2 business development deals. 
Regarding performance, we had $4.1 billion in sales, a 4% year-over-year increase. Opdivo and Eliquis, our key growth drivers, showed strong demand in the market. Opdivo sales were just over $300 million, reflecting a stronger take in squamous lung cancer and melanoma, particularly in the U.S. but also in Germany. Following the recent approval of non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer based on the -057 study, we now expect it to be in an even more competitive position in the U.S. Eliquis prescription trends continue to be very positive, and we remain encouraged by what we are seeing in our key markets. And it was also a very good quarter for our other marketed products, namely our hepatitis C franchise, despite the increasingly competitive hep C landscape as well as ORENCIA and Sprycel. 
Regarding clinical and regulatory milestones. We also had a very strong quarter, most notably with respect to I-O. Specifically, we continue to improve on our competitive position in lung cancer. Opdivo just received another early FDA approval, expanding the label to now include non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer. We have a very strong label, with a demonstrated overall survival benefit in a broad population, regardless of PD-L1 expression and no requirement for PD-L1 biomarker testing. 
In first line, we presented promising data on the Opdivo+Yervoy combination regimen at World Lung. Based on our data, we feel confident in our first line strategy, with ongoing trials for PD-L1 expressers, while we are finalizing our plans for PD-L1 non-expressers. 
In melanoma, we are very pleased to have received U.S. approval for our Opdivo+Yervoy regimen, making it the first I-O combination therapy to be approved for any type of cancer. And with renal cell carcinoma, as you will recall, we announced in July that the -025 study was stopped early, the fourth such announcement we've been able to make with Opdivo, something for which I am very proud. 
A few weeks ago at ESMO, we presented important data from that Phase III study, which demonstrated superior overall survival for Opdivo versus standard of care in advanced or metastatic RCC. The FDA recently granted breakthrough therapy designation to Opdivo for this potential indication, and we are working with regulators and anticipate filing in the U.S. and the EU by the end of the year. 
And lastly, our application for elotuzumab for multiple myeloma was accepted by the FDA for a priority review, with a PDUFA date of February 29. These followed a similar action by the European Medicines Agency, which granted elotuzumab accelerated assessment. 
Given all the progress we made in immuno-oncology during the quarter, clinical, regulatory and commercial, it is clear to me that we are rapidly changing the standard of care across multiple cancers. We are strengthening our leadership position, and we are successfully growing our business. 
With respect to business development, we continue to invest in building a diversified pipeline within I-O and beyond. Recently, we signed agreements to license or acquire exciting programs in I-O and fibrosis. Going forward, I expect we will continue to expand our portfolio to strengthen our leadership position in I-O, and also to enhance our non-oncology businesses. Charlie will elaborate further on our business performance and business development in his prepared remarks. 
Again, I'm very pleased with our third quarter results, and continue to feel good about where we are and where we are headed. We have an established, proven strategy. Our performance across the company from commercial through R&D is strong, and we are making the investments necessary to deliver on the promise of our exciting portfolio. We are entering our exciting next chapter from a position of strength, and with a great deal of optimism. 
And with that, I will turn the floor over to Charlie. Thank you."

As Giovanni just mentioned, we had a very good quarter, driven by strong sales growth of 4%, or 11% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Overall, FX had a negative impact on EPS of approximately $0.05.",870,"Thank you, Giovanni, and good morning, everyone. As Giovanni just mentioned, we had a very good quarter, driven by strong sales growth of 4%, or 11% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Overall, FX had a negative impact on EPS of approximately $0.05. 
Let me provide a few highlights. Opdivo sales were $305 million for the quarter. In second line lung cancer, Opdivo has quickly become the standard of care. Roughly 75% of new squamous patients are being treated with Opdivo, and physicians are also prescribing Opdivo in the non-squamous setting, given the updated NCCN Guidelines in June. With the recent FDA approval in non-squamous and no biomarker testing requirement, we believe Opdivo is in a very strong competitive position in all second line lung patients. 
In melanoma, we are beginning to see usage in combination and expect our competitive position to be strengthened with the expected upcoming approvals for studies, -066 and -067. Importantly, access continues to be very strong as we have nearly 100% coverage for Opdivo in the U.S. 
Internationally, Opdivo has now been approved in over 38 countries. In Europe, we have approval for both first and second line melanoma and squamous lung cancer. Our trends in Germany are strong, and we are working through the reimbursement process for most other EU countries. 
Yervoy sales were $240 million in the third quarter. As we discussed, we continue to see an impact of the PD-1 in melanoma in both the U.S. and EU. We do believe Yervoy will play an important role in combination with Opdivo going forward, not only in melanoma, but potentially in many tumors, including lung and renal. Over time, we expect the regimen, once it's launched around the world, will allow the Yervoy business to stabilize. 
Eliquis' sales were $466 million, up 7% sequentially from the second quarter. Prescription trends remain strong, both in the U.S. and internationally. U.S. TRx growth was up over 18% versus prior quarter, although sales were flat. This is primarily due to the impact of the net of care coverage gap, or donut hole, which kicks in around this time of the year. We continue to be encouraged by very strong new-to-brand prescription trends with both cardiologists and primary care physicians. 
Hep C sales were very strong for the quarter at just over $400 million. During the quarter, we launched Daklinza in the U.S. for combination use in genotype 3 patients and recorded $111 million in sales. While the trends are early, our sales in the quarter reflect strong demand, VA purchases and some inventory stocking. We've also filed additional indications for HIV co-infected cirrhotic and post-transplant patients. 
Our business in Japan continued to do reasonably well in the quarter, but we do see an increasingly competitive landscape there, which will impact our business going forward. 
Now let me highlight a couple of items from our non-GAAP P&L. Gross margin was unfavorable 180 basis points compared to prior year, primarily due to manufacturing variances, the contractual expiration of ABILIFY in the U.S. earlier of this year and higher sales of Eliquis. These negative impacts were partially offset by higher sales of Opdivo and hep C. Compared with our second quarter, gross margin is down 290 basis points. Recall that last quarter, we recognized previously-deferred hep C sales in France, and had roughly 1 month of ABILIFY sales. 
Overall, operating expenses were higher than last year as we are seeing the impact from the incremental investments we mentioned last quarter. These initiatives in commercial, medical and R&D, primarily behind Opdivo and Eliquis, are continuing into Q4 and 2016. 
Our tax rate for the quarter is in line with last year, and on a quarterly basis, will fluctuate based on earnings mix. Our Q3 rate does not include the R&D tax credit, which has yet to be passed by Congress. 
Moving to business development. We have recently executed against 2 early-stage opportunities, which served to strengthen our pipeline. In fibrosis, we acquired an exclusive option to the worldwide rights of Promedior's lead asset, which is being studied in 2 orphaned fibrotic diseases: myelofibrosis and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, with the potential to prevent and possibly reverse fibrosis. In oncology, we licensed worldwide rights to a CSF1R anti-body from Five Prime. This agreement expands our existing collaboration and further supports our early-stage I-O development strategy of targeting the tumor microenvironment. 
Now let me provide some comments on our revised guidance. We have increased our guidance range for both revenues and EPS due to strong sales trends, primarily from Opdivo, Eliquis and hep C that have exceeded our expectations. For tax, we expect an effective rate of 20% due to earnings mix. 
As Giovanni mentioned, we remain very confident in the growth opportunity of the company. Over the next several years, we see meaningful growth from our portfolio, which will disproportionately come from Opdivo and Eliquis. And as previously discussed, we are making strategic investments to support these important growth products. 
To conclude, we are very encouraged by our continued good clinical results, regulatory approvals and strong underlying sales trends and metrics from our key brands that are important to our future growth outlook. We would now be happy to address your questions."

We have seen some early uptake of the regimen already in the market and in fact, about 10% to 15% of new patients are actually receiving the regimen. So that's a good signal that there is already good demand in the market. And we're hearing positive things from community oncologists about their interest in using the regimen as well.

You were asking us about what do we think the diagnostic dynamic's going to be in the market?  What is happening with non-squamous uptake, and lastly, what should we be thinking about expenses going forward, which I'll turn over to Charlie. I'll take a stab at the first 2. 
It's really interesting, in second line lung, the good news is physicians can use Opdivo in an all-comer patient population according to our label across non-squamous and squamous. So really, the testing for Opdivo is to better inform a physician-patient dialogue on what expectation should be around response to Opdivo. But the good news is you don't have to wait for that test result before treating a patient, and you don't have to inform a patient that they might not be eligible for treatment. And as I mentioned before to the previous question, the prescriber can feel confident that they'll be reimbursed for the product across a broad range of patients. So we think that in second line, having a broad all-comer label is definitely an advantage. Now I do think testing will evolve over time, but I think the ideal time to test for PD-L1 expression is going to be when tissue is taken at time of diagnosis when other things like EGFR and ALK are ascertained. So in second line, oftentimes, there's no tissue available and it's very difficult to get test results. In frontline, more likely, so I think that's where it will evolve, and it will take time to see how that changes in the market. With respect to our performance in non-squamous, obviously, it's a very recent event, so we have been promoting for just a few days now. But previous to our approval, there was some uptake in non-squamous. And at this point in time, we're probably -- and then this is an estimate, we're probably in the range of about 30% to 35% of new patients receiving Opdivo in non-squamous second line non-small cell lung cancer. I'll turn it over to Charlie."

So I think it's hard to fix a number in terms of physicians who prefer testing over those who are agnostic to testing. I think what we're seeing is in an academic institutional setting, where reference labs have had our anti-body for some time now, they're definitely more tests. There's more testing in the institutional setting, so that the physician can ascertain what the likelihood of a response will be. I think in the community, it's much less frequent and that will obviously change, as I said earlier. But it's the minority of physicians who are aware and understand how to do the testing. Given that we've been out promoting in the squamous histology for some time with no required testing, clearly, they are a bit confused now as to why all of a sudden there's a requirement to test from other PD-1 inhibitors and, of course, we're reinforcing that there's no requirement to test with Opdivo across non-squamous and squamous. 
When it comes to off-label use in terms of renal indication, we're not really tracking that right now in a large extent. We look at it, obviously, we look at all of our use.

When you think about Opdivo monotherapy, it's actually a really good questions, Gregg, because what we are hearing from our customers is the fact that we have 2 immune checkpoint inhibitors and our portfolio has obviously very real potential benefits for them. But even for patients, once a patient enrolls in our patient assistance program for either drug, they are no longer required to reenroll for assistance with the next drug. So as you highlighted, a physician may decide to use Opdivo versus other PD-1 options in frontline because they know if they do progress, they don't have to fill out any additional paperwork or reapply for patient assistance when they get a patient on Yervoy, and it's a real convenience factor for physicians and patients. And obviously, if they are going to use the 2 in combination, then they only need to familiarize themselves with one PD-1 inhibitor in that setting as well, so thanks for that question."

And we are also strengthening and continuing to strengthen globally the reach and the characteristics of our reimbursement support and access assistance programs. With respect to the combo specifically, the value that the combination of Opdivo and Yervoy offers in -- for patients with melanoma is very significant. And payers are responding positively to the 60% response rate, to 17% complete response, to the durability of the response, and we have really not seen significant objections to date. Remember that during the phase in which the 2 products are used together, the cost of therapy during that induction phase is only 6% higher than Opdivo monotherapy, and only the patients that continue on a monotherapy regimen with Opdivo after the combo period, clearly continue to incur incremental costs. But those patients are typically patients that would respond, and given the durability of response with Opdivo, the value is highest at that point. So I think that message is resonating really well."

As far as the tumor microenvironment, we're actually very excited about the progress of IDO. That program we acquired from Flexus, and we're on track to have that lead molecule enter the clinic next year. Additionally, as you recall, we have the TGF beta program from Rigel, which is still preclinical and an internally-discovered anti-CD73 molecule, which we hope to be in the clinic before the end of next year, too.

But let me tell you what we do know. We do know is that Opdivo has a clear overall survival benefit, and a benefit in a broad population. As a result, it's got the broadest label, and as you know, it's indicated for previously-treated patients, both squamous and non-squamous, regardless of PD-L1 expression. And as Murdo said, there's no need, therefore, to test. 
Now in both those -017 and -057, Opdivo demonstrated PFS benefit versus docetaxel. And in -017, the benefit was seen in both PD-L1 positive and negative patients. And in -057, the benefit was statistically significant at all levels of PD-L1 expression, including greater than 1%, not just 50%. So I'm very clear in my own mind about the strengths of the Opdivo data, and obviously, we'll be able to comment -- we'll be able to see when you see the KEYTRUDA data. 
I don't have an update on the chemotherapy data from -012 in combination with Opdivo. But what I would say is we are going forward with a number of approaches in addition to the I-O combination of Opdivo+Yervoy regimen. So we've got the large, well-controlled study in -227. We are looking at novel dosing with chemo in terms of priming and shorter-term disease control. We have collaborations with Novartis and Celgene, looking at chemotherapy and targeted therapy. But we've also initiated a multi-arm study, which is CheckMate 370, which is looking at Opdivo, primarily in the community setting as maintenance after induction chemotherapy was first-line treatment, either low or in combination with standard of care chemotherapies in advance non-small cell lung cancer.

And just to give you a bit more color, we gained the worldwide rights to PRM-151, which is a recombinant form of the human pentraxin-2 protein. This is in Phase II development as you heard for the treatment of IPF and myelofibrosis. Now what particularly struck us about the early data, which is continuing to develop in myelofibrosis, that it suggests that pentraxin-2 may be able to reverse the fibrotic process and improve the downstream events, not just stop the progression. So pentraxin-2 clearly complements our growing early-stage fibrosis portfolio, and it becomes very exciting if the early data is confirmed and it has the potential to be transformational in multiple fibrotic diseases. As far as HIV, we're continuing to bring forward 2 novel, potentially first-in-class compounds. The attachment inhibitor has moved into Phase III. The -- as you saw recently, we've had some good Phase II data with the maturation inhibitor, the first in salvage therapy and of course, the second possibility for fixed-dose combinations.

A",209,"Let me just -- Colin, let me just, before I close, make a couple of comments on business development. So first of all, both areas, immuno-oncology and other therapeutic areas will continue to be important internally and in terms of business development. And as we've done when we have moved from our focus on checkpoint inhibitors into the tumor microenvironment, we will continue to look at how the science evolves in other areas within immuno-oncology. And when we see technologies or programs that are interesting and relevant to our program, we will continue to focus on business development in immuno-oncology. With respect to the other therapeutic areas, they remain the ones we've discussed before with immunoscience, cardiovascular medicines, fibrosis and genetically-defined diseases as areas where our science can be complemented by business development activities, and I don't expect that to change going forward. 
So let me just close. Thank you all for participating in the call, and reiterate that again, we had a very strong quarter. Our performance was strong from a commercial perspective. Our clinical and regulatory developments were very significant, and we are optimistic as we're moving forward into our exciting new chapter of sustained growth in a position of strength. Thanks, everyone. Have a good day."
