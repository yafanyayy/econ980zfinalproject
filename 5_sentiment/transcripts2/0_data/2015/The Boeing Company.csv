Let me begin today with a brief review of some recent strategic achievements, followed by comments on our strong 2014 operating performance, then an overview of the business environment. After that, Greg will walk you through our financial results and outlook in greater detail. 
Now let's move to Slide 2, please. Boeing is entering 2015 stronger, healthier and better positioned in its markets than any time in recent memory. Our strategic accomplishments over the past 24 months alone provide a compelling picture of the progress we've made to enable sustained growth in improving profitability as we near the start of our second century in business. During that time frame, we captured more than 2,700 net new Commercial Airplane orders; grew our market share in deliveries, with 6 successful production rate increases, including reaching our target 10 per month on the 787 with more than 3 per month growing steadily from our capacity expansion in South Carolina. We completed a comprehensive refresh of our Commercial Airplane product line, with the highly successful launches of the twin-aisle 787-10 and the 777X on a combined 400 orders and commitments, and the launch of the single-aisle, 737 MAX 200 with a 100-airplane order from Ryanair. 
Starting with the hard-fought technology gains at 787, we have built a substantial technological lead in commercial aviation, particularly in the high-value twin-aisle market. And by listening to our customers and applying our proven technologies and lessons learned, in summary, we have derisked a decade of new product development while expanding our edge in the performance and efficiency of our airplanes. 
Turning The Boeing Defense, Space & Security. Despite a tough domestic budget environment, BDS continued to strengthen its relative market position and competitiveness. We have accomplished this by driving significant new efficiencies in response to the environment in order to meet government customer needs and fund investment in technology and innovation, including in-space programs where we have restored our technological lead in market position in satellites, autonomous spacecraft, missile defense and human space flight. To the benefit of both businesses, we also secured an unprecedented production continuity and improved economics with long-term labor agreements at our major production sites at Puget Sound, St. Louis and Philadelphia. And we retired significant and long-standing legal and financial risks from an provincial liability in matters such as the A-12 program to the short-term threat to our balance sheet from defined benefit pensions. As you know, by the end of next year, approximately 90% of our workforce will participate in defined contribution plans, which provide attractive and competitive benefits to employees without the risks to our balance sheet. Going forward, we remain ever focused on driving productivity and executing on our growth initiatives, which are fundamental to our success. 
To meet customer demand for our market-leading Commercial Airplanes, we have 5 more rate increases ahead of us over the remainder of the decade. These higher production volumes will provide additional opportunities for driving step-function gains in productivity for us and our suppliers through capturing the value of quality and our Partnering for Success efforts. We are equally committed to breaking the cost curve on our new development programs and delivering them on time with performance as advertised. To that end, we are focused our Engineering teams on designs that are more producible, common systems in parts across airplane families and our disciplined gated development process. We have also increased our investment in manufacturing and production innovations, including automation to increase quality and safety in the workplace and reduce flow times. Overall, for 2015 and throughout the remainder of the decade, these recent achievements in the marketplace, in our operations and in our financial performance set the stage for expected significant cash generation, the flexibility to invest for growth in support of our customers and the increasing return of cash to shareholders. 
With that as perspective, let's discuss our 2014 results on Slide 3, please. Strong fourth quarter results, driven by higher commercial deliveries and solid operating performance, capped an outstanding year. We continue to deliver on our strategies to convert our backlog into profitable growth and to drive productivity and affordability throughout the company. For the full year, we reported record revenue and core earnings per share, solid operating margins and strong cash flow, much of which was returned to shareholders. Boeing Commercial Airplanes reported record revenue of $60 billion through the year on higher production rates and an industry record 723 deliveries, which expanded our global market share leadership in deliveries for the third consecutive year. 2014 was also an exceptional year for new bookings, as we captured commercial gross orders of 1,550 airplanes and record net orders of 1,432 airplanes, which increased our backlog to nearly 5,800 airplanes. When combined with strong orders from our Defense business, total company backlog grew to a record $502 billion [ph] 
Other Commercial Airplanes key milestones in 2014 included successfully reaching the 42 per month production rate on the 737 and announcing plans to increase the 52 in 2018. Model certification and delivery of the first 10 787-9s, completing Preliminary Design Review on the 787-10 and breaking ground on the new 777X composite centers in Puget Sound and St. Louis. Borrowing Defense, Space & Security also had a solid year with solid revenue, healthy margins and significant new business wins and program milestones. Key contract awards captured during the fourth quarter included an order for 2 702 high-power satellites; multiple, long-term international service contracts, including a 25-year order from the Australian government to train rotary wing aircrews valued at approximately $500 million; and finalization of the NASA Commercial Crew award announced in the third quarter. Noteworthy program milestones in the quarter included the first flight of the 767-2C test aircraft for the KC-46 Tanker program, the selection of the B22 by Japan to fulfill their tilt-rotor aircraft requirements and U.S. Government funding for EA-18G growler production. Finally, our strong operational performance trend, significant cash flow and confidence in the future, all supported by our December announcement of the share repurchase authorization, totaling $12 billion and a 25% increase in the quarterly dividend. 
With that, let's turn to the business environment on Slide 4. Our view of the business environment remains positive, given favorable global air traffic trends, improving airline profitability and the continuing need for and efficient and value-creating products we provide. Strong growth in the Commercial Airplane market continues to drive demand that supports our planned production rate increases over the remainder of the decade. Net new orders for 2014 that I mentioned earlier were essentially twice our 2014 output, and our record backlog of 5,800 airplanes represents approximately 8 years of production at current rates. Replacement demand remains an important market driver, with airlines continuing to introduce new and more efficient airplanes with superior economics and a rapid return on investment in place older, less efficient models and service. Notwithstanding a fuel price environment today that is well below the 15-year average, the value proposition for our airplanes remains a compelling one. Historically, we have seen aircraft orders more correlated to airline profits, and as many of you may recall, we closed the business case for and launched the 787 when oil was at $40 a barrel. Furthermore, based on discussions with our customers, lower oil prices have not substantially changed their views on preplanning or their commitment to existing delivery schedules. Our new technologically advanced airplanes not only have far better fuel efficiency and lower maintenance cost but also often deliver higher passenger and cargo revenue, increased residual values, a better overall passenger experience and greater range, allowing for new city pairs and more optimal routes. All of these elements provide significant value to our customers over the life of the aircraft. Overall, we see low fuel price prices and positive traffic trends as beneficial to our industry and growth prospects. Our long-term outlook also remain strong, as we expect the combination and growth in replacement to drive the need for nearly 37,000 aircraft over the next 20 years. 
In the twin-aisle segment, we continue to see healthy demand for both the 777 and the 777X, which are outselling the competition by a wide margin, giving us confidence in our ability to efficiently transition production between the 2 airplanes. In 2014, we captured 63 new orders for current 777 models, giving us 217 firm orders in backlog. We expect demand for the 777 to remain healthy through the end of this decade, with an anticipated average order capture of around 40 to 60 airplanes per year to support the transition to the 777X. With the new airplanes scheduled to enter final assembly in the 2018 time frame, this transition will leverage new manufacturing processes and technologies being proven on the current 777 to optimize the 777X production system. 
On the 787 program, which delivered a twin-aisle industry record 114 airplanes in 2014, we remain focused on continued production efficiencies and support our future plan rate increases to match the strong market demand for the airplane. Since the first customer flight, 787 fleet has now flown -- has now safely flown approximately 30 million passengers, more than 400 million miles while saving 1 billion pounds of fuel, providing game-changing efficiencies and capabilities to 29 customers worldwide. 
In the single-aisle segment, demand for our new fuel-efficient 737 MAX also remains high, with cumulative orders totaling more than 2,660 airplanes from 57 customers. Development of the MAX remains on track for first delivery in 2017. 
Turning to Defense, Space & Security. We continue to see solid support among U.S. customers and Congress for our major programs. In addition to the Growler funding I mentioned earlier, the FY '15 budget signed into law in December fully funds our core Boeing production programs, such as the Apache helicopter and the P-8. Key development programs like Tanker and Long Range Strike also were fully funded, and additional funds were added for the space launch system. We continue to see strong international demand for our offerings as well, particularly in the Middle East and the Asia Pacific region. In 2014, international customers for Defense, Space & Security represented 28% of revenue and 36% of our current backlog. While notable alone for its size, the strength of our international Defense backlog also comes from its diversity across our product and services portfolio and the geographic mix of its customer base. 
Our investments in technology and innovation for organic growth continue in areas such as commercial derivatives, space, unmanned systems, intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance and the critical few large-scale future programs that our priorities for our customers, like Long Range Strike, UCLASS and the T-X Trainer. The relative strength of our Defense, Space & Security business stems from a portfolio that is reliable, proven and affordable, supported by our ongoing market base affordability initiative, which is focused on reducing operating cost by another $2 billion to ensure competitiveness through the ongoing downturn in domestic defense spending. 
In summary, our business strategies are aligned to the realities and opportunities of our markets. And our teams are executing them well to deliver top line and bottom line performance and capture new business to sustain our growth and profitability for the decades to come. 
Now over to Greg for our financial results and our updated guidance. Greg?"
370857,280138552,750049,"The Boeing Company, Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2015",2015-01-28,"Earnings Calls","The Boeing Company","Executives","Thanks, Jim, and good morning. Let's turn to Slide 5 to discuss our full year results. Revenue for the year was a record $91 billion, reflecting 5% growth from last year, driven by higher deliveries in our Commercial Airplane business. Core earnings per",1555,"Thanks, Jim, and good morning. Let's turn to Slide 5 to discuss our full year results. 
Revenue for the year was a record $91 billion, reflecting 5% growth from last year, driven by higher deliveries in our Commercial Airplane business. Core earnings per share totaled $8.60 for the year, representing a 22% increase. The increase in core EPS was driven by strong operational performance across the company. Adjusting for the tax items in the A-12 litigation settlement 2013, core earnings per share increased 14%. 
Operating cash flow for the year was also very strong at $8.9 billion. The robust cash generation was driven by higher deliveries, solid core operating performance, favorable timing of receipts and expenditures and capturing the early benefits of our disciplined working capital initiatives. 
Let's now move to our quarterly results on Slide 6. Fourth quarter revenue increased 3% to $24.5 billion, driven by strong commercial airplane deliveries. Core operating margin increased to 9.6%, reflecting solid productivity gains in both businesses. Fourth quarter core earnings per share increased 23% to $2.31 on higher volume and continued strong operating performance. Fourth quarter 2013 included, again, $0.34 for the A-12 litigation settlement. 
Let's now discuss Commercial Airplanes on Slide 7. For the fourth quarter, our Commercial Airplane business increased revenue 15% to $16.8 billion on a record 195 airplane delivery and solid operating margin of 9.3%. The margin benefit from the higher volume mature programs was offset by the impact of higher 787 deliveries and the anticipated increase in period cost, primarily for investments to support future growth and productivity. 
Commercial Airplanes revenue for the year was a record $60 billion, an increase of 13%, as we successfully executed on our planned production rate increases resulting again in record deliveries totaled 723 aircrafts. Commercial Airplanes captured $27 billion in net orders during the quarter, and backlog grew to a new record of $440 billion [ph] and nearly 5,800 aircraft. 
Specifically, on the 787, we exceeded our delivery guidance for the full year as the team worked hard to deliver 114 787s, and in total, we've now delivered 228 787s to 29 customers, 14 of which were new customers in 2014. We continue to see progress in key operational performance indicators as we further implement production efficiencies and stabilize the overall 787 production system. On the 787-8, we've seen a decline in unit costs or approximately 30% over the last 175 deliveries, and on 787-9, we see declines of 20% since the first delivery. Based on this progress, our production schedule on planned productivity investments, we continue to expect the 787 to be cash-positive during 2015, and we still anticipate deferred production to decline shortly after we've achieved the 12 per month production rate in 2016. No change to these fundamental milestones. 
In the fourth quarter, the 787 deferred production increased $960 million to $26.1 billion, and we now anticipate 787 different production to grow at moderate levels for the next several quarters, as productivity improvements on both models offset timing of supplier negotiations, further investments to optimize the production system and our decision to maintain higher employment levels to ensure the continued smooth introduction of the 787-9 and further incorporate additional productivity and reliability investments. These focused decision and efforts are expected to continue to drive long-term efficiencies, margin improvement and cash generation on the 787 program. 
Overall, our focus and priorities remain unchanged for the 787 program. Solid day-to-day execution, risk reduction and improving long-term productivity and cash flow going forward, while continuing to have smooth ramp-up on the 787-9 production, prepare for the 12 per month rate introducing the Dash 10, while again driving efficiencies across all aspects of the program. 
Let's turn now to Defense, Space & Security results on Slide 8. Fourth quarter revenue for our Defense business was $7.6 billion, and operating margins increased to 12.1% due to strong business across the portfolio. Revenue for Boeing Military Aircraft declined to $3 billion in the fourth quarter, resulting from lower planned C-17 and F-15 deliveries. Operating margins increased to 12.3% in the quarter, driven by solid operating performance. 
Network & Space Systems revenue declined to $2.2 billion in the fourth quarter on lower government satellite volume. Operating margin at S&S was 8.8% in the quarter. Global Services & Support reported a 2% increase in the fourth quarter revenue to $2.4 billion on higher MM&U volume and generate strong operating margins of 14.9%, driven by higher operating performance. 
Defense, Space & Security reported a solid backlog of $62 billion, with 36% of our current backlog now representing from customers outside the United States. 
Let's now turn to Slide 9. Operating cash flow for the fourth quarter was $5 billion. The strength of our cash flow was driven by higher volume, strong operating performance, the favorable timing of receipts and expenditures and, again, early benefits of our disciplined working capital initiatives. With regard to capital the deployment, we paid $519 million in dividend to shareholders and repurchased 7.8 million shares for $1 billion in the fourth quarter, bringing our total 2014 repurchase activity to 47 million shares or $6 billion. As Jim mentioned earlier, we announced in December that our Board of Directors increased share repurchase authorization to $12 billion [ph] and increase the dividend 25%, up 88% in the last 2 years. We expect to complete the repurchase authorization over approximately the next 2 to 3 years. 
Our capital deployment to date continues to demonstrate the strength of our portfolio in backlog and our commitment and confidence in the business performing well going forward. Returning cash to shareholders, along with continued investment to support future growth, remains priorities for us. 
Let's now move to cash and debt balances on Slide 10. We ended the quarter with $13.1 billion of cash and marketable securities, and our cash position continue to provide solid liquidity and position us well going forward. Again, our financial strength allows us to continue to invest in key growth areas of the business, returning cash to shareholders and execute our cash deployment strategies going forward. 
Turn now to Slide 11, we'll discuss our outlook for 2015. Our guidance for 2015 reflects solid core operating performance, higher deliveries at Commercial Airplanes business, while reflecting the near-term investments needed to support our efforts to drive long-term growth and productivity. Core earnings per share guidance for 2015 is set to be between $8.20 and $8.40 per share and excluding the 2014 tax settlements totaling $0.71 per share, 2015 earnings per share is expected to grow between 4% and 6%. 
Revenue for 2015 is forecast to increase to be between $94.5 billion and $96.5 billion, representing growth of between 4% and 6%. Our 2015 Commercial Airplane of revenue guidance is between $64.5 billion and $65.5 billion, reflecting 8% to 9% growth, as we execute on our record backlog. The 2015 commercial delivery forecast is now between 750 and 755 airplanes, and 787 deliveries for 2015 are expected to be essentially in line with the 10 per month production rate plus a few early build deliveries. Commercial Airplanes operating guidance is set to be between 9.5% and 10% on improved operating performance, offset by greater dilution impact of higher planned research and development spending, higher 787 deliveries and further investments to support future growth. 
Defense, Space & Security revenue guidance for 2015 is between $29.5 billion and $30.5 billion, reflecting the continued challenging defensive environment, particularly -- partially offset, excuse me, by the ongoing international growth. Operating margin guidance for the Defense business is now between 9.75% and 10%, reflecting continued productivity efforts, offset by the impact of lower volume and delivery mix. Supporting our long-term growth plans, we expect research and development spending for 2015 to be approximately $3.5 billion, with about 70% related to 787, particularly driven by the planned increase in 777X and 787-10 development. While at BDS, we continue to invest in key strategic growth opportunities going forward. We expect operating cash for 2015 to be greater than $9 billion, reflecting higher deliveries, strong operating performance, continued 787 productivity and capturing final C-17 orders. This is somewhat offset by higher cash tax payments and favorable timing of receipts and expenditures benefited 2014 results. As we look forward, we expect further growth in operating cash flow in 2016 as we continue to execute on our backlog, capture additional activity gain and improve 787 cash performance. Capital spending guidance for 2015 is approximately $2.8 billion, driven by the new 777X facilities and equipment, Charleston expansion to support the 787 rate increase and other investments to support continued growth and productivity. Our required pension contributions in 2015 will be minimal. As a result of legislative pension changes, we are now foregoing discretionary pension funding in 2015. As we look into the next quarter, we expect first quarter revenue core EPS and cash flow to be the lowest during the year, based on timing of deliveries, leasing the expenditures and advances. First quarter EPS is estimated to be approximately 20% of our full earnings. 
So in summary, Boeing's 2014 financial performance and the 2015 financial guidance reflects the strong demand for our products and services, the strength of our backlog and our continued focus on driving productivity throughout the entire enterprise. 
With that, I'll now turn it back to Jim for some final thoughts."

On the 777, the big issue there obviously is the bridge, transition to the bridge because I think the market spoke of the launch of 777X, a very robust launch. As to the bridge, the 63 orders this year that Ray and his team secured bodes well for the 40 to 60 we need over the next few years to get to the bridge, so I'm feeling increasingly comfortable there. Long-term demand for the airplanes, there is no competition for the airplane, so I feel very good about the long-term demand for the airplane. I think on the 787, I think what you're going to see is a mix from Dash 8s to Dash 9s to Dash 10s. And there'll be some moving around this guideline as that's accommodated. That's all goodness for the Boeing Company in the sense that we are usually selling more capability for a higher price, and that dynamic I don't see changing. I think we're still -- we're a little bit hampered by the number of orders we have. I mean, it's -- now we're to 21-ish, I would anticipate toward the end of this year and into next year a rekindling of orders on the 87s as we go a little closer to the end of the decade, people begin to pick up options, the moving around of this guideline was excited a little bit. And the airplane's performance, quite frankly, I cited it in my remarks, the airplane's performance, to be candid, is better, I think, by and large, than we sold it at. And we're very pleased with the operating cost, the fuel savings obviously. And the thing that is often left unnoticed here is that this grows the market. This airplane enables widebody or  any kind of body, quite frankly, that have never been enabled before. And so I'm sort of making up the number, but it's 20% of the demand for this thing is opening up capacity between city pairs that was not available before because of the performance of the airplane. So it's a little bit longer answer than you wanted, but that's my jump on the subject."

The things we're doing on this program everyday are all about driving cash and profitability over the long term, so there's going to be additions we made quarter-over-quarter or, frankly, half year between last year and this year that are enhancements to the production system over long term that are proven. We've done them another program, and now it's about implementing on the 787. So there's some in there that's really, again, focused on investments over the long term of the program. As far as labor, we are coming down on unit cost, but we are coming down in a lower rate than what we expected or anticipated. And again, we're doing at these higher labor levels to really achieve the stability, incorporate those reliability enhancements I talked about. And then these productivity initiatives, again, they're going to take folks to work through each one of those at every sequence of the bill, and we're working that. We're working that at an enterprise-level. We're leveraging across Boeing. So we know where the bottlenecks or some of the challenges are, so now it's about when we reach 10 a month, capturing that and improving upon that. On the supply chain side, we talked about the timing of some of our discussions and negotiation, and some of those have moved up to the right and I think I've mentioned before that we see no benefit in doing that. These guys are still coming down the learning curve. We are helping them encapsulate productivity enhancements that we're seeing or able to achieve in Charleston and Everett. We want to get that back into the supply chain, and then from there, we'll mature our negotiation. So again, a near-term sacrifice but much long-term benefit, frankly, for us and our supplier. But those are really the 3 main categories that we're faced with over the next tenures till the end of '15. But very focused again on the long term and very focused on improving cash on the program, and none of those fundamentals have changed."

Let me begin today with a brief review of some recent strategic achievements, followed by comments on our strong 2014 operating performance, then an overview of the business environment. After that, Greg will walk you through our financial results and outlook in greater detail. 
Now let's move to Slide 2, please. Boeing is entering 2015 stronger, healthier and better positioned in its markets than any time in recent memory. Our strategic accomplishments over the past 24 months alone provide a compelling picture of the progress we've made to enable sustained growth in improving profitability as we near the start of our second century in business. During that time frame, we captured more than 2,700 net new commercial airplane orders; grew our market share in deliveries with 6 successful production rate increases including reaching our target 10 per month on the 787 with more than 3 per month flowing steadily from our capacity expansion in South Carolina; we completed a comprehensive refresh of our commercial airplane product line with the highly successful launches of the twin-aisle 787-10 and the 777X on a combined 400 orders and commitments and the launch of the single-aisle 737 MAX 200 with a 100-airplane order from Ryanair. 
Starting with the hard-fought technology gains at 787, we have built a substantial technological lead in commercial aviation, particularly in the high-value twin-aisle market. And by listening to our customers and applying our proven technologies and lessons learned, in summary, we have derisked a decade of new product development while expanding our edge in the performance and efficiency of our airplanes. 
Turning to Boeing Defense, Space & Security. Despite a tough domestic budget environment, BDS continued to strengthen its relative market position and competitiveness. We have accomplished this by driving significant new efficiencies in response to the environment in order to meet government customer needs and fund investments in technology and innovation, including in-space programs where we have restored our technological lead and market position in satellites, autonomous spacecraft, missile defense and human space flight. To the benefit of both businesses, we also secured unprecedented production continuity and improved economics with long-term labor agreements at our major production sites at Puget Sound, St. Louis and Philadelphia. And we retired significant and long-standing legal and financial risks from billions in potential liability on matters such as the A-12 program, to the short-term threat to our balance sheet from defined benefit pensions. As you know, by the end of next year, approximately 90% of our workforce will participate in defined contribution plans which provide attractive and competitive benefits to employees without the risks to our balance sheet. Going forward, we remain ever focused on driving productivity and executing on our growth initiatives which are fundamental to our success. 
To meet customer demand for our market-leading Commercial Airplanes, we have 5 more rate increases ahead of us over the remainder of the decade. These higher production volumes will provide additional opportunities for driving step-function gains in productivity for us and our suppliers through Lean, plus capturing the value of quality and our Partnering for Success efforts. We are equally committed to breaking the cost curve on our new development programs and delivering them on time with performance as advertised. To that end, we have focused our engineering teams on designs that are more producible, common systems and parts across airplane families and our disciplined gated development process. We have also increased our investment in manufacturing and production innovations, including automation, to increase quality and safety in the workplace and reduce flow times. Overall, for 2015 and throughout the remainder of the decade, these recent achievements in the marketplace, in our operations and in our financial performance set the stage for expected significant cash generation, the flexibility to invest for growth in support of our customers and the increasing return of cash to shareholders. 
With that as perspective, let's discuss our 2014 results on Slide 3, please. Strong fourth quarter results, driven by higher commercial deliveries and solid operating performance, capped an outstanding year. We continue to deliver on our strategies to convert our backlog into profitable growth and to drive productivity and affordability throughout the company. For the full year, we reported record revenue and core earnings per share, solid operating margins and strong cash flow, much of which was returned to shareholders. Boeing Commercial Airplanes reported record revenue of $60 billion for the year on higher production rates and an industry record 723 deliveries, which expanded our global market share leadership in deliveries for the third consecutive year. 2014 was also an exceptional year for new bookings as we captured commercial gross orders of 1,550 airplanes and record net orders of 1,432 airplanes, which increased our backlog to nearly 5,800 airplanes. When combined with strong orders from our Defense business, total company backlog grew to a record $502 billion.
Other Commercial Airplanes key milestones in 2014 included successfully reaching the 42 per month production rate on the 737 and announcing plans to increase to 52 in 2018; model certification and delivery of the first 10 787-9s, completing Preliminary Design Review on the 787-10 and breaking ground on the new 777X composite centers in Puget Sound and St. Louis. Boeing Defense, Space & Security also had a very strong year with solid revenue, healthy margins and significant new business wins and program milestones. Key contract awards captured during the fourth quarter included an order for 2 702 high-power satellites; multiple long-term international service contracts, including a 25-year order from the Australian government to train rotary-wing aircrews valued at approximately $500 million; and the finalization of the NASA commercial crew award announced in the third quarter. Noteworthy program milestones in the quarter included the first flight of the 767-2C test aircraft for the KC-46 Tanker program; the selection of the V-22 by Japan to fulfill their tiltrotor aircraft requirements; and U.S. government funding for EA-18G Growler production; finally, our strong operational performance trend, significant cash flow and confidence in the future all supported by our December announcement of the new share repurchase authorization totaling $12 billion and a 25% increase in the quarterly dividend. 
With that, let's turn to the business environment on Slide 4. Our view of the business environment remains positive, given favorable global air traffic trends, improving airline profitability and the continuing need for efficient and value-creating products we provide. Strong growth in the commercial airplane market continues to drive demand that supports our planned production rate increases over the remainder of the decade. Net new orders for 2014 that I mentioned earlier were essentially twice our 2014 output, and our record backlog of 5,800 airplanes represents approximately 8 years of production at current rates. Replacement demand remains an important market driver, with airlines continuing to introduce newer, more efficient airplanes with superior economics and a rapid return on investment in place of older, less efficient models in service. Notwithstanding a fuel price environment today that is well below the 15-year average, the value proposition for our airplanes remains a compelling one. Historically, we have seen aircraft orders more correlated to airline profits, and as many of you may recall, we closed the business case for and launched the 787 when oil was at $40 a barrel. Furthermore, based on discussions with our customers, lower oil prices have not substantially changed their views on fleet planning or their commitment to existing delivery schedules. Our new technologically advanced airplanes not only have far better fuel efficiency and lower maintenance cost, but also often deliver higher passenger and cargo revenue, increased residual values, a better overall passenger experience and greater range, allowing for new city pairs and more optimal routes. All of these elements provide significant value to our customers over the life of the aircraft. Overall, we see low fuel prices and positive traffic trends as beneficial to our industry and growth prospects. Our long-term outlook also remain strong as we expect the combination of growth and replacement to drive the need for nearly 37,000 aircraft over the next 20 years. 
In the twin-aisle segment, we continue to see healthy demand for both the 777 and the 777X, which are outselling the competition by a wide margin, giving us confidence in our ability to efficiently transition production between the 2 airplanes. In 2014, we captured 63 new orders for current 777 models, giving us 217 firm orders in backlog. We expect demand for the 777 to remain healthy through the end of this decade, with an anticipated average order capture of around 40 to 60 airplanes per year to support the transition to the 777X. With the new airplanes scheduled to enter final assembly in the 2018 time frame, this transition will leverage new manufacturing processes and technologies being proven on the current 777 to optimize the 777X production system. 
On the 787 program, which delivered a twin-aisle industry record 114 airplanes in 2014, we remain focused on continued production efficiencies in support of future plan rate increases to match the strong market demand for the airplane. Since the first customer flight, the 787 fleet has now flown -- has now safely flown approximately 30 million passengers, more than 400 million miles while saving 1 billion pounds of fuel, providing game-changing efficiencies and capabilities to 29 customers worldwide. 
In the single-aisle segment, demand for our new fuel-efficient 737 MAX also remains high, with cumulative orders totaling more than 2,660 airplanes from 57 customers. Development of the MAX remains on track for the first delivery in 2017. 
Turning to Defense, Space & Security. We continue to see solid support among U.S. customers and Congress for our major programs. In addition to the Growler funding I mentioned earlier, the FY '15 budget signed into law in December fully funds other core Boeing production programs such as the Apache helicopter and the P-8A Poseidon. Key development programs like Tanker and Long Range Strike also were fully funded, and additional funds were added for the Space Launch System. We continue to see strong international demand for our offerings as well, particularly in the Middle East and the Asia-Pacific region. In 2014, international customers for Defense, Space & Security represented 28% of revenue and 36% of our current backlog. While notable alone for its size, the strength of our international Defense backlog also comes from its diversity across our product and services portfolio and the geographic mix of its customer base. 
Our investments in technology and innovation for organic growth continue in areas such as commercial derivatives, space, unmanned systems, intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance and the critical few large-scale future programs that are priorities for our customers, like Long Range Strike, UCLASS and the T-X Trainer. The relative strength of our Defense, Space & Security business stems from a portfolio that is reliable, proven and affordable, supported by our ongoing market-based affordability initiative, which is focused on reducing operating costs by another $2 billion to ensure competitiveness through the ongoing downturn in domestic defense spending. 
In summary, our business strategies are aligned to the realities and the opportunities of our markets. And our teams are executing them well to deliver top line and bottom line performance and capture new business to sustain our growth and profitability for the decades to come. 
Now over to Greg for our financial results and our updated guidance. Greg?"
370857,280138552,750266,"The Boeing Company, Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2015",2015-01-28,"Earnings Calls","The Boeing Company","Executives","Thanks, Jim, and good morning. Let's turn to Slide 5 to discuss our full year results. Revenue for the year was a record $91 billion, reflecting 5% growth from last year, driven by higher deliveries in our Commercial Airplane business. Core earnings per",1569,"Thanks, Jim, and good morning. Let's turn to Slide 5 to discuss our full year results. 
Revenue for the year was a record $91 billion, reflecting 5% growth from last year, driven by higher deliveries in our Commercial Airplane business. Core earnings per share totaled $8.60 for the year, representing a 22% increase. The increase in core EPS was driven by strong operational performance across the company. Adjusting for the tax items in the A-12 litigation settlement in 2013, core earnings per share increased 14%. 
Operating cash flow for the year was also very strong at $8.9 billion. The robust cash generation was driven by higher deliveries, solid core operating performance, favorable timing of receipts and expenditures and capturing the early benefits of our disciplined working capital initiatives. 
Let's now move to our quarterly results on Slide 6. Fourth quarter revenue increased 3% to $24.5 billion, driven by strong Commercial Airplane deliveries. Core operating margins increased to 9.6%, reflecting solid productivity gains in both businesses. Fourth quarter core earnings per share increased 23% to $2.31 on higher volume and continued strong operating performance. Fourth quarter 2013 included, again, $0.34 for the A-12 litigation settlement. 
Let's now discuss Commercial Airplanes on Slide 7. For the fourth quarter, our Commercial Airplane business increased revenue 15% to $16.8 billion on a record 195 airplane deliveries and solid operating margins of 9.3%. The margin benefit from the higher volume and mature programs was offset by the impact of higher 787 deliveries and the anticipated increase in period cost primarily for investments to support future growth and productivity. 
Commercial Airplanes revenue for the year was a record $60 billion, an increase of 13%, as we successfully executed on our planned production rate increases, resulting again in record deliveries totaling 723 aircraft. Commercial Airplanes captured $27 billion in net orders during the quarter, and backlog grew to a new record of $440 billion and nearly 5,800 aircraft. 
Specifically on the 787, we exceeded our delivery guidance for the full year as the team worked hard to deliver 114 787s, and in total, we have now delivered 228 787s to 29 customers, 14 of which were new customers in 2014. We continue to see progress in key operational performance indicators as we further implement production efficiencies and stabilize the overall 787 production system. On the 787-8, we've seen a decline in unit costs of approximately 30% over the last 175 deliveries. And on 787-9, we've seen declines of 20% since the first delivery. Based on this progress, our production schedule and planned productivity investments, we continue to expect the 787 to be cash-positive during 2015, and we still anticipate deferred production to decline shortly after we have achieved the 12 per month production rate in 2016. No change to these fundamental milestones. 
In the fourth quarter, the 787 deferred production increased $960 million to $26.1 billion, and we now anticipate 787 deferred production to grow at moderate levels for the next several quarters as productivity improvements on both models offset timing of supplier negotiations, further investments to operate -- optimize the production system and our decision to maintain higher employment levels to ensure the continued smooth introduction of the 787-9 and further incorporate additional productivity and reliability investments. These focused decisions and efforts are expected to continue to drive long-term efficiencies, margin improvement and cash generation on the 787 program. 
Overall, our focus and priorities remain unchanged for the 787 program: solid day-to-day execution, risk reduction and improving long-term productivity and cash flow going forward while continuing to have smooth ramp-up on the 787-9 production; prepare for the 12 per month rate introducing the Dash 10, while again driving efficiencies across all aspects of the program. 
Let's turn now to Defense, Space & Security results on Slide 8. Fourth quarter revenue for our Defense business was $7.6 billion, and operating margins increased to 12.1% due to strong business across the portfolio. Revenue for Boeing Military Aircraft declined by -- to $3 billion in the fourth quarter, resulting from lower planned C-17 and F-15 deliveries. Operating margins increased to 12.3% in the quarter, driven by solid operating performance. 
Network & Space Systems revenue declined to $2.2 billion in the fourth quarter on lower government satellite volume. Operating margin at N&SS was 8.8% in the quarter. Global Services & Support reported a 2% increase in the fourth quarter revenue to $2.4 billion on higher MM&U volume and generated strong operating margins of 14.9%, driven by higher operating performance. 
Defense, Space & Security reported a solid backlog of $62 billion, with 36% of our current backlog now representing from customers outside the United States. 
Let's now turn to Slide 9. Operating cash flow for the fourth quarter was $5 billion. The strength of our cash flow was driven by higher volume, strong operating performance, favorable timing of receipts and expenditures and again, early benefits of our disciplined working capital initiatives. With regard to capital deployment, we paid $519 million in dividend to shareholders and repurchased 7.8 million shares for $1 billion in the fourth quarter, bringing our total 2014 repurchase activity to 47 million shares or $6 billion. And as Jim mentioned earlier, we announced in December that our Board of Directors increased the share repurchase authorization to $12 billion and increased the dividend 25%, up 88% in the last 2 years. We expect to complete the repurchase authorization over approximately the next 2 to 3 years. 
Our capital deployment to date continues to demonstrate the strength of our portfolio and backlog and our commitment and confidence in the business performing well going forward. Returning cash to shareholders, along with continued investment to support future growth, remains priorities for us. 
Let's now move to cash and debt balances on Slide 10. We ended the quarter with $13.1 billion of cash and marketable securities, and our cash position continues to provide solid liquidity and positions us well going forward. Again, our financial strength allows us to continue to invest in key growth areas of the business, return cash to shareholders and execute our cash deployment strategies going forward. 
Turn now to Slide 11, and we'll discuss our outlook for 2015. Our guidance for 2015 reflects solid core operating performance, higher deliveries in the Commercial Airplanes business, while reflecting the near-term investments needed to support our efforts to drive long-term growth and productivity. Core earnings per share guidance for 2015 is set to be between $8.20 and $8.40 per share and excluding the 2014 tax settlements totaling $0.71 per share, 2015 earnings per share is expected to grow between 4% and 6%. 
Revenue for 2015 is forecast to increase, to be between $94.5 billion and $96.5 billion, representing growth of between 4% and 6%. Our 2015 Commercial Airplane revenue guidance is between $64.5 billion and $65.5 billion, reflecting 8% to 9% growth as we execute on our record backlog. The 2015 commercial delivery forecast is now between 750 and 755 airplanes, and 787 deliveries for 2015 are expected to be essentially in line with the 10 per rate -- 10 per month production rate, plus a few early-build deliveries. Commercial Airplanes' operating margin guidance is set to be between 9.5% and 10% on improved operating performance, offset by greater dilution impact of higher planned research and development spending, higher 787 deliveries and further investments to support future growth. 
Defense, Space & Security revenue guidance for 2015 is between $29.5 billion and $30.5 billion, reflecting the continued challenging defense environment, particularly offset -- partially offset, excuse me, by the ongoing international growth. Operating margin guidance of the Defense business is now between 9.75% and 10%, reflecting continued productivity efforts, offset by the impact of lower volume and delivery mix. Supporting our long-term growth plans, we expect research and development spending for 2015 to be approximately $3.5 billion, with about 70% related to 787, particularly driven by the planned increase in 777X and 787-10 development; while at BDS, we continue to invest in key strategic growth opportunities going forward. We expect operating cash flow for 2015 to be greater than $9 billion, reflecting higher deliveries, strong operating performance, continued 787 productivity and capturing final C-17 orders. This is somewhat offset by higher cash tax payments, and favorable timing of receipts and expenditures benefited 2014 results. As we look forward, we expect further growth in operating cash flow in 2016 as we continue to execute on our backlog, capture additional productivity gain and improve 787 cash performance. Capital spending guidance for 2015 is approximately $2.8 billion, driven by the new 777X facilities and equipment, Charleston expansion to support the 787 rate increase and other investments to support continued growth and productivity. Our required pension contributions in 2015 will be minimal. As a result of legislative pension changes, we are now foregoing discretionary pension funding in 2015. As we look into the next quarter, we expect first quarter revenue core EPS and cash flow to be the lowest during the year, based on timing of deliveries, phasing the expenditures and advances. First quarter EPS is estimated to be approximately 20% of our full earnings. 
So in summary, Boeing's 2014 financial performance and the 2015 financial guidance reflects the strong demand for our products and services, the strength of our backlog and our continued focus on driving productivity throughout the entire enterprise. 
With that, I'll now turn it back over to Jim for some final thoughts."

On the 777, the God issue there obviously is the bridge, transition to the bridge, because I think the market has spoken on the launch of the 777X, a very robust launch. As to the bridge, the 63 orders this year that Ray and his team secured bodes well for the 40 to 60 we need over the next few years to get to the bridge, so I'm feeling increasingly comfortable there. Long-term demand for the airplane, there is no competition for the airplane, so I feel very good about the long-term demand for the airplane. I think on the 787, I think what you're going to see is a mix from Dash 8s to Dash 9s to Dash 10s. And there will be some moving around of this guideline as that's accommodated. That's all goodness for the Boeing Company in the sense that we are usually selling more capability for a higher price, and that dynamic I don't see changing. I think we're still -- we're a little bit hampered by the number of orders we have. I mean, it's -- we're out to 20, 21-ish. I would anticipate toward the end of this year and into next year a rekindling of orders on the 87 as we get a little closer to the end of the decade. People begin to pick up options. The moving around of this guideline will have subsided a little bit. And the airplane's performance, quite frankly, I cited it in my remarks, the airplane's performance, to be candid, is better, I think, by and large, than we sold it for -- at. And we're very pleased with the operating cost, the fuel savings obviously. And the thing that is often left unnoticed here is that this grows the market. This airplane enables widebody or any kind of body, quite frankly, city pairs that have never been enabled before. And so I'm sort of making up the number, but it's 20% of the demand for this thing is opening up capacity between city pairs that was not available before because of the performance of the airplane. So it's a little bit longer answer than you wanted, but that's my dump on the subject."

We've done them on other programs. And now it's about implementing them on the 787. So there's some of that in there that's really, again, focused on investments over the long term of the program. On -- as far as labor, we are coming down on unit cost, but we're coming down in a lower rate than what we expected or anticipated. And again, we're doing that at these higher labor levels to really achieve the stability, incorporate those reliability enhancements I talked about. And then these productivity initiatives, again, they're going to take folks to work through each one of those at every sequence of the build, and we're working that. And we're working that at an enterprise level. We're leveraging it across Boeing. So we know where the bottlenecks are or some of the challenges are, so now it's about when reaching -- when we reach the 10 a month, capturing that and improving upon that. On the supply chain side, we've talked about the timing of some of our discussions and negotiations, and some of those have moved out to the right and I think I've mentioned before that we've seen a benefit in doing that. These guys are still coming down a learning curve. We are helping them encapsulate productivity enhancements that we're seeing or able to achieve in Charleston and Everett. We want to get that back into the supply chain, and then from there, we'll mature our negotiations. So again, a near-term sacrifice but much long-term benefit, frankly, for us and our supplier.

Let me begin today with a brief review of some recent strategic achievements, followed by comments on our strong 2014 operating performance, then an overview of the business environment. After that, Greg will walk you through our financial results and outlook in greater detail. 
Now let's move to Slide 2, please. Boeing is entering 2015 stronger, healthier and better positioned in its markets than any time in recent memory. Our strategic accomplishments over the past 24 months alone provide a compelling picture of the progress we've made to enable sustained growth and improving profitability as we near the start of our second century in business. During that time frame, we've captured more than 2,700 net new Commercial Airplane orders; grew our market share in deliveries with 6 successful production rate increases, including reaching our target 10 per month on the 787 with more than 3 per month flowing steadily from our capacity expansion in South Carolina; we completed a comprehensive refresh of our Commercial Airplane product line with the highly successful launches of the twin-aisle 787-10 and the 777X on a combined 400 orders and commitments and the launch of the single-aisle 737 MAX 200 with a 100-airplane order from Ryanair. 
Starting with the hard-fought technology gains of 787, we have built a substantial technological lead in Commercial Aviation, particularly in the high-value twin-aisle market. And by listening to our customers and applying our proven technologies and lessons learned, in summary, we have derisked a decade of new product development while expanding our edge in the performance and efficiency of our airplanes. 
Turning to Boeing Defense, Space & Security. Despite a tough domestic budget environment, BDS continued to strengthen its relative market position and competitiveness. We have accomplished this by driving significant new efficiencies in response to the environment in order to meet government customer needs and fund investments in technology and innovation, including in space programs, where we have restored our technological lead and market position in satellites, autonomous spacecraft, missile defense and human space flight. To the benefit of both businesses, we also secured unprecedented production continuity and improved economics with long-term labor agreements at our major production sites at Puget Sound, St. Louis and Philadelphia. And we retired significant and longstanding legal and financial risks from billions in potential liability on matters such as the A-12 program to the short-term threat to our balance sheet from defined benefit pensions. As you know, by the end of next year, approximately 90% of our workforce will participate in defined contribution plans, which provide attractive and competitive benefits to employees without the risks to our balance sheet. Going forward, we remain ever focused on driving productivity and executing on our growth initiatives, which are fundamental to our success. 
To meet customer demand for our market-leading Commercial Airplanes, we have 5 more rate increases ahead of us over the remainder of the decade. These higher production volumes will provide additional opportunities for driving step-function gains in productivity for us and our suppliers through Lean+, Capturing the Value of Quality and our Partnering for Success efforts. We are equally committed to breaking the cost curve on our new development programs and delivering them on time with performance as advertised. To that end, we have focused our engineering teams on designs that are more producible, common systems and parts across airplane families and our disciplined, gated development process. We have also increased our investment in manufacturing and production innovations, including automation, to increase quality and safety in the workplace and reduce flow times. Overall, for 2015 and throughout the remainder of the decade, these recent achievements in the marketplace, in our operations and in our financial performance set the stage for expected significant cash generation, the flexibility to invest for growth in support of our customers and the increasing return of cash to shareholders. 
With that as perspective, let's discuss our 2014 results on Slide 3, please. Strong fourth quarter results, driven by higher commercial deliveries and solid operating performance, capped an outstanding year. We continued to deliver on our strategies to convert our backlog into profitable growth and to drive productivity and affordability throughout the company. For the full year, we reported record revenue and core earnings per share, solid operating margins and strong cash flow, much of which was returned to shareholders. Boeing Commercial Airplanes reported record revenue of $60 billion for the year on higher production rates and an industry record 723 deliveries, which expanded our global market share leadership in deliveries for the third consecutive year. 2014 was also an exceptional year for new bookings, as we captured commercial gross orders of 1,550 airplanes and record net orders of 1,432 airplanes, which increased our backlog to nearly 5,800 airplanes. When combined with strong orders from our Defense business, total company backlog grew to a record $502 billion.
Other Commercial Airplanes key milestones in 2014 included successfully reaching the 42-per-month production rate on the 737 and announcing plans to increase to 52 in 2018; model certification and delivery of the first 10 787-9s; completing Preliminary Design Review on the 787-10; and breaking ground on the new 777X composite centers in Puget Sound and St. Louis. Boeing Defense, Space & Security also had a very strong year with solid revenue, healthy margins and significant new business wins and program milestones. Key contract awards captured during the fourth quarter included an order for 2 702 high-power satellites; multiple long-term international service contracts, including a 25-year order from the Australian government to train rotary-wing aircrews valued at approximately $500 million; and finalization of the NASA commercial crew award announced in the third quarter. Noteworthy program milestones in the quarter included the first flight of the 767-2C test aircraft for the KC-46 Tanker program; the selection of the V-22 by Japan to fulfill their tiltrotor aircraft requirements; and U.S. government funding for EA-18G Growler production. Finally, our strong operational performance trend, significant cash flow and confidence in the future, all supported by our December announcement of the new share repurchase authorization totaling $12 billion and a 25% increase in the quarterly dividend. 
With that, let's turn to the business environment on Slide 4. Our view of the business environment remains positive, given favorable global air traffic trends, improving airline profitability and the continuing need for efficient and value-creating products we provide. Strong growth in the commercial airplane market continues to drive demand that supports our planned production rate increases over the remainder of the decade. Net new orders for 2014 that I mentioned earlier were essentially twice our 2014 output, and our record backlog of 5,800 airplanes represents approximately 8 years of production at current rates. Replacement demand remains an important market driver, with airlines continuing to introduce newer, more efficient airplanes with superior economics and a rapid return on investment in place of older, less efficient models in service. Notwithstanding a fuel price environment today that is well below the 15-year average, the value proposition for our airplanes remains a compelling one. Historically, we have seen aircraft orders more correlated to airline profits, and as many of you may recall, we closed the business case for and launched the 787 when oil was at $40 a barrel. Furthermore, based on discussions with our customers, lower oil prices have not substantially changed their views on fleet planning or their commitment to existing delivery schedules. Our new technologically advanced airplanes not only have far better fuel efficiency and lower maintenance costs but also often deliver higher passenger and cargo revenue, increased residual values, a better overall passenger experience and greater range, allowing for new city pairs and more optimal routes. All of these elements provide significant value to our customers over the life of the aircraft. Overall, we see low fuel prices and positive traffic trends as beneficial to our industry and growth prospects. Our long-term outlook also remains strong, as we expect the combination of growth and replacement to drive the need for nearly 37,000 aircraft over the next 20 years. 
In the twin-aisle segment, we continue to see healthy demand for both the 777 and the 777X, which are outselling the competition by a wide margin, giving us confidence in our ability to efficiently transition production between the 2 airplanes. In 2014, we captured 63 new orders for current 777 models, giving us 217 firm orders in backlog. We expect demand for the 777 to remain healthy through the end of this decade, with an anticipated average order capture of around 40 to 60 airplanes per year to support the transition to the 777X. With the new airplanes -- for the new airplanes scheduled to enter final assembly in the 2018 time frame, this transition will leverage new manufacturing processes and technologies being proven on the current 777 to optimize the 777X production system. 
On the 787 program, which delivered a twin-aisle industry record 114 airplanes in 2014, we remain focused on continued production efficiencies in support of future planned rate increases to match the strong market demand for the airplane. Since the first customer flight, the 787 fleet has now flown -- has now safely flown approximately 30 million passengers, more than 400 million miles, while saving 1 billion pounds of fuel, providing game-changing efficiencies and capabilities to 29 customers worldwide. 
In the single-aisle segment, demand for our new fuel-efficient 737 MAX also remains high with cumulative orders totaling more than 2,660 airplanes from 57 customers. Development of the MAX remains on track for first delivery in 2017. 
Turning to Defense, Space & Security. We continue to see solid support among U.S. customers and Congress for our major programs. In addition to the Growler funding I mentioned earlier, the FY '15 budget signed into law in December fully funds other core Boeing production programs such as the Apache helicopter and the P-8A Poseidon. Key development programs like Tanker and Long Range Strike also were fully funded, and additional funds were added for the Space Launch System. We continue to see strong international demand for our offerings as well, particularly in the Middle East and the Asia-Pacific region. In 2014, international customers for Defense, Space & Security represented 28% of revenue and 36% of our current backlog. While notable alone for its size, the strength of our international Defense backlog also comes from its diversity across our product and services portfolio and the geographic mix of its customer base 
Our investments in technology and innovation for organic growth continue in areas such as commercial derivatives; space; unmanned systems; intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance; and the critical few large-scale future programs that are priorities for our customers, like Long Range Strike, UCLASS and the T-X Trainer. The relative strength of our Defense, Space & Security business stems from a portfolio that is reliable, proven and affordable, supported by our ongoing market-based affordability initiative, which is focused on reducing operating costs by another $2 billion to ensure competitiveness through the ongoing downturn in domestic Defense spending. 
In summary, our business strategies are aligned to the realities and the opportunities of our markets, and our teams are executing them well to deliver top line and bottom line performance and capture new business to sustain our growth and profitability for the decades to come. 
Now over to Greg for our financial results and our updated guidance. Greg?"
370857,280138552,750347,"The Boeing Company, Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2015",2015-01-28,"Earnings Calls","The Boeing Company","Executives","Thanks, Jim, and good morning. Let's turn to Slide 5 to discuss our full year results. Revenue for the year was a record $91 billion, reflecting 5% growth from last year, driven by higher deliveries in our Commercial Airplane business. Core earnings per",1566,"Thanks, Jim, and good morning. Let's turn to Slide 5 to discuss our full year results. 
Revenue for the year was a record $91 billion, reflecting 5% growth from last year, driven by higher deliveries in our Commercial Airplane business. Core earnings per share totaled $8.60 for the year, representing a 22% increase. The increase in core EPS was driven by strong operational performance across the company. Adjusting for the tax items in the A-12 litigation settlement in 2013, core earnings per share increased 14%. 
Operating cash flow for the year was also very strong at $8.9 billion. The robust cash generation was driven by higher deliveries, solid core operating performance, favorable timing of receipts and expenditures and capturing the early benefits of our disciplined working capital initiatives. 
Let's now move to our quarterly results on Slide 6. Fourth quarter revenue increased 3% to $24.5 billion, driven by strong Commercial Airplane deliveries. Core operating margins increased to 9.6%, reflecting solid productivity gains in both businesses. Fourth quarter core earnings per share increased 23% to $2.31 on higher volume and continued strong operating performance. Fourth quarter 2013 included, again, $0.34 for the A-12 litigation settlement. 
Let's now discuss Commercial Airplanes on Slide 7. For the fourth quarter, our Commercial Airplane business increased revenue 15% to $16.8 billion on a record 195 airplane deliveries and solid operating margins of 9.3%. The margin benefit from the higher volume in mature programs was offset by the impact of higher 787 deliveries and the anticipated increase in period costs, primarily for investments to support future growth and productivity. 
Commercial Airplanes revenue for the year was a record $60 billion, an increase of 13%, as we successfully executed on our planned production rate increases, resulting again in record deliveries totaling 723 aircraft. Commercial Airplanes captured $27 billion in net orders during the quarter, and backlog grew to a new record of $440 billion and nearly 5,800 aircraft. 
Specifically on the 787, we exceeded our delivery guidance for the full year as the team worked hard to deliver 114 787s, and in total, we have now delivered 228 787s to 29 customers, 14 of which were new customers in 2014. We continue to see progress in key operational performance indicators as we further implement production efficiencies and stabilize the overall 787 production system. On the 787-8, we've seen a decline in unit costs of approximately 30% over the last 175 deliveries. And on 787-9, we've seen declines of 20% since the first delivery. Based on this progress, our production schedule and planned productivity investments, we continue to expect the 787 to be cash-positive during 2015, and we still anticipate deferred production to decline shortly after we have achieved the 12-per-month production rate in 2016, no change to these fundamental milestones. 
In the fourth quarter, the 787 deferred production increased $960 million to $26.1 billion, and we now anticipate 787 deferred production to grow at moderate levels for the next several quarters as productivity improvements on both models offset timing of supplier negotiations, further investments to operate -- optimize the production system and our decision to maintain higher employment levels to ensure the continued smooth introduction of the 787-9 and further incorporate additional productivity and reliability investments. These focused decisions and efforts are expected to continue to drive long-term efficiencies, margin improvement and cash generation on the 787 program. 
Overall, our focus and priorities remain unchanged for the 787 program: solid day-to-day execution, risk reduction and improving long-term productivity and cash flow going forward while continuing to have smooth ramp-up on the 787-9 production; prepare for the 12-per-month rate introducing of the Dash 10; while again driving efficiencies across all aspects of the program. 
Let's turn now to Defense, Space & Security results on Slide 8. Fourth quarter revenue for our Defense business was $7.6 billion, and operating margins increased to 12.1% due to strong business across the portfolio. Revenue for Boeing Military Aircraft declined by -- to $3 billion in the fourth quarter, resulting from lower planned C-17 and F-15 deliveries. Operating margins increased to 12.3% in the quarter, driven by solid operating performance. 
Network & Space Systems revenue declined to $2.2 billion in the fourth quarter on lower government satellite volume. Operating margin at NS&S (sic) [N&SS] was 8.8% in the quarter. Global Services & Support reported a 2% increase in the fourth quarter revenue to $2.4 billion on higher MM&U volume and generated strong operating margins of 14.9%, driven by higher operating performance. 
Defense, Space & Security reported a solid backlog of $62 billion, with 36% of our current backlog now representing from customers outside the United States. 
Let's now turn to Slide 9. Operating cash flow for the fourth quarter was $5 billion. The strength of our cash flow was driven by higher volume, strong operating performance, favorable timing of receipts and expenditures and, again, early benefits of our disciplined working capital initiatives. With regard to capital deployment, we paid $519 million in dividend to shareholders and repurchased 7.8 million shares for $1 billion in the fourth quarter, bringing our total 2014 repurchase activity to 47 million shares or $6 billion. And as Jim mentioned earlier, we announced in December that our Board of Directors increased the share repurchase authorization to $12 billion and increased the dividend 25%, up 88% in the last 2 years. We expect to complete the repurchase authorization over approximately the next 2 to 3 years. 
Our capital deployment to date continues to demonstrate the strength of our portfolio and backlog and our commitment and confidence in the business performing well going forward. Returning cash to shareholders, along with continued investment to support future growth, remains priorities for us. 
Let's now move to cash and debt balances on Slide 10. We ended the quarter with $13.1 billion of cash and marketable securities, and our cash position continues to provide solid liquidity and positions us well going forward. Again, our financial strength allows us to continue to invest in key growth areas of the business, return cash to shareholders and execute our cash deployment strategies going forward. 
Turn now to Slide 11, and we'll discuss our outlook for 2015. Our guidance for 2015 reflects solid core operating performance, higher deliveries at Commercial Airplanes business, while reflecting the near-term investments needed to support our efforts to drive long-term growth and productivity. Core earnings per share guidance for 2015 is set to be between $8.20 and $8.40 per share. And excluding the 2014 tax settlements totaling $0.71 per share, 2015 earnings per share is expected to grow between 4% and 6%. 
Revenue for 2015 is forecast to increase to be between $94.5 billion and $96.5 billion, representing growth of between 4% and 6%. Our 2015 Commercial Airplane revenue guidance is between $64.5 billion and $65.5 billion, reflecting 8% to 9% growth as we execute on our record backlog. The 2015 Commercial delivery forecast is now between 750 and 755 airplanes, and 787 deliveries for 2015 are expected to be essentially in line with the 10 per rate -- 10-per-month production rate, plus a few early-build deliveries. Commercial Airplanes' operating margin guidance is set to be between 9.5% and 10% on improved operating performance, offset by greater dilution impact of higher planned research and development spending, higher 787 deliveries and further investments to support future growth. 
Defense, Space & Security revenue guidance for 2015 is between $29.5 billion and $30.5 billion, reflecting the continued challenging defense environment, particularly offset -- partially offset, excuse me, by the ongoing international growth. Operating margin guidance of the Defense business is now between 9.75% and 10%, reflecting continued productivity efforts, offset by the impact of lower volume and delivery mix. Supporting our long-term growth plans, we expect research and development spending for 2015 to be approximately $3.5 billion, with about 70% related to 787, particularly driven by the planned increase in 777X and 787-10 development; while at BDS, we continue to invest in key strategic growth opportunities going forward. We expect operating cash flow for 2015 to be greater than $9 billion, reflecting higher deliveries, strong operating performance, continued 787 productivity and capturing final C-17 orders. This is somewhat offset by higher cash tax payments and favorable timing of receipts and expenditures, which benefited 2014 results. As we look forward, we expect further growth in operating cash flow in 2016 as we continue to execute on our backlog, capture additional productivity gains and improve 787 cash performance. Capital spending guidance for 2015 is approximately $2.8 billion, driven by the new 777X facilities and equipment, Charleston expansion to support the 787 rate increase and other investments to support continued growth and productivity. Our required pension contributions in 2015 will be minimal. As a result of legislative pension changes, we are now foregoing discretionary pension funding in 2015. As we look into the next quarter, we expect first quarter revenue, core EPS and cash flow to be the lowest during the year based on timing of deliveries, phasing of expenditures and advances. First quarter EPS is estimated to be approximately 20% of our full earnings. 
So in summary, Boeing's 2014 financial performance and the 2015 financial guidance reflects the strong demand for our products and services, the strength of our backlog and our continued focus on driving productivity throughout the entire enterprise. 
With that, I'll now turn it back over to Jim for some final thoughts."

Built upon an underlying foundation, 2014 was a very strong year for Boeing as we continued to deliver on the significant and sustained growth and increasing profitability and cash flow that our strategies were designed to produce. Thanks to the tremendous efforts of our employees, our partners and customers around the world, we achieved critical strategic milestones in both businesses, continued focus and execution on production and development programs that are important to our customers and maintained our relentless focus on productivity to enable continued investment in our future, all of which sets the stage for further growth and sustained business performance for customers and shareholders in the years ahead. 
Now we'd be delighted to take your questions."

On the 777, the gut issue there obviously is the bridge, transition to the bridge, because I think the market has spoken on the launch of the 777X, a very robust launch. As to the bridge, the 63 orders this year that Ray and his team secured bodes well for the 40 to 60 we need over the next few years to get to the bridge, so I'm feeling increasingly comfortable there. Long-term demand for the airplane, there is no competition for the airplane, so I feel very good about the long-term demand for the airplane. I think, on the 787, I think what you're going to see is a mix from Dash 8s to Dash 9s to Dash 10s. And there will be some moving around of the skyline as that's accommodated. That's all goodness for The Boeing Company in the sense that we are usually selling more capability for a higher price, and that dynamic I don't see changing. I think we're still -- we're a little bit hampered by the number of orders we have. I mean, it's -- we're out to 20, 21-ish. I would anticipate, toward the end of this year and into next year, a rekindling of orders on the 87 as we get a little closer to the end of the decade, people begin to pick up options, the moving around of the skyline will have subsided a little bit. And the airplane's performance -- quite frankly, I cited it in my remarks, the airplane's performance, to be candid, is better, I think, by and large, than we sold it for -- at. And we're very pleased with the operating cost, the fuel savings, obviously. And the thing that is often left unnoticed here is that this grows the market. This airplane enables widebody or any kind of body, quite frankly, city pairs that have never been enabled before. And so I'm sort of making up the number, but it's 20% of the demand for this thing is opening up capacity between city pairs that was not available before because of the performance of the airplane. So it's a little bit of a longer answer than you wanted, but that's my dump on the subject."

We've done them on other programs. And now it's about implementing on the 787. So there's some of that in there that's really, again, focused on investments over the long term of the program. On -- as far as labor, we are coming down on unit cost, but we're coming down at a lower rate than what we expected or anticipated. And again, we're doing that at these higher labor levels to really achieve the stability, incorporate those reliability enhancements I talked about. And then these productivity initiatives, again, they're going to take folks to work through each one of those at every sequence of the build, and we're working that. And we're working that at an enterprise level, we're leveraging across Boeing. So we know where the bottlenecks are or some of the challenges are, so now it's about when reaching -- when we reach the 10 a month, capturing that and improving upon that. On the supply chain side, we've talked about the timing of some of our discussions and negotiations. And some of those have moved out to the right, and I think I've mentioned before that we've seen a benefit in doing that. These guys are still coming down a learning curve. We are helping them encapsulate productivity enhancements that we're seeing or able to achieve in Charleston and Everett. We want to get that back into the supply chain. And then from there, we'll mature our negotiation. So again, a near-term sacrifice but much long-term benefit, frankly, for us and our supplier.

We've got additional productivity initiatives in here, including the automation that Jim talked about. And so that's kind of the profile on CapEx.

But for this year, we're seeing that at about $3.5 billion and, I say, managing it very efficiently and taking advantage of a lot of things that, again, as Jim highlighted, in doing it in a more efficient and effective manner."

My comments today will focus on our positive first quarter performance in what we see is a continued, healthy and business environment. After that, Greg will walk you through the details of our financial results and outlook.
Now let's move to Slide 2, please. Building on the strong performance trend we sustained through 2014, Boeing delivered solid first quarter 2015 financial results, including higher revenue, healthy core earning -- healthy core operating margins and double-digit growth in core earnings per share. We also continued to return cash to shareholders in the first quarter by repurchasing $2.5 billion of Boeing stock and increasing our dividend, as promised, by 25%, for a payout of $639 million.
Revenue at Boeing Commercial Airplanes increased 21% to $15.4 billion, and operating margins were 10.5%. We delivered 184 commercial airplanes in the quarter and added 110 net new orders. Key milestones in the quarter included delivery of the first 787-9 built at Boeing South Carolina, the opening of our South Carolina propulsion systems facility and start-up of an automated wing panel assembly on the 737 program in Renton.
Boeing Defense, Space & Security reported revenue in the first quarter of $6.7 billion and generated strong operating margins of 11.1%. Key contract awards included orders for 43 AH-64E Apache helicopters, a multiyear combat logistics support contract and an order from SES for an all-electric, 702SP satellite. In addition, the U.S. Air Force selected the 747-8 as the next presidential aircraft.
[indiscernible] program milestones in the quarter included: launching the first 2 all-electric propulsion satellites, double-stacked, on a single rocket and building -- and breaking ground on the crew access tower, which will support the Commercial Crew program and replicating a best practice for bolstering performance on development programs by establishing a single, unified defense and space development programs organization. Our success with a similar structure put in place at Commercial Airplanes, starting with the development of the 787-9, shows that we can leverage synergies and expertise across different development programs to reduce costs and risks and better ensure performance, as promised to our customers. This new organization will oversee current and future development efforts, including work on the KC-46 Tanker, the 747-8 presidential aircraft, our Commercial Crew spacecraft and Space Launch System rocket, the 502 small satellite and our St. Louis-based, 777X work package. In summary, we delivered another strong quarter of operating performance, achieved significant program milestones, captured orders totaling $15 billion and returned significant cash to shareholders, all of which Greg will cover in more detail in a moment.
With that, let's turn to the business environment on Slide 3. Strong airline profitability, healthy global air traffic trends and our backlog totaling more than 5,700 aircraft all combined to underpin our planned production rate increases over the remainder of the decade. Our long-term outlook also remains positive as we expect airline fleet growth and replacement demand to drive the need for nearly 37,000 commercial aircraft over the next 20 years. As evidenced by the healthy pace of orders during the first quarter, conversations with our airline customers continued to center on new purchases or accelerating delivery slots. All requests are still running well below the historical average. These remained very good times for our industry. As I mentioned on last quarter's call, historically, airplane orders are highly correlated to airline profitability, and lower oil prices have not fundamentally changed our customers view on fleet planning or their commitment to existing delivery schedules. The rapid return on investment from new, more efficient airplanes, remains a compelling factor in purchase decisions in a fuel price environment that remains -- even if it remains well below the 15-year average.
As a reminder, in addition to far better fuel efficiency and lower maintenance costs, our new technologically advanced airplanes also often deliver higher passenger and cargo revenue, increased residual values, a better overall passenger experience and greater range that grows market opportunities by allowing for new city pairs and more optimal routes. All of these elements provide significant value to our customers over the life of the aircraft.
Further to those points, demand for both the 777 and 777X remains strong. The 777 production line is essentially sold out for 2016, approximately half sold out in 2017 and has a healthy number of slots already sold firm in 2018. As we've discussed before, the new 777X is scheduled to enter final assembly in the 2018 time frame and will leverage new manufacturing processes and technologies being proven on the current 777 to optimize the overall 777X production system. We will continue to assess the most efficient way to phase in this new technology and adapt, as necessary, to ensure we meet our customers' commitments.
On the 787 program. We have now delivered more than 250 airplanes including 20 -9. Notable among the strong new bookings during the quarter was ANA's orders for 3 787-10s. 787-10 remains on track for first delivery in 2018.
In the single-aisle segment, demand for our new fuel-efficient 737 MAX also remains high, with cumulative orders totaling more than 2,700 airplanes from 57 customers. Development of the MAX remains on track for first delivery in 2017.
Turning to Defense, Space & Security. We continue to see solid support for our major programs. The president's fiscal 2016 budget request included increases for core Boeing production programs such as: P-8A Poseidon, Apache and Chinook helicopters. Key development programs such as Tanker, Long Range Strike and Commercial Crew also saw budget increases. International demand for our offerings remains strong, particularly in the Middle East and the Asia Pacific region. During the first quarter, international customers for Defense, Space & Security represented 23% of revenue and 37% of our current backlog.
Our investments in technology and innovation for organic growth continue in areas such as commercial derivatives, space, unmanned systems, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance and the few critical future franchise programs like Long Range Strike and the T-X Trainer, which are priorities for our customers.
The relative strength of our Defense, Space & Security's business stems from a portfolio that is reliable, proven and affordable, supported by our ongoing market-based affordability initiative, which is focused on reducing operating cost by another $1 billion on top of the $5 billion already achieved, which will ensure competitiveness through the ongoing downturn in domestic defense spending.
Overall, our business strategies are aligned to the realities and the opportunities of our markets, and our teams are executing them well to deliver increased top line and bottom line performance, support the needs of our customers and capture new business to sustain our growth and profitability for the decades to come.
Now over to Greg for our financial results and our updated guidance. Greg?"
370857,289530266,791906,"The Boeing Company, Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 22, 2015",2015-04-22,"Earnings Calls","The Boeing Company","Executives","Thanks, Jim, and good morning. Let's turn to Slide 4, and we'll discuss our first quarter results. First quarter revenue increased 8% to $22.1 billion driven by strong commercial airplane deliveries. Core earnings per share for the quarter increased 12% t",795,"Thanks, Jim, and good morning. Let's turn to Slide 4, and we'll discuss our first quarter results. First quarter revenue increased 8% to $22.1 billion driven by strong commercial airplane deliveries. Core earnings per share for the quarter increased 12% to $1.97, driven on higher commercial airplane volume and continued strong operating performance.
Let's now discuss Commercial Airplanes on Slide 5. For the first quarter, our Commercial Airplanes business increased revenue 21% to $15.4 billion on 184 airplane deliveries and reported operating margins of 10.5%. Strong operating margins in the quarter were primarily driven by higher volume, continued focus on productivity and program mix. Commercial Airplanes captured $9.8 billion in net orders during the first quarter and backlog remains very strong at $435 billion and over 5,700 aircraft, equating to approximately 8 years of production.
Specifically on the 787 program, we continue to expect the program to be cash positive during 2015, and we still anticipate deferred production to decline shortly after we achieve the 12-per-month production rate in 2016. No change to these fundamental milestones. We continue to see progress in key operational performance indicators for the 787 program as we further implement production efficiencies while meaningfully increasing the 787-9 production and managing through some near-term disruption in supply chain, largely in cabin interiors. Despite these challenges and with a lot of hard work from the team, we delivered 30 787s in the quarter and made further progress on reducing unit cost.
On the 787-8, we've seen a decline in unit cost of approximately 30% over the last 190 deliveries. And furthermore, the 787-9 unit cost declined approximately 25% over the first 20 deliveries. In line with our expectations and as declining rates, 787 deferred production increased $793 million to $27 billion in the first quarter. And as we've previously discussed, we continued to anticipate 787 deferred production to grow at similar levels for the next couple of quarters before seeing a healthy decline in the growth later in this year.
We remain focused on the solid day-to-day execution, risk reduction in improving the long-term productivity and cash flow going forward. We continue to manage the smooth ramp of the 787-9 production, prepare for the 12 rate per month introduction of -10, while also driving efficiencies across all aspects of the program.
Let's turn now to Defense, Space & Security results on Slide 6. First quarter revenue in our defense business was $6.7 billion, and operating margins were strong at 11.1%, largely driven by solid performance and favorable mix. Boeing Military Aircraft first quarter revenue declined to $2.7 billion, primarily driven by planned timing of C-17 and F-15 deliveries. Operating margins of 9.5% reflect delivery mix that offset improved operating performance.
Network & Space Systems reported revenue of $1.7 billion and increased operating margins to 9.6% in the quarter, resulting from higher ULA earnings.
Global Services & Support revenue was $2.2 billion and operating margins increased to 14.1% on solid operating performance and favorable program mix.
Defense, Space & Security reported a solid backlog of $60 billion with 37% of our current backlog representing customers outside the United States.
Next slide, please. Operating cash flow. Operating cash flow for the first quarter was approximately $100 billion, driven by solid operating performance, and as expected, the timing of receipts and expenditures that were largely benefited late in Q4 of 2014. We continue to expect 2015 operating cash flow to be more than $9 billion with the majority of that being generated in the second half of the year.
With regards to capital deployment, as Jim mentioned, we paid $639 million in dividends and repurchased 17 million shares for $2.5 billion in the first quarter as we continue to deliver on our commitment to our shareholders. And furthermore, this reflects our ongoing confidence in the long-term outlook for our business. We continue to anticipate completing the remaining $9.5 billion repurchase authorization over the next 2 to 3 years. Returning cash to shareholders, along with continued investment to support future growth, remains a top priority for us.
Moving to cash and debt balances on Slide 8. We ended the quarter with $9.6 billion of cash and marketable securities, and our cash balance continues to provide solid liquidity and positions us very well going forward.
Let's now turn to Slide 9, and I'll discuss our outlook for 2015. We are reaffirming our 2015 guidance for revenue, operating margins, core earnings, deliveries and cash flow. And overall, we're very pleased with the first quarter performance as the core operating engine continues to deliver strong results, and we expect that performance to continue as we remain focused on production, program profitability, rate ramp-up and ongoing productivity improvements.
With that, I'll turn it back over to Jim for some closing comments."

That's roughly half or just short of half of what we're looking for for the entire year. I mentioned the production skyline in '16, '17 and '18, and it's beginning to firm up. So we are increasingly confident that we can implement this bridge. And it's important not only commercially and to keep the rate going, but as I mentioned in my comments, we're sort of feathering in some new technology on the current airplane, the ER, so it's tested and de-risked by the time we get to the X.

And that's attributed to really risk-reduction effort and focus early on in the program, some of the supplier negotiations that we talked about moving some of those to the right as we get more mature on the learning curve within those suppliers and then some of the productivity initiatives, as I've highlighted, where we are really seeing opportunities to drive further value in the program over the long term, but requires some upfront investment. Those are very good business cases. Those are absolutely the right things to do to drive long-term profitability and cash of this program. And those obviously remain a top priority for us. And at the same time, we're looking for more opportunities to capture further productivity and cash that will require more investment. So we're continuing to focus on that.

When I say that, proving out this technology outside the production system in an isolated -- again, outside the mainstream production, proving it out, making it rate capable and then a smooth implementation as you're continuing to build 8.3 a month. So a lot of that prove out again risk reduction investment up front, but long-term profitability in the program doing that outside of production system. So we've been doing that and that's the, I'll say, the plan to implement that into the mainstream production. So I don't view that as high risk. I think that de-risking activity has been very prudent. And if we see any issues along the way, we have a plan B or, I'd say, an offramp, to continue with the current production system. So I think the risk is very managed. Now the opportunity obviously is in increasing or reducing float time, better quality, and ultimately, better unit cost.

The -- back to the specifics of your question, C-17s, we've got orders and commitments that leave about 5 to go. We have a lot of action on those 5s, but I think the team made the right call when to curtail the program. You always want to curtail these things where you end up having a little bit more demand than you've got airplanes at the end. So it's hold pricing and production, and that is playing out well for us. I think the -- in the face of sequestration, the reason for my optimism, and it's not wide-eyed optimism, it's a matter of sort of Ryan-Murray 2.0 sort of maybe extending the kind of budget compromise that have been fashioned a couple of years ago, another couple of years, and that may turn into a broader consensus deal with sequestration in a balanced way. So a little more optimism that that will sort out. And based on newspaper reports I've seen, Murray and Ryan are working together again, trying to come up with some kind of a budget compromise that would include the defense portion. We're well marked up in the president's budget request, more than our fair share of sort of the jump balls, I guess, is the way to put it. And so our backlog remains strong, our profitability, because our productivity plans assumed the worst, and what we'd like to do is be surprised. And so that's the reason you're seeing strong margins in the first quarter in our defense business, notwithstanding some timing on the deliveries, which will sort out by year-end.

I would say as far as cash flow goes, the outlook for operating cash from us remains unchanged, and we still see strong cash flow this year, again greater than $9 billion [ph] and continued growth as we come out of '15 into '16.

My comments today will focus on our positive first quarter performance in what we see as a continued healthy business environment. After that, Greg will walk you through the details of our financial results and outlook. Now let's move to Slide 2, please.
Building on the strong performance trend we sustained through 2014, Boeing delivered solid first quarter 2015 financial results, including higher revenue, healthy core earning -- healthy core operating margins and double-digit growth in core earnings per share. We also continued to return cash to shareholders in the first quarter by repurchasing $2.5 billion of Boeing stock; and increasing our dividend, as promised, by 25%, for a payout of $639 million.
Revenue at Boeing Commercial Airplanes increased 21% to $15.4 billion, and operating margins were 10.5%. We delivered 184 commercial airplanes in the quarter and added 110 net new orders. Key milestones in the quarter included delivery of the first 787-9 built at Boeing South Carolina, the opening of our South Carolina propulsion systems facility and startup of an automated wing panel assembly on the 737 program in Renton.
Boeing Defense, Space & Security reported revenue in the first quarter of $6.7 billion and generated strong operating margins of 11.1%. Key contract awards included orders for 43 AH-64E Apache helicopters, a multiyear combat logistics support contract and an order from SES for an all-electric 702SP satellite. In addition, the U.S. Air Force selected the 747-8 as the next presidential aircraft.
Noteworthy program milestones in the quarter included: launching the first 2 all-electric propulsion satellites double-stacked on a single rocket; and building -- and breaking ground on the crew access tower which will support the Commercial Crew program and replicating a best practice for bolstering performance on development programs by establishing a single, unified defense and space development programs organization. Our success with a similar structure put in place at Commercial Airplanes starting with the development of the 787-9 shows that we can leverage synergies and expertise across different development programs to reduce costs and risks and better ensure performance as promised to our customers. This new organization will oversee current and future development efforts, including work on the KC-46 tanker, the 747-8 presidential aircraft, our Commercial Crew spacecraft and Space Launch System rocket, the 502 small satellite and our St. Louis-based 777X work package.
In summary, we delivered another strong quarter of operating performance, achieved significant program milestones, captured orders totaling $15 billion and returned significant cash to shareholders, all of which Greg will cover in more detail in a moment.
With that, let's turn to the business environment on Slide 3.
Strong airline profitability, healthy global air traffic trends and our backlog totaling more than 5,700 aircraft all combined to underpin our planned production rate increases over the remainder of the decade. Our long-term outlook also remains positive as we expect airline fleet growth and replacement demand to drive the need for nearly 37,000 commercial aircraft over the next 20 years. As evidenced by the healthy pace of orders during the first quarter, conversations with our airline customers continued to center on new purchases or accelerating delivery slots. Deferral requests are still running well below the historical average. These remain very good times for our industry. As I mentioned on last quarter's call, historically, airplane orders are highly correlated to airline profitability, and lower oil prices have not fundamentally changed our customers' view on fleet planning or their commitment to existing delivery schedules. The rapid return on investment from new, more efficient airplanes remains a compelling factor in purchase decisions in a fuel price environment that remains -- even if it remains well below the 15-year average.
As a reminder, in addition to far better fuel efficiency and lower maintenance costs, our new technologically advanced airplanes also often deliver higher passenger and cargo revenue, increased residual values, a better overall passenger experience and greater range that grows market opportunities by allowing for new city pairs and more optimal routes. All of these elements provide significant value to our customers over the life of the aircraft.
Further to those points, demand for both the 777 and the 777X remained strong. The 777 production line is essentially sold out for 2016, approximately half-sold out in 2017 and has a healthy number of slots already sold firm in 2018. As we've discussed before, the new 777X is scheduled to enter final assembly in the 2018 time frame and will leverage new manufacturing processes and technologies being proven on the current 777 to optimize the overall 777X production system. We will continue to assess the most efficient way to phase-in this new technology and adapt as necessary to ensure we meet our customers' commitments.
On the 787 program. We have now delivered more than 250 airplanes, including 20 -9s. Notable among the strong new bookings during the quarter was ANA's order for 3 787-10s. 787-10 development remains on track for first delivery in 2018.
In the single-aisle segment, demand for our new fuel-efficient 737 MAX also remains high, with cumulative orders totaling more than 2,700 airplanes from 57 customers. Development of the MAX remains on track for first delivery in 2017.
Turning to Defense, Space & Security. We continue to see solid support for our major programs. The president's fiscal 2016 budget request included increases for core Boeing production programs such as P-8A Poseidon, Apache and Chinook helicopters. Key development programs such as tanker, Long Range Strike and Commercial Crew also saw budget increases. International demand for our offerings remained strong, particularly in the Middle East and the Asia Pacific regions. During the first quarter, international customers for Defense, Space & Security represented 23% of revenue and 37% of our current backlog.
Our investments in technology and innovation for organic growth continue in areas such as commercial derivatives; space unmanned systems; intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance; and a few critical future franchise programs like Long Range Strike and the T-X Trainer, which are priorities for our customers. The relative strength of our Defense, Space & Security business stems from a portfolio that is reliable, proven and affordable, supported by our ongoing market-based affordability initiative which is focused on reducing operating costs by another $1 billion on top of the $5 billion already achieved, which will ensure competitiveness through the ongoing downturn in domestic defense spending.
Overall, our business strategies are aligned to the realities and the opportunities of our markets. And our teams are executing them well to deliver increased top line and bottom line performance, support the needs of our customers and capture new business to sustain our growth and profitability for the decades to come.
Now over to Greg for our financial results and our updated guidance. Greg?"
370857,289530266,792053,"The Boeing Company, Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 22, 2015",2015-04-22,"Earnings Calls","The Boeing Company","Executives","Thanks, Jim. And good morning.Let's turn to Slide 4, and we'll discuss our first quarter results. First quarter revenue increased 8% to $22.1 billion, driven by strong commercial airplane deliveries. Core earnings per share for the quarter increased 12%",795,"Thanks, Jim. And good morning.
Let's turn to Slide 4, and we'll discuss our first quarter results. First quarter revenue increased 8% to $22.1 billion, driven by strong commercial airplane deliveries. Core earnings per share for the quarter increased 12% to $1.97, driven on higher commercial airplane volume and continued strong operating performance.
Let's now discuss Commercial Airplanes on Slide 5. For the first quarter, our Commercial Airplanes business increased revenue 21% to $15.4 billion on 184 airplane deliveries and reported operating margins of 10.5%. Strong operating margins in the quarter were primarily driven by higher volume, continued focus on productivity and program mix. Commercial Airplanes captured $9.8 billion in net orders during the first quarter. And backlog remains very strong at $435 billion and over 5,700 aircraft, equating to approximately 8 years of production.
Specifically on the 787 program. We continue to expect the program to be cash positive during 2015. And we still anticipate deferred production to decline shortly after we achieve the 12-per-month production rate in 2016, no change to these fundamental milestones. We continue to see progress in key operational performance indicators for the 787 program as we further implement production efficiencies while meaningfully increasing the 787-9 production and managing through some near-term disruption in supply chain, largely around cabin interiors. Despite these challenges and with a lot of hard work from the team, we delivered 30 787s in the quarter and made further progress on reducing unit cost.
On the 787-8, we've seen a decline in unit cost of approximately 30% over the last 190 deliveries. And furthermore, the 787-9 unit cost declined approximately 25% over the first 20 deliveries. In line with our expectations and now declining rates, 787 deferred production increased $793 million to $27 billion in the first quarter. And as we've previously discussed, we continue to anticipate 787 deferred production to grow at similar levels for the next couple of quarters before seeing a healthy decline in the growth later in this year.
We remain focused on the solid day-to-day execution, risk reduction and improving the long-term productivity and cash flow going forward. We continue to manage the smooth ramp of the 787-9 production, prepare for the 12 rate -- per-month introduction of the -10 while also driving efficiencies across all aspects of the program.
Let's turn now to Defense, Space & Security results on Slide 6. First quarter revenue in our defense business was $6.7 billion, and operating margins were strong at 11.1%, largely driven by solid performance and favorable mix. Boeing Military Aircraft first quarter revenue declined to $2.7 billion, primarily driven by planned timing of C-17 and F-15 deliveries. Operating margins of 9.5% reflect delivery mix that offset improved operating performance.
Network & Space Systems reported revenue of $1.7 billion and increased operating margins to 9.6% in the quarter, resulting from higher ULA earnings. Global Services & Support revenue was $2.2 billion, and operating margins increased to 14.1% on solid operating performance and favorable program mix.
Defense, Space & Security reported a solid backlog of $60 billion, with 37% of our current backlog representing customers outside the United States.
Next slide, please. Operating cash flow. Operating cash flow for the first quarter was approximately $100 billion, driven by solid operating performance and, as expected, the timing of receipts and expenditures that were largely benefited late in Q4 of 2014. We continue to expect 2015 operating cash flow to be more than $9 billion, with the majority of that being generated in the second half of the year.
With regards to capital deployment, as Jim mentioned, we paid $639 million in dividends and repurchased 17 million shares for $2.5 billion in the first quarter as we continue to deliver on our commitment to our shareholders. And furthermore, this reflects our ongoing confidence in the long-term outlook for our business. We continue to anticipate completing the remaining $9.5 billion repurchase authorization over the next 2 to 3 years. Returning cash to shareholders, along with continued investment to support future growth, remains top priority for us.
Moving to cash and debt balances on Slide 8. We ended the quarter with $9.6 billion of cash and marketable securities. And our cash balance continues to provide solid liquidity and positions us very well going forward.
Let's now turn to Slide 9, and I'll discuss our outlook for 2015.
We are reaffirming our 2015 guidance for revenue, operating margins, core earnings, deliveries and cash flow. And overall, we're very pleased with the first quarter performance, as the core operating engine continues to deliver strong results. And we expect that performance to continue as we remain focused on production, program profitability, rate ramp-up and ongoing productivity improvements.
With that, I'll turn it back over to Jim for some closing comments."

That's roughly half or just short of half of what we're looking for, for the entire year. I mentioned the production of skyline in '16, '17 and '18, and it's beginning to firm up. So we are increasingly confident that we can implement this bridge. And it's important not only commercially and to keep the rate going, but as I mentioned in my comments, we're sort of feathering-in some new technology on the current airplane, the ER, so it's tested and de-risked by the time we get to the X.

When I say that, proving out this technology outside the production system in an isolated -- again, outside the mainstream production, proving it out, making it rate capable and then a smooth implementation as you're continuing to build 8.3 a month. So a lot of that prove out again risk-reduction investment upfront but long-term profitability in the program doing that outside the production system. So we've been doing that. And that's the -- I'll say, the plan to implement that into the mainstream production. So I don't view that as high risk. I think the de-risking activity has been very prudent. And if we see any issues along the way, we have a plan B or, I'll say, an offramp to continue with the current production system. So I think the risk is very managed.

I think the -- in the face of sequestration, the reason for my optimism, and it's not wide-eyed optimism, it's a matter of sort of Ryan-Murray 2.0 sort of maybe extending the kind of budget compromise that had been fashioned a couple of years ago another couple of years. And that may turn into a broader consensus dealing with sequestration in a balanced way. And so a little more optimism that, that will sort out. And based on newspaper reports I've seen, Murray and Ryan are working together again trying to come up with some kind of a budget compromise that would include the defense portion. We're well marked up in the president's budget request, more than our fair share of sort of the jump balls, I guess, is the way to put it.

My comments today will focus on our positive first quarter performance in what we see as a continued healthy business environment. After that, Greg will walk you through the details of our financial results and outlook. Now let's move to Slide 2, please.
Building on the strong performance trend we sustained through 2014, Boeing delivered solid first quarter 2015 financial results, including higher revenue, healthy core earning -- healthy core operating margins and double-digit growth in core earnings per share. We also continued to return cash to shareholders in the first quarter by repurchasing $2.5 billion of Boeing stock; and increasing our dividend, as promised, by 25%, for a payout of $639 million.
Revenue at Boeing Commercial Airplanes increased 21% to $15.4 billion, and operating margins were 10.5%. We delivered 184 commercial airplanes in the quarter and added 110 net new orders. Key milestones in the quarter included delivery of the first 787-9 built at Boeing South Carolina, the opening of our South Carolina propulsion systems facility and startup of an automated wing panel assembly on the 737 program in Renton.
Boeing Defense, Space & Security reported revenue in the first quarter of $6.7 billion and generated strong operating margins of 11.1%. Key contract awards included orders for 43 AH-64E Apache helicopters, a multiyear combat logistics support contract and an order from SES for an all-electric 702SP satellite. In addition, the U.S. Air Force selected the 747-8 as the next presidential aircraft.
Noteworthy program milestones in the quarter included: launching the first 2 all-electric propulsion satellites double-stacked on a single rocket; and building -- and breaking ground on the crew access tower which will support the Commercial Crew program and replicating a best practice for bolstering performance on development programs by establishing a single, unified defense and space development programs organization. Our success with a similar structure put in place at Commercial Airplanes starting with the development of the 787-9 shows that we can leverage synergies and expertise across different development programs to reduce costs and risks and better ensure performance as promised to our customers. This new organization will oversee current and future development efforts, including work on the KC-46 tanker, the 747-8 presidential aircraft, our Commercial Crew spacecraft and Space Launch System rocket, the 502 small satellite and our St. Louis-based 777X work package.
In summary, we delivered another strong quarter of operating performance, achieved significant program milestones, captured orders totaling $15 billion and returned significant cash to shareholders, all of which Greg will cover in more detail in a moment.
With that, let's turn to the business environment on Slide 3.
Strong airline profitability, healthy global air traffic trends and our backlog totaling more than 5,700 aircraft all combined to underpin our planned production rate increases over the remainder of the decade. Our long-term outlook also remains positive as we expect airline fleet growth and replacement demand to drive the need for nearly 37,000 commercial aircraft over the next 20 years. As evidenced by the healthy pace of orders during the first quarter, conversations with our airline customers continued to center on new purchases or accelerating delivery slots. Deferral requests are still running well below the historical average. These remain very good times for our industry. As I mentioned on last quarter's call, historically, airplane orders are highly correlated to airline profitability, and lower oil prices have not fundamentally changed our customers' view on fleet planning or their commitment to existing delivery schedules. The rapid return on investment from new, more efficient airplanes remains a compelling factor in purchase decisions in a fuel price environment that remains -- even if it remains well below the 15-year average.
As a reminder, in addition to far better fuel efficiency and lower maintenance costs, our new technologically advanced airplanes also often deliver higher passenger and cargo revenue, increased residual values, a better overall passenger experience and greater range that grows market opportunities by allowing for new city pairs and more optimal routes. All of these elements provide significant value to our customers over the life of the aircraft.
Further to those points, demand for both the 777 and the 777X remained strong. The 777 production line is essentially sold out for 2016, approximately half-sold out in 2017 and has a healthy number of slots already sold firm in 2018. As we've discussed before, the new 777X is scheduled to enter final assembly in the 2018 time frame and will leverage new manufacturing processes and technologies being proven on the current 777 to optimize the overall 777X production system. We will continue to assess the most efficient way to phase-in this new technology and adapt as necessary to ensure we meet our customers' commitments.
On the 787 program. We have now delivered more than 250 airplanes, including 20 -9s. Notable among the strong new bookings during the quarter was ANA's order for 3 787-10s. 787-10 development remains on track for first delivery in 2018.
In the single-aisle segment, demand for our new fuel-efficient 737 MAX also remains high, with cumulative orders totaling more than 2,700 airplanes from 57 customers. Development of the MAX remains on track for first delivery in 2017.
Turning to Defense, Space & Security. We continue to see solid support for our major programs. The president's fiscal 2016 budget request included increases for core Boeing production programs such as P-8A Poseidon, Apache and Chinook helicopters. Key development programs such as tanker, Long Range Strike and Commercial Crew also saw budget increases. International demand for our offerings remained strong, particularly in the Middle East and the Asia Pacific regions. During the first quarter, international customers for Defense, Space & Security represented 23% of revenue and 37% of our current backlog.
Our investments in technology and innovation for organic growth continue in areas such as commercial derivatives; space unmanned systems; intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance; and a few critical future franchise programs like Long Range Strike and the T-X Trainer, which are priorities for our customers. The relative strength of our Defense, Space & Security business stems from a portfolio that is reliable, proven and affordable, supported by our ongoing market-based affordability initiative which is focused on reducing operating costs by another $1 billion on top of the $5 billion already achieved, which will ensure competitiveness through the ongoing downturn in domestic defense spending.
Overall, our business strategies are aligned to the realities and the opportunities of our markets. And our teams are executing them well to deliver increased top line and bottom line performance, support the needs of our customers and capture new business to sustain our growth and profitability for the decades to come.
Now over to Greg for our financial results and our updated guidance. Greg?"
370857,289530266,792162,"The Boeing Company, Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 22, 2015",2015-04-22,"Earnings Calls","The Boeing Company","Executives","Thanks, Jim. And good morning.Let's turn to Slide 4, and we'll discuss our first quarter results. First quarter revenue increased 8% to $22.1 billion, driven by strong commercial airplane deliveries. Core earnings per share for the quarter increased 12%",795,"Thanks, Jim. And good morning.
Let's turn to Slide 4, and we'll discuss our first quarter results. First quarter revenue increased 8% to $22.1 billion, driven by strong commercial airplane deliveries. Core earnings per share for the quarter increased 12% to $1.97, driven on higher commercial airplane volume and continued strong operating performance.
Let's now discuss Commercial Airplanes on Slide 5. For the first quarter, our Commercial Airplanes business increased revenue 21% to $15.4 billion on 184 airplane deliveries and reported operating margins of 10.5%. Strong operating margins in the quarter were primarily driven by higher volume, continued focus on productivity and program mix. Commercial Airplanes captured $9.8 billion in net orders during the first quarter. And backlog remains very strong at $435 billion and over 5,700 aircraft, equating to approximately 8 years of production.
Specifically on the 787 program. We continue to expect the program to be cash positive during 2015. And we still anticipate deferred production to decline shortly after we achieve the 12-per-month production rate in 2016, no change to these fundamental milestones. We continue to see progress in key operational performance indicators for the 787 program as we further implement production efficiencies while meaningfully increasing the 787-9 production and managing through some near-term disruption in supply chain, largely around cabin interiors. Despite these challenges and with a lot of hard work from the team, we delivered 30 787s in the quarter and made further progress on reducing unit cost.
On the 787-8, we've seen a decline in unit cost of approximately 30% over the last 190 deliveries. And furthermore, the 787-9 unit cost declined approximately 25% over the first 20 deliveries. In line with our expectations and now declining rates, 787 deferred production increased $793 million to $27 billion in the first quarter. And as we've previously discussed, we continue to anticipate 787 deferred production to grow at similar levels for the next couple of quarters before seeing a healthy decline in the growth later in this year.
We remain focused on the solid day-to-day execution, risk reduction and improving the long-term productivity and cash flow going forward. We continue to manage the smooth ramp of the 787-9 production, prepare for the 12 rate -- per-month introduction of the -10 while also driving efficiencies across all aspects of the program.
Let's turn now to Defense, Space & Security results on Slide 6. First quarter revenue in our defense business was $6.7 billion, and operating margins were strong at 11.1%, largely driven by solid performance and favorable mix. Boeing Military Aircraft first quarter revenue declined to $2.7 billion, primarily driven by planned timing of C-17 and F-15 deliveries. Operating margins of 9.5% reflect delivery mix that offset improved operating performance.
Network & Space Systems reported revenue of $1.7 billion and increased operating margins to 9.6% in the quarter, resulting from higher ULA earnings. Global Services & Support revenue was $2.2 billion, and operating margins increased to 14.1% on solid operating performance and favorable program mix.
Defense, Space & Security reported a solid backlog of $60 billion, with 37% of our current backlog representing customers outside the United States.
Next slide, please. Operating cash flow. Operating cash flow for the first quarter was approximately $100 billion, driven by solid operating performance and, as expected, the timing of receipts and expenditures that were largely benefited late in Q4 of 2014. We continue to expect 2015 operating cash flow to be more than $9 billion, with the majority of that being generated in the second half of the year.
With regards to capital deployment, as Jim mentioned, we paid $639 million in dividends and repurchased 17 million shares for $2.5 billion in the first quarter as we continue to deliver on our commitment to our shareholders. And furthermore, this reflects our ongoing confidence in the long-term outlook for our business. We continue to anticipate completing the remaining $9.5 billion repurchase authorization over the next 2 to 3 years. Returning cash to shareholders, along with continued investment to support future growth, remains top priority for us.
Moving to cash and debt balances on Slide 8. We ended the quarter with $9.6 billion of cash and marketable securities. And our cash balance continues to provide solid liquidity and positions us very well going forward.
Let's now turn to Slide 9, and I'll discuss our outlook for 2015.
We are reaffirming our 2015 guidance for revenue, operating margins, core earnings, deliveries and cash flow. And overall, we're very pleased with the first quarter performance, as the core operating engine continues to deliver strong results. And we expect that performance to continue as we remain focused on production, program profitability, rate ramp-up and ongoing productivity improvements.
With that, I'll turn it back over to Jim for some closing comments."

That's roughly half or just short of half of what we're looking for, for the entire year. I mentioned the production of skyline in '16, '17 and '18, and it's beginning to firm up. So we are increasingly confident that we can implement this bridge. And it's important not only commercially and to keep the rate going, but as I mentioned in my comments, we're sort of feathering-in some new technology on the current airplane, the ER, so it's tested and de-risked by the time we get to the X.

And that investment that we've talked about that's going to apply on the 777 and eventually the 777X, some of that cost is incorporated, so those are in our booking rates this quarter. I would tell you, a very smooth introduction. When I say that, proving out this technology outside the production system in an isolated -- again, outside the mainstream production, proving it out, making it rate capable and then a smooth implementation as you're continuing to build 8.3 a month. So a lot of that prove out again risk-reduction investment upfront but long-term profitability in the program doing that outside the production system. So we've been doing that. And that's the -- I'll say, the plan to implement that into the mainstream production. So I don't view that as high risk. I think the de-risking activity has been very prudent. And if we see any issues along the way, we have a plan B or, I'll say, an offramp to continue with the current production system. So I think the risk is very managed. Now the opportunity obviously is in increasing or reducing flow time, better quality and ultimately better unit costs. So at -- a very good investment for us over the long term of the 777, plus the 777X."

The -- but to the specifics of your question, C-17s, we've got orders and commitments that leave about 5 to go. We have a lot of action on those 5, so I think the team made the right call on when to curtail the program. You always want to curtail these things where you end up having a little more demand than you've got airplanes at the end, so hold pricing and production. And that is playing out well for us. I think the -- in the face of sequestration, the reason for my optimism, and it's not wide-eyed optimism, it's a matter of sort of Ryan-Murray 2.0 sort of maybe extending the kind of budget compromise that had been fashioned a couple of years ago another couple of years. And that may turn into a broader consensus dealing with sequestration in a balanced way. And so a little more optimism that, that will sort out. And based on newspaper reports I've seen, Murray and Ryan are working together again trying to come up with some kind of a budget compromise that would include the defense portion. We're well marked up in the president's budget request, more than our fair share of sort of the jump balls, I guess, is the way to put it. And so our backlog remains strong, our profitability, because our productivity plans assume the worst. And what we'd like to do is be surprised. And so that's the reason you're seeing strong margins in the first quarter in our defense business notwithstanding some timing on the deliveries, which we will sort out by year-end.

We're in a technology cycle now. We're not tied to GDP growth. We are tied to a very favorable replacement economics. And so half our growth is replacement. Half is sort of new routes, new airlines opening up and new deliveries more tied to GDP, but that's the nice thing about what innovation can do for you."

As you all know, in June, our Board of Directors elected Dennis as Chief Executive Officer of the company, effective July 1. The move was the result of a dedicated effort over several years to develop the future leaders of this company, including my successor as CEO. This has always been a top priority. Our aim was a seamless transition and continuity in our business strategy and overall direction, and that's exactly how it's playing out. I look forward to continuing to work with Dennis and Greg for my role as Chairman. In a moment, I'll turn this call and all subsequent ones over to them. But before doing that, let me just say a very few words about where we are as a company at the start of our 100th year, which began July 15.
These calls tend to have a heavy focus on our performance quarter-to-quarter, and rightfully so. But when you zoom out for a wider perspective, a clear picture emerges of an enterprise that is unified in its mission and purpose to lead the industry. It is as strong as it has ever been financially and is positioned to deliver sustained profitable growth in the years ahead. The commercial, defense and space markets we serve are large and growing at a global level. We have already captured a significant share of that growth in our unprecedented backlog. And unlike many companies, our opportunity is largely organic, and harvesting it rests on our execution. A good place to be. As we deliver that backlog to customers, we are intensely focused on productivity and profitability to drive increased shareholder returns and to reinvest in technology and innovation to further strengthen our market-leading portfolio of products and services. The Board of Directors and I are confident that Dennis and the strong team supporting him, including company Vice Chairman, Ray Conner, will succeed in growing our company and serving the interests of our employees, customers and shareholders, communities and other business partners.
With that, let me turn it over to Dennis for a summary of our second quarter results and the business environment. Dennis?"

And Jim, thanks for your leadership over the last 10 years and your continued support and partnership. And good morning, everybody. Let me start by saying it is a privilege to assume leadership of this great company and the more than 160,0",1457,"Thank you, Jim. And Jim, thanks for your leadership over the last 10 years and your continued support and partnership. And good morning, everybody. Let me start by saying it is a privilege to assume leadership of this great company and the more than 160,000 talented employees who comprise it. With Jim at the helm over the past decade, we developed a winning playbook and set a solid foundation for our future. Our job going forward is to deliver on our existing commitments, build on our strengths and improve, where needed, to create an even bigger, better Boeing in our second century.
Now let's turn to Slide 2 to discuss the second quarter. Boeing delivered strong second quarter operating performance across our production programs and services businesses with higher revenue on record commercial airplane deliveries. Notably, we also generated significant cash flow totaling $3.3 billion. With a strong cash flow and confidence in our long-term outlook, we continue to make strategic R&D and capital investments and return cash to our shareholders. During the quarter, we purchased $2 billion of Boeing stock and paid $625 million in dividends. Year-to-date, we've returned nearly $6 billion to our shareholders, which remains the top priority for us under our balanced cash deployment strategy.
As we announced last week, our very strong second quarter operating performance was impacted by a $536 million after-tax charge to complete development and holds the delivery schedule on our KC-46 Tanker program for the U.S. Air Force. That program, as you know, is being developed on a fixed-price contract. The increased company investment in that program is primarily driven by required rework on the integrated fuel system that was identified as we prepared for and conducted ground and flight tests and verification events system during the second quarter. The integrated fuel system is the last major system to undergo a component qualification testing. No new technology is needed to resolve these issues, which are well defined and understood, but that in no way mitigates our disappointment in having to take this charge. Our teams are very focused on executing the plan to meet our commitment to deliver 18 KC-46 Tankers to our Air Force customer by August 2017 and 179 Tankers by 2027. To that end, we completed initial airworthiness flight testing in the second quarter, which is a major milestone, and test aircraft #1 will return to flight this month followed by the first flight of aircraft #2 yet this summer. To be clear though, we do have a lot more work to do as we progress through the remaining ground and flight test phases, but we are on the right path. We also remain confident in the long-term financial value of the Tanker program for our company. With a potential market of up to 400 aircraft worth $80 billion, we expect to realize strong returns over decades of production and in-service support.
Now turning to our core operating performance during the quarter. Revenue at Boeing Commercial Airplanes increased 18% to $16.9 billion on a record 197 deliveries. Among the key milestones in the quarter was the start of wing assembly on the first 737 MAX. We also completed Critical Design Review on the 787-10, validating the program is on plan to meet its performance, cost and schedule requirements.
Boeing Defense, Space & Security reported revenue in the second quarter of $7.5 billion on the delivery of 54 aircraft, 2 satellites and healthy volume in our services business. Key contract awards included Carter purchasing for C-17s and Australia purchasing to C-17s. In International, F-15 service contract extension. And for the first time in history, NASA awarded a contract for a human spaceflight mission to a commercial company. In summary, notwithstanding the Tanker charge, we delivered another quarter of strong core operating performance, achieved significant program milestones, captured orders totaling $18 billion and returned significant cash to our shareholders.
With that, let's turn to the business environment on Slide 3. Our overall view of the business environment remains positive due to improving airline profitability and healthy global air traffic. Based on that traffic growth and strong replacement demand, our new long-term commercial market outlook forecast demand for more than 38,000 commercial aircraft over the next 20 years. That new forecast is up nearly 1,300 aircraft from last year. Customer discussions continued to focus on placing new aircraft orders or accelerating deliveries, as indicated by the favorable pace of orders in and around the Paris Airshow and yesterday's decision by FedEx to purchase 50 767 freighters with options for 50 more. Deferral requests continue to run well below the historical average. Demand also remained strong for both the 777 and the 777X. Year-to-date, 777 orders and commitments totaled 44, which puts us in solid position to achieve our target of 40 to 60 orders a year to bridge production of the 777X. The 777 production line is essentially sold out for 2016, more than half sold out in 2017 and has a healthy number of slots sold firm in 2018. As we've discussed before, the new 777X is scheduled to enter final assembly in the 2018 time frame and will leverage new manufacturing technologies and processes that are being proven on the current 777. We continue to assess the most efficient way to phase in this new technology and adapt, if necessary, to optimize the 777X production system and meet our customer commitments.
On the 787 program, we've now delivered more than 290 airplanes including 34-9. The airplanes' capabilities continue to draw strong interest from airlines around the world, as noted by the order commitment activity at the Paris Airshow. Production of the 787 is now balanced between the -8s and -9s, and this is a testament to the progress that the team is making while increasing the -9 up to full rate production.
In the single-aisle segment, demand for our new fuel-efficient 737 MAX also remains high with cumulative orders totaling more than 2,800 airplanes from 58 customers. Development of the MAX remains on track for first delivery in 2017. We also continue to see upward pressure on narrowbody production rates beyond the announced 52 per month in 2018. However, we remain steadfast in our financial discipline as we assess production rate changes.
Turning to Defense, Space & Security. We continue to see solid support for our major programs. Congress has been supportive of the president's fiscal year '16 budget request, which increases core Boeing production program such as P-8 Poseidon, the Apache and Chinook helicopters. Additionally, all 4 defense oversight committees have added 12 F-18 variant aircraft to their budget proposal. Year-over-year budget increases have also been supported by Congress for development programs such as Tanker, Long Range Strike and Commercial Crew, though in some cases it levels below the president's request. Boeing space launch system program has once again been recommended by the appropriations committees for funding increases, far above the president's request.
International demand for our offerings remained strong, especially in the Middle East and the Asia Pacific region. During the second quarter, international customers for Defense, Space & Security represented 33% of revenue and 39% of our current backlog. The strength of our defense and space business stems from a portfolio that is reliable, proven and affordable, supported by our ongoing market base affordability initiative that will ensure our long-term competitiveness.
Now before I turn it over to Greg, let me expand for just a minute on Jim's comments earlier about our competitive position, the continuity of our focus and the attitude and approach we are taking to further improve our business. All in all, Boeing is financially strong and well positioned in attractive markets. We have the right products, the right strategies and the right people to continue growing and leading our industry. However, we know that standing still is not an option for staying ahead of our competitors and for meeting our customers' expectations in a more-for-less world. In recent years, we've made large and important strides in driving productivity and first-time quality to fund our innovation and growth, working as One Boeing to fully leverage the breadth and depth of our capabilities, reducing long-term risk to our business and balance sheet, expanding internationally and developing better leaders and better teams. Moving forward, our focus on these areas will only grow stronger. We will sharpen our strategies to win. We will accelerate our pace of progress on these and other fundamental efforts, including development program performance. And through these efforts, we will succeed in profitably executing our record backlog, leading through innovation, investing in our people and making our second century even better than our first.
And with that, over to Greg for our financial results and our updated guidance. Greg?"

Let's turn to Slide 4, and we'll discuss our second quarter results. The second quarter revenue increased 11% to $24.5 billion, driven by strong commercial airplane deliveries.

The second quarter revenue increased 11% to $24.5 billion, driven by strong commercial airplane deliveries. Core operating margins of 7% reflect the impact of the $835 million pretax Tanker charge, or $536 million on an after-tax basis, that offset solid productivity gains on production programs and across our services business. Core earnings per share for the quarter was $1.62, reflecting the $0.77 per share Tanker impact that again offset the benefit of continued strong operating performance across the business. As Dennis noted, despite our disappointment in encountering the charge on the Tanker program, we're confident in the path forward as we progress through the remaining functional and flight tests. While we have a lot of work to do in front of us, we have added the necessary engineering and support staff to complete the program on schedule to meet the customer's commitments.
Let's now discuss Commercial Airplanes on Slide 5. For the second quarter, our Commercial Airplane business increased revenue 18% to $16.9 billion on a record 197 airplane deliveries. Operating margins of 7.1% reflect the $513 million pretax Tanker impact to DCA and the diluted impact of higher 787 and 747 deliveries, partially offset by stronger performance on production programs. Commercial Airplanes captured $13 billion of net orders in the second quarter, and backlog remains very strong, $431 billion [ph] and nearly 5,700 aircraft that equates to approximately 8 years of production. Specifically on the 787 program, we continue to expect the program to be cash positive during 2015, and we still anticipate deferred production to decline shortly after we achieve the 12-per-month production rate later in 2016, and there's no change to these fundamental milestones. We continue to see progress in key operational performance indicators for the 787 program as we further implement production efficiencies while meaningfully increasing 787-9 production. The team delivered 64 787s during the first 6 months of the year and made further progress on reducing unit costs.
On the 787-8, we've seen a decline in unit cost of approximately 35% now over the last 210 deliveries. And furthermore, 787-9 unit cost declined approximately 30% over the first 34 aircraft delivered. In line with our expectations, 787 deferred production increased $790 million to $27.7 billion in the second quarter. As we previously discussed, we continue to anticipate 787 deferred production to grow at a similar level next quarter before a healthy decline in growth in the fourth quarter. More work to do here, but we remain focused on the solid day-to-day execution and risk reduction while improving the long-term productivity and cash flow going forward. We continue to manage the smooth introduction and the ramp-up of the 787-9, prepare for the 12-per-month rate and introducing the -10, while again driving efficiencies across all aspects of the program.
Let's now turn to Defense, Space & Security results on Slide 6. Second quarter revenue on defense business was $7.5 billion, and operating margins were 7.2% as the $322 million pretax Tanker charge at BDS offset strong performance on production program and favorable delivery mix. Boeing Military Aircraft second quarter revenue was $3.5 billion due to timing of deliveries and operating margins of 3.5% in the quarter, again reflecting the Tanker impact. Beyond the Tanker program, BMA captured productivity improvements on a number of key production programs. In addition, the BMA segment significantly retired risk during the quarter on the C-17 program by capturing contracts for 6 aircraft. We now have one more aircraft to sell, and we continue see strong interest in that final aircraft for delivery.
Network & Space Systems revenue was $1.9 billion, and the segment generated operating margins of 7.8%. Global Services & Support revenue was $2.1 billion, and operating margins increased to 12.8% on favorable program mix and performance. Defense, Space & Security recorded a solid backlog of $58 billion with 39% of our current backlog representing customers outside the United States.
Let's move to cash flow now on the next slide. Operating cash flow for the second quarter was strong, $3.3 billion, driven by higher volumes and solid operating performance across the company. With regards to capital deployment, as Dennis mentioned, we paid $625 million in dividends and repurchased 14 million shares for $2 billion in the second quarter as we continue to deliver on our commitment of returning cash to shareholders. Furthermore, this reflects our ongoing confidence in the long-term outlook for the business. We anticipate completing the remainder $7.5 billion repurchase authorization over the next 2 years. Returning cash to shareholders, along with continued investment to support future growth, remains top priorities for us.
Moving now to cash and debt balances on Slide 8. We ended the quarter with $9.6 billion of cash and marketable securities, and our cash balance continues to provide solid liquidity and positions us well going forward.
Turning now to Slide 9, and we'll discuss our outlook for 2015. We are reaffirming our 2015 guidance for revenue, deliveries and cash flow and updating the margin and core EPS guidance to account for the Tanker charge that offsets improved productivity. Our cash flow guidance for 2015 remains unchanged at greater than $9 billion as the cash impact from the Tanker program is offset by improved cash performance across the company. Our 2015 guidance for commercial airplane operating margin is now 9%, reflecting the Tanker impact in Defense, Space & Security operating margin guidance is now 9.5%. That has more than offset the improved performance at BMA and GS&S. Core earnings per share guidance is now between $7.70 and $7.90 from $8.20 to $8.40, reflecting the $0.77 Tanker charge and $0.27 benefit from improved performance.
In summary, we generated solid revenue growth, delivered on our backlog, generated significant cash flow and meaningfully returned cash to shareholders.
So with that, I'll turn it back over to Dennis for some closing comments."

And Carter, to your broader, higher-level question, it's frankly been a privilege for me to work side by side with Jim for about the last 1.5 years with him and the rest of the team, Greg, Ray and the whole Boeing team a lot of confidence in the foundation that we put in place. And as we noted, today, we have a very strong company. We're well positioned in our markets. We have a strong financial foundation. We've got the right productivity machine in place. We've got the right strategy in place. So the team, you'll be hearing from me and the rest of the team, is one of strategic consistency. We like the path we're on, the direction we're headed. There are a few areas where we're going to continue to hone our strategy, sharpen it and accelerate our actions. I think if I look at big opportunities and risks, certainly, going forward, our opportunity to execute on our commercial aircraft backlog and to do that profitably and return cash to shareholders and fund our future division, that is the single biggest opportunity we have. Having 7 years of backlog and the opportunity to execute that well, that will be a clear focus for us. On the risk side, certainly, we want to continue to pay attention to delivering on our development programs. We're seeing steady improvement overall in terms of our ability to deliver on cost and schedule. And Tanker is a good reminder to us to continue honing that effort. But we are on the right path to continue to deliver innovation to marketplace and to do it in a repeatable, financially disciplined way. And if I look a little farther beyond that, if we think about how we're going to invest that capital, as you noted, our cash opportunity in terms of executing our backlog, also creates opportunity to invest in future innovation. And successfully bringing those new commercial aircraft to the marketplace is very important to us with the MAX, 787-10 and the 777X. And we feel very confident in all those development activities. We're also investing in a few future franchises on the defense side, including Long Range Strike. Again, good solid opportunities for us. And if we look at uses of cash going forward, our #1 priority remains a disciplined investment in innovation for the future. Secondly, returning cash to shareholders, as you've seen through both the stock repurchase and through dividends. And then thirdly, where it makes sense, bolt-on acquisitions. But our fundamental investment priority is for the future is in organic investments. We have a very strong position here, and we plan to leverage that."

You think about the numbers I talked to you about, 30% over 34 deliveries, gives you a really good sense of how well that's being incorporated. But remember, we made some investments upfront to ensure we had that smooth introduction. At the same time, lessons learned after -8 and getting those into the -9. So that produce-ability of the -9 has definitely improved. So over time, that favorable mix will work in our favor. I think I've mentioned that half of our deliveries this year will be -9s. And I would tell you just from my time at the company, that is the smoothest introduction of a derivative at -- on top of the all-time high production rate on the widebody program. So again, I think there's more opportunity for us going forward. We got enterprise focused on that and whether that's in -- on the shop floor, support or across the supply chain. That remains a top priority for us. So made good progress. But as you know, we've still got a lot of work to do going forward. But I think we got the right people focused. We got a lot of projects.

That's one of the reasons that we're investing now during the development program to refine the production system and ensure we are ready to ramp in to the low-rate initial production. Those priced options that you mentioned are part of the low-rate initial production program, and I think here, where we've already got the first 2 aircraft loaded into production line system in our commercial factory in Everett. And our ability to integrate that into the full commercial line is one of the big ways that we've reduced risk on the program overall, and some of the charges that we've taken in this quarter is the fact that we are having to retrofit a couple of those early aircraft that are in early build stages, but it allows us to get into a mature position now so again we have high confidence in the production program. We've got Ray in our BCA team very much engaged on ensuring we're doing the right things to drive profitability in the production system for the long run.

It looks if I strip out what's happening at 787 deferred, and I'm just looking at total working capital change, other than that, it's been about 1/3 of total company free cash, excluding deferred, the last kind of 3 to 5 years or so. Should I be reverting that back to 0 over time? Or can that be sustainably greater than 0 for a long time because it's a growth industry? And then specifically on advances, specifically given that's kind of a big part of that, has there been any strategic change with how and when the company takes advances, whether it's a competitive advantage driver or any other reason just because that's been such a big piece?"

I think as I've said to you before, as you think about just purely the production rate increases that are going to take place over time and how that advanced stream is completely associated with that, you're going to continue to see advances grow going forward as we increase production rates and then ultimately increase deliveries. So that profile will continue. Now it won't be at the same growth rate it's been because we don't have 18 rate breaks in front of us that we've just completed. We've got to have 5. So you'll still see a healthy increase in advances going forward. And then ultimately, as you know, bulk of the cash coming on delivery. So that's where you'll see it coming from. In the quarter, that is core cash. That is just pure core cash performance across the business. It's not timing. It's not driven by some advances from one quarter to the next. It's purely associated with performance across again multiple programs in the portfolio."

In terms of the transition, this is where we'll be feathering in the new production systems. As you know, that will start hitting the production system around the 2018 time frame, in terms of long lead implementation for 2020 deliveries on the 777X. So specific decisions around that will be more in the next year time frame, but the key thing we're doing now is derisking that transition by pulling some of the technology and some the automation forward into the 777 line, things like the fuselage upgrade build, for example. And that's allowing us to derisk the production system, and we'll continue to look for ways to make sure that feathering in is done most effectively and efficiently. We know how to do this. We've built bridges on our other production lines. We're doing the same thing on the Angie to Mac's transition in the 737 line.

And then, Greg, I'll flip it  over to you for some additional comments. Again, when we look at the overall performance, Jason, it's important for us to first note the market demand for the 777 remains very strong prints. Our ability to confidently build a bridge in the plan on that is part of the equation here. The bridge itself and the transition to the 777X, the key there is to flow it efficiently into production system into our supply chain. So long lead planning is already underway. As I said, we'll make some additional decision next year on exactly how we'll implement that and feather it into the production system, but we do this across the entire depth of our supply chain. Any technologies or investments that we can pull forward and pre-implement on the 777 line, as I said, we're doing with some of the automation technology, further derisks it for 777X and also allows us to drive additional profitability on the current 777 line. And as part of how we're continuing to pay for the implementation, if you will, is by driving productivity on the base programs to fuel our future innovation. It allows automation into the production lines. That cycle is one that we're going through right now. We expect the overall R&D and capital profile for 777X to remain stable. We've guided you to about $3.5 billion in total R&D spend this year. That remains confidently in place. Our 2016 overall expenditures will be similar to that. And we'll see some incremental growth in 777X. We'll roll off of some of it in other development programs. So it's a very disciplined process, as I said, one that we understand how to do and rolling it in efficiently so that we can continue to drive profitability while we make the transition. It's fundamentals to the equation. We've done it previously on our other rate ramp-ups. We're doing it now on the 737 line, as you can see in the results.

But if you think about out into that time frame, we should be in a lot better shape on that program as well.

As you know, the Senate was in the midst of discussing the Highway Bill yesterday and the potential of XM being included -- XM reauthorization being included as part of that bill. We know it's -- it has the attention of both the House and the Senate right now. We remain optimistic that we'll ultimately see reauthorization, but we also recognize that there's political risk to that. So we're being mindful of that, staying properly engaged in the process. I will say from a company perspective, so we said before, this is not something that creates near-term financial risk for Boeing. There are multiple commercial credit sources available today, that the market is sound there. We have about 15% of our customers that use XM financing as backstop financing, but the current financing market, that doesn't create risk for us. This is about long-term global competitiveness. And that's why we're so forceful on this topic that it's important XM be reauthorized. It's about allowing U.S. industry to be globally competitive. It's about American manufacturing jobs. It's the right thing for the country to do, and we're going to continue to advocate on behalf of U.S. manufacturing jobs."

As you all know, in June, our Board of Directors elected Dennis as Chief Executive Officer of the company, effective July 1. The move was the result of a dedicated effort over several years to develop the future leaders of this company, including my successor as CEO. This has always been a top priority. Our aim was a seamless transition and continuity in our business strategy and overall direction, and that's exactly how it's playing out. I look forward to continuing to work with Dennis and Greg for my role as Chairman. In a moment, I'll turn this call and all subsequent ones over to them. But before doing that, let me just say a very few words about where we are as a company at the start of our 100th year, which began July 15.
These calls tend to have a heavy focus on our performance quarter-to-quarter and rightfully so. But when you zoom out for a wider perspective, a clear picture emerges of an enterprise that is unified in its mission and purpose to lead the industry. It is as strong as it has ever been financially and is positioned to deliver sustained profitable growth in the years ahead. The commercial, defense and space markets we serve are large and growing at a global level. We have already captured a significant share of that growth in our unprecedented backlog. And unlike many companies, our opportunity is largely organic, and harvesting it rests on our execution, a good place to be. As we deliver that backlog to customers, we are intensely focused on productivity and profitability to drive increased shareholder returns and to reinvest in technology and innovation to further strengthen our market-leading portfolio of products and services. The Board of Directors and I are confident that Dennis and the strong team supporting him, including company Vice Chairman, Ray Conner, will succeed in growing our company and serving the interests of our employees, customers and shareholders, communities and other business partners.
With that, let me turn it over to Dennis for a summary of our second quarter results and the business environment. Dennis?"

And Jim, thanks for your leadership over the last 10 years and your continued support and partnership. And good morning, everybody. Let me start by saying it is a privilege to assume leadership of this great company and the more than 160,0",1465,"Thank you, Jim. And Jim, thanks for your leadership over the last 10 years and your continued support and partnership. And good morning, everybody. Let me start by saying it is a privilege to assume leadership of this great company and the more than 160,000 talented employees who comprise it. With Jim at the helm over the past decade, we developed a winning playbook and set a solid foundation for our future. Our job going forward is to deliver on our existing commitments, build on our strengths and improve where needed to create an even bigger, better Boeing in our second century.
Now let's turn to Slide 2 to discuss the second quarter. Boeing delivered strong second quarter operating performance across our production programs and services businesses with higher revenue on record commercial airplane deliveries. Notably, we also generated significant cash flow totaling $3.3 billion. With a strong cash flow and confidence in our long-term outlook, we continue to make strategic R&D and capital investments and return cash to our shareholders. During the quarter, we purchased $2 billion of Boeing stock and paid $625 million in dividends. Year-to-date, we have returned nearly $6 billion to our shareholders, which remains the top priority for us under our balanced cash deployment strategy.
As we announced last week, our very strong second quarter operating performance was impacted by a $536 million after-tax charge to complete development and holds the delivery schedule on our KC-46 Tanker program for the U.S. Air Force. That program, as you know, is being developed on a fixed-price contract. The increased company investment in that program is primarily driven by required rework on the integrated fuel system that was identified as we prepared for and conducted ground and flight tests and verification of that system during the second quarter. The integrated fuel system is the last major system to undergo a component qualification testing. No new technology is needed to resolve these issues, which are well defined and understood, but that in no way mitigates our disappointment in having to take this charge. Our teams are very focused on executing the plan to meet our commitment to deliver 18 KC-46A Tankers to our Air Force customer by August 2017 and 179 Tankers by 2027. To that end, we completed initial airworthiness flight testing in the second quarter, which is a major milestone, and test aircraft #1 will return to flight this month followed by the first flight of aircraft #2 yet this summer. To be clear though, we do have a lot more work to do as we progress through the remaining ground and flight test phases, but we are on the right path. We also remain confident in the long-term financial value of the Tanker program for our company. With a potential market of up to 400 aircraft worth $80 billion, we expect to realize strong returns over decades of production and in-service support.
Now turning to our core operating performance during the quarter. Revenue at Boeing Commercial Airplanes increased 18% to $16.9 billion on a record 197 deliveries. Among the key milestones in the quarter was the start of wing assembly on the first 737 MAX. We also completed Critical Design Review on the 787-10, validating that the program is on plan to meet its performance, cost and schedule requirements.
Boeing Defense, Space & Security reported revenue in the second quarter of $7.5 billion on the delivery of 54 aircraft, 2 satellites and healthy volume in our services business. Key contract awards included Cutter purchasing 4 C-17s and Australia purchasing 2 C-17s, an international F-15 service contract extension and for the first time in history, NASA awarded a contract for a human spaceflight mission to a commercial company. In summary, notwithstanding the Tanker charge, we delivered another quarter of strong core operating performance, achieved significant program milestones, captured orders totaling $18 billion and returned significant cash to our shareholders.
With that, let's turn to the business environment on Slide 3. Our overall view of the business environment remains positive due to improving airline profitability and healthy global air traffic. Based on that traffic growth and strong replacement demand, our new long-term commercial market outlook forecast demand for more than 38,000 commercial aircraft over the next 20 years. That new forecast is up nearly 1,300 aircraft from last year. Customer discussions continue to focus on placing new aircraft orders or accelerating deliveries, as indicated by the favorable pace of orders in and around the Paris Air Show, and yesterday's decision by FedEx to purchase 50 767 freighters with options for 50 more. Deferral requests continue to run well below the historical average. Demand also remained strong for both the 777 and the 777X. Year-to-date, 777 orders and commitments totaled 44, which puts us in solid position to achieve our target of 40 to 60 orders a year to bridge production of the 777X. The 777 production line is essentially sold out for 2016, more than half sold out in 2017 and has a healthy number of slots sold firm in 2018. As we've discussed before, the new 777X is scheduled to enter final assembly in the 2018 time frame and will leverage new manufacturing technologies and processes that are being proven on the current 777. We continue to assess the most efficient way to phase in this new technology and adapt, as necessary, to optimize the 777X production system and meet our customer commitments.
On the 787 program, we have now delivered more than 290 airplanes, including 34 -9s. The airplanes' capabilities continue to draw strong interest from airlines around the world, as noted by the order and commitment activity at the Paris Air Show. Production of the 787 is now balanced between the -8s and -9s, and this is a testament to the progress that the team is making while increasing the -9 up to full rate production.
In the single-aisle segment, demand for our new fuel-efficient 737 MAX also remains high, with cumulative orders totaling more than 2,800 airplanes from 58 customers. Development of the MAX remains on track for first delivery in 2017. We also continue to see upward pressure on narrowbody production rates beyond the announced 52 per month in 2018. However, we remain steadfast in our financial discipline as we assess production rate changes.
Turning to Defense, Space & Security. We continue to see solid support for our major programs. Congress has been supportive of the President's fiscal year '16 budget request, which increases core Boeing production programs such as the P-8A Poseidon, the Apache and Chinook helicopters. Additionally, all 4 defense oversight committees have added 12 F-18 variant aircraft to their budget proposals. Year-over-year budget increases have also been supported by Congress for development programs such as Tanker, Long Range Strike and Commercial Crew, though in some cases, it levels below the President's request. Boeing's Space Launch System program has once again been recommended by the appropriations committees for funding increases far above the President's request.
International demand for our offerings remained strong, especially in the Middle East and the Asia Pacific region. During the second quarter, international customers for Defense, Space & Security represented 33% of revenue and 39% of our current backlog. The strength of our defense and space business stems from a portfolio that is reliable, proven and affordable, supported by our ongoing market-based affordability initiative that will ensure our long-term competitiveness.
Now before I turn it over to Greg, let me expand for just a minute on Jim's comments earlier about our competitive position, the continuity of our focus and the attitude and approach we are taking to further improve our business. All in all, Boeing is financially strong and well positioned in attractive markets. We have the right products, the right strategies and the right people to continue growing and leading our industry. However, we know that standing still is not an option for staying ahead of our competitors and for meeting our customers' expectations in a more-for-less world. In recent years, we've made large and important strides in driving productivity and first-time quality to fund our innovation and growth, working as One Boeing to fully leverage the breadth and depth of our capabilities, reducing long-term risk to our business and balance sheet, expanding internationally and developing better leaders and better teams. Moving forward, our focus on these areas will only grow stronger. We will sharpen our strategies to win. We will accelerate our pace of progress on these and other fundamental efforts, including development program performance. And through these efforts, we will succeed in profitably executing our record backlog, leading through innovation, investing in our people and making our second century even better than our first.
And with that, over to Greg for our financial results and our updated guidance. Greg?"

Let's turn to Slide 4 and we'll discuss our second quarter results. Second quarter revenue increased 11% to $24.5 billion, driven by strong commercial airplane deliveries. Core operating margins of 7% reflect the impact o",987,"Thanks, Dennis, and good morning. Let's turn to Slide 4 and we'll discuss our second quarter results. Second quarter revenue increased 11% to $24.5 billion, driven by strong commercial airplane deliveries. Core operating margins of 7% reflect the impact of the $835 million pretax Tanker charge, or $536 million on an after-tax basis, that offset solid productivity gains on production programs and across our services businesses. Core earnings per share for the quarter was $1.62, reflecting the $0.77 per share Tanker impact that again offset the benefit of continued strong operating performance across the business. As Dennis noted, despite our disappointment in encountering the charge on the Tanker program, we're confident on the path forward and as we progress through the remaining functional and flight tests. While we have a lot of work to do in front of us, we have added the necessary engineering and support staff to complete the program on schedule to meet the customer's commitments.
Let's now discuss Commercial Airplanes on Slide 5. For the second quarter, our Commercial Airplane business increased revenue 18% to $16.9 billion on a record 197 airplane deliveries. Operating margins of 7.1% reflect the $513 million pretax Tanker impact to BCA and the diluted impact of higher 787 and 747 deliveries, partially offset by stronger performance on production programs. Commercial Airplanes captured $13 billion of net orders during the second quarter, and backlog remains very strong, $431 billion and nearly 5,700 aircraft that equates to approximately 8 years of production. Specifically on the 787 program, we continue to expect the program to be cash-positive during 2015 and we still anticipate deferred production to decline shortly after we achieve the 12-per-month production rate later in 2016, and there's no change to these fundamental milestones. We continue to see progress in key operational performance indicators for the 787 program as we further implement production efficiencies while meaningfully increasing 787-9 production. The team delivered 64 787s during the first 6 months of the year and made further progress on reducing unit costs.
On the 787-8, we've seen a decline in unit cost of approximately 35% now over the last 210 deliveries. And furthermore, 787-9 unit cost declined approximately 30% over the first 34 aircraft delivered. In line with our expectations, 787 deferred production increased $790 million to $27.7 billion in the second quarter. As we previously discussed, we continue to anticipate 787 deferred production to grow at a similar level next quarter before a healthy decline in growth in the fourth quarter. More work to do here, but we remain focused on the solid day-to-day execution and risk reduction while improving the long-term productivity and cash flow going forward. We continue to manage the smooth introduction and the ramp-up of the 787-9, prepare for the 12-per-month rate and introducing the -10, while again driving efficiencies across all aspects of the program.
Let's now turn to Defense, Space & Security results on Slide 6. Second quarter revenue, our defense business was $7.5 billion, and operating margins were 7.2% as the $322 million pretax Tanker charge at BDS offset strong performance on production programs and favorable delivery mix. Boeing Military Aircraft's second quarter revenue was $3.5 billion due to timing of deliveries and operating margins of 3.5% in the quarter, again reflecting the Tanker impact. Beyond the Tanker program, BMA captured productivity improvements on a number of key production programs. In addition, the BMA segment significantly retired risk during the quarter on the C-17 program by capturing contracts for 6 aircraft. We now have one more aircraft to sell and we continue see strong interest in that final aircraft for delivery.
Network & Space Systems revenue was $1.9 billion, and the segment generated operating margins of 7.8%. Global Services & Support revenue was $2.1 billion, and operating margins increased to 12.8% on favorable program mix and performance. Defense, Space & Security recorded a solid backlog of $58 billion, with 39% of our current backlog representing customers outside the United States.
Let's move to cash flow now on the next slide. Operating cash flow for the second quarter was strong, $3.3 billion, driven by higher volumes and solid operating performance across the company. With regards to capital deployment, as Dennis mentioned, we paid $625 million in dividends and repurchased 14 million shares for $2 billion in the second quarter as we continue to deliver on our commitment of returning cash to shareholders. Furthermore, this reflects our ongoing confidence in the long-term outlook for the business. We anticipate completing the remainder $7.5 billion repurchase authorization over the next 2 years. Returning cash to shareholders, along with continued investment to support future growth, remains top priorities for us.
Moving now to cash and debt balances on Slide 8. We ended the quarter with $9.6 billion of cash and marketable securities, and our cash balance continues to provide solid liquidity and positions us well going forward.
Turning now to Slide 9 and we'll discuss our outlook for 2015. We are reaffirming our 2015 guidance for revenue, deliveries and cash flow and updating the margin and core EPS guidance to account for the Tanker charge that offsets improved productivity. Our cash flow guidance for 2015 remains unchanged at greater than $9 billion as the cash impact from the Tanker program is offset by improved cash performance across the company. Our 2015 guidance for commercial airplane operating margin is now 9%, reflecting the Tanker impact, and Defense, Space & Security operating margin guidance is now 9.5%. That has more than offset the improved performance at BMA and GS&S. Core earnings per share guidance is now between $7.70 and $7.90 from $8.20 to $8.40, reflecting the $0.77 Tanker charge and $0.27 benefit from improved performance.
In summary, we generated solid revenue growth, delivered on our backlog, generated significant cash flow and meaningfully returned cash to shareholders.
So with that, I'll turn it back over to Dennis for some closing comments."

And Carter, to your broader, higher-level question, it's frankly been a privilege for me to work side by side with Jim for about the last 1.5 years with him and the rest of the team, Greg, Ray and the whole Boeing teams. I've got a lot of confidence in the foundation that we've put in place. And as we noted, today, we have a very strong company. We're well positioned in our markets. We have a strong financial foundation. We've got the right productivity machine in place. We've got the right strategy in place. So the theme you'll be hearing from me and the rest of the team is one of strategic consistency. We like the path we're on, the direction we're headed. There are a few areas where we're going to continue to hone our strategy, sharpen it and accelerate our actions. I think if I looked at big opportunities and risks, certainly, going forward, our opportunity to execute on our commercial aircraft backlog and to do that profitably and return cash to shareholders and fund our future innovation, that is the single biggest opportunity we have. Having 7 years of backlog and the opportunity to execute that well, that will be a clear focus for us. On the risk side, certainly, we want to continue to pay attention to delivering on our development programs. We're seeing steady improvement overall in terms of our ability to deliver on cost and schedule. I think Tanker is a good reminder to us to continue to hone that effort. But we are on the right path to continue to deliver innovation to the marketplace and to do it in a repeatable, financially disciplined way. And if I look out a little farther beyond that, if we think about how we're going to invest that capital, as you noted, our cash opportunity in terms of executing our backlog also creates opportunity to invest in future innovation. And successfully bringing those new commercial aircraft to the marketplace is very important to us with the MAX, 787-10 and the 777X. And we feel very confident in all those development activities. We're also investing in a few future franchises on the defense side, including Long Range Strike, again, good solid opportunities for us. And if we look at uses of cash going forward, our #1 priority remains that disciplined investment in innovation for the future; secondly, returning cash to shareholders, as you've seen through both the stock repurchase and through dividends; and then thirdly, where it makes sense, bolt-on acquisitions. But our fundamental investment priority for the future is an organic investment machine. We have a very strong position here, and we plan to leverage that."

I want to confirm that's still the case. But also, as you see the model shift toward the -9, the -9 should ultimately be, we would think, considerably more profitable than the -8.

You think about the numbers I talked to you about, 30% over 34 deliveries, it gives you a really good sense of how well that's being incorporated. But remember, we made some investments upfront to ensure we had that smooth introduction. At the same time, lessons learned after -8 and getting those into the -9, so the producibility of the -9 has definitely improved. So over time, that favorable mix will work in our favor. I think I've mentioned that half of our deliveries this year will be -9s. And I would tell you just from my time at the company, that is the smoothest introduction of a derivative at -- on top of the all-time high production rate on the widebody program. So again, I think there's more opportunity for us going forward. We got the enterprise focused on that. Whether that's in -- on the shop floor, support or across the supply chain, that remains a top priority for us.

Those priced options that you mentioned are part of the low-rate initial production program, and I think here, where we've already got the first 2 aircraft loaded into the production line system in our commercial factory in Everett. And our ability to integrate that into the full commercial line is one of the big ways that we've reduced risk on the program overall and some of the charge that we've taken in this quarter is the fact that we are having to retrofit a couple of those early aircraft that are in early-build stages, but that allows us to get into a mature position now so that again, we have high confidence in the production program. We've got Ray in our BCA team very much engaged on ensuring we're doing the right things now to drive profitability in the production system for the long run.

I think as I've said to you before, as you think about just purely the production rate increases that are going to take place over time and how that advance stream is completely associated with that, you're going to continue to see advances grow going forward as we increase production rates and then ultimately, increase deliveries. So that profile will continue. Now it won't be at the same growth rate it's been because we don't have 18 rate breaks in front of us that we've just completed. We've got to have 5. So you'll still see a healthy increase in advances going forward and then ultimately, as you know, the bulk of the cash coming on delivery. So that's where you'll see it coming from. In the quarter, that is core cash. That is just pure core cash performance across the business. It's not timing. It's not driven by some advances from one quarter to the next.

Several campaigns still underway, so our ability to build the bridge, one, we continue to be confident there. In terms of the transition, this is where we'll be feathering in the new production systems. As you know, that will start hitting the production system around the 2018 time frame, in terms of long lead implementation for 2020 deliveries on the 777X. So specific decisions around that will be more in the next year time frame, but the key thing we're doing now is derisking that transition by pulling some of the technology and some of the automation forward into the 777 line, things like the fuselage upright build, for example. And that's allowing us to derisk the production system, and we'll continue to look for ways to make sure that feathering in is done most effectively and efficiently. We know how to do this. We've built bridges on our other production lines. We're doing the same thing on the NG to MAX transition in the 737 line.

And then, Greg, I'll flip it  over to you for some additional comments. Again, when we look at that overall transition, Jason, it's important for us to first note that the market demand for the 777 remains very strong. So our ability to confidently build a bridge and to plan on that is part of the equation here. The bridge itself and the transition to the 777X, the key there is to flow it efficiently into the production system and into our supply chain. So long lead planning is already underway. As I said, we'll make some additional decisions next year on exactly how we'll implement that and feather it into the production system, but we do this across the entire depth of our supply chain. Any technologies or investments that we can pull forward and pre-implement on the 777 line, as I said we're doing with some of the automation technology, further derisks it for 777X and also allows us to drive additional profitability on the current 777 line. And that's part of how we're continuing to pay for the implementation, if you will, is by driving productivity on the base programs to fuel our future innovation and allows automation into the production lines. That cycle is one that we're going through right now. We expect the overall R&D and capital profile for 777X to remain stable. We've guided you to about $3.5 billion of total R&D spend this year. That remains confidently in place. Our 2016 overall expenditures will be similar to that. And we'll see some incremental growth in 777X but roll off in some of the other development programs. So it's a very disciplined process, as I said, one that we understand how to do and rolling it in efficiently so that we can continue to drive profitability while we make the transition. It's fundamental to the equation. We've done it previously on our other rate ramp-ups. We're doing it now on the 737 line, as you can see in the results. And we expect to use that same disciplined process on 777. Greg, anything you want to add?"

But if you think about out into that time frame, we should be in a lot better shape on that program as well. So there's more offsets than any short term, I'd say, impact as related to this transition on 777 to 777X. Now obviously, that is a key franchise for us.

The second, I'll continue on the Tanker theme, is thinking about the pace of rework on the fuel system and looking at history of 87 and what happened with F-35 over at Lockheed, is it wise to push headlong into production when you're not totally clear on the pace of changes ahead of 46A flight tests?

There's more retrofit into the aircraft that are in the line already. That said, we have our arms around this. We understand the work that has to be done.

So now it's about executing the work ahead of us and delivering those first 18 Tankers by 2017.

We know it's -- it has the attention of both the House and the Senate right now. We remain optimistic that we'll ultimately see reauthorization, but we also recognize that there's political risk to that. So we're being mindful of that and staying properly engaged in the process. I will say, from a company perspective, as we said before, this is not something that creates near-term financial risk for Boeing. There are multiple commercial credit sources available today, that the market is sound there. We have about 15% of our customers that use Ex-Im financing as backstop financing, but in the current financing market, that doesn't create risk for us. This is about long-term global competitiveness. And that's why we're so forceful on this topic that it's important Ex-Im be reauthorized. It's about allowing U.S. industry to be globally competitive. It's about American manufacturing jobs. It's the right thing for the country to do, and we're going to continue to advocate on behalf of U.S. manufacturing jobs."

As you all know, in June, our Board of Directors elected Dennis as Chief Executive Officer of the company, effective July 1. The move was the result of a dedicated effort over several years to develop the future leaders of this company, including my successor as CEO. This has always been a top priority. Our aim was a seamless transition and continuity in our business strategy and overall direction, and that's exactly how it's playing out. I look forward to continuing to work with Dennis and Greg through my role as Chairman. In a moment, I'll turn this call and all subsequent ones over to them. But before doing that, let me just say a very few words about where we are as a company at the start of our 100th year, which began July 15.
These calls tend to have a heavy focus on our performance quarter-to-quarter and rightfully so. But when you zoom out for a wider perspective, a clearer picture emerges of an enterprise that is unified in its mission and purpose to lead the industry. It is as strong as it has ever been financially and is positioned to deliver sustained profitable growth in the years ahead. The commercial, defense and space markets we serve are large and growing at a global level. We have already captured a significant share of that growth in our unprecedented backlog. And unlike many companies, our opportunity is largely organic, and harvesting it rests on our execution, a good place to be. As we deliver that backlog to customers, we are intensely focused on productivity and profitability to drive increased shareholder returns and to reinvest in technology and innovation to further strengthen our market-leading portfolio of products and services. The Board of Directors and I are confident that Dennis and the strong team supporting him, including company Vice Chairman, Ray Conner, will succeed in growing our company and serving the interests of our employees, customers and shareholders, communities and other business partners.
With that, let me turn it over to Dennis for a summary of our second quarter results and the business environment. Dennis?"

And Jim, thanks for your leadership over the last 10 years and your continued support and partnership. And good morning, everybody. Let me start by saying it is a privilege to assume leadership of this great company and the more than 160,000 talented employees who comprise it. With Jim at the helm over the past decade, we developed a winning playbook and set a solid foundation for our future. Our job going forward is to deliver on our existing commitments, build on our strengths and improve where needed to create an even bigger, better Boeing in our second century.
Now let's turn to Slide 2 to discuss the second quarter. Boeing delivered strong second quarter operating performance across our production programs and services businesses with higher revenue on record commercial airplane deliveries. Notably, we also generated significant cash flow totaling $3.3 billion. With this strong cash flow and confidence in our long-term outlook, we continue to make strategic R&D and capital investments and return cash to our shareholders. During the quarter, we purchased $2 billion of Boeing stock and paid $625 million in dividends. Year-to-date, we have returned nearly $6 billion to our shareholders, which remains the top priority for us under our balanced cash deployment strategy.
As we announced last week, our very strong second quarter operating performance was impacted by a $536 million after-tax charge to complete development and hold to the delivery schedule on our KC-46 Tanker program for the U.S. Air Force. That program, as you know, is being developed on a fixed-price contract. The increased company investment in that program is primarily driven by required rework on the integrated fuel system that was identified as we prepared for and conducted ground and flight tests and verification of that system during the second quarter. The integrated fuel system is the last major system to undergo component qualification testing. No new technology is needed to resolve these issues, which are well defined and understood, but that in no way mitigates our disappointment in having to take this charge. Our teams are very focused on executing the plan to meet our commitment to deliver 18 KC-46A Tankers to our Air Force customer by August 2017 and 179 Tankers by 2027. To that end, we completed initial airworthiness flight testing in the second quarter, which is a major milestone. And test aircraft #1 will return to flight this month, followed by the first flight of aircraft #2 yet this summer. To be clear though, we do have a lot more work to do as we progress through the remaining ground and flight test phases, but we are on the right path. We also remain confident in the long-term financial value of the Tanker program for our company. With a potential market of up to 400 aircraft worth $80 billion, we expect to realize strong returns over decades of production and in-service support.
Now turning to our core operating performance during the quarter. Revenue at Boeing Commercial Airplanes increased 18% to $16.9 billion on a record 197 deliveries. Among the key milestones in the quarter was the start of wing assembly on the first 737 MAX. We also completed Critical Design Review on the 787-10, validating that the program is on plan to meet its performance, cost and schedule requirements.
Boeing Defense, Space & Security reported revenue in the second quarter of $7.5 billion on the delivery of 54 aircraft, 2 satellites and healthy volume in our services business. Key contract awards included Qatar purchasing 4 C-17s and Australia purchasing 2 C-17s, an international F-15 service contract extension, and for the first time in history, NASA awarded a contract for a human spaceflight mission to a commercial company. In summary, notwithstanding the Tanker charge, we delivered another quarter of strong core operating performance, achieved significant program milestones, captured orders totaling $18 billion and returned significant cash to our shareholders.
With that, let's turn to the business environment on Slide 3. Our overall view of the business environment remains positive due to improving airline profitability and healthy global air traffic. Based on that traffic growth and strong replacement demand, our new long-term commercial market outlook forecast demand for more than 38,000 commercial aircraft over the next 20 years. That new forecast is up nearly 1,300 aircraft from last year. Customer discussions continue to focus on placing new aircraft orders or accelerating deliveries, as indicated by the favorable pace of orders in and around the Paris Air Show, and yesterday's decision by FedEx to purchase 50 767 freighters, with options for 50 more. Deferral requests continue to run well below the historical average. Demand also remained strong for both the 777 and the 777X. Year-to-date, 777 orders and commitments totaled 44, which puts us in solid position to achieve our target of 40 to 60 orders a year to bridge production of the 777X. The 777 production line is essentially sold out for 2016, more than half sold out in 2017 and has a healthy number of slots sold firm in 2018. As we've discussed before, the new 777X is scheduled to enter final assembly in the 2018 time frame and will leverage new manufacturing technologies and processes that are being proven on the current 777. We continue to assess the most efficient way to phase in this new technology and adapt, as necessary, to optimize the 777X production system and meet our customer commitments.
On the 787 program, we have now delivered more than 290 airplanes, including 34 -9s. The airplanes' capabilities continue to draw strong interest from airlines around the world, as noted by the order and commitment activity at the Paris Air Show. Production of the 787 is now balanced between the -8s and -9s, and this is a testament to the progress that the team is making while increasing the -9 up to full rate production.
In the single-aisle segment, demand for our new fuel-efficient 737 MAX also remains high, with cumulative orders totaling more than 2,800 airplanes from 58 customers. Development of the MAX remains on track for first delivery in 2017. We also continue to see upward pressure on narrowbody production rates beyond the announced 52 per month in 2018. However, we remain steadfast in our financial discipline as we assess production rate changes.
Turning to Defense, Space & Security. We continue to see solid support for our major programs. Congress has been supportive of the President's fiscal year '16 budget request, which increases core Boeing production programs such as the P-8A Poseidon, the Apache and Chinook helicopters. Additionally, all 4 defense oversight committees have added 12 F-18 variant aircraft to their budget proposals. Year-over-year budget increases have also been supported by Congress for development programs such as Tanker, Long Range Strike and Commercial Crew, though in some cases, it levels below the President's request. Boeing's Space Launch System program has once again been recommended by the appropriations committees for funding increases far above the President's request.
International demand for our offerings remained strong, especially in the Middle East and the Asia Pacific region. During the second quarter, international customers for Defense, Space & Security represented 33% of revenue and 39% of our current backlog. The strength of our defense and space business stems from a portfolio that is reliable, proven and affordable, supported by our ongoing market-based affordability initiative that will ensure our long-term competitiveness.
Now before I turn it over to Greg, let me expand for just a minute on Jim's comments earlier about our competitive position, the continuity of our focus and the attitude and approach we are taking to further improve our business. All in all, Boeing is financially strong and well positioned in attractive markets. We have the right products, the right strategies and the right people to continue growing and leading our industry. However, we know that standing still is not an option for staying ahead of our competitors and for meeting our customers' expectations in a more-for-less world. In recent years, we've made large and important strides in driving productivity and first-time quality to fund our innovation and growth, working as One Boeing to fully leverage the breadth and depth of our capabilities, reducing long-term risk to our business and balance sheet, expanding internationally and developing better leaders and better teams. Moving forward, our focus on these areas will only grow stronger. We will sharpen our strategies to win. We will accelerate our pace of progress on these and other fundamental efforts, including development program performance. And through these efforts, we will succeed in profitably executing our record backlog, leading through innovation, investing in our people and making our second century even better than our first.
And with that, over to Greg for our financial results and our updated guidance. Greg?"

Let's turn to Slide 4 and we'll discuss our second quarter results. Second quarter revenue increased 11% to $24.5 billion, driven by strong commercial airplane deliveries.

Second quarter revenue increased 11% to $24.5 billion, driven by strong commercial airplane deliveries. Core operating margins of 7% reflect the impact of the $835 million pretax Tanker charge, or $536 million on an after-tax basis, that offset solid productivity gains on production programs and across our services businesses. Core earnings per share for the quarter was $1.62, reflecting the $0.77-per-share Tanker impact that again offset the benefit of continued strong operating performance across the business. As Dennis noted, despite our disappointment in encountering the charge on the Tanker program, we're confident on the path forward and as we progress through the remaining functional and flight tests. While we have a lot of work to do in front of us, we have added the necessary engineering and support staff to complete the program on schedule to meet the customer's commitments.
Let's now discuss Commercial Airplanes on Slide 5. For the second quarter, our Commercial Airplane business increased revenue 18% to $16.9 billion on a record 197 airplane deliveries. Operating margins of 7.1% reflect the $513 million pretax Tanker impact to BCA and the diluted impact of higher 787 and 747 deliveries, partially offset by stronger performance on production programs. Commercial Airplanes captured $13 billion of net orders during the second quarter, and backlog remains very strong, $431 billion and nearly 5,700 aircraft that equates to approximately 8 years of production. Specifically on the 787 program, we continue to expect the program to be cash-positive during 2015 and we still anticipate deferred production to decline shortly after we achieve the 12-per-month production rate later in 2016, and there's no change to these fundamental milestones. We continue to see progress in key operational performance indicators for the 787 program as we further implement production efficiencies while meaningfully increasing 787-9 production. The team delivered 64 787s during the first 6 months of the year and made further progress on reducing unit costs.
On the 787-8, we've seen a decline in unit cost of approximately 35% now over the last 210 deliveries. And furthermore, 787-9 unit cost declined approximately 30% over the first 34 aircraft delivered. In line with our expectations, 787 deferred production increased $790 million to $27.7 billion in the second quarter. As we previously discussed, we continue to anticipate 787 deferred production to grow at a similar level next quarter, before a healthy decline in growth in the fourth quarter. More work to do here, but we remain focused on the solid day-to-day execution and risk reduction while improving the long-term productivity and cash flow going forward. We continue to manage the smooth introduction and the ramp-up of the 787-9, prepare for the 12-per-month rate and introducing the -10, while again driving efficiencies across all aspects of the program.
Let's now turn to Defense, Space & Security results on Slide 6. Second quarter revenue in our defense business was $7.5 billion, and operating margins were 7.2%, as the $322 million pretax Tanker charge at BDS offset strong performance on production programs and favorable delivery mix. Boeing Military Aircraft's second quarter revenue was $3.5 billion due to timing of deliveries and operating margins of 3.5% in the quarter, again reflecting the Tanker impact. Beyond the Tanker program, BMA captured productivity improvements on a number of key production programs. In addition, the BMA segment significantly retired risk during the quarter on the C-17 program by capturing contracts for 6 aircraft. We now have one more aircraft to sell and we continue see strong interest in that final aircraft for delivery.
Network & Space Systems revenue was $1.9 billion, and the segment generated operating margins of 7.8%. Global Services & Support revenue was $2.1 billion, and operating margins increased to 12.8% on favorable program mix and performance. Defense, Space & Security recorded a solid backlog of $58 billion, with 39% of our current backlog representing customers outside the United States.
Let's move to cash flow now on the next slide. Operating cash flow for the second quarter was strong, $3.3 billion, driven by higher volumes and solid operating performance across the company. With regards to capital deployment, as Dennis mentioned, we paid $625 million in dividends and repurchased 14 million shares for $2 billion in the second quarter as we continue to deliver on our commitment of returning cash to shareholders. Furthermore, this reflects our ongoing confidence in the long-term outlook for the business. We anticipate completing the remainder of $7.5 billion repurchase authorization over the next 2 years. Returning cash to shareholders, along with continued investment to support future growth, remains top priorities for us.
Moving now to cash and debt balances on Slide 8. We ended the quarter with $9.6 billion of cash and marketable securities, and our cash balance continues to provide solid liquidity and positions us well going forward.
Turning now to Slide 9, and we'll discuss our outlook for 2015. We are reaffirming our 2015 guidance for revenue, deliveries and cash flow and updating the margin and core EPS guidance to account for the Tanker charge that offsets improved productivity. Our cash flow guidance for 2015 remains unchanged at greater than $9 billion, as the cash impact from the Tanker program is offset by improved cash performance across the company. Our 2015 guidance for commercial airplane operating margin is now 9%, reflecting the Tanker impact. And Defense, Space & Security operating margin guidance is now 9.5%. That has more than offset the improved performance at BMA and GS&S. Core earnings-per-share guidance is now between $7.70 and $7.90 from $8.20 to $8.40, reflecting the $0.77 Tanker charge and $0.27 benefit from improved performance.
In summary, we generated solid revenue growth, delivered on our backlog, generated significant cash flow and meaningfully returned cash to shareholders.
So with that, I'll turn it back over to Dennis for some closing comments."

And Carter, to your broader, higher-level question, it's frankly been a privilege for me to work side by side with Jim for about the last 1.5 years with him and the rest of the team, Greg, Ray and the whole Boeing team. I've got a lot of confidence in the foundation that we've put in place. And as we noted, today, we have a very strong company. We're well positioned in our markets. We have a strong financial foundation. We've got the right productivity machine in place. We've got the right strategy in place. So the theme you'll be hearing from me and the rest of the team is one of strategic consistency. We like the path we're on, the direction we're headed. There are a few areas where we're going to continue to hone our strategy, sharpen it and accelerate our actions. I think if I looked at big opportunities and risks, certainly, going forward, our opportunity to execute on our commercial aircraft backlog and to do that profitably and return cash to shareholders and fund our future innovation, that is the single biggest opportunity we have. Having 7 years of backlog and the opportunity to execute that well, that will be a clear focus for us. On the risk side, certainly, we want to continue to pay attention to delivering on our development programs. We're seeing steady improvement overall in terms of our ability to deliver on cost and schedule. I think Tanker is a good reminder to us to continue to hone that effort. But we are on the right path to continue to deliver innovation to the marketplace and to do it in a repeatable, financially disciplined way. And if I look out a little farther beyond that, if we think about how we're going to invest that capital, as you noted, our cash opportunity in terms of executing our backlog also creates opportunity to invest in future innovation. And successfully bringing those new commercial aircraft to the marketplace is very important to us with the MAX, 787-10 and the 777X. And we feel very confident in all those development activities. We're also investing in a few future franchises on the defense side, including Long Range Strike, again, good solid opportunities for us. And if we look at uses of cash going forward, our #1 priority remains that disciplined investment in innovation for the future; secondly, returning cash to shareholders, as you've seen through both the stock repurchase and through dividends; and then thirdly, where it makes sense, bolt-on acquisitions. But our fundamental investment priority for the future is an organic investment machine. We have a very strong position here, and we plan to leverage that."

You think about the numbers I talked to you about, 30% over 34 deliveries, it gives you a really good sense of how well that's being incorporated. But remember, we made some investments upfront to ensure we had that smooth introduction. At the same time, lessons learned after -8 and getting those into the -9, so the producibility of the -9 has definitely improved. So over time, that favorable mix will work in our favor. I think I've mentioned that half of our deliveries this year will be -9s. And I would tell you just from my time at the company, that is the smoothest introduction of a derivative at -- on top of the all-time high production rate on the widebody program. So again, I think there's more opportunity for us going forward. We got the enterprise focused on that.

And some of the charge that we've taken in this quarter is the fact that we are having to retrofit a couple of those early aircraft that are in early-build stages. But that allows us to get into a mature position now so that again, we have high confidence in the production program. We've got Ray and our BCA team very much engaged on ensuring we're doing the right things now to drive profitability in the production system for the long run. So we'll complete that work here during the development phase. We're confident that as we get into low-rate initial production and then full production, this program will have a lot of financial value both for the company and for our shareholders."

I think as I've said to you before, as you think about just purely the production rate increases that are going to take place over time and how that advance stream is completely associated with that, you're going to continue to see advances grow going forward as we increase production rates and then ultimately, increase deliveries. So that profile will continue. Now it won't be at the same growth rate it's been because we don't have 18 rate breaks in front of us that we've just completed. We've got about 5. So you'll still see a healthy increase in advances going forward and then ultimately, as you know, the bulk of the cash coming on is delivery. So that's where you'll see it coming from.

So specific decisions around that will be more in the next year time frame, but the key thing we're doing now is derisking that transition by pulling some of the technology and some of the automation forward into the 777 line, things like the fuselage upright build, for example.

And then, Greg, I'll flip it  over to you for some additional comments. Again, when we look at that overall transition, Jason, it's important for us to first note that the market demand for the 777 remains very strong. So our ability to confidently build a bridge and to plan on that is part of the equation here. The bridge itself and the transition to the 777X, the key there is to flow it efficiently into the production system and into our supply chain. So long lead planning is already underway. As I said, we'll make some additional decisions next year on exactly how we'll implement that and feather it into the production system, but we do this across the entire depth of our supply chain. Any technologies or investments that we can pull forward and pre-implement on the 777 line, as I said we're doing with some of the automation technology, further derisks it for 777X and also allows us to drive additional profitability on the current 777 line. And that's part of how we're continuing to pay for the implementation, if you will, is by driving productivity on the base programs to fuel our future innovation and allows automation into the production lines. That cycle is one that we're going through right now. We expect the overall R&D and capital profile for 777X to remain stable. We've guided you to about $3.5 billion of total R&D spend this year. That remains confidently in place. Our 2016 overall expenditures will be similar to that. And we'll see some incremental growth in 777X but roll-off in some of the other development programs. So it's a very disciplined process, as I said, one that we understand how to do, and rolling it in efficiently so that we can continue to drive profitability while we make the transition is fundamental to the equation. We've done it previously on our other rate ramp-ups. We're doing it now on the 737 line, as you can see in the results. And we expect to use that same disciplined process on 777.

We've got the 7 -- I'm sorry, 737, the 787 going up in rate, and as well as, obviously, we had to continue down this learning curve on 787. But if you think about out into that time frame, we should be in a lot better shape on that program as well. So there's more offsets than any short term, I'd say, impact as related to this transition on 777 to 777X. Now obviously, that is a key franchise for us. So having that short-term transition period is very minimal considering the benefit that program -- both of those programs bring to the bottom line of the Boeing company."

The second, I'll continue on the Tanker theme, is thinking about the pace of rework on the fuel system and looking at history of 87 and what happened with F-35 over at Lockheed, is it wise to push headlong into production when you're not totally clear on the pace of changes ahead of 46A flight tests? And how are you guys going to kind of avoid, manage a pileup of post-production modification like you had on 87, and ultimately, what you did last week? Is that the last of the charges?"

There's no technology or invention that has to be accomplished. As Jim said, this is the nature of what came out of some final ground and flight testing on certifying the integrated fuel system. This is the last major system to be qualified under the development program. So while we're disappointed in the charge, it reflects the ripple effect that it is the last system. As a result, there's more retrofit into the aircraft that are in the line already. That said, we have our arms around this. We understand the work that has to be done. We have found a way to execute that work and keep the program on schedule for our customer. And we're confident that we're going to do that. So now it's about executing the work ahead of us and delivering those first 18 Tankers by 2017.

We know it's -- it has the attention of both the House and the Senate right now. We remain optimistic that we'll ultimately see reauthorization, but we also recognize that there's political risk to that. So we're being mindful of that and staying properly engaged in the process. I will say, from a company perspective, as we said before, this is not something that creates near-term financial risk for Boeing. There are multiple commercial credit sources available today, that the market is sound there. We have about 15% of our customers that use Ex-Im financing as backstop financing, but in the current financing market, that doesn't create risk for us. This is about long-term global competitiveness. And that's why we're so forceful on this topic that it's important Ex-Im be reauthorized. It's about allowing the U.S. industry to be globally competitive. It's about American manufacturing jobs. It's the right thing for the country to do, and we're going to continue to advocate on behalf of U.S. manufacturing jobs."

I'll start with some comments on the quarter and our business environment, after that, Greg will walk through details for financial results and outlook. 
With that lets move to Slide 2. Boeing delivered strong third quarter operating performance with 9% revenue growth, 10.2% core operating margins, 18% growth in core earnings per share and operating cash flow of $2.9 billion. Given our operating performance in the quarter, we are raising 2015 guidance for revenue, core EPS and operating cash flow. This performance and confidence in our long-term outlook continues to support our commitment to return cash to shareholders while also making strategic investments to grow our business. Year-to-date, we've returned nearly $8 billion to shareholders through share repurchase and dividends. This remains a priority under our balance cash deployment strategy. Revenue at Boeing Commercial airplanes increased 10% on record deliveries of our industry-leading product family. During the quarter, we delivered our 325th 787. We began final assembly and achieved power on for the 737 MAX, completed firm configuration on the 777x and successfully completed final testing and began implementing the advanced automation fuselage technology on the 777 line, which will improve safety, quality and flow time and ensure a smooth transition to the 777x. Boeing Defense Space and Security grew its top line by 6% on higher revenue at Boeing Military aircraft, and network and space systems. Key contract awards during the quarter included in orders from India were 22 Apache attack helicopters and 15 Chinook heavylift helicopters and a contract from Japan for 5  V-22 rotary aircraft. We also received a contract from the U.S. Navy for 13 additional P-8A Poseidon aircraft. Significant defense program milestones included delivery of the first 2 of 12 EA-18 Growlers to the Royal Australian Air Force and the start of flight testing of the first pull off KC-46A aerial refueling tanker. During the last few weeks, we have successfully deployed the tankers refueling boom and its line and refueling systems multiple times over a broad range of flight additions. While more work remains ahead, these early accomplishments represent significant risk reductions and real progress from the flight test program. In summary, we had another strong partner of operating performance and cash generation. 
With that, let's turn to the business environment on Slide 3. The commercial airplane business environment generally remains healthy, driven by improving airline profitability, solid air passenger traffic and meaningful replacement demand. Air cargo traffic remains a watch target for us as a gradual market recovery continues and amid modest overall global economic growth rates. Airplane order activity and customer discussions are continuing at a moderated but historically healthy pace. Deferral requests and cancellations remain well below the historical average. In the single-aisle segment, demand for our new fuel-efficient 737 MAX remains high with cumulative orders totaling nearly 2,900 airplanes from 58 customers. Given the strong market demand, we continue to see upward pressure on narrowbody production rates, beyond the announced 52 per month in 2018. However, we remained steadfast in our financial discipline as we assess the market demand for further production rate changes. 
During the third quarter, we made the decision to increase the 767 production rate to 2.5 per month starting in 2017, driven by ongoing strong demand for the 767 freighter on top of the existing plan tanker production base. This is a testament to the compelling value proposition that airplane brings to the market. Demand also remained strong for the 777x, with the backlog of 306 aircraft from 6 customers. On the 777, we have 44 orders and commitments year-to-date including the 2 777-300 ERs announced last week for EVA Airways. Our 777 backlog stands at 235 aircraft with production for 2016 essentially sold out, and 2017 production more than half sold. With firm configuration of that 777x complete and our manufacturing advanced taking hold, we are now working to finalize the production plan to phase in this new technology. We will also continue to assess 777 supply and demand to maximize airplane profitability over the transition period. On the 787 program EVA's decision last week to also purchase up to 24 787-10 is evidenced of strong continued market demand for the Dreamliner. The 787 backlog of nearly 800 orders fully supports our planned production rate increases to 12 per month for 2016 and 14 per month later this decade. We have now delivered more than 330 787s, including more than 50 Dash 9. 
Turning to defense base and security. We continue to see solid support for major programs. Congress has been supportive of the President's fiscal year 2016 VOD and NASA budget request basis to core Boeing programs, including the P-8A Poseidon, the F-18 Super Hornet, Apache and Chinook helicopters and the NASA's Space Launch System. International demand for our offerings remained strong, particularly in the Middle East and the Asia-Pacific region. 
During the third quarter, international customers for defense space and security represents 35% of revenue and 40% of our current backlog. The strength of our defense and space business stems from our investments in technology and innovation that have established the portfolio of reliable, proven and affordable products and services. We continue to invest in organic growth areas that are priorities for our customers, such as commercial derivatives, space, unmanned systems, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, and the critical few future franchise programs like long-range strike and the T-X Trainer. Teams throughout our company continue to ensure our long-term competitiveness made driving further safety, quality and productivity gains to improve program profitability and fund investment in future growth. In summary, our team is executing on our business strategy by growing revenues, generating solid operating performance and capturing strategic new business. 
Now over to Greg for our financial results and our updated guidance. Greg?"

Third quarter revenue increased 9% to $25.8 billion, driven by record commercial airplane deliveries. Core operating margins of 10.2% reflects solid execution across both businesses. Core earnings per share for the quarter increased 18% to $2.52, reflecting, again, continued strong core operating performance on production programs and within our services business. Let's now discuss Commercial Airplanes on Slide 5. For the third quarter, Boeing Commercial Airplanes revenue increased 10% to $17.7 billion on a record 199 airplane deliveries. BCA operating margin of 10% reflects strong execution, offset by the impact of higher planned R&D spending and increased 787 deliveries. Commercial Airplanes captured $13 billion of net orders during the third quarter and backlog remains very strong at $426 billion and nearly 5,700 aircraft equating to more than 7 years of production. Specifically on the 787, we continue to expect the program to be cash positive in the fourth quarter, and we still anticipate the production to declined shortly after we achieve the 12 per month production rate later in 2016. No change to these fundamental milestones. 
We continue to see progress in the key operational performance indicators for the 787 program as we implement additional production efficiency while meaningfully increasing 787-9 production. As planned, the 787-9 production rate and deliveries are now outpacing 787-8. This is a testament to the team's detailed advanced planning and day-to-day execution to ensure a smooth transition and ramp up of the 787-9. 
On the 787-8, we have continued to make progress on unit cost production, where we now see a decline of approximately 40% over the last 230 deliveries. We've also made further progress in the 787-9, where we now have had more than 30% cost reduction over the first 50 deliveries. Driven by continued cost reductions, a healthy mix of Dash 9s and the benefit of favorable timing on quarterly spending 787 deferred production increased $577 million to now a balance of $28.3 billion in the third quarter. We continue to anticipate 787 deferred production growth to further decline in the fourth quarter. We still have work ahead of us in the 787 as we remain focused on the solid day-to-day execution and risk mitigation while improving the long-term productivity and cash flow going forward. We will continue to manage the smooth ramp up of the 787-9 production, prepare for the 12 per month introduction and introduce the Dash 10 while, again, driving efficiencies across all aspects of the program. 
Let's now turn to Slide 6 to discuss Defense, Space & Security results. BDS reported strong results in the quarter with revenue increasing 6% to $8.4 billion, and operating margins of 12.2% on strong performance and a favorable delivery mix. Boeing Military Aircraft third quarter revenue increased 15% to $4.1 billion, largely driven by F-15 contract negotiations. Operating margins were 12.2% in the quarter, reflecting higher volumes and strong performance. Network and space revenue increased 5% to $2.1 billion, driven by commercial crude volume. The segment also generated strong operating margins of 11.5% on favorable mix and productivity improvements. Global services and support revenue declined to $2.2 billion, largely driven by timing of deliveries while operating margins were strong at 12.9%. Defense, Space & Security captured $9 billion of orders during the quarter and reported to solid backlog of $59 billion. 
Let's move to cash flow now on Slide 7. Operating cash flow for the third quarter was strong at $2.9 billion, driven by higher volumes and solid operating performance. And with regards to capital deployment, we paid $618 million in dividend and repurchased 11 million shares for $1.5 billion in the third quarter as we continue to deliver on our commitment of returning cash to shareholders. Year-to-date, we have returned $8 billion to shareholders through dividends and repurchased 41 million shares. Again, this reflects our commitment and confidence in the long-term outlook for our business. Returning cash to shareholders, along with continued investments support future growth remain high priority for us. 
Let's now move to cash and debt balances on Slide 8. We ended the quarter with $9.9 billion of cash and marketable securities. Our cash balance continues to provide solid liquidity and positions us well going forward. Let's now turn to Slide 9 and will discuss our outlook for the balance of 2015. Based on the strong operating performance year-to-date, we've increased our 2015 guidance for revenue, operating margins, core earnings per share and operating cash flow. Core earnings per share guidance for 2015 has increased $0.25 to now be between $7.95 and $8.15 a share on continued solid execution across the business. The company revenue guidance increased $500 million, now be between $95 billion and $97 billion on higher commercial airplane deliveries. BCA delivery guidance has increased now 5 airplanes to be from 755 to 760. Defense, Space & Security operating margins guidance has increased to approximately 10%, again, reflecting strong operating efficiencies across the business. Operating cash flow has increased to approximately $9.5 billion on improved performance across the company as well as favorable timing of receipts and expenditures. And furthermore, we're lowering our R&D guidance, $100 million to now be $3.4 billion for the year to reflect timing of spending. In the fourth quarter, we expect BCA margins to be impacted by the strong operating performance somewhat offset by delivery mix and higher planned R&D spending on 777x as well as additional investments in productivity initiatives.
So in summary, we generated solid revenue growth and healthy operating margins while generating significant cash flow. We meaningfully return cash to shareholders and invested in our future. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Dennis for closing comments."

Certainly productivity continuing to come down the learning curve internally. You've heard us talk about the progress-to-date on the 787-9 and the 787-8, so that's got to continue. And we got a lot of projects and work. We've got to get those matured, and we got to get them cut in on line numbers. So there's not a lack of, I'll say, focus, and ideas on that areas. But we got to get them matured and get them in, but continuing to execute enough as we have on the productivity. Mix plays a big factor in here. And so our ability with a richer mix of Dash 9s and 10s. And quite frankly, as you see the Dash 9 get entered into the production system as smooth as it is another, I think, indicator of that mix coming together. And keeping in mind, this is all in our backlog. So this is delivering on the backlog, but getting that smooth introduction and having that richer mix of Dash 9s and 10s will obviously grow as you get further out on that cost base and deliver on that backlog. The supply chain, obviously, we've got planned step down and contractual step down, but we've also got initiatives that we're working together across -- in the company and across the supply chain, looking for additional productivity ideas. And keeping in mind, there's only been 300 units built here, roughly. And very steep ramp up and a lot of change in rate break having being stable at 10, and then now making that transition up to 12. This is when you look historically, this is where you been able to capture additional productivity gains. So we're working with the supply-chain on that. And then rate. As you know, we are going up in rate, and it will total about 40% going up to 12 a month in '16, and then 14 a month later in 2019, '20 timeframe. So making good progress in getting up to rate within the supply chain as well as getting the factories ready internally. Again, this is delivering on the backlog and you know the market. And so that support these rate increases very much. But again, that will continue to drive productivity. And then I guess the only comment I'd make on the margins, I'd say, they are similar to what we see today on our widebody programs and what we're achieving. So I'd say good progress to date, a lot of work ahead of us to do teams got good plans in place, but we need to keep executing as we have, and that will be the path going forward."

Yes. Thanks, Howard. Say, yes, just stepping back, and I know there's been a lot of discussion out there about the widebody marketplace and the prospects going forward, so let me paint for you a market outlook there, and then home in on those 2 specific airplanes in particular. But if you take a look at the overall market, we continue to see a growing healthy marketplace. As we've said before, a current market outlook for 38,000 new airplanes over the next 20 years in total. We continue to see strong passenger growth independent assessments again of 6% year-over-year growth throughout the time period. Cargo growth has been more moderated and has been a bit slow to recover, as you know. But we are seeing some recovery signs there. If you take a look at overall market characteristics, we continue to see a strong healthy marketplace, both narrowbodies and widebodies. If you take a look at replacement demand, it continue to be strong. We expect about 40% of those aircraft in that market outlook to be driven by replacement demand. As I said, cancellations and referrals remain below historic levels as well. So the market fundamentals remained strong. Now when we get to the 2 projects you mentioned, on 787, as noted, with 800 aircraft in backlog and a continuing strong market demand, and I think, EVA's decision here just in the last couple of weeks to acquire 24 787-10  is just another good sign of the value that, that product is bringing to the marketplace. The 787 searcher value is delivering value to our customers. The value proposition is clearly a competitive advantage, both in terms of operating cost reduction as well as the advantage in revenue and cargo volume and residual value that it brings to the customers. And with the production efficiencies that we're generating, and we remain very bullish on 787. And as Greg talked about our plans to ramp up to 12 a month and to 14 a month before the end of the decade, all supported by strong market demand and the unique value proposition of that airplane. On the 777, we've been very focused on building up 777 Bridge. We talked about we needed to generate about 40 to 60 orders per year on the current 777 to build that bridge. Year-to-date we've got 44 orders and commitments. So we're continuing to fill out that bridge, in essence. The 777 line is sold out through 2016 more than half sold in 2017, and we continue to it with a number of serious campaigns, all bridging to the 777x. And as you pointed out, the 777x is bringing, again, our unique value proposition to the market. Both today's 777 and the 777x have really no pure competitor in bringing unique value to our customers. And 777x having just completed firm configuration, they've got good solid signs on development programs, being executed on plan and we plan to have EIS on airplane 2020 as scheduled. So in all cases, a strong fundamental market, the right differentiated product line of 787s and 777s. And very mindful right now about building a bridge from the 777 to the 777x."

But if we take a longer term view of what our company can and should be, getting to that mid-teens margin range is an expectation and aspiration that we set for ourselves. And I think that's a smart and aggressive target for the long-term. We're just going to stay very focused on it. As Greg had said, with the backlog that we have and the product line that we have, our opportunity to the generate long-term cash growth and long term margin accretion is very strong.

Obviously, a key topic for us here is as the 777x will begin coming into the production system in the 2018 timeframe, leading to EIS in 2020. As I mentioned earlier, we're building the 777 bridge with today's current product line leveraging the fact that, that airplane does provide a unique value proposition in the marketplace. We're thinking carefully through exactly how we do that transition and the timing of it. As we talked about before, it's important that we do that efficiently. We're trying to pull ahead some of the technology investment in the line like automation and in the fuselage line to derisk that transition. And as I mentioned earlier, we've already implemented that automation here in the 777 line on the fuselage operate build and that's going well. So that's another way to derisk that transition and ensure profitability through it. There's been a lot of conversations out there about exactly what the shape of that transition might be. And we're factoring in market demand, as I said, some uncertainty around cargo recovery. Frankly, some uncertainty around XM bank reauthorization. Those are factors that could cause some customers to delay decisions around widebodies. So we're being mindful of that. We're going to make sure where going to maintain a highly profitable line through the transition. All of those factors are going into our planning right now. Frankly, with that, we don't see any scenarios where we've come down below a 7 a month production rate during the transition. Import again to remind ourselves that 2016 is essentially sold out. 2017 is more than half sold out. So this transition that we're talking about is a 2017 and beyond transition. And through all of that, we're going to drive this in a way that maximizes profitability of the line through the transition, allows us to continue to invest in the future. And my broader comments about continued cash growth and margin accretion over the long-term all account for that 777 transition. So that's all factored into our bigger game plan."

Again, we continue to see book-to-bill of approximately 1 for the end of the year. As I mentioned, some hesitancy right now in the widebody marketplace around cargo recovery and uncertainty with the XM bank. That's causing some customers to pause a bit on decision making, so it's more of a timing issue rather than a volume issue. So we still anticipate book-to-bill to be roughly 1 by the end of the year. Some decisions could slide into the earlier part of the new year. Frankly, with about 5,700 aircraft in backlog, annual book-to-bill ratios are not that important to us. We're continuing to generate orders pipeline. But timing quarter-to-quarter, it happens to shift a bit with that kind of backlog that we have, we remain very confident in the long-term plan. As you mentioned, the recent announcement by our customers in China was very positive for us. We were honored to host President Shea [ph] at our factory in Everett a couple of weeks ago. Amongst the number of agreements that's included in the announcement of around 300 aircraft, 250 narrowbodies and 50 widebodies. Some of those are airplanes that were already in backlog but unidentified. Others are incremental new commitments. And we'll be working through the specific deals on those airplanes with our customers over the next many months, and we'll announce those as they come to fruition.

That will make the transition even smoother. In some cases, we will fire selected blanks down the production line. Then again that will help us smooth out implementation and ensure lean implementation. Note that we'll also add some 777 flight test -- excuse me 777 X flight test aircraft that will flow through the production system in that same timeframe. So all of that will be factored into the production profile in the transition plan. But again as I said, we've looked through all the options and variables what's from a market demand standpoint from a production efficiency standpoint. We don't see any scenarios that would take us below a 7 a month production rate.

At the same time, we remained committed to the dividend to ensure that we're competitive from a dividend perspective as well as investing in the business.

We continue to do studies on possibilities of ramping up beyond that. As I said earlier, we're going to maintain very strict financial discipline as we do those studies, being very mindful about it. We are still in a slightly overbooked position in terms of our order profile for the 737. And all of that just creates general upward pressure to production rates. We're going to be very fiscally responsible us we consider those options. Again, our committed plan and takes this out through 2018. So we have time to consider these alternatives beyond that."

That's one of the things that we factor into our committed plans. We remain very confident that our supply chain can meet our ramp up to 52 a month on the MAX.

That marketplace is some what muted. So expect that business to be relatively flat to slight growth top line in parallel with that, we're continuing to drive bottom line performance. And you saw in the results there with at 12.2% margin quarter and our defense business. So that's our robust, important part of our portfolio. We have differentiated product lines some things like commercial derivatives and TA in the tanker that for me percent us with opportunities for long-term growth and leverage them the Boeing value that,  if you will, across commercial and defense sectors, are continuing to invest in future product lines around human space expiration, satellites, or investing in unmanned systems and ISR capabilities. And importantly, we are investing for some critical franchise programs for the future. You alluded to that, but that programs like Long Range Strike, the new T-X trainer, are important. And one of the reasons we won we continue to drive productivity so we can invest in those future product lines.

The depth of that bridge is most significant in the 2018, 2019 timeframe. So we're very focused on filling that out. And we need about 40 to 60 aircraft per year over that 5 years to fill that bridge. So that effort continues to press ahead. Now when you think about the transition production rate, the fact that we'll fire some selective blanks through the line, that is not a high volume decision to your point. This is something that we'll do selectively as we bring Lean implementation online in the new production rig. We haven't finalized exactly how many that will be. But those will be -- those are incremental, not a sustained activity.

Year-to-date, we have returned nearly $8 billion to shareholders through share repurchase and dividends. This remains a priority under our balanced cash deployment strategy. 
Revenue at Boeing Commercial airplanes increased 10% on record deliveries of our industry-leading product family. During the quarter, we delivered our 325th 787. We began final assembly and achieved power on for the 737 MAX, completed firm configuration on the 777X and successfully concluded final testing and began implementing the advanced automated fuselage production technology on the 777 line, which will improve safety, quality and flow time, and ensure a smooth transition to the 777X. 
Boeing Defense Space and Security grew its top line by 6% on higher revenue at Boeing Military aircraft and Network & Space Systems. Key contract awards during the quarter included an order from India for 22 Apache attack helicopters and 15 Chinook heavy-lift helicopters and a contract from Japan for 5 V-22 tiltrotor aircraft. We also received a contract from the U.S. Navy for 13 additional P-8A Poseidon aircraft. Significant defense program milestones included delivery of the first 2 of 12 EA-18 Growlers to the Royal Australian Air Force and the start of flight testing [ph] KC-46A aerial refueling tanker.  During the last few weeks, we have successfully deployed the tankers refueling boom and its [ph] and wing refueling drogue systems multiple times over a broad range of flight conditions. While more work remains ahead, these early accomplishments represent significant risk reduction and real progress on the flight test program. In summary, we had another strong quarter of operating performance and cash generation. 
With that, let's turn to the business environment on Slide 3. The commercial airplane business environment generally remains healthy, driven by improving airline profitability, solid air passenger traffic and meaningful replacement demand. Air cargo traffic remains a watch item for us, as the gradual market recovery continues amid modest overall global economic growth rates. Airplane order activity and customer discussions are continuing at a moderated but historically healthy pace. Deferral requests and cancellations remain well below the historical average. In the single-aisle segment, demand for our new fuel-efficient 737 MAX remains high with cumulative orders totaling nearly 2,900 airplanes from 58 customers. Given the strong market demand, we continue to see upward pressure on narrowbody production rates, beyond the announced 52 per month in 2018. However, we remained steadfast in our financial discipline as we assess the market demand for further production rate changes. 
During the third quarter, we made the decision to increase the 767 production rate to 2.5 per month starting in 2017, driven by ongoing strong demand for the 767 freighter on top of the existing planned tanker production base. This is a testament to the compelling value proposition that airplane brings to the market. Demand also remained strong for the 777X, with the backlog of 306 aircraft from 6 customers. On the 777, we have 44 orders and commitments year-to-date including the 2 777-300 ERs announced last week for EVA Airways. Our 777 backlog stands at 235 aircraft with production for 2016 essentially sold out and 2017 production more than half sold. With firm configuration of the 777X complete and our manufacturing advancement taking hold, we are now working to finalize the production plan to phase in this new technology. We will also continue to assess 777 supply and demand to maximize airplane profitability over the transition period. 
On the 787 program. EVA's decision last week to also purchase up to 24 787-10 is evidenced of continued strong market demand for the Dreamliner. The 787's backlog of nearly 800 orders fully supports our planned production rate increases to 12 per month in 2016 and 14 per month later this decade. We have now delivered more than 330 787s including more than 50 -9.
Turning to Defense, Space & Security. We continue to see solid support for our major program. Congress has been supportive of the President's fiscal year 2016 DoD and NASA budget request increases to core Boeing programs, including the P-8A Poseidon, the F-18 Super Hornet, Apache and Chinook helicopters, and the NASA's Space Launch System. International demand for our offerings remained strong, particularly in the Middle East and the Asia-Pacific region. 
During the third quarter, international customers for Defense, Space & Security represented 35% of revenue and 40% of our current backlog. The strength of our defense and space business stems from our investments in technology and innovation that have established the portfolio of reliable, proven and affordable products and services. We continue to invest in organic growth areas that are priorities for our customers, such as commercial derivatives, space, unmanned systems, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, and the critical few future franchise programs like long-range strike and the T-X trainer. Teams throughout our company also continue to ensure our long-term competitiveness by driving further safety, quality and productivity gains to improve program profitability and fund investment in future growth. 
In summary, our team is executing on our business strategy by growing revenues, generating solid operating performance and capturing strategic new business. 
Now over to Greg for our financial results and our updated guidance. Greg?"

Third quarter revenue increased 9% to $25.8 billion, driven by record commercial airplane deliveries. Core operating margins of 10.2% reflects solid execution across both businesses. Core earnings per share for the quarter increased 18% to $2.52 reflecting, again, continued strong core operating performance on production programs and within our services businesses. 
Let's now discuss Commercial Airplanes on Slide 5. For the third quarter, Boeing Commercial Airplanes revenue increased 10% to $17.7 billion on a record 199 airplane deliveries. BCA operating margin of 10% reflects strong execution, offset by the impact of higher planned R&D spending and increased 787 deliveries. Commercial Airplanes captured $13 billion of net orders during the third quarter and backlog remains very strong at $426 billion, and nearly 5,700 aircraft equating to more than 7 years of production. Specifically on the 787, we continue to expect the program to be cash positive in the fourth quarter, and we still anticipate the production to decline shortly after we achieve the 12 per month production rate later in 2016. No change to these fundamental milestones. 
We continue to see progress in the key operational performance indicators for the 787 program as we implement additional production efficiencies, while meaningfully increasing 787-9 production. As planned, the 787-9 production rate and deliveries are now outpacing 787-8. This is a testament to the team's detailed advanced planning and day-to-day execution to ensure a smooth transition and ramp-up of the 787-9. 
On the 787-8, we have continued to make progress on unit cost reduction, where we've now seen a decline of approximately 40% over the last 230 deliveries. We've also made further progress in the 787-9, where we now have had more than 30% cost reduction over the first 50 deliveries. Driven by continued cost reductions, a healthy mix of -9s and the benefit of favorable timing on quarterly spending, the 787 deferred production increased $577 million to now a balance of $28.3 billion in the third quarter. We continue to anticipate 787 deferred production growth to further decline in the fourth quarter. We still have work ahead of us on the 787 as we remain focused on the solid day-to-day execution and risk mitigation, while improving the long-term productivity and cash flow going forward. We will continue to manage the smooth ramp-up of the 787-9 production, prepare for the 12 per month introduction and introduce the -10, while again driving efficiencies across all aspects of the program. 
Let's now turn to Slide 6 to discuss Defense, Space & Security results. BDS reported strong results in the quarter with revenue increasing 6% to $8.4 billion and operating margins of 12.2% on strong performance and a favorable delivery mix. Boeing Military Aircraft third quarter revenue increased 15% to $4.1 billion, largely driven by F-15 contract negotiations. Operating margins were 12.2% in the quarter, reflecting higher volumes and strong performance. Network and space revenue increased 5% to $2.1 billion driven by Commercial Crew volume. The segment also generated strong operating margins of 11.5% on favorable mix and productivity improvements. Global services and support revenue declined to $2.2 billion largely driven by timing of deliveries, while operating margins were strong at 12.9%. Defense, Space & Security captured $9 billion of orders during the quarter and reported to solid backlog of $59 billion. 
Let's move to cash flow now on Slide 7. Operating cash flow for the third quarter was strong at $2.9 billion driven by higher volumes and solid operating performance. And with regards to capital deployment, we paid $618 million in dividend and repurchased 11 million shares for $1.5 billion in the third quarter as we continue to deliver on our commitment of returning cash to shareholders. Year-to-date, we have returned $8 billion to shareholders through dividend and repurchased 41 million shares. Again, this reflects our commitment and confidence in the long-term outlook for our business. Returning cash to shareholders, along with continued investments to support future growth, remain a high priority for us. 
Let's now move to cash and debt balances on Slide 8. We ended the quarter with $9.9 billion of cash and marketable securities. Our cash balance continues to provide solid liquidity and positions us well going forward. 
Let's now turn to Slide 9 and I'll discuss our outlook for the balance of 2015. Based on the strong operating performance year-to-date, we've increased our 2015 guidance for revenue, operating margins, core earnings per share and operating cash flow. Core earnings per share guidance for 2015 has increased $0.25 to now be between $7.95 and $8.15 a share on continued solid execution across the business. The company revenue guidance has increased $500 million, now to be between $95 billion and $97 billion on higher commercial airplane deliveries. BCA delivery guidance has increased now 5 airplanes to be from 755 to 760. 
Defense, Space & Security operating margin guidance is increased to approximately 10%, again, reflecting strong operating efficiencies across the business. Operating cash flow has increased to approximately $9.5 billion on improved performance across the company as well as favorable timing of receipts and expenditures. And furthermore, we're lowering our R&D guidance, $100 million to now be $3.4 billion for the year to reflect timing of spending. In the fourth quarter, we expect BCA margins to be impacted by the strong operating performance somewhat offset by delivery mix and higher planned R&D spending on 777X, as well as additional investments in productivity initiatives.
So in summary, we generated solid revenue growth and healthy operating margins while generating significant cash flow. We meaningfully return cash to shareholders and invested in our future. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Dennis for closing comments."

Certainl",492,"Well, Doug, I won't get into the specific program by program margin, but I will give you a sense of kind of I'll say the few areas that are focused on that have been in the past and will be the path forward to continue to drive 787 profitability. Certainly, productivity continuing to come down the learning curve internally. You heard us talk about the progress-to-date on the 787-9 and the 787-8, so that's got to continue. And we got a lot of projects and work. We've got to get those matured and we got to get them cut in on line numbers. So there is not a lack of, I'll say, focus and ideas in that areas. But we got to get them matured and get them in, but continuing to execute as we have on the productivity. Mix plays a big factor in here. And so our ability -- with a richer mix of -9s and 10s, and quite frankly, as you've see the -9 get entered into the production system as smooth as it is another, I think, indicator of that mix coming together. And keeping in mind, this is all in our backlog. So this is delivering on the backlog, but getting that smooth introduction and having that richer mix of-9s and 10s will obviously grow as you get further out on that cost base and deliver on that backlog. The supply chain, obviously, we've got planned step down and contractual step down, but we also got initiatives that we're working together across -- in the company and across the supply chain, looking for additional productivity ideas. And keeping in mind, there's only been 300 units built here, roughly, and on very steep ramp-up and a lot of change in rate break having being stable at 10 and now making that transition up to 12. This is when you look, historically, this is where you've been really been able to capture additional productivity gains. So we're working with the supply-chain on that. And then rate. As you know, we're going up in rate and it will total about 40% going up to 12 a month in '16 and then 14 a month later in 2019 -- '20 time frame. So making good progress on getting up to rate within the supply chain as well as getting the factories readily internally. Again, this is delivering on the backlog and you know the market. And so that supports these rate increases very much. But again, that will continue to drive productivity. And then I guess the only comment I'd make on the margins, I'd say they are similar to what we see today on our widebody programs and what we're achieving. So I'd say good progress to date, a lot of work ahead of us to do, teams got good plans in place, but we need to keep executing as we have and that will be the path going forward."

Yes. Thanks, Howard. Say -- just stepping back, and I know there's been a lot of discussion out there about the widebody marketplace and the prospects going forward, so let me paint for you a market outlook there and then home in on those 2 specific airplanes in particular. But if you take a look at the overall market, we continue to see a growing healthy marketplace. As we've said before, a current market outlook for 38,000 new airplanes over the next 20 years in total. We continue to see strong passenger growth independent assessments again of 6% year-over-year growth throughout the time period. Cargo growth has been more moderated and has been a bit slow to recover, as you know. But we are seeing some recovery signs there. If you take a look at overall market characteristics, we continue to see a strong healthy marketplace, both narrowbodies and widebodies. If you take a look at replacement demand, it continues to be strong. We expect about 40% of those aircraft in that market outlook to be driven by replacement demand. As I said, cancellations and deferrals remain below historic levels as well. So the market fundamentals remained strong. Now when we get to the 2 products you've mentioned, on 787, as noted, with 800 aircraft in backlog and a continuing strong market demand and I think, EVA's decision here just in the last couple of weeks to acquire 24 787-10, is just another good sign of the value that, that product is bringing to the marketplace. The 787 is delivering value to our customers. The value proposition is clearly a competitive advantage, both in terms of operating cost reduction as well as the advantage on revenue and cargo volume, and residual value that it brings to the customers. And with the production efficiencies that we're generating, we remain very bullish on 787. And as Greg talked about our plans to ramp-up to 12 a month and then to 14 a month before the end of the decade, all supported by strong market demand and the unique value proposition of that airplane. On the 777, we've been very focused on building up the 777 bridge. We talked about we needed to generate about 40 to 60 orders per year on the current 777 to build that bridge. Year-to-date we've got 44 orders and commitments. So we're continuing to fill out that bridge. In essence, the 777 line is sold out through 2016 more than half sold in 2017. And we continue it with a number of serious campaigns. They are all bridging to the 777X. And as you pointed out, the 777X is bringing, again, a unique value proposition to the market. Both today's 777 and the 777X have really no pure competitor in bringing unique value to our customers. And 777X, having just completed firm configuration, we have good solid signs on development programs being executed on plan and we plan to have EIS on that airplane 2020 as scheduled. So in all cases, a strong fundamental market. The right differentiated product line of 787s and 777s. And very mindful, right now, about building a bridge from the 777 to the 777X."

And the best sign of that is with the roughly 50 -9s that we delivered. As they're hitting the fleets, they're coming in at a much higher dispatch reliability then the original -8s.

As we've talked about before, we see margin growth in BCA as an important priority for us. You're seeing it in the data and the results that we're producing. The productivity actions that Greg described earlier are all part of doing that, part of it is productivity, efficiency inside our own factories. Another key portion of that is within our supply chain through our Partnering for Success effort. But if we take the longer-term view of what our company can and should be, getting to that mid-teens margin range, is an expectation and aspiration that we've set for ourselves. And I think that's a smart and aggressive target for the long term and we're going to stay very focused on it. As Greg has said, with the backlog that we have and the product line that we have, our opportunity to the generate long-term cash growth and long-term margin accretion is very strong. And we are taking the right productivity actions both internally and externally to do that. And that will result in increased return to our shareholders. And it will allow us to fund and invest in our future innovation and talent. So we are very focused on doing that and remain steadfast on that longer-term target.
Now regarding your question around 777 as we think about that transition. Obviously, a key topic for us here is the 777X will begin coming into the production system in the 2018 time frame, leading to EIS in 2020. As I mentioned earlier, we're building the 777 bridge with today's current product line, leveraging the fact that, that airplane does provide a unique value proposition in the marketplace. We're thinking carefully through exactly how we do that transition and the timing of it. As we've talked about before, it's important that we do that efficiently. We're trying to pull ahead some of the technology investment in the line, like automation in the fuselage line, to derisk that transition. And as I mentioned earlier, we've already implemented that automation here in the 777 line on the fuselage operate build, and that's going well. So that's another way to derisk that transition and ensure profitability through it. There's been a lot of conversations out there about exactly what the shape of that transition might be, and we're factoring in market demand. As I said, some uncertainty around cargo recovery, frankly some uncertainty around Ex-Im Bank reauthorization, those are factors that could cause some customers to delay decisions around widebodies, so we're being mindful of that. We're going to make sure we maintain a highly profitable line through the transition. All of those factors are going into our planning right now. Frankly with that, we don't see any scenarios where we've come down below a 7 a month production rate during the transition. Important again to remind ourselves that 2016 is essentially sold out. 2017 is more than half sold out. So this transition that we're talking about is a 2017-and-beyond transition. And through all of that, we're going to drive this in a way that maximizes profitability of the line through the transition, allows us to continue to invest in the future. And my broader comments about continued cash growth and margin accretion over the long-term all account for that 777 transition. So that's all factored into our bigger game plan."

So regarding book to bill for the year, again, we continue to see book to bill of approximately 1 for the end of the year. As I mentioned, some hesitancy right now in the widebody marketplace around cargo recovery and uncertainty with the Ex-Im Bank. That's causing some customers to pause a bit on decision making, so it's more of a timing issue rather than a volume issue. So we still anticipate book-to-bill to be roughly 1 by the end of the year. Some decisions could slide into the early part of the new year. Frankly, with about 5,700 aircraft in backlog, annual book-to-bill ratios are not that important to us, and we're continuing to generate orders pipeline. But timing quarter-to-quarter, if it happens to shift a bit, with the kind of backlog we have, we remain very confident in the long-term plan. Now as you mentioned, the recent announcement by our customers in China was very positive for us. We were honored to host President Xi at our factory in Everett a couple of weeks ago. Amongst a number of agreements, that included an announcement around 300 aircraft, 250 narrowbodies and 50 widebodies. Some of those are airplanes that were already in backlog but unidentified. Others are incremental new commitments. And we'll be working through the specific deals on those airplanes with our customers over the next many months, and we'll announce those as they come to fruition. But that will generally create upside to our book-to-bill posture for the end of the year. Greg, do you want to take the first part of the question?"

In some cases, we will fire selective blanks down the production line. That again will help us smooth out implementation and ensure Lean implementation. Note that we'll also have some 777 flight test -- excuse me, 777X flight test aircraft that will flow through the production system in that same time frame. So all of that will be factored into the production profile in the transition plan. But again, as I said, we looked through all the options and variables here both from a market demand standpoint, from a production efficiency standpoint. We don't see any scenarios that would take us below a 7 a month production rate, and we're very confident that we can achieve that implementation, remain very profitable on that line while we do it and successfully bring the 777X to the marketplace."

At the same time, we remained committed to the dividend to ensure that we're competitive from a dividend perspective as well as investing in the business.

And then as you move into '16, Seth, as I said, you'll start to see that turn once you hit the 12 month. So the growth will moderate, obviously, into the fourth quarter and then through into '16 until you hit that rate and then that's when we would expect to turn.

What we're seeing from customers in terms of market demand, especially if it's 737 MAX, continues to be positive sign for us. As we've told you, we're at 42 a month now. We're ramping to 47 a month and 52 a month by 2018. Those are committed plans that we have in place. We continue to do studies on possibilities of ramping up beyond that. As I said earlier, we're going to maintain very strict financial discipline as we do those studies, being very mindful about it. We are still in a slightly overbooked position in terms of our order profile for the 737, and all of that just creates general upward pressure to production rates. We're going to be very fiscally responsible as we consider those options. Again, our committed plan takes this out through 2018, so we have time to consider these alternatives beyond that. The other thing that I'd like to factor in is the 737 MAX development, the fact that we've achieved to power on in the first airplane. That final assembly is on or ahead of schedule also gives us confidence in terms of the airplane coming together and being ready for EIS with our customer. So both the development program progress as well as the market demand signals show us that narrowbodies are a very robust market for us both short and near and long term."

Nothing that I would say is out of the ordinary. These are normal ramp-up pressures. And we know how to do these rate ramp ups. We've done more than a dozen over the last few years. We've got a few more important ones ahead of us during the next 5 years. But working across the integrated supply chain and making sure they have the capacity and the capability to deliver on our needs is an important part of the equation. That's one of the things we factor into our committed plans. We remain very confident that our supply chain can meet our ramp up to 52 a month on the MAX. If we were to go beyond that, factoring in supply chain capability is a key component of that decision.

That marketplace is somewhat muted, so we expect that business to be relatively flat to slight growth top line. In parallel with that, we're continuing to drive bottom line performance. And you saw it in the results here with a 12.2% margin quarter in our Defense business. So that's a robust, important part of our portfolio. We have differentiated product lines on things like commercial derivatives, the PA [ph] and the tanker, which presents us with opportunities for longer-term growth and leverage the one Boeing value, if you will, across commercial and defense sectors. We're continuing to invest in future product lines around human space exploration, satellites. We're investing in unmanned systems and ISR capabilities. And importantly, we are investing for some critical franchise programs for the future. You alluded to that, but programs like Long Range Strike, the new T-X trainer are important. And one of the reasons we continue to drive productivity is so we can invest in those future product lines. And we don't see a need to significantly change the structure of our Defense business.

This is something that we'll do selectively as we bring Lean implementation online in the new production rate. We haven't finalized exactly how many that will be, but those are incrementals, not a sustained activity.

It's a unique value proposition for our customers. So values are holding up well in the marketplace. We are mindful that the cargo market has been a bit slow to return. We're mindful of the fact that lack of Ex-Im Bank reauthorization is creating some uncertainty and some delays in customer decisions. And so we're considering that. But if you step back from it, the overall health of the marketplace and the unique value proposition of our airplanes is very clear, and we'll remain confident in that."

After that, Greg will walk you through details of our financial results and outlook. 
With that, lets move to Slide 2. Boeing delivered strong third quarter operating performance with 9% revenue growth, 10.2% core operating margins, 18% growth in core earnings per share and operating cash flow of $2.9 billion. Given our operating performance in the quarter, we are raising 2015 guidance for revenue, core EPS and operating cash flow. This performance and confidence in our long-term outlook continues to support our commitment to return cash to shareholders while also making strategic investments to grow our business. Year-to-date, we have returned nearly $8 billion to shareholders through share repurchase and dividends. This remains a priority under our balanced cash deployment strategy. 
Revenue at Boeing Commercial airplanes increased 10% on record deliveries of our industry-leading product family. During the quarter, we delivered our 325th 787. We began final assembly and achieved power on for the 737 MAX, completed firm configuration on the 777X and successfully concluded final testing and began implementing the advanced automated fuselage production technology on the 777 line, which will improve safety, quality and flow time, and ensure a smooth transition to the 777X. 
Boeing Defense Space and Security grew its top line by 6% on higher revenue at Boeing Military aircraft and Network & Space Systems. Key contract awards during the quarter included an order from India for 22 Apache attack helicopters and 15 Chinook heavy-lift helicopters and a contract from Japan for 5 V-22 tiltrotor aircraft. We also received a contract from the U.S. Navy for 13 additional P-8A Poseidon aircraft. Significant defense program milestones included delivery of the first 2 of 12 EA-18 Growlers to the Royal Australian Air Force and the start of flight testing at the first full op [ph] KC-46A aerial refueling tanker.  During the last few weeks, we have successfully deployed the tankers refueling boom and its center line and wing refueling drogue systems multiple times over a broad range of flight conditions. While more work remains ahead, these early accomplishments represent significant risk reduction and real progress on the flight test program. In summary, we had another strong quarter of operating performance and cash generation. 
With that, let's turn to the business environment on Slide 3. The commercial airplane business environment generally remains healthy, driven by improving airline profitability, solid air passenger traffic and meaningful replacement demand. Air cargo traffic remains a watch item for us, as the gradual market recovery continues amid modest overall global economic growth rates. Airplane order activity and customer discussions are continuing at a moderated but historically healthy pace. Deferral requests and cancellations remain well below the historical average. In the single-aisle segment, demand for our new fuel-efficient 737 MAX remains high with cumulative orders totaling nearly 2,900 airplanes from 58 customers. Given the strong market demand, we continued to see upward pressure on narrowbody production rates, beyond the announced 52 per month in 2018. However, we remained steadfast in our financial discipline as we assess the market demand for further production rate changes. 
During the third quarter, we made the decision to increase the 767 production rate to 2.5 per month starting in 2017, driven by ongoing strong demand for the 767 freighter on top of the existing planned tanker production base. This is a testament to the compelling value proposition that airplane brings to the market. Demand also remained strong for the 777X, with the backlog of 306 aircraft from 6 customers. On the 777, we have 44 orders and commitments year-to-date including the 2 777-300 ERs announced last week for EVA Airways. Our 777 backlog stands at 235 aircraft with production for 2016 essentially sold out and 2017 production more than half sold. With firm configuration of the 777X complete and our manufacturing advancement taking hold, we are now working to finalize the production plan to phase in this new technology. We will also continue to assess 777 supply and demand to maximize airplane profitability over the transition period. 
On the 787 program. EVA's decision last week to also purchase up to 24 787-10 is evidenced of continued strong market demand for the Dreamliner. The 787's backlog of nearly 800 orders fully supports our planned production rate increases to 12 per month in 2016 and 14 per month later this decade. We have now delivered more than 330 787s including more than 50 -9.
Turning to Defense, Space & Security. We continue to see solid support for our major program. Congress has been supportive of the President's fiscal year 2016 DoD and NASA budget request increases to core Boeing programs, including the P-8A Poseidon, the F-18 Super Hornet, Apache and Chinook helicopters, and the NASA's Space Launch System. International demand for our offerings remained strong, particularly in the Middle East and the Asia-Pacific region. 
During the third quarter, international customers for Defense, Space & Security represented 35% of revenue and 40% of our current backlog. The strength of our defense and space business stems from our investments in technology and innovation that have established the portfolio of reliable, proven and affordable products and services. We continue to invest in organic growth areas that are priorities for our customers, such as commercial derivatives, space, unmanned systems, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, and the critical few future franchise programs like long-range strike and the T-X trainer. Teams throughout our company also continue to ensure our long-term competitiveness by driving further safety, quality and productivity gains to improve program profitability and fund investment in future growth. 
In summary, our team is executing on our business strategy by growing revenues, generating solid operating performance and capturing strategic new business. 
Now over to Greg for our financial results and our updated guidance. Greg?"
370857,312108142,880409,"The Boeing Company, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 21, 2015",2015-10-21,"Earnings Calls","The Boeing Company","Executives","Thanks, Dennis. Good morning, everybody.

Third quarter revenue increased 9% to $25.8 billion, driven by record commercial airplane deliveries. Core operating margins of 10.2% reflects solid execution across both businesses. Core earnings per share for the quarter increased 18% to $2.52 reflecting, again, continued strong core operating performance on production programs and within our services businesses. 
Let's now discuss Commercial Airplanes on Slide 5. For the third quarter, Boeing Commercial Airplanes revenue increased 10% to $17.7 billion on a record 199 airplane deliveries. BCA operating margin of 10% reflects strong execution, offset by the impact of higher planned R&D spending and increased 787 deliveries. Commercial Airplanes captured $13 billion of net orders during the third quarter and backlog remains very strong at $426 billion, and nearly 5,700 aircraft equating to more than 7 years of production. Specifically on the 787, we continue to expect the program to be cash positive in the fourth quarter, and we still anticipate the production to decline shortly after we achieve the 12 per month production rate later in 2016. No change to these fundamental milestones. 
We continue to see progress in the key operational performance indicators for the 787 program as we implement additional production efficiencies, while meaningfully increasing 787-9 production. As planned, the 787-9 production rate and deliveries are now outpacing 787-8. This is a testament to the team's detailed advanced planning and day-to-day execution to ensure a smooth transition and ramp-up of the 787-9. 
On the 787-8, we have continued to make progress on unit cost reduction, where we've now seen a decline of approximately 40% over the last 230 deliveries. We've also made further progress in the 787-9, where we now have had more than 30% cost reduction over the first 50 deliveries. Driven by continued cost reductions, a healthy mix of -9s and the benefit of favorable timing on quarterly spending, the 787 deferred production increased $577 million to now a balance of $28.3 billion in the third quarter. We continue to anticipate 787 deferred production growth to further decline in the fourth quarter. We still have work ahead of us on the 787 as we remain focused on the solid day-to-day execution and risk mitigation, while improving the long-term productivity and cash flow going forward. We will continue to manage the smooth ramp-up of the 787-9 production, prepare for the 12 per month introduction and introduce the -10, while again driving efficiencies across all aspects of the program. 
Let's now turn to Slide 6 to discuss Defense, Space & Security results. BDS reported strong results in the quarter with revenue increasing 6% to $8.4 billion and operating margins of 12.2% on strong performance and a favorable delivery mix. Boeing Military Aircraft third quarter revenue increased 15% to $4.1 billion, largely driven by F-15 contract negotiations. Operating margins were 12.2% in the quarter, reflecting higher volumes and strong performance. Network and space revenue increased 5% to $2.1 billion driven by Commercial Crew volume. The segment also generated strong operating margins of 11.5% on favorable mix and productivity improvements. Global services and support revenue declined to $2.2 billion largely driven by timing of deliveries, while operating margins were strong at 12.9%. Defense, Space & Security captured $9 billion of orders during the quarter and reported to solid backlog of $59 billion. 
Let's move to cash flow now on Slide 7. Operating cash flow for the third quarter was strong at $2.9 billion driven by higher volumes and solid operating performance. And with regards to capital deployment, we paid $618 million in dividend and repurchased 11 million shares for $1.5 billion in the third quarter as we continue to deliver on our commitment of returning cash to shareholders. Year-to-date, we have returned $8 billion to shareholders through dividend and repurchased 41 million shares. Again, this reflects our commitment and confidence in the long-term outlook for our business. Returning cash to shareholders, along with continued investments to support future growth, remain a high priority for us. 
Let's now move to cash and debt balances on Slide 8. We ended the quarter with $9.9 billion of cash and marketable securities. Our cash balance continues to provide solid liquidity and positions us well going forward. 
Let's now turn to Slide 9 and I'll discuss our outlook for the balance of 2015. Based on the strong operating performance year-to-date, we've increased our 2015 guidance for revenue, operating margins, core earnings per share and operating cash flow. Core earnings per share guidance for 2015 has increased $0.25 to now be between $7.95 and $8.15 a share on continued solid execution across the business. The company revenue guidance has increased $500 million, now to be between $95 billion and $97 billion on higher commercial airplane deliveries. BCA delivery guidance has increased now 5 airplanes to be from 755 to 760. 
Defense, Space & Security operating margin guidance is increased to approximately 10%, again, reflecting strong operating efficiencies across the business. Operating cash flow has increased to approximately $9.5 billion on improved performance across the company as well as favorable timing of receipts and expenditures. And furthermore, we're lowering our R&D guidance, $100 million to now be $3.4 billion for the year to reflect timing of spending. In the fourth quarter, we expect BCA margins to be impacted by the strong operating performance somewhat offset by delivery mix and higher planned R&D spending on 777X, as well as additional investments in productivity initiatives.
So in summary, we generated solid revenue growth and healthy operating margins while generating significant cash flow. We meaningfully return cash to shareholders and invested in our future. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Dennis for closing comments."

Certainly, productivity continuing to come down the learning curve internally. You heard us talk about the progress-to-date on the 787-9 and the 787-8, so that's got to continue. And we got a lot of projects and work. We've got to get those matured and we got to get them cut in on line numbers. So there is not a lack of, I'll say, focus and ideas in that areas. But we got to get them matured and get them in, but continuing to execute as we have on the productivity. Mix plays a big factor in here. And so our ability -- with a richer mix of -9s and 10s, and quite frankly, as you've see the -9 get entered into the production system as smooth as it is another, I think, indicator of that mix coming together. And keeping in mind, this is all in our backlog. So this is delivering on the backlog, but getting that smooth introduction and having that richer mix of-9s and 10s will obviously grow as you get further out on that cost base and deliver on that backlog. The supply chain, obviously, we've got planned step down and contractual step down, but we also got initiatives that we're working together across -- in the company and across the supply chain, looking for additional productivity ideas. And keeping in mind, there's only been 300 units built here, roughly, and on very steep ramp-up and a lot of change in rate break having being stable at 10 and now making that transition up to 12. This is when you look, historically, this is where you've been really been able to capture additional productivity gains. So we're working with the supply-chain on that. And then rate. As you know, we're going up in rate and it will total about 40% going up to 12 a month in '16 and then 14 a month later in 2019 -- '20 time frame. So making good progress on getting up to rate within the supply chain as well as getting the factories ready internally. Again, this is delivering on the backlog and you know the market. And so that supports these rate increases very much. But again, that will continue to drive productivity. And then I guess the only comment I'd make on the margins, I'd say they are similar to what we see today on our widebody programs and what we're achieving. So I'd say good progress to date, a lot of work ahead of us to do, teams got good plans in place, but we need to keep executing as we have and that will be the path going forward."

Yes. Thanks, Howard. Say -- just stepping back, and I know there's been a lot of discussion out there about the widebody marketplace and the prospects going forward, so let me paint for you a market outlook there and then hone in on those 2 specific airplanes in particular. But if you take a look at the overall market, we continue to see a growing healthy marketplace. As we've said before, a current market outlook for 38,000 new airplanes over the next 20 years in total. We continue to see strong passenger growth independent assessments again of 6% year-over-year growth throughout the time period. Cargo growth has been more moderated and has been a bit slow to recover, as you know. But we are seeing some recovery signs there. If you take a look at overall market characteristics, we continue to see a strong healthy marketplace, both narrowbodies and widebodies. If you take a look at replacement demand, it continues to be strong. We expect about 40% of those aircraft in that market outlook to be driven by replacement demand. As I said, cancellations and deferrals remain below historic levels as well. So the market fundamentals remained strong. Now when we get to the 2 products you've mentioned, on 787, as noted, with 800 aircraft in backlog and a continuing strong market demand and I think, EVA's decision here just in the last couple of weeks to acquire 24 787-10, is just another good sign of the value that, that product is bringing to the marketplace. The 787 is delivering value for our customers. The value proposition is clearly a competitive advantage, both in terms of operating cost reduction as well as the advantage on revenue and cargo volume, and residual value that it brings to the customers. And with the production efficiencies that we're generating, we remain very bullish on 787. And as Greg talked about our plans to ramp-up to 12 a month and then to 14 a month before the end of the decade, all supported by strong market demand and the unique value proposition of that airplane. On the 777, we've been very focused on building up the 777 bridge. We talked about we needed to generate about 40 to 60 orders per year on the current 777 to build that bridge. Year-to-date we've got 44 orders and commitments. So we're continuing to fill out that bridge. In essence, the 777 line is sold out through 2016 more than half sold in 2017. And we continue it with a number of serious campaigns. They are all bridging to the 777X. And as you pointed out, the 777X is bringing, again, a unique value proposition to the market. Both today's 777 and the 777X have really no pure competitor in bringing unique value to our customers. And 777X, having just completed firm configuration, we have good solid signs on development programs being executed on plan and we plan to have EIS on that airplane 2020 as scheduled. So in all cases, a strong fundamental market. The right differentiated product line, both 787s and 777s. And very mindful, right now, about building a bridge from the 777 to the 777X."

We are pleased with the progress there. That said, more work to go. So we're not done and we're going to continue to drive dispatch reliability there for our customers until we achieve the objectives that we have. So more work to go. I will say that reliability improvements that we've delivered to date in the field and then it back driven into the production line, are really taking hold. And the best sign of that is with the roughly 50 -9s that we delivered. As they're hitting the fleets, they're coming in at a much higher dispatch reliability then the original -8s. So it's just further proof that the investments were making our delivering value for our customers. And we're going to stay very focused to getting to the finish line there."

As we've talked about before, we see margin growth in BCA as an important priority for us. You're seeing it in the data and the results that we're producing. The productivity actions that Greg described earlier are all part of doing that, part of it is productivity, efficiency inside our own factories. Another key portion of that is within our supply chain through our Partnering for Success effort. But if we take the longer-term view of what our company can and should be, getting to that mid-teens margin range, is an expectation and aspiration that we've set for ourselves. And I think that's a smart and aggressive target for the long term and we're going to stay very focused on it. As Greg has said, with the backlog that we have and the product line that we have, our opportunity to the generate long-term cash growth and long-term margin accretion is very strong. And we are taking the right productivity actions both internally and externally to do that. And that will result in increased return to our shareholders. And it will allow us to fund and invest in our future innovation and talent. So we are very focused on doing that and remain steadfast on that longer-term target.
Now regarding your question around 777 as we think about that transition. Obviously, a key topic for us here as the 777X will begin coming into the production system in the 2018 time frame, leading to EIS in 2020. As I mentioned earlier, we're building the 777 bridge with today's current product line, leveraging the fact that, that airplane does provide a unique value proposition in the marketplace. We're thinking carefully through exactly how we do that transition and the timing of it. As we've talked about before, it's important that we do that efficiently. We're trying to pull ahead some of the technology investment in the line, like automation in the fuselage line, to derisk that transition. And as I mentioned earlier, we've already implemented that automation here in the 777 line on the fuselage upright build, and that's going well. So that's another way to derisk that transition and ensure profitability through it. There's been a lot of conversations out there about exactly what the shape of that transition might be, and we're factoring in market demand. As I said, some uncertainty around cargo recovery, frankly some uncertainty around Ex-Im Bank reauthorization, those are factors that could cause some customers to delay decisions around widebodies, so we're being mindful of that. We want to make sure we maintain a highly profitable line through the transition. All of those factors are going into our planning right now. Frankly with that, we don't see any scenarios where we've come down below a 7 a month production rate during the transition. Important again to remind ourselves that 2016 is essentially sold out. 2017 is more than half sold out. So this transition that we're talking about is a 2017-and-beyond transition. And through all of that, we're going to drive this in a way that maximizes profitability of the line through the transition, allows us to continue to invest in the future. And my broader comments about continued cash growth and margin accretion over the long-term all account for that 777 transition. So that's all factored into our bigger game plan."

So regarding book to bill for the year, again, we continue to see book to bill of approximately 1 for the end of the year. As I mentioned, some hesitancy right now in the widebody marketplace around cargo recovery and uncertainty with the Ex-Im Bank. That's causing some customers to pause a bit on decision making, so it's more of a timing issue rather than a volume issue. So we still anticipate book-to-bill to be roughly 1 by the end of the year. Some decisions could slide into the early part of the new year. Frankly, with about 5,700 aircraft in backlog, annual book-to-bill ratios are not that important to us, and we're continuing to generate orders pipeline. But timing quarter-to-quarter, if it happens to shift a bit, with the kind of backlog we have, we remain very confident in the long-term plan. Now as you mentioned, the recent announcement by our customers in China was very positive for us. We were honored to host President Xi at our factory in Everett a couple of weeks ago. Amongst a number of agreements, that included an announcement around 300 aircraft, 250 narrowbodies and 50 widebodies. Some of those are airplanes that were already in backlog but unidentified. Others are incremental new commitments. And we'll be working through the specific deals on those airplanes with our customers over the next many months, and we'll announce those as they come to fruition. But that will generally create upside to our book-to-bill posture for the end of the year. Greg, do you want to take the first part of the question?"

In some cases, we will fire selected blanks down the production line. That again will help us smooth out implementation and ensure Lean implementation. Note that we'll also have some 777 flight test -- excuse me, 777X flight test aircraft that will flow through the production system in that same time frame. So all of that will be factored into the production profile in the transition plan.

And then as you move into '16, Seth, as I said, you'll start to see that turn once you hit the 12 a month. So the growth will moderate, obviously, into the fourth quarter and then through into '16 until you hit that rate and then that's when we would expect it to turn.

What we're seeing from customers in terms of market demand, especially if it's 737 MAX, continues to be positive sign for us. As we've told you, we're at 42 a month now. We're ramping to 47 a month and 52 a month by 2018. Those are committed plans that we have in place. We continue to do studies on possibilities of ramping up beyond that. As I said earlier, we're going to maintain very strict financial discipline as we do those studies, being very mindful about it. We are still in a slightly overbooked position in terms of our order profile for the 737, and all of that just creates general upward pressure to production rates. We're going to be very fiscally responsible as we consider those options. Again, our committed plan takes this out through 2018, so we have time to consider these alternatives beyond that. The other thing that I'd like to factor in is the 737 MAX development, the fact that we've achieved to power on in the first airplane. That final assembly is on or ahead of schedule also gives us confidence in terms of the airplane coming together and being ready for EIS with our customer. So both the development program progress as well as the market demand signals show us that narrowbodies are a very robust market for us both short and near -- and long term."

Nothing that I would say is out of the ordinary. These are normal ramp-up pressures. And we know how to do these rate ramp ups. We've done more than a dozen over the last few years. We've got a few more important ones ahead of us during the next 5 years. But working across the integrated supply chain and making sure they have the capacity and the capability to deliver on our needs is an important part of the equation. That's one of the things we factor into our committed plans. We remain very confident that our supply chain can meet our ramp up to 52 a month on the MAX. If we were to go beyond that, factoring in supply chain capability is a key component of that decision.

Specific timing implementation is yet to be finalized. We're working our way through those details. Those will be decisions we'll have to make in the first part of next year. But I'll stress again that we are sold out essentially through 2016, more than half sold out through 2017.

But our Defense business overall is a healthy portfolio. We like the program structures we have. We're growing internationally, and we're investing for the long run. That marketplace is somewhat muted, so we expect that business to be relatively flat to slight growth top line. In parallel with that, we're continuing to drive bottom line performance. And you saw it in the results here with a 12.2% margin quarter in our Defense business. So that's a robust, important part of our portfolio. We have differentiated product lines on things like commercial derivatives, the P-8 and the tanker, which presents us with opportunities for longer-term growth and leverage the one Boeing value, if you will, across commercial and defense sectors. We're continuing to invest in future product lines around human space exploration, satellites. We're investing in unmanned systems and ISR capabilities. And importantly, we are investing for some critical franchise programs for the future. You alluded to that, but programs like Long Range Strike, the new T-X trainer are important. And one of the reasons we continue to drive productivity is so we can invest in those future product lines. And we don't see a need to significantly change the structure of our Defense business. We're going to stay very focused on executing the business, investing organically. And where we can make targeted acquisitions to round out our portfolio, we'll continue to do that."

This is something that we'll do selectively as we bring Lean implementation online in the new production rate. We haven't finalized exactly how many that will be, but those are incrementals, not a sustained activity.

So those are all the key items, I'll say contributors to that. But the funnel of milestones in the profile, that has not changed from what we've discussed probably 1.5 years ago."

We continue to see a very healthy overall marketplace, both narrowbodies and widebodies. As I said, traffic growth is sustained. Replacement demand is sustained. Deferrals, cancellations below historic levels. We recognize some of the comments that have come out recently and we'll be referencing the note around a $10 million 777s that might be available. I'll say just based on our understanding of the marketplace and what we understand from our customers, that number's of the wrong order of magnitude. And frankly, the value of the 777 is holding up very well in the marketplace. It is a unique airplane. In that 365-seat category, there is no competing aircraft out there. It's a unique value proposition for our customers. So values are holding up well in the marketplace. We are mindful that the cargo market has been a bit slow to return. We're mindful of the fact that lack of Ex-Im Bank reauthorization is creating some uncertainty and some delays in customer decisions. And so we're considering that. But if you step back from it, the overall health of the marketplace and the unique value proposition of our airplanes is very clear, and we remain confident in that."
