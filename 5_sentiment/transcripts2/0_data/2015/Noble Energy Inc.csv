I'll start out with a few highlights of Noble Energy's fourth quarter before focusing on our finance for 2015. From an execution perspective, it was an excellent quarter, where we delivered significant growth in our U.S. onshore programs and progressed a number of deepwater development projects towards start up. Sales volumes averaged a record 315,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, a 14% increase versus the fourth quarter of 2013 after adjusting for asset sales. Highlighting our performance was our U.S. onshore horizontal volumes up more than 50%. We ended the year with total proved reserves of 1.4 billion barrels of oil equivalent as production and noncore asset sales were offset by additions and revisions in our core areas. Over 90% of the reserve editions came from the execution of our low risk U.S. onshore program with the remaining coming from the Gulf of Mexico. We replaced 200% of our production in the U.S., even with pud bookings reflecting future growing activity based on the current price environment. 
On the financial side of the business, we remain highly focused on maintaining substantial liquidity, protecting our balance sheet and sustaining our investment grade rating. Late in 2014, we've proactively issued $1.5 billion in long-term notes at record low coupons for Noble, and ended the year with $5.2 billion in liquidity, including $1.2 billion in cash and $4 billion on our undrawn credit facility. Over the last 3 years, we've been very active in generating cash flow to the business through portfolio optimization, realizing over $2 billion in after-tax proceeds from noncore asset sales and our CONE MLP IPO. And I think it's important to mention that, looking forward, we will continue to seek additional ways to protect our financial strength and flexibility and monetize assets that we feel are undervalued. 
We've been very proactive in our hedging for 2015, with approximately 70% of global crude oil and 48% of U.S. natural gas hedged at attractive prices. Our Israel gas is also acting as a great natural hedge, an important contributor to our cash flow during the year, highlighting the benefits of our diverse portfolio. Obviously, everyone is focused on how the energy landscape has changed in the past several months. I believe the combination of our high-quality assets, deep drilling inventory, strong balance sheet and fiscal discipline have us well positioned, not only for the current year, but for the long-term as well. The key to our success and forward focus remains diversification, which has proven to be a competitive advantage in volatile markets. Our portfolio of opportunities around the world is well-balanced between liquids and domestic and international gas, includes thousands of drillable locations in 2 top-tier U.S. unconventional plays, both of which are well positioned on the industry cost of supply curve. These assets are essentially held by existing productions so we're not restricted in our ability to ramp up or down when appropriate. Offshore, our assets do not require large amounts of maintenance capital, that contributes significant cash flow to the business and provide running room for future growth. This combination of assets gives us a tremendous amount of optionality in how we allocate capital and manage risks. 
As we look at the uncertainty surrounding commodity prices and service costs, it is clear that now is not the time to push near-term production growth. The rapid decline in commodity prices has caused industry margins and project economics to be squeezed. With commodity prices at depressed levels, cost must find a new equilibrium with product prices before we resume investing for significant growth. The depth and duration of the current commodity cycle is unknown. So we believe starting 2015, with the capital budget of $2.9 billion, allows us to retain our financial strength and flexibility for an extended period of time. This program aligns us with the investment environment and cash flow, and we continue to be very disciplined in capital allocation and focused on cost management. 
We're intensely scrutinizing our cost and have already captured significant cost savings and reductions from our service providers. While these are primarily focused on achieving immediate cost reductions, we're also looking at the opportunity to implement some structural cost the changes that will have a long-term impact on margins and the efficiency of our business. 
Now let's walk through some of the details of our 2015 program. We've talked previously with many of you about the capital optionality in our portfolio, including the U.S. onshore program, major projects spendings and exploration as our primary levers in the allocation process. This year's program allocates approximately 60% of our CapEx to our core U.S. onshore and about 35% towards development of our offshore sanction major projects, which deliver substantial cash flows and value to the business. Exploration is set at around 5% of the budgets, although we're still testing a couple of varied material prospects that we're excited about. 
In the DJ Basin, we're coming off a year in which we delivered about 30% growth in our horizontal volumes and further advanced our understanding of the value upside from long laterals, downspacing and enhanced completion techniques. We're currently running a 4 rig program and have focused our activity in the Wells Ranch and East Pony development areas where we can drill a higher percentage of long laterals and can optimize the use of existing infrastructure. Total capital allocation to the basins this year is around $900 million. 
In 2015, we will continue to evaluate well performance from our 2014 downspacing test to assess incremental value in the basins above our standard 16-well-per-section development plan. We now have a high density test across all of our development areas, with early performance meeting and in certain areas, outperforming expectations. We're not anticipating a one-size-fits-all downspace program across our acreage. Additional production data collected this year will help fine-tune our understanding of high density spacing and ultimate recovery throughout the season. Early indications from downspacing continue to suggest that there's a huge price for us in the DJ. 
Our capital budget assumes a $4 million average well cost for standard length in Wells Ranch and East Pony which is down meaningfully from prior years. This has been achieved through supplier price reductions, use of existing infrastructure and sustainable efficiency improvements, much of which has already been captured to date. Our teams have been on the forefront of testing multiple completion methods in the DJ, and we continue to see evidence that our sliding sleeve design is the best value.  In 2015, we will continue to modify this design for optimal stage length and fluid type, both of which have the potential to reduce well cost even further. 
Another factor driving efficiency enhancement in our program is the ability to drill extended-reach laterals, which continue to deliver higher recovery and lower well cost per lateral foot. Approximately 50% of our 2015 wells will be extended reach. Overall, the program lateral length will average 6,500 feet per well, a 20% increase over last year. These are all components a very competitive, unconventional liquids play, and the economics, even at today's prices, remain very attractive, with before tax rates of return of approximately 40% and payout in under 2 years. We expect third-party infrastructure to improve in 2015. Beginning with the start up of the 70 Ranch Compressor Station, which commenced in the first quarter of this year. While  Lucerne-2 plant and Rocky Compressor Stations are progressing for start up in the second quarter providing necessary expansion of infrastructure in the northern Greater Wattenberg Area. In addition, we have recently committed to a third-party low-pressure gathering loop in Greater Wattenberg, which will have a positive impact to the overall operation of the field as early as the beginning of next year. 
On the operated side, we continue to build out our infrastructure in the basin and we'll investigate strategic opportunities to monetize these assets. In the Marcellus, total capital for 2015 is currently planned at $900 million with about 15% of the amount for midstream infrastructure. We're continuing to work with our partner on the optimal investment or 2015. This is not the time to be accelerating gas production, therefore, we have reduced Noble operated activity in the Marcellus to 2 rigs, while retaining the ability to accelerate drilling should that make sense for the future market. 
Performance in the Marcellus shows that this is a world-class asset. This being even further enhance with the completion such as reduced stage and cost for spacing. The RSCS design continues to outperform standard completion by approximately 30% on our operated wells, and we will continue to increase our use of this design in our 2015 program. Recently, gross daily production from the joint venture reached 1 billion cubic feet equivalent per day, with a major contributor growth in 2014 being down the wet Noble operated volume. 
As mentioned earlier, we're completing our sanctioned oil projects in the Gulf of Mexico. Our estimated Gulf of Mexico development budget is $600 million with 3 new fields to come on in the for next 15 months. The lineup of production includes Big Bend start up in fourth quarter; Dentler, which has moved up to around the end of 2015; followed by Gunflint by mid-2016. While these project don't have a meaningful impact on 2015 average production, they're certainly big contributors to our year-end and 2016 liquids rate. 
We're currently finishing completion operations of the Dentler #2 well and expect all drilling and completion operations in the Rio Grande area to be finished by mid-March. Remaining 2015 investment is focused on subsea pipeline installation at Big Ben and Dantzler, and drilling and completions operations at Gunflint. 
In West Africa, the majority of the development capital will be directed to the Alba compression project in Equatorial Guinea, which will create additional value by lowering decline and extending the life of the field. We plan to resume exploration in West Africa with the Cheetah prospect offshore Cameroon. Cheetah is an oil prospect with a 47% working interest targeting over 100 million barrels of gross resources and representing Noble's first cretaceous test in the Duala basin. 
Moving to the Eastern Mediterranean. Tool continues to perform exceptionally well, both from the reservoir and facility standpoint. These high demand and de-bottlenecking of the facilities has resulted recent record production days in excess of 1 billion cubic feet of natural gas and gross sales. 
I want to spend a couple of minutes discussing the regulatory environment in Israel. For over 15 years, we've been working with the government and people of Israel to explore for develop and produce natural gas. Our success has delivered substantial volume in Israel in terms of reduced fuel and electricity costs as well as new energy security. Early last year, Noble Energy, its partners and the Israel and antitrust authority reached an agreement for the consent decree that included the divestiture of the word gas fields in an effort to support competition of supply and move forward the development of word. The recent decision by the antitrust authority did not submit the agreed consent decree for final approval with a direct reversal of their prior agreement and another example of the uncertain regulatory environment in Israel. Now as a consequence, we have suspended essentially all investment in Israel, except for our Ashdod compression project which is nearly complete. Resolution of antitrust manner, along with progress on a number of additional regulatory matters, is required before we can proceed with significant further investment in Israel's energy sector. A predictable and stable regulatory environment is critical requirement in decisions related to major energy development projects. We continue to have discussions with the government in an effort to establish the regulatory framework necessary to progress development of these world class resources. While no agreement has been reached to date, we remain committed to finding appropriate and workable solutions. However, we're also prepared to vigorously defend our right related to our assets in Israel. 
It's worth remembering that Israel's only been producing gas for just over a decade. The discoveries of the giant and fields provide opportunity for substantial regional exports, which is changing the energy landscape of the Eastern Mediterranean. We're excited to be leading the way as further expansion of Tamar and initial development of LeVitus have the potential to material -- materially expand energy, economic and environmental benefits to Israel and the region. 
We were able to sign multiple LOIs for regional export in 2015. The most recent of these was an LOI with a customer in Egypt to supply interruptible volumes from Tamar. The terms of the LOI include up to 250 million cubic feet per day with pricing equivalent to other export LOIs that we signed. It's an opportunity that can have a near-term impact, requires very little capital and will provide relief from gas shortages in Egypt. We have not assumed any of these potential sales in our base guidance but are hopeful to commence exports this year, pending government approvals. 
To wrap up the Eastern Mediterranean, we continue to progress plans for development in Cyprus with our discovery there providing another option to meet growing regional demand. 
Our exploration investments this year company-wide will be about 5% of total planned expenditures. Lower than past years given the environment. While the budget is reduced, the program will test and underexplored area in the Falklands Island with multibillion barrel potential as well as our large prospect in Cameroon. We will use 2015 as an opportunity to further strengthen and enhance our exploration portfolio. I am confident that our best-in-class process and talented employees will continue to deliver exploration projects that will be a key contributor to the long-term growth of Noble Energy. 
As I mentioned earlier, now is not the time to be pushing near-term production growth. We have scaled our capital program back and expect modest growth of approximately 5% from 2014 driven primarily in the U.S. onshore business as well as Israel. In the U.S. onshore, we expect meaningful growth with more than 5% growth in the DJ Basin and 40% plus in the Marcellus. Natural gas sales from Tamar and Israel are expected to rise 10% or so year-over-year. Volumes are anticipated to be down about 10,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day year-on-year in West Africa, with approximately half of this amount being attributed to natural just field decline and the remaining from plant turnarounds. In the Gulf of Mexico, we anticipate flat to modest declines through the year until the Big Bend start up in the fourth quarter. While quarter-to-quarter volumes for us can vary quite a bit, contribution from our Gulf of Mexico development project sets us up well for 2016. In fact, excluding whatever Israel investment turns out to be, we can maintain an even slightly growth 2016 volumes at even lower capital levels than this year. It is this portfolio and diversity of projects that provides Noble a differential advantage going forward. 
For the first quarter of 2015, we expect sales volumes to range from 305,000 million to 315,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with the primary variance from the fourth quarter of last year being the timing of liquid listings and planned facility downtime in West Africa. Our U.S. onshore business post the DJ Basin and the Marcellus are anticipated to show growth, with Deepwater in Israel relatively flat. Due to uncertainty of the depths or duration of the present cycle, we believe the prudent approach to 2015 is to manage the spend more closely to cash flows. While this plan provides us with a more modest growth rate than we previously projected, our actions will continue to be focused on ensuring that we exit the current cycle with substantial operating and financial strength that will allow us to either resume a more accelerated pace of activity or pursue other opportunities that may arise. I believe this strategy is the appropriate course of action in a volatile market. Our U.S. onshore development, major project execution and exploration capabilities have us uniquely positioned to differentially outperform over the coming years. Now Melanie, at this time, I would like to go ahead and open the call for questions."

I'll start out with a few highlights of Noble Energy's fourth quarter before focusing on our plans for 2015.

I'll start out with a few highlights of Noble Energy's fourth quarter before focusing on our plans for 2015. From an execution perspective, it was an excellent quarter, where we delivered significant growth in our U.S. onshore programs and progressed a number of deepwater development projects towards start up. Sales volumes averaged a record 315,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, a 14% increase versus the fourth quarter of 2013 after adjusting for asset sales. Highlighting our performance was our U.S. onshore horizontal volumes, up more than 50%. 
We ended the year with total proved reserves of 1.4 billion barrels of oil equivalent as production and non-core asset sales were offset by additions and revisions in our core areas. Over 90% of the reserve editions came from the execution of our low-risk U.S. onshore program, with the remaining coming from the Gulf of Mexico. We replaced 200% of our production in the U.S., even with pud bookings reflecting future drilling activity based on the current price environment. 
On the financial side of the business, we remain highly focused on maintaining substantial liquidity, protecting our balance sheet and sustaining our investment-grade rating. Late in 2014, we proactively issued $1.5 billion in long-term notes at record low coupons for Noble, and ended the year with $5.2 billion in liquidity, including $1.2 billion in cash and $4 billion on our undrawn credit facility. Over the last 3 years, we've been very active in generating cash flow to the business through portfolio optimization, realizing over $2 billion in after-tax proceeds from non-core asset sales and our CONE MLP IPO. And I think it's important to mention that looking forward, we will continue to seek additional ways to protect our financial strength and flexibility and monetize assets that we feel are undervalued. 
We've been very proactive in our hedging for 2015, with approximately 70% of global crude oil and 48% of U.S. natural gas hedged at attractive prices. Our Israel gas is also acting as a great natural hedge, an important contributor to our cash flow during the year, highlighting the benefits of our diverse portfolio. Obviously, everyone is focused on how the energy landscape has changed in the past several months. I believe the combination of our high-quality assets, deep drilling inventory, strong balance sheet and fiscal discipline have us well positioned, not only for the current year, but for the long-term as well. A key to our success and forward focus remains diversification, which has proven to be a competitive advantage in volatile markets. 
Our portfolio of opportunities around the world is well-balanced between liquids and domestic and international gas. It includes thousands of drillable locations and 2 top-tier U.S. unconventional plays, both of which are well positioned on the industry cost of supply curve. These assets are essentially held by existing productions, so we're not restricted in our ability to ramp up or down when appropriate. Offshore, our assets do not require large amounts of maintenance capital, but contributes significant cash flow to the business and provide running room for future growth. This combination of assets gives us a tremendous amount of optionality in how we allocate capital and manage risk.
As we look at the uncertainty surrounding commodity prices and service costs, it is clear that now is not the time to push near-term production growth. The rapid decline in commodity prices has caused industry margins and project economics to be squeezed. With commodity prices at depressed levels, cost must find a new equilibrium with product prices before we resume investing for significant growth. The depth and duration of the current commodity cycle is unknown. So we believe starting 2015 with a capital budget of $2.9 billion, allows us to retain our financial strength and flexibility for an extended period of time. This program aligns us with the investment environment and cash flow, and we continue to be very disciplined in capital allocation and focused on cost management.
We're intensely scrutinizing our cost and have already captured significant cost savings and reductions from our service providers. While these are primarily focused on achieving immediate cost reductions, we're also looking at the opportunity to implement some structural cost changes that will have a long-term impact on margins and the efficiency of our business. 
Now let's walk through some of the details of our 2015 program. We've talked previously with many of you about the capital optionality in our portfolio, including the U.S. onshore program, major project spending and exploration is our primary levers in the allocation process. This year's program allocates approximately 60% of our CapEx to our core U.S. onshore and about 35% toward development of our offshore sanction major projects, which deliver substantial cash flows and value to the business. Exploration is set at around 5% of the budget, although we're still testing a couple of very material prospects that we're excited about. 
In the DJ Basin, we're coming off a year in which we delivered about 30% growth in our horizontal volumes and further advanced our understanding of the value upside from long laterals, downspacing and enhanced completion techniques. We're currently running a 4-rig program and have focused our activity in the Wells Ranch and East Pony development areas, where we can drill a higher percentage of long laterals and can optimize the use of existing infrastructure. Total capital allocation to the basin this year is around $900 million. 
In 2015, we will continue to evaluate well performance from our 2014 downspacing test to assess incremental value in the basin above our standard 16-well-per-section development plan. We now have high-density test across all of our development areas, with early performance meeting and in certain areas, outperforming expectations. We're not anticipating a one-size-fits-all downspace program across our acreage. Additional production data collected this year will help fine-tune our understanding of high-density spacing and ultimate recovery throughout the basin. Early indications from downspacing continue to suggest there's a huge price for us in the DJ. 
Our capital budget assumes a $4 million average well cost for standard length in Wells Ranch and East Pony, which is down meaningfully from prior years. This is being achieved through supplier price reductions, use of existing infrastructure and sustainable efficiency improvements, much of which has already been captured to date. Our teams have been on the forefront of testing multiple completion methods in the DJ, and we continue to see evidence that our sliding sleeve design is the best value. In 2015, we will continue to modify this design for optimal stage length and fluid type, both of which have the potential to reduce well cost even further. 
Another factor driving efficiency enhancement in our program is the ability to drill extended-reach laterals, which continue to deliver higher recovery and lower well cost per lateral foot. Approximately 50% of our 2015 wells will be extended reach. Overall, the program lateral length will average 6,500 feet per well, a 20% increase over last year. These are all components of a very competitive, unconventional liquids play, and the economics, even at today's prices, remain very attractive, with before tax rates of return of approximately 40% and payout in under 2 years. We expect third-party infrastructure to improve in 2015. Beginning with the start up of the 70 Ranch Compressor Station, which commenced in the first quarter of this year. While  Lucerne II plant and Rockies and Trout Compressor Stations are progressing for start up in the second quarter, providing necessary expansion of infrastructure in the northern greater Wattenberg area. In addition, we have recently committed to a third-party low-pressure gathering loop in greater Wattenberg, which will have a positive impact to the overall operation of the field as early as the beginning of next year. 
On the operated side, we continue to build out our infrastructure in the basin and we'll investigate strategic opportunities to monetize these assets. In the Marcellus, total capital for 2015 was currently planned at $900 million, with about 15% of the amount for midstream infrastructure. We're continuing to work with our partner on the optimal investment for 2015. This is not the time to be accelerating gas production, therefore, we have reduced Noble-operated activity in the Marcellus to 2 rigs, while retaining the ability to accelerate drilling, should that make sense in the future market. 
Performance in the Marcellus shows that it is a world-class asset, and is being even further enhanced with completion such as reduced stage and cost for spacing. The RSCS design continues to outperform standard completion by approximately 30% on our operated wells, and we will continue to increase our use of this design in our 2015 program. Recently, gross daily production from the joint venture reached 1 billion cubic feet equivalent per day, with a major contributor growth in 2014 being the wet Noble operated volumes. 
As mentioned earlier, we're completing our sanctioned oil projects in the Gulf of Mexico. Our estimated Gulf of Mexico development budget is $600 million with 3 new fields to come on in the for next 15 months. The lineup of production includes Big Bend start up in fourth quarter; Dantzler, which has moved up to around the end of 2015; followed by Gunflint by mid-2016. While these projects don't have a meaningful impact on 2015 average production, they are certainly big contributors to our year-end and 2016 liquids rate. 
We're currently finishing completion operations of the Dantzler #2 well and expect all drilling and completion operations in the Rio Grande area to be finished by mid-March. Remaining 2015 investment is focused on subsea pipeline installation at Big Bend and Dantzler, and drilling and completions operations at Gunflint. 
In West Africa, the majority of the development capital will be directed to the Alba compression project in Equatorial Guinea, which will create additional value by lowering decline and extending the life of the field. We plan to resume exploration in West Africa with the Cheetah prospect offshore Cameroon. Cheetah is an oil prospect with a 47% working interest, targeting over 100 million barrels of gross resources and representing Noble's first cretaceous test in the Douala Basin. 
Moving to the Eastern Mediterranean. Tamar continues to perform exceptionally well, both from the reservoir and facility standpoint. These merely high demand and de-bottlenecking of the facilities has resulted recent record production days in excess of 1 billion cubic feet of natural gas and gross sales. 
I want to spend a couple of minutes discussing the regulatory environment in Israel. For over 15 years, we've been working with the government and people of Israel to explore for develop and produce natural gas. Our success has delivered substantial value to Israel in terms of reduced fuel and electricity costs as well as new energy security. Early last year, Noble Energy, its partners and the Israel Antitrust Authority reached an agreement for the consent decree that included the divestiture of the Tanin and Karish gas fields in an effort to support competition of supply and move forward the development of Leviathan. The recent decision by the Antitrust Authority did not submit the agreed consent decree for final approval, with a direct reversal of their prior agreement and another example of the uncertain regulatory environment in Israel. Now as a consequence, we have suspended essentially all investment in Israel, except for our Ashdod compression project, which is nearly complete. Resolution of the antitrust matter, along with progress on a number of additional regulatory matters, is required before we can proceed with significant further investment in Israel's energy sector. 
A predictable and stable regulatory environment is critical requirement in decisions related to major energy development projects. We continue to have discussions with the government in an effort to establish the regulatory framework necessary to progress development of these world class resources. While no agreement has been reached to date, we remain committed to finding appropriate and workable solutions. However, we are also prepared to vigorously defend our rights related to our assets in Israel.
It's worth remembering that Israel's only been producing gas for just over a decade. The discoveries of the giant Tamar and Leviathan fields provide the opportunity for the substantial regional exports, which is changing the energy landscape of the Eastern Mediterranean. We're excited to be leading the way as further expansion of Tamar and initial development of Leviathan have the potential to material expand -- materially expand energy, economic and environmental benefits to Israel and the region. 
We were able to sign multiple LOIs for regional export in 2014. The most recent of these was an LOI with a customer in Egypt to supply interruptible volumes from Tamar. The terms of the LOI include up to 250 million cubic feet per day, with pricing equivalent to other export LOIs that we signed. It's an opportunity that can have near-term impact, requires very little capital and would provide relief from gas shortages in Egypt. We have not assumed any of these potential sales in our base guidance, but are hopeful to commence exports this year, pending government approvals. To wrap up the Eastern Mediterranean, we continue to progress plans for development in Cyprus with our discovery there providing another option to meet growing regional demand. 
Our exploration investments this year, company-wide, will be about 5% of total planned expenditures, lower than past years given the environment. While the budget is reduced, the program will test an underexplored area in the Falkland Islands, with multibillion barrel potential, as well as our large prospect in Cameroon. We will use 2015 as an opportunity to further strengthen and enhance our exploration portfolio. I am confident that our best-in-class process and talented employees will continue to deliver exploration projects that will be a key contributor to the long-term growth of Noble Energy.
As I mentioned earlier, now is not the time to be pushing near-term production growth. We have scaled our capital program back and expect modest growth of approximately 5% from 2014 driven primarily in the U.S. onshore business as well as Israel. In the U.S. onshore, we expect meaningful growth with more than 5% growth in the DJ Basin and 40%-plus in the Marcellus. Natural gas sales from Tamar and Israel are expected to rise 10% or so year-over-year. 
Volumes are anticipated to be down about 10,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day year-on-year in West Africa, with approximately half of this amount being attributed to natural field decline and the remaining from plant turnarounds. In the Gulf of Mexico, we anticipate flat to modest declines through the year until the Big Bend start up in the fourth quarter. While quarter-to-quarter volumes for us can vary quite a bit, contribution from our Gulf of Mexico development project sets us up well for 2016. In fact, excluding whatever Israel investment turns out to be, we can maintain and even slightly growth 2016 volumes at even lower capital levels than this year. It is this portfolio and diversity of projects that provides Noble a differential advantage going forward. 
For the first quarter of 2015, we expect sales volumes to range from 305,000 to 315,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with the primary variance from the fourth quarter of last year being the timing of liquid liftings and planned facility downtime in West Africa. Our U.S. onshore business, post the DJ Basin and the Marcellus are anticipated to show growth, with Deepwater in Israel relatively flat. Due to uncertainty as to the depth or duration of the present cycle, we believe the prudent approach to 2015 is to manage the spend more closely to cash flows. While this plan provides us with a more modest growth rate than we previously projected, our actions will continue to be focused on ensuring that we exit the current cycle with substantial operating and financial strength that will allow us to either resume a more accelerated pace of activity or pursue other opportunities that may arise. 
I believe this strategy is the appropriate course of action in a volatile market. Our U.S. onshore development, major project execution and exploration capabilities have us uniquely positioned to differentially outperform over the coming years. Melanie, at this time, we'd like to go ahead and open the call for questions."

I think when you think about it from an Israel piece, the next big booking there will be with either some expansion at Tamar or the sanctioning of Leviathan.

I think -- so where we are, and I think we were surprised, I think a lot of people over there were surprised with the reversal in that decision. And the thing that we're focused on now and what that's highlighted is the need to put together a comprehensive framework to provide some regulatory certainty and stability going forward, to make the investment decisions. I mean, when you go back to the discussions with the antitrust commission and where we had gotten to last year, we essentially agreed to and thought everybody had agreed to the resolution to that competition was selling Karish and Tanin. When you think about that, Karish and Tanin in total, is about 3x the size of what Mari-B was. And Mari-B produced about 600 million a day for a number of years. So we thought that was a pretty good solution at the time. So right now, what have entered into the equation is a discussion now of, ""Okay, so how do we move forward on this?"" The good part of it is, that it's brought the ministries together to even better understand the situation and better understand even the importance of resolving this and resolving this quickly for the betterment of Israel and actually the whole region over there."

I'll start out with a few highlights of Noble Energy's fourth quarter before focusing on our plans for 2015. From an execution perspective, it was an excellent quarter, where we delivered significant growth in ou",2703,"Thanks, David, and good morning, everyone. I'll start out with a few highlights of Noble Energy's fourth quarter before focusing on our plans for 2015. From an execution perspective, it was an excellent quarter, where we delivered significant growth in our U.S. onshore programs and progressed a number of deepwater development projects towards start up. Sales volumes averaged a record 315,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, a 14% increase versus the fourth quarter of 2013 after adjusting for asset sales. Highlighting our performance was our U.S. onshore horizontal volumes, up more than 50%. 
We ended the year with total proved reserves of 1.4 billion barrels of oil equivalent as production and non-core asset sales were offset by additions and revisions in our core areas. Over 90% of the reserve editions came from the execution of our low-risk U.S. onshore program, with the remaining coming from the Gulf of Mexico. We replaced 200% of our production in the U.S., even with pud bookings reflecting future drilling activity based on the current price environment. 
On the financial side of the business, we remain highly focused on maintaining substantial liquidity, protecting our balance sheet and sustaining our investment-grade rating. Late in 2014, we proactively issued $1.5 billion in long-term notes at record low coupons for Noble, and ended the year with $5.2 billion in liquidity, including $1.2 billion in cash and $4 billion on our undrawn credit facility. Over the last 3 years, we've been very active in generating cash flow to the business through portfolio optimization, realizing over $2 billion in after-tax proceeds from non-core asset sales and our CONE MLP IPO. And I think it's important to mention that, looking forward, we will continue to seek additional ways to protect our financial strength and flexibility and monetize assets that we feel are undervalued. 
We've been very proactive in our hedging for 2015, with approximately 70% of global crude oil and 48% of U.S. natural gas hedged at attractive prices. Our Israel gas is also acting as a great natural hedge, an important contributor to our cash flow during the year, highlighting the benefits of our diverse portfolio. Obviously, everyone is focused on how the energy landscape has changed in the past several months. I believe the combination of our high-quality assets, deep drilling inventory, strong balance sheet and fiscal discipline have us well positioned, not only for the current year, but for the long-term as well. A key to our success and forward focus remains diversification, which has proven to be a competitive advantage in volatile markets. 
Our portfolio of opportunities around the world is well-balanced between liquids and domestic and international gas. It includes thousands of drillable locations and 2 top-tier U.S. unconventional plays, both of which are well positioned on the industry cost of supply curve. These assets are essentially held by existing production, so we're not restricted in our ability to ramp up or down when appropriate. Offshore, our assets do not require large amounts of maintenance capital, but contributes significant cash flow to the business and provide running room for future growth. This combination of assets gives us a tremendous amount of optionality in how we allocate capital and manage risk.
As we look at the uncertainty surrounding commodity prices and service costs, it is clear that now is not the time to push near-term production growth. The rapid decline in commodity prices has caused industry margins and project economics to be squeezed. With commodity prices at depressed levels, costs must find a new equilibrium with product prices before we resume investing for significant growth. The depth and duration of the current commodity cycle is unknown. So we believe starting 2015 with a capital budget of $2.9 billion allows us to retain our financial strength and flexibility for an extended period of time. This program aligns us with the investment environment and cash flow, and we continue to be very disciplined in capital allocation and focused on cost management.
We're intensely scrutinizing our costs and have already captured significant cost savings and reductions from our service providers. While these are primarily focused on achieving immediate cost reductions, we're also looking at the opportunity to implement some structural cost changes that will have a long-term impact on margins and the efficiency of our business. 
Now let's walk through some of the details of our 2015 program. We've talked previously with many of you about the capital optionality in our portfolio, including the U.S. onshore program, major project spending and exploration as our primary levers in the allocation process. This year's program allocates approximately 60% of our CapEx to our core U.S. onshore and about 35% toward development of our offshore sanctioned major projects, which deliver substantial cash flows and value to the business. Exploration is set at around 5% of the budget, although we're still testing a couple of very material prospects that we're excited about. 
In the DJ Basin, we're coming off a year in which we delivered about 30% growth in our horizontal volumes and further advanced our understanding of the value upside from long laterals, downspacing and enhanced completion techniques. We're currently running a 4-rig program and have focused our activity in the Wells Ranch and East Pony development areas, where we can drill a higher percentage of long laterals and can optimize the use of existing infrastructure. Total capital allocation to the basin this year is around $900 million. 
In 2015, we will continue to evaluate well performance from our 2014 downspacing tests to assess incremental value in the basin above our standard 16-well-per-section development plan. We now have high-density tests across all of our development areas, with early performance meeting and, in certain areas, outperforming expectations. We're not anticipating a one-size-fits-all downspace program across our acreage. Additional production data collected this year will help fine-tune our understanding of high-density spacing and ultimate recovery throughout the basin. Early indications from downspacing continue to suggest there's a huge prize for us in the DJ. 
Our capital budget assumes a $4 million average well cost for a standard length lateral in Wells Ranch and East Pony, which is down meaningfully from prior years. This is being achieved through supplier price reductions, use of existing infrastructure and sustainable efficiency improvements, much of which has already been captured to date. Our teams have been on the forefront of testing multiple completion methods in the DJ, and we continue to see evidence that our sliding sleeve design is the best value. In 2015, we will continue to modify this design for optimal stage length and fluid type, both of which have the potential to reduce well cost even further. 
Another factor driving efficiency enhancement of our program is the ability to drill extended-reach laterals, which continue to deliver higher recovery and lower well cost per lateral foot. Approximately 50% of our 2015 wells will be extended reach. Overall, the program lateral length will average 6,500 feet per well, a 20% increase over last year. These are all components of a very competitive, unconventional liquids play, and the economics, even at today's prices, remain very attractive, with before-tax rates of return of approximately 40% and payout in under 2 years. We expect third-party infrastructure to improve in 2015. Beginning with the start-up of the 70 Ranch Compressor Station, which commenced in the first quarter of this year. The Lucerne II plant and Rocky's and Trout Compressor Stations are progressing for start-up in the second quarter, providing necessary expansion of infrastructure in the northern greater Wattenberg area. In addition, we have recently committed to a third-party low-pressure gathering loop in greater Wattenberg, which will have a positive impact to the overall operation of the field as early as the beginning of next year. 
On the operated side, we continue to build out our infrastructure in the basin and we'll investigate strategic opportunities to monetize these assets. In the Marcellus, total capital for 2015 was currently planned at $900 million, with about 15% of the amount for midstream infrastructure. We're continuing to work with our partner on the optimal investment for 2015. This is not the time to be accelerating gas production, therefore, we have reduced Noble-operated activity in the Marcellus to 2 rigs, while retaining the ability to accelerate drilling, should that make sense in the future market. 
Performance in the Marcellus shows that it is a world-class asset, and is being even further enhanced with completions such as reduced-stage and cluster spacing. The RSCS design continues to outperform standard completion by approximately 30% on our operated wells, and we will continue to increase our use of this design in our 2015 program. Recently, gross daily production from the joint venture reached 1 billion cubic feet equivalent per day, with a major contributor to growth in 2014 being the wet Noble operated volumes. 
As mentioned earlier, we're completing our sanctioned oil projects in the Gulf of Mexico. Our estimated Gulf of Mexico development budget is $600 million with 3 new fields to come on in the next 15 months. The lineup of production includes Big Bend start up in fourth quarter; Dantzler, which has moved up to around the end of 2015; followed by Gunflint by mid-2016. While these projects don't have a meaningful impact on 2015 average production, they are certainly big contributors to our year-end and 2016 liquids rate. 
We're currently finishing completion operations at the Dantzler #2 well and expect all drilling and completion operations in the Rio Grande area to be finished by mid-March. Remaining 2015 investment is focused on subsea pipeline installation at Big Bend and Dantzler, and drilling and completions operations at Gunflint. 
In West Africa, the majority of the development capital will be directed to the Alba compression project in Equatorial Guinea, which will create additional value by lowering decline and extending the life of the field. We plan to resume exploration in West Africa with the Cheetah prospect offshore Cameroon. Cheetah is an oil prospect with a 47% working interest, targeting over 100 million barrels of gross resources and representing Noble's first cretaceous test in the Douala Basin. 
Moving to the Eastern Mediterranean. Tamar continues to perform exceptionally well, both from the reservoir and facility standpoint. Seasonally high demand and de-bottlenecking of the facilities has resulted in recent record production days in excess of 1 billion cubic feet of natural gas and gross sales. 
I want to spend a couple of minutes discussing the regulatory environment in Israel. For over 15 years, we've been working with the government and people of Israel to explore for, develop and produce natural gas. Our success has delivered substantial value to Israel in terms of reduced fuel and electricity costs as well as new energy security. Early last year, Noble Energy, its partners and the Israel Antitrust Authority reached an agreement for the consent decree that included the divestiture of the Tanin and Karish gas fields in an effort to support competition of supply and move forward the development of Leviathan. The recent decision by the Antitrust Authority to not submit the agreed consent decree for final approval, was a direct reversal of their prior agreement and another example of the uncertain regulatory environment in Israel. Now as a consequence, we have suspended essentially all investment in Israel, except for our Ashdod compression project, which is nearly complete. Resolution of the antitrust matter, along with progress on a number of additional regulatory matters, is required before we can proceed with significant further investment in Israel's energy sector. 
A predictable and stable regulatory environment is critical requirement in decisions related to major energy development projects. We continue to have discussions with the government in an effort to establish the regulatory framework necessary to progress development of these world class resources. While no agreement has been reached to date, we remain committed to finding appropriate and workable solutions. However, we are also prepared to vigorously defend our rights related to our assets in Israel.
It's worth remembering that Israel's only been producing gas for just over a decade. The discoveries of the giant Tamar and Leviathan fields provide the opportunity for the substantial regional exports, which is changing the energy landscape of the Eastern Mediterranean. We're excited to be leading the way as further expansion of Tamar and initial development of Leviathan have the potential to material expand -- materially expand energy, economic and environmental benefits to Israel and the region. 
We were able to sign multiple LOIs for regional export in 2014. The most recent of these was an LOI with a customer in Egypt to supply interruptible volumes from Tamar. The terms of the LOI include up to 250 million cubic feet per day, with pricing equivalent to other export LOIs that we signed. It's an opportunity that can have near-term impact, requires very little capital and would provide relief from gas shortages in Egypt. We have not assumed any of these potential sales in our base guidance, but are hopeful to commence exports this year, pending government approvals. To wrap up the Eastern Mediterranean, we continue to progress plans for development in Cyprus, with our discovery there providing another option to meet growing regional demand. 
Our exploration investments this year, company-wide, will be about 5% of total planned expenditures, lower than past years given the environment. While the budget is reduced, the program will test an underexplored area in the Falkland Islands, with multibillion barrel potential, as well as our large prospect in Cameroon. We will use 2015 as an opportunity to further strengthen and enhance our exploration portfolio. I am confident that our best-in-class process and talented employees will continue to deliver exploration projects that will be a key contributor to the long-term growth of Noble Energy.
As I mentioned earlier, now is not the time to be pushing near-term production growth. We have scaled our capital program back and expect modest growth of approximately 5% from 2014 driven primarily in the U.S. onshore business as well as Israel. In the U.S. onshore, we expect meaningful growth with more than 5% growth in the DJ Basin and 40%-plus in the Marcellus. Natural gas sales from Tamar and Israel are expected to rise 10% or so year-over-year. 
Volumes are anticipated to be down about 10,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day year-on-year in West Africa, with approximately half of this amount being attributed to natural field decline and the remaining from plant turnarounds. In the Gulf of Mexico, we anticipate flat to modest declines through the year until the Big Bend start up in the fourth quarter. While quarter-to-quarter volumes for us can vary quite a bit, contribution from our Gulf of Mexico development project sets us up well for 2016. In fact, excluding whatever Israel investment turns out to be, we can maintain and even slightly grow 2016 volumes at even lower capital levels than this year. It is this portfolio and diversity of projects that provides Noble a differential advantage going forward. 
For the first quarter of 2015, we expect sales volumes to range from 305,000 to 315,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with the primary variance from the fourth quarter of last year being the timing of liquid liftings and planned facility downtime in West Africa. Our U.S. onshore business, both the DJ Basin and the Marcellus, are anticipated to show growth, with Deepwater in Israel relatively flat. Due to uncertainty as to the depth or duration of the present cycle, we believe the prudent approach to 2015 is to manage the spend more closely to cash flows. While this plan provides us with a more modest growth rate than we previously projected, our actions will continue to be focused on ensuring that we exit the current cycle with substantial operating and financial strength that will allow us to either resume a more accelerated pace of activity or pursue other opportunities that may arise. 
I believe this strategy is the appropriate course of action in a volatile market. Our U.S. onshore development, major project execution and exploration capabilities have us uniquely positioned to differentially outperform over the coming years. Melanie, at this time, we'd like to go ahead and open the call for questions."

When we've talked about the IDPs and what we've implemented, we kind of started with Wells Ranch and then we've been moving towards East Pony. So hand-in-hand with that is where we're going to concentrate this year's activity. So I think we have the ability to be pretty flexible. I think we've got the ability to adapt either way pretty quickly. I think -- in this environment, we probably won't do as much front-end loading of facility capital right now. I think what it does is probably move us back just slightly on when we will see some of these other IDP, bigger facility, capital come in place. But I think it is a great time to benefit from this facility infrastructure that we've put in place and that we've already built. I think we're going to capture some tremendous benefits of that as we match our drilling program to where we have this facility infrastructure in place this year."

I think -- so where we are, and I think we were surprised, I think a lot of people over there were surprised with the reversal in that decision. And the thing that we're focused on now and what that's highlighted is the need to put together a comprehensive framework to provide some regulatory certainty and stability going forward, to make the investment decisions. I mean, when you go back to the discussions with the antitrust commission and where we had gotten to last year, we essentially agreed to, and thought everybody had agreed to, the resolution to that competition was selling Karish and Tanin. When you think about that, Karish and Tanin in total, is about 3x the size of what Mari-B was. And Mari-B produced about 600 million a day for a number of years. So we thought that was a pretty good solution at the time. So right now, what they have entered into the equation is a discussion now of, ""Okay, so how do we move forward on this?"" The good part of it is, that it's brought the ministries together to even better understand the situation and better understand even the importance of resolving this and resolving this quickly for the betterment of Israel and actually the whole region over there."

I think starting to project beyond that is going to depend on where you start to ramp up, especially your onshore programs. What I will say when you go back to that 5-year outlook, no, none of the resources in there have changed, at least, to the downside. If anything, what we've learned through our drilling programs it continues to put upward pressure on that. So the nice thing is the resources there.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'm extremely pleased with how Noble Energy has performed in the early part of 2015. This is highlighted by our production, which has been very strong across the board. And whil",2182,"Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'm extremely pleased with how Noble Energy has performed in the early part of 2015. This is highlighted by our production, which has been very strong across the board. And while still early, we're confident enough to raise our full year volume outlook. Our successes also include improving capital efficiency and reducing operating costs. And results so far this year are right where we expect it, if not a little better. Another major accomplishment was gaining alignment with our partner in the Marcellus to reduce our activity levels. And in the DJ Basin, strong results and continued operational efficiencies are driving additional capital allocation in the second half of the year.
Starting off with sales volumes. We sold a record 318,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the first quarter, an increase of 17% over the same period last year after adjusting for asset sales. Full year sales are now expected to average between 300,000 and 315,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, as we have raised the bottom end of our range by 5,000 barrels equivalent per day. The up -- this update range now reflects the first quarter our performance while maintaining our prior expectations for remaining quarters of the year.
Compared to the first quarter of last year, core U.S. onshore sales volumes increased more than 35%, driven by record production in both the DJ Basin and Marcellus Shale. Horizontal production in these 2 plays were up in combined 60% versus the same time period. 
Offshore, including the Gulf of Mexico and our international businesses, volumes were relatively flat with the first quarter of last year after adjusting for asset sales. Our offshore assets continue to perform very well with world-class runtime and lower-than-expected decline rate. 
Highlighting this performance is nearly 100% runtime at both Tamar offshore Israel and Aseng in Equatorial Guinea. As the combination of these high-quality, low-cost asset and managing a diversified portfolio that continues to provide Noble competitive advantage, our U.S. onshore development, major project execution and exploration activities provide material resource opportunities and tremendous investment optionality.
As mentioned earlier, we have made substantial progress towards lowering both our capital and operating cost. We've worked closely with our suppliers to achieve an average of 20% savings, the most prominently in our U.S. onshore business. Our suppliers have moved quickly to assist in adjusting our cost structure, and we continue to work with them in partnership to ensure these early achievements are turned into sustainable cost improvements.
Highlighting our production cost reduction was lease operating expense, which is already down $0.50 per barrel from the fourth quarter, a material change in such a short period of time and putting us on track to meet our full year average expectation. 
General and administrative costs are down from previous quarters as well. We've also recently completed an organizational realignment, which better positions our workforce for this current environment.
Capital expenditures for the quarter were a little over $900 million, slightly below our internal expectations and trending lower as we move through the year. Total capital for 2015 remains $2.9 billion, with $1.8 billion allocated to the onshore U.S. business. The DJ Basin has increased to more than 60% of the onshore U.S. amount, with Marcellus now representing slightly less than 40%.
Focusing on our DJ operations. Growth in the first quarter exhibited our strong operating capacity. Total volumes were a record 116,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up 22% versus the first quarter last year. Growth in the horizontal program was even more impressive, up more than 50% over the last year and more than 110% the last 2 years.
Slide 4 highlights continued drilling efficiencies being delivered by our teams. And as you can see, we're now averaging 7 days from spud to rig release for standard lateral length well, almost as fast as we use to drill vertical wells. In fact, we recently drilled a 9,300-foot horizontal well in Wells Ranch in just 7 days.
Compared to last year, we're drilling 70% of the total footage while utilizing 40% of the rig count. This is a result of our focus on drilling execution, utilizing the best rigs and cruise in the basin, and continuing to increase our average lateral lengths per well.
Reduced drilling times are resulting in an increased number of wells that can be completed this year. And we're reallocating some capital here to keep up with a drilling pace supplementing our one full-time completion crew with a second completion crew in the second half of the year. These efficiencies along supplier cost reductions are driving a downward trend in our well cost. Based on today's drilling completion costs, we're already meeting our budgeted well cost expectations for the year. 
We have highlighted on Slide 5 a $3.8 million Wells Ranch well. Our overall cost reductions from 2014 include 5% to 15% sustainable cost savings from continuing to reduce drilling times and optimizing equipment usage and a range of 15% to 25% savings from our major suppliers. It is worth noting that the these well costs are all in and include items that just pad construction and associated facilities cost.
And we have opportunities continue to drive cost down further. Using slick water for fracs in certain parts of the basin may allow us to save an additional $100,000 to $200,000 per well on a standardized lateral. We recently brought online 11 wells in East Pony that were completed with slick water, and these wells are performing at/or above expectations.
Third-party infrastructure uptime improved at the start of the year, and I am pleased with the progress of the expansion projects that are currently underway. 
The Lucerne-2 plant and additional compressor stations are on track for start-up in late second quarter, providing a material increase in processing and compression capacity on the DCP system. The grand parkway low-pressure loop has been approved and is expected to start-up by the end of the year, which will have a positive impact on the performance of legacy vertical wells and earlier horizontal wells.
Operating performance in the Marcellus Shale remains exceptional as well and our production grew 73% versus the first quarter of last year to nearly 400 million cubic feet equivalent per day. Similar to the DJ Basin, we're seeing substantial reduction in drilling times and lower well cost through a combination of utilizing top full rigs, drilling longer laterals and supplier cost reductions.
Improvements in drilling times have resulted in a larger inventory of uncompleted wells than we had originally anticipated in both the operated and non-operated the areas of the Marcellus. This affords us the opportunity to reduce rig count in the second half of the year to 1 operated rig and 2 non-operated rigs while still meeting our plant completion and production goals. Overall, this is a $200 million net reduction to our prior Marcellus expectations.
We continue to diversify our natural gas markets and recently began transporting approximately 100 million cubic feet per day of gas out of the basin, including our first sales in the Gulf Coast market. This firm transportation has a relatively low overall cost and gives us further access to better price markets.
Moving offshore. We achieved a number of key milestones on our major projects in the Gulf of Mexico during the first quarter. At Rio Grande, all drilling and completion operations are now complete and pipeline installation is scheduled to begin in the second quarter. Rio Grande remains on schedule for first production in the fourth quarter. Development drilling operations at Gunflint are underway and are expected to continue throughout the remainder of 2015. Pipeline installation will commence following the Rio Grande installation and first production from Gunflint remains on schedule for mid-2016.
Our Gulf of Mexico projects highlight the benefits of our diverse portfolio by providing strong oil growth exiting 2015 with another step up in 2016. The cash margins for these projects are very competitive with the U.S. onshore resource place, evident by nearly all of the production being oil and priced at a premium to WTI, combined with attractive production cost.
Moving to the Eastern Mediterranean. To mark continues to exhibit exceptional reliability and set new milestones for delivery, achieving a net record weekly grow sales average of over 1 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day, driven by seasonal demand and coal plant maintenance. A recently signed agreement to supply interruptible sales of up to 250 million cubic feet per day gross from Tamar to Egypt's domestic market is another example of the strongly general demand for our natural gas. We and our customer are now working to finalize regulatory approvals and transportation agreements needed to start sales. We believe these can be included in the next few months, setting us up for initial sales of later 2015 by utilizing existing infrastructure. Once we have those approvals, we will provide an outlook for sales and adjust our production guidance at that time.
During the first quarter, we received regulatory approval for export sales to the Arab Potash Company and Jordan Bromine Company in Jordan. While relatively small volumes, this does represent the first formally approved regional export of natural gas from Israel and sets forward a path for additional agreements to follow. 
Meanwhile, we continue to work very intently to establish a comprehensive framework for energy development. Our teams are meeting regularly with the interministerial group established by the Prime Minister's office for this purpose, and we are encouraged by their efforts to create a sustainable climate for energy development in Israel. 
Early progress has been made, and we look forward to working with the new government. Resolution about standing regulatory matters, including antitrust concerns and export taxation, along with a comprehensive framework for energy development, is still necessary to enable additional project development. We believe the interministerial working group is on track to achieve this objective over the next few months following the seating of the new government.
In Cyprus, we're working closely with the government and plan to submit a preliminary field development plan in the near future. Our Cyprus discovery can be another important contributor toward meeting regional gas demand. We've begun export marketing activities and are greatly encouraged by the local of interest expressed by potential counterparties, not only for gas purchases, but also regarding participating in export infrastructure investment.
Also within our offshore business, you can certainly feel the exploration excitement around our office as we're nearing a very impactful 2015 drilling program. 
In West Africa, we recently signed a rig contract for the Cheetah exploration prospect in Cameroon and expect this low-cost well to spud earlier in the third quarter. Cheetah represents our first test in the developed basin and has a main resource size in excess of 100 million barrels of oil equivalent gross. A sizable discovery at Cheetah will deliver very attractive development in less than 100 feet of water depth where we can move very quickly to first production.
By the end of the second quarter, we anticipate commencing drilling offshore to Falkland Islands where we plan to drill 2 exploration wells this year. Our first prospect, Humpback, which we operate with a 35% as a gross main resource size of over 250 million barrels of oil. If successful, Humpback with de-risk other large prospect shown on Slide 10 that have cumulative growth resource potential in excess of 1 billion barrels of oil.
We recently formed into the Rhea prospect also with 250 million barrels of oil potential, which will be our second exploration well in the Falkland Islands. Adding the Rhea opportunity further diversifies our exploration inventory and enhances our overall chance of success as it offsets other oil discoveries in the basin. The prospect is anticipated the spud by year-end. We operate Rhea and currently have a 75% working interest.
Let me now provide some insight into our volume profile throughout the year. As mentioned earlier, we've not made any production guidance changes to the remaining quarters. Second quarter sales volumes are anticipated to range between 290,000 and 300,000 barrels of oil per day, impacted by the plant facility maintenance and turnarounds in West Africa and the Gulf of Mexico, along with the usual seasonal demand softness for Israel volumes. 
For their sales are expected to build in the second half of the year with strong seasonal demand in Israel in the third quarter followed by new oil volumes from the start-up of our major projects in the Gulf of Mexico in the fourth quarter. Our diversified portfolio is setting us up to exit 2015 on a nice trajectory. 
So in summary, we're off to a strong start this year. Performance and volumes, capital efficiency and costs is where we expect it, if not a little better -- not a little bit better at this point. And we're on a path approaching cash flow neutrality around midyear as we anticipated.
So Joshua, this time, we'd like to go ahead and open the call to questions."

And as Dave mentioned, while we average to 7 days for normal in collaterals in first quarter in DJ, wells are drilled 9,300-foot well in 7 days. And we also drilled a long length lateral well in 5 days in East Pony. So that gives us confidence that they're still more improvement 2 come and that's where we'll be taking over the next quarters."

And what is enabling us to do is to bring more wells ready for -- more wells drilled by the end of year more wells rate complete by the end of the year, which I think will give us some very nice momentum as we exit this year and look towards 2016.

So I think one thing worth noting and I think we had it in the notes, but when we talk drilling complete numbers, whether it's the $3.8 million on the side or the $3.4 million that we've done since then, that really is an all-in cost that includes all the pad cost that's allocated to the wells, new facilities allocated to the wells, as well as when we get into areas where there's vertical legacy wells, if any prep work needs to be done on those, that gets allocated back to the wells. So that truly is an all-in costs. I think hitting the $3.4 million in April says a lot about our ability to continue to drive it down, especially as we continue to drive drilling times down to those 5 the records I mentioned on a long length collateral and 7 days on a long length lateral. But the cost savings really coming across the board. It's coming in drilling efficiencies, it's coming in supply cost reductions, it's coming in greater utilization of consolidated facilities. And we're just going to continue to push it. We've got a technical limit case that's actually significantly below $3.4 million even. we're working towards that."

I think what I would point out is that we said all 3 last year that we're devoting a large part of that program to testing downspacing at 24 wells per section and 32 wells per section and then we wanted to get the wells on and really gather some longer-term data. And we have ramped that downspacing program almost down to nothing this year. and that doesn't really have anything to do with the commodity environment. That was the plan all along until we have gathered the data on the pilots that we did last year. So all the resource numbers everything we've ever talked about, location tons for the fields always been based on 16 wells per section. We've talked about we do expect it to be different spacing and different parts of the field. 16 wells per section has an average is certainly still a very good number, a conservative number I think. We see some areas where we do expect it to be greater spacing than that, more than 16 wells. There maybe some areas that are not being less than 16. But still feel very comfortable overall with where we're at."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'm extremely pleased with how Noble Energy has performed in the early part of 2015. This is highlighted by our production, which has been very strong across the board. And whil",2184,"Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'm extremely pleased with how Noble Energy has performed in the early part of 2015. This is highlighted by our production, which has been very strong across the board. And while still early, we're confident enough to raise our full year volume outlook. Our successes also include improving capital efficiency and reducing operating costs. And results so far this year are right where we expect it, if not a little better. Another major accomplishment was gaining alignment with our partner in the Marcellus to reduce our activity levels. And in the DJ Basin, strong results and continued operational efficiencies are driving additional capital allocation in the second half of the year.
Starting off with sales volumes. We sold a record 318,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the first quarter, an increase of 17% over the same period last year after adjusting for asset sales. Full year sales are now expected to average between 300,000 and 315,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day as we have raised the bottom end of our range by 5,000 barrels equivalent per day. This updated range now reflects the first quarter outperformance while maintaining our prior expectations for the remaining quarters of the year.
Compared to the first quarter of last year, core U.S. onshore sales volumes increased more than 35%, driven by record production in both the DJ Basin and Marcellus Shale. Horizontal production in these 2 plays was up a combined 60% versus the same time period. Offshore, including the Gulf of Mexico and our International businesses, volumes were relatively flat with the first quarter of last year after adjusting for asset sales. 
Our offshore assets continue to perform very well with world-class run time and lower-than-expected decline rates. Highlighting this performance is nearly 100% run time at both Tamar offshore Israel and Aseng in Equatorial Guinea. It's the combination of these high-quality, low-cost assets and managing a diversified portfolio that continues to provide Noble a competitive advantage. Our U.S. onshore development, major project execution and exploration capabilities provide material resource opportunities and tremendous investment optionality.
As mentioned earlier, we have made substantial progress towards lowering both our capital and operating costs. We've worked closely with our suppliers to achieve an average of 20% savings, seen most prominently in our U.S. onshore business. Our suppliers have moved quickly to assist in adjusting our cost structure, and we continue to work with them in partnership to ensure these early achievements are turned into sustainable cost improvements.
Highlighting our production cost reduction was lease operating expense, which is already down $0.50 per barrel from the fourth quarter, a material change in such a short period of time and putting us on track to meet our full year average expectation. General and administrative costs are down from previous quarters as well. We've also recently completed an organizational realignment, which better positions our workforce for this current environment.
Capital expenditures for the quarter were a little over $900 million, slightly below our internal expectations and trending lower as we move through the year. Total capital for 2015 remains $2.9 billion with $1.8 billion allocated to the onshore U.S. business. The DJ Basin has increased to more than 60% of the onshore U.S. amount with Marcellus now representing slightly less than 40%.
Focusing on our DJ operations. Growth in the first quarter exhibited our strong operating capacity. Total volumes were a record 116,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up 22% versus the first quarter of last year. Growth in the horizontal program was even more impressive, up more than 50% over the last year and more than 110% the last 2 years.
Slide 4 highlights continued drilling efficiencies being delivered by our teams. And as you can see, we're now averaging 7 days from spud-to-rig release for a standard lateral length well, almost as fast as we used to drill vertical wells. In fact, we recently drilled a 9,300-foot horizontal well in Wells Ranch in just 7 days. Compared to last year, we're drilling 70% of the total footage while utilizing 40% of the rig count. This is a result of our focus on drilling execution, utilizing the best rigs and crews in the basin and continuing to increase our average lateral lengths per well.
Reduced drilling times are resulting in an increased number of wells that can be completed this year. And we are reallocating some capital here to keep up with the drilling pace, supplementing our one full-time completion crew with a second completion crew in the second half of the year. These efficiencies, along with supplier cost reductions, are driving a downward trend in our well cost. Based on today's drilling and completion costs, we're already meeting our budgeted well cost expectations for the year. 
We have highlighted on Slide 5 a $3.8 million Wells Ranch well. Our overall cost reductions from 2014 include 5% to 15% sustainable cost savings from continuing to reduce drilling times and optimizing equipment usage and a range of 15% to 25% savings from our major suppliers. It is worth noting that the these well costs are all-in and include items that such as pad construction and associated facilities costs. And we have opportunities continue to drive cost down further. Using slickwater for fracs in certain parts of the basin may allow us to save an additional $100,000 to $200,000 per well on a standardized length lateral. We recently brought online 11 wells in East Pony that were completed with slickwater. And these wells are performing at/or above expectations.
Third-party infrastructure uptime improved at the start of the year. And I am pleased with the progress of the expansion projects that are currently underway. The Lucerne-2 plant and additional compressor stations are on track for start-up in late second quarter, providing a material increase in processing and compression capacity on the DCP system. The Grand Parkway low-pressure loop has been approved and is expected to start up by the end of the year, which will have a positive impact on the performance of legacy vertical wells and earlier horizontal wells.
Operating performance in the Marcellus Shale remains exceptional as well. And our production grew 73% versus the first quarter of last year to nearly 400 million cubic feet equivalent per day. Similar to the DJ Basin, we're seeing substantial reduction in drilling times and lower well cost through a combination of utilizing top hole rigs, drilling longer laterals and supplier cost reductions. 
Improvements in drilling times have resulted in a larger inventory of uncompleted wells than we had originally anticipated in both the operated and nonoperated areas of the Marcellus. This affords us the opportunity to reduce rig count in the second half of the year to 1 operated rig and 2 nonoperated rigs while still meeting our planned completion and production goals. Overall, this is a $200 million net reduction to our prior Marcellus expectations. We continue to diversify our natural gas markets and recently began transporting approximately 100 million cubic feet per day of gas out of the basin, including our first sales into Gulf Coast markets. This firm transportation has a relatively low overall cost and gives us further access to better-priced markets.
Moving offshore. We achieved a number of key milestones on our major projects in the Gulf of Mexico during the first quarter. At Rio Grande, all drilling and completion operations are now complete and pipeline installation is scheduled to begin in the second quarter. Rio Grande remains on schedule for first production in the fourth quarter. Development drilling operations at Gunflint are underway and are expected to continue throughout the remainder of 2015. Pipeline installation will commence following the Rio Grande installation and first production from Gunflint remains on schedule for mid-2016. Our Gulf of Mexico projects highlight the benefits of our diverse portfolio by providing strong oil growth exiting 2015 with another step-up in 2016. The cash margins for these projects are very competitive with U.S. onshore resource plays, evident by nearly all of the production being oil and priced at a premium to WTI, combined with attractive production costs.
Moving to the Eastern Mediterranean. Tamar continues to exhibit exceptional reliability and set new milestones for delivery, achieving a record weekly gross sales average of over 1 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day, driven by seasonal demand and coal plant maintenance. A recently signed agreement to supply interruptible sales of up to 250 million cubic feet per day gross from Tamar to Egypt's domestic market is another example of the strong regional demand for our natural gas. We and our customer are now working to finalize regulatory approvals and transportation agreements needed to start sales. We believe these can be included in the next few months, setting us up for initial sales later in 2015 by utilizing existing infrastructure. Once we have those approvals, we will provide an outlook for sales and adjust our production guidance at that time.
During the first quarter, we received regulatory approval for export sales to the Arab Potash Company and Jordan Bromine Company in Jordan. While a relatively small volume, this does represent the first formally approved regional export of natural gas from Israel and sets forward a path for additional agreements to follow. Meanwhile, we continue to work very intently to establish a comprehensive framework for energy development. Our teams are meeting regularly with the interministerial group established by the Prime Minister's Office for this purpose. And we are encouraged by their efforts to create a sustainable investment climate for energy development in Israel. Early progress has been made, and we look forward to working with the new government. Resolution about standing regulatory matters, including antitrust concerns and export taxation, along with a comprehensive framework for energy development, is still necessary to enable additional project development. We believe the interministerial working group is on track to achieve this objective over the next few months following the seating of the new government.
In Cyprus, we're working closely with the government and plan to submit a preliminary field development plan in the near future. Our Cyprus discovery can be another important contributor toward meeting regional gas demand. We've begun export marketing activities and are greatly encouraged by the level of interest expressed by potential counterparties, not only for gas purchases but also regarding participating in export infrastructure investment. 
Also within our offshore business, you can certainly feel the exploration excitement around our office as we're nearing a very impactful 2015 drilling program. In West Africa, we recently signed a rig contract for the Cheetah exploration prospect in Cameroon and expect this low-cost well to spud early in the third quarter. Cheetah represents our first Cretaceous test in the Douala Basin and has a main resource size in excess of 100 million barrels of oil equivalent gross. A sizable discovery at Cheetah would deliver a very attractive development in less than 100 feet of water depth, where we can move very quickly to first production.
By the end of the second quarter, we anticipate commencing drilling offshore of the Falkland Islands, where we plan to drill 2 exploration wells this year. Our first prospect, Humpback, which we operate with a 35% interest, has a gross main resource size of over 250 million barrels of oil. If successful, Humpback would derisk other large prospects shown on Slide 10 that have cumulative gross resource potential in excess of 1 billion barrels of oil. We recently farmed into the Rhea prospect, also with 250 million barrels of oil potential, which will be our second exploration well in the Falkland Islands. Adding the Rhea opportunity further diversifies our exploration inventory and enhances our overall chance of success as it offsets other oil discoveries in the basin. The prospect is anticipated the spud by year end. We operate Rhea and currently have a 75% working interest.
Let me now provide some insight into our volume profile throughout the year. As mentioned earlier, we've not made any production guidance changes to the remaining quarters. Second quarter sales volumes are anticipated to range between 290,000 and 300,000 barrels of oil per day, impacted by planned facility maintenance and turnarounds in West Africa and the Gulf of Mexico, along with the usual seasonal demand softness for Israel volumes. Further sales are expected to build in the second half of the year with strong seasonal demand in Israel in the third quarter followed by new oil volumes from the start-up of our major projects in the Gulf of Mexico in the fourth quarter. Our diversified portfolio is setting us up to exit 2015 on a nice trajectory. 
So in summary, we're off to a strong start this year. Performance on volumes, capital efficiency and costs is where we expect it, if not a little better -- not a little bit better at this point. And we're on a path approaching cash flow neutrality around mid-year as we anticipated.
So Joshua, at this time, we'd like to go ahead and open the call to questions."

I think some of the recent performance improvement we've seen to be fair is we're running 4 rigs and we tended to keep the 4 best rigs out of the 10. But I think that's a fairly small part of the improvement that we've seen. Most of it comes from just a continuing focus on how can we make each little part of the drilling process better. And as Dave mentioned, while we average to 7 days for normal length laterals in the first quarter in the DJ, we also drilled a 9,300-foot well in 7 days. Now we also drilled a normal length lateral well in 5 days in East Pony. So that gives us confidence that there's still more improvement to come. And that's what we'll be chasing over the next quarters."

And what is enabling us to do now is to bring more wells ready for -- more wells will have drilled by the end of year and more wells ready to complete by the end of the year, which I think will give us some very nice momentum as we exit this year and look towards 2016.

So a number of these things are within the control of specific ministries. And so this is a case in point where it's completely within the remit of the Ministry of Energy and Water Resources. Others are more complex that require the alignment across ministries. And that's really been the benefit that we've seen in this interministerial working group. It's caused a number of ministries that typically don't work as closely together as might be needed to create the kind of framework that investors look for. It's provided a venue for those groups to work together. And that's been the real positive thing, I think, that's come out of this for us."

So I think one thing worth noting, and I think we had it in the notes, but when we talk drill and complete numbers, whether it's the $3.8 million on the slide or the $3.4 million that we've done since then, that really is an all-in cost. That includes all the pad costs that's allocated to the wells, new facilities allocated to the wells as well as when we get into areas where there's vertical legacy wells, if any prep work needs to be done on those, that gets allocated back to the wells. So that truly is an all-in cost. I think hitting the $3.4 million in April says a lot about our ability to continue to drive it down, especially as we continue to drive drilling times down to those 5-day records I mentioned on a normal length lateral and 7 days on a long length lateral. But the cost savings is really coming across the board. It's coming in drilling efficiencies, it's coming in supply cost reductions, it's coming in greater utilization of consolidated facilities.

Whereas I think when you look at it, it was -- the $2.9 billion was -- and when we were looking at the budget, we were looking at that relative to a $50 to $55 oil price and we were assuming probably on a full year basis, around 10%, if I remember right, on the average savings overall on those. And you see a little higher savings that we're seeing on some of the completion part, but you have to look at the total cost. So I think it's too early for us to adjust anything yet, which is why we haven't changed our capital outlook for the year.

And we have ramped that downspacing program almost down to nothing this year. And that doesn't really have anything to do with the commodity environment. That was the plan all along until we have gathered the data on the pilots that we did last year. So all the resource numbers, everything we've ever talked about, location counts for the field has always been based on 16 wells per section. We've talked about we do expect it to be different spacing in different parts of the field. 16 wells per section is an average that's certainly still a very good number, a conservative number, I think. We see some areas where we do expect it to be greater spacing than that, more than 16 wells. There maybe some areas that end up being less than 16.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'm extremely pleased with how Noble Energy has performed in the early part of 2015. This is highlighted by our production, which has been very strong across the board. And whil",2187,"Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'm extremely pleased with how Noble Energy has performed in the early part of 2015. This is highlighted by our production, which has been very strong across the board. And while still early, we're confident enough to raise our full year volume outlook. Our successes also include improving capital efficiency and reducing operating costs. And results so far this year are right where we expect it, if not a little better. Another major accomplishment was gaining alignment with our partner in the Marcellus to reduce our activity levels. And in the DJ Basin, strong results and continued operational efficiencies are driving additional capital allocations in the second half of the year.
Starting off with sales volumes. We sold a record 318,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the first quarter, an increase of 17% over the same period last year after adjusting for asset sales. Full year sales are now expected to average between 300,000 and 315,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day as we have raised the bottom end of our range by 5,000 barrels equivalent per day. This updated range now reflects the first quarter outperformance while maintaining our prior expectations for the remaining quarters of the year.
Compared to the first quarter of last year, core U.S. onshore sales volumes increased more than 35%, driven by record production in both the DJ Basin and Marcellus Shale. Horizontal production in these 2 plays was up a combined 60% versus the same time period. Offshore, including the Gulf of Mexico and our International businesses, volumes were relatively flat with the first quarter of last year after adjusting for asset sales. 
Our offshore assets continue to perform very well with world-class run time and lower-than-expected decline rates. Highlighting this performance is nearly 100% run time at both Tamar offshore Israel and Aseng in Equatorial Guinea. It's the combination of these high-quality, low-cost assets and managing a diversified portfolio that continues to provide Noble a competitive advantage. Our U.S. onshore development, major project execution and exploration capabilities provide material resource opportunities and tremendous investment optionality.
As mentioned earlier, we have made substantial progress towards lowering both our capital and operating costs. We've worked closely with our suppliers to achieve an average of 20% savings, seen most prominently in our U.S. onshore business. Our suppliers have moved quickly to assist in adjusting our cost structure, and we continue to work with them in partnership to ensure these early achievements are turned into sustainable cost improvements.
Highlighting our production cost reduction was lease operating expense, which is already down $0.50 per barrel from the fourth quarter, a material change in such a short period of time and putting us on track to meet our full year average expectation. General and administrative costs are down from previous quarters as well. We've also recently completed an organizational realignment, which better positions our workforce for this current environment.
Capital expenditures for the quarter were a little over $900 million, slightly below our internal expectations and trending lower as we move through the year. Total capital for 2015 remains $2.9 billion with $1.8 billion allocated to the onshore U.S. business. The DJ Basin has increased to more than 60% of the onshore U.S. amount with Marcellus now representing slightly less than 40%.
Focusing on our DJ operations. Growth in the first quarter exhibited our strong operating capacity. Total volumes were a record 116,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up 22% versus the first quarter of last year. Growth in the horizontal program was even more impressive, up more than 50% over the last year and more than 110% the last 2 years.
Slide 4 highlights continued drilling efficiencies being delivered by our teams. And as you can see, we're now averaging 7 days from spud-to-rig release for a standard lateral length well, almost as fast as we used to drill vertical wells. In fact, we recently drilled a 9,300-foot horizontal well in Wells Ranch in just 7 days. Compared to last year, we're drilling 70% of the total footage while utilizing 40% of the rig count. This is a result of our focus on drilling execution, utilizing the best rigs and crews in the basin and continuing to increase our average lateral lengths per well.
Reduced drilling times are resulting in an increased number of wells that can be completed this year. And we are reallocating some capital here to keep up with the drilling pace, supplementing our one full-time completion crew with a second completion crew in the second half of the year. These efficiencies, along with supplier cost reductions, are driving a downward trend in our well cost. Based on today's drilling and completion costs, we're already meeting our budgeted well cost expectations for the year. 
We have highlighted on Slide 5 a $3.8 million Wells Ranch well. Our overall cost reductions from 2014 include 5% to 15% sustainable cost savings from continuing to reduce drilling times and optimizing equipment usage and a range of 15% to 25% savings from our major suppliers. It is worth noting that the these well costs are all-in and include items that such as pad construction and associated facilities costs. And we have opportunities continue to drive cost down further. Using slickwater for fracs in certain parts of the basin may allow us to save an additional $100,000 to $200,000 per well on a standardized length lateral. We recently brought online 11 wells in East Pony that were completed with slickwater. And these wells are performing at or above expectations.
Third-party infrastructure uptime improved at the start of the year. And I am pleased with the progress of the expansion projects that are currently underway. The Lucerne-2 plant and additional compressor stations are on track for start-up in late second quarter, providing a material increase in processing and compression capacity on the DCP system. The Grand Parkway low pressure loop has been approved and is expected to start up by the end of the year, which will have a positive impact on the performance of legacy vertical wells and earlier horizontal wells.
Operating performance in the Marcellus Shale remains exceptional as well. And our production grew 73% versus the first quarter of last year to nearly 400 million cubic feet equivalent per day. Similar to the DJ Basin, we're seeing substantial reduction in drilling times and lower well cost through a combination of utilizing top hole rigs, drilling longer laterals and supplier cost reductions. 
Improvements in drilling times have resulted in a larger inventory of uncompleted wells than we had originally anticipated in both the operated and nonoperated areas of the Marcellus. This affords us the opportunity to reduce rig count in the second half of the year to 1 operated rig and 2 nonoperated rigs while still meeting our planned completion and production goals. Overall, this is a $200 million net reduction to our prior Marcellus expectations. We continue to diversify our natural gas markets and recently began transporting approximately 100 million cubic feet per day of gas out of the basin, including our first sales into Gulf Coast markets. This firm transportation has a relatively low overall cost and gives us further access to better-priced markets.
Moving offshore. We achieved a number of key milestones on our major projects in the Gulf of Mexico during the first quarter. At Rio Grande, all drilling and completion operations are now complete and pipeline installation is scheduled to begin in the second quarter. Rio Grande remains on schedule for first production in the fourth quarter. Development drilling operations at Gunflint are underway and are expected to continue throughout the remainder of 2015. Pipeline installation will commence following the Rio Grande installation and first production from Gunflint remains on schedule for mid-2016. Our Gulf of Mexico projects highlight the benefits of our diverse portfolio by providing strong oil growth exiting 2015 with another step-up in 2016. The cash margins for these projects are very competitive with U.S. onshore resource plays, evident by nearly all of the production being oil and priced at a premium to WTI, combined with attractive production costs.
Moving to the Eastern Mediterranean. Tamar continues to exhibit exceptional reliability and set new milestones for delivery, achieving a record weekly gross sales average of over 1 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day, driven by seasonal demand and coal plant maintenance. A recently signed agreement to supply interruptible sales of up to 250 million cubic feet per day gross from Tamar to Egypt's domestic market is another example of the strong regional demand for our natural gas. We and our customer are now working to finalize regulatory approvals and transportation agreements needed to start sales. We believe these can be concluded in the next few months, setting us up for initial sales later in 2015 by utilizing existing infrastructure. Once we have those approvals, we will provide an outlook for sales and adjust our production guidance at that time.
During the first quarter, we received regulatory approval for export sales to the Arab Potash Company and Jordan Bromine Company in Jordan. While a relatively small volume, this does represent the first formally approved regional export of natural gas from Israel and sets forward a path for additional agreements to follow. Meanwhile, we continue to work very intently to establish a comprehensive framework for energy development. Our teams are meeting regularly with the interministerial group established by the Prime Minister's Office for this purpose. And we are encouraged by their efforts to create a sustainable investment climate for energy development in Israel. Early progress has been made, and we look forward to working with the new government. Resolutions about standing regulatory matters, including antitrust concerns and export taxation, along with a comprehensive framework for energy development, is still necessary to enable additional project development. We believe the interministerial working group is on track to achieve this objective over the next few months following the seating of the new government.
In Cyprus, we're working closely with the government and plan to submit a preliminary field development plan in the near future. Our Cyprus discovery can be another important contributor toward meeting regional gas demand. We've begun export marketing activities and are greatly encouraged by the level of interest expressed by potential counterparties, not only for gas purchases but also regarding participating in export infrastructure investment. 
Also within our offshore business, you can certainly feel the exploration excitement around our office as we're nearing a very impactful 2015 drilling program. In West Africa, we recently signed a rig contract for the Cheetah exploration prospect in Cameroon and expect this low-cost well to spud early in the third quarter. Cheetah represents our first Cretaceous test in the Douala Basin and has a main resource size in excess of 100 million barrels of oil equivalent gross. A sizable discovery at Cheetah would deliver a very attractive development in less than 100 feet of water depth, where we can move very quickly to first production.
By the end of the second quarter, we anticipate commencing drilling offshore of the Falkland Islands, where we plan to drill 2 exploration wells this year. Our first prospect, Humpback, which we operate with a 35% interest, has a gross main resource size of over 250 million barrels of oil. If successful, Humpback would derisk other large prospects shown on Slide 10 that have cumulative gross resource potential in excess of 1 billion barrels of oil. We recently farmed into the Rhea prospect, also with 250 million barrels of oil potential, which will be our second exploration well in the Falkland Islands. Adding the Rhea opportunity further diversifies our exploration inventory and enhances our overall chance of success as it offsets other oil discoveries in the basin. The prospect is anticipated to spud by year end. We operate Rhea and currently have a 75% working interest.
Let me now provide some insight into our volume profile throughout the year. As mentioned earlier, we've not made any production guidance changes to the remaining quarters. Second quarter sales volumes are anticipated to range between 290,000 and 300,000 barrels of oil per day, impacted by planned facility maintenance and turnarounds in West Africa and the Gulf of Mexico, along with the usual seasonal demand softness for Israel volumes. For there, sales are expected to build in the second half of the year with strong seasonal demand in Israel in the third quarter followed by new oil volumes from the start-up of our major projects in the Gulf of Mexico in the fourth quarter. Our diversified portfolio is setting us up to exit 2015 on a nice trajectory. 
So in summary, we're off to a strong start this year. Performance on volumes, capital efficiency and cost is where we expect it, if not a little better -- not a little bit better at this point. And we're on a path approaching cash flow neutrality around mid-year as we anticipated.
So Joshua, at this time, we'd like to go ahead and open the call to questions."

So we were able to do that even in a much higher commodity price environment obviously. I think some of the recent performance improvement we've seen to be fair is we're running 4 rigs and we tended to keep the 4 best rigs out of the 10. But I think that's a fairly small part of the improvement that we've seen. Most of it comes from just a continuing focus on how can we make each little part of the drilling process better. And as Dave mentioned, while we average to 7 days for normal length laterals in the first quarter in the DJ, we also drilled a 9,300-foot well in 7 days. Now we also drilled a normal length lateral well in 5 days in East Pony. So that gives us confidence that there's still more improvement to come.

The real test will be when we start, at some point, trying to do this in areas that have had very good results.

I think when you look at our profile through the year, we expect 1Q to be the highest, be fairly flat maybe through the first half, and then start to decline in the second half as we get back into more of an equilibrium that you would expect with only running the 4 rigs. Now what it remains to be seen on top of that is how much an uplift we truly get from the start-up of the Lucerne-2 gas plant that DCP is bringing on in June. That's a $200 million a day plant.

So I think one thing worth noting, and I think we had it in the notes, but when we talk drill and complete numbers, whether it's the $3.8 million on the slide or the $3.4 million that we've done since then, that really is an all-in cost.

So that truly is an all-in cost. I think hitting the $3.4 million in April says a lot about our ability to continue to drive it down, especially as we continue to drive drilling times down to those 5-day records I mentioned on a normal length lateral and 7 days on a long length lateral. But the cost savings is really coming across the board. It's coming in drilling efficiencies, it's coming in supply cost reductions, it's coming in greater utilization of consolidated facilities.

And we have ramped that downspacing program almost down to nothing this year. And that doesn't really have anything to do with the commodity environment. That was the plan all along until we have gathered the data on the pilots that we did last year. So all the resource numbers, everything we've ever talked about, location counts for the field has always been based on 16 wells per section. We've talked about we do expect it to be different spacing in different parts of the field. 16 wells per section is an average that's certainly still a very good number, a conservative number, I think. We see some areas where we do expect it to be greater spacing than that, more than 16 wells. There maybe some areas that end up being less than 16.

I want to share with you why I continue to have great confidence in our business and strategy. While these are challenging times in our industry, it does not diminish the fact that Noble Energy has exceptional assets as well as a financial strength and operational excellence to realize their potential. Our positive momentum, including the recent closing of the Rosetta acquisition, gives us great optimism for the future as we continue to execute on our strategy of driving value from a high-quality diversified portfolio that provide investment choices. Our core competitive advantages continue to be focused on U.S. onshore unconventional development, combined with material offshore exploration and proven major project execution. Additionally, we have the financial strength to navigate through a volatile market and take advantage of opportunities. All oil and natural gas companies are facing choppy seas right now, but I believe investors are very well positioned with Noble Energy. We continue to effectively manage the things that are within our control and position the business for long-term value creation. Our diversified portfolio underpins strong performance in the second quarter. Volumes again exceeded expectations, and meaningful reductions are being realized on both capital and operating cost. Sales volumes were nearly 300,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, even with the impact of scheduled facility maintenance in both the Gulf of Mexico and West Africa. For the second time this year, we raised our Noble Energy legacy volume outlook for the full year. This is a result of our flexibility to reallocate capital throughout the year as we continue to see efficiency improvements in the DJ Basin program. Second quarter capital expenditures declined sequentially to under $800 million and we remain on track to meet our original $2.9 billion capital forecast. Our capital is trending well quarterly for the year as we manage the cash flow in the second half of the year. 
I'm also extremely pleased with our progress in reducing cash cost, specifically in the onshore business where lease operator expense was reduced to approximately $4 per barrel of oil equivalent in the quarter. This is down more than 20% from the first quarter. Total lease operating expense per barrel of oil equivalent for Noble Energy is now back to pre-2010 level reflecting our portfolio changes an intense focus on reducing controllable cost. 
Operational execution continues to be an area of keen focus as we look to maximize long-term profitability with a number of major accomplishments achieved during the second quarter. This included our onshore horizontal production growth of 45% versus the same quarter of last year and record low drilling times in both the DJ Basin and Marcellus shale. Drilling complete cost, all in, are trending below targeted low-cost in both plays. 
In our offshore business, the Ash compression project in Israel has been completed, increasing our peak deliverability. And at the same time, pipeline installation and side modifications are progressing as planned on Big Bend and Dantzler in the Gulf of Mexico. First production from this field is expected in the fourth quarter and around the end of the year, respectively. 
On the offshore drilling side, we have 3 rigs currently operating. 1 progressing our Gunflint development and 2, drilling machine exploration wells, including prospect offshore Falkland Islands and Cameroon. So from an execution standpoint, I am pleased with how our business is operating. 
The acquisition of Rosetta enhances and further diversifies our onshore and conventional portfolio baddie to premiere low-cost operating assets. Strong underlying asset performance results from other operators in and around our acreage as well as recent M&A activity in these basins continues to affirm the long-term value of our transaction. It was the right opportunity at the right time for Noble Energy. These high-quality assets provides prolific and low-cost production in the Eagle Ford with running room and its deep inventory of liquids-rich opportunities in the emerging Delaware basin. Without question, these new areas will have a substantial impact to Noble Energy. When you think about more than 60,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day of production, at least 1,800 identifiable locations and around 1 billion barrel of oil equivalent potential, that's a very sizable business that can grow materially into the future. We've hit the ground running, and we're already seeing more value potential than we originally assumed. 
Combined, our Texas assets will deliver 15% compound annual growth for several years within the operating cash flow to this business. As such, we aren't pouring capital away from any of our strong return opportunities, which is one reason this investment was so unique. 
As shown on Slide 3, we now have sizable position in 4 of the premier U.S. unconventional plays. This provides substantial flexibility in our future capital allocation and the ability to accelerate activity when appropriate. We will also realize about $40 million per year in G&A synergies, while taking advantage of Noble's lower cost of capital. 
Let me now hand it over to Gary to walk through an operations update."

I'd like to start off by sharing my thoughts on why the Rosetta acquisition was such a great move for Noble Energy. Our technical knowledge of these basins was built over the last several years as our business development and new venture teams assess all of the best basins in the U.S. From this work, two things became apparent. First, we needed to focus our existing onshore U.S. portfolio on the DJ Basin and Marcellus Shale, which consistently ranked among the top basins. This cost has exited another of plays over the last few years. Secondly, we want to be ready to further enhance our portfolio by capturing opportunities and other competitive basins then they became available. The Eagle Ford and Delaware basins are both top-tier plays, and we've now obtain premier positions in some of the best parts of each. Over the last few years, we have dramatically improved performance in the DJ Basin, and then transferred an accelerated those learnings in the Marcellus. With the addition of the Eagle Ford in Delaware positions, we are confident that our operational expertise will again unlock incremental value that otherwise would not have been delivered. Our acquisition model applied value almost entirely to the existing production but lower Eagle Ford inventory and the upper Wolfcamp  potential in the Delaware. We see a lot of room to increase value further our multizone development in both ways, refrac potential and additional locations that are not assumed in our current counts. 
The high-quality nature of our Eagle Ford asset is demonstrated on Slide 5. The map illustrates estimated recoveries for lateral foot in the basin. You can see the outline of our acreage, the largest being a core position in northern West County where we will focus our Eagle Ford activity over the next few years. This is a sweet spot of some of the most productive rock in the plate, with tremendous resource recoveries ranging between 1 million and 3 million-barrel of oil equivalent per well based on a 5,000-foot lateral. We have highlighted in the table our current assumptions, including inventory count based on current strip pricing and assumed spacing, estimated ultimate recoveries and average well cost. 
Highlighted on Slide 6 is the 3 million barrels equivalent type curve for Southgate's ranch represented by the blue lines. This is an increase of 25% from Rosetta's prior type curve shown in red. The green line is the average of 2 recent wells, which are outpacing even our increased type curve by another 20%. 
We have provided our detailed Eagle Ford plans on Slide 7 showing accelerating well activity through at least 2018. Our plan is to focus on the lower Eagle Ford for the last few years, increasing well lateral links to an average of around 7,000 feet. We are currently drilling our first Eagle Ford well and have already implemented improvements that have material increased footage drilled per day. 
Moving over to the Permian. This is an area where we see tremendous value and upside as we accelerate the appraisal activities and move quickly to development boat. The Delaware is a emerging as a world-class basin with multizone potential. Development plans will include multi-well pad drilling, centralized production facilities and the potential for longer laterals, none of which were being done in the these assets. We will rapidly incorporate and leverage learnings from the DJ Basin and the Marcellus as we plan the long-term development of the basin. 
Our focus on the Permian will be on the Delaware basin position, which is a contiguous 45,000 net acres. In the DJ Basin, we've already experienced the significant value uplift of the large-scale systematic development approach can bring in terms of maximizing recoveries, lowering capital and operating costs and minimizing the aboveground impacts. 
On Slide 8, we have shows how these acreage compares to our  DJ Basin, East Pony, IDP area in terms of size. This is clearly a material position for Noble. We've already identified over 1,200 gross locations based on current strip prices for development with 70% of these in the Wolfcamp A and Third Bone Spring and the remainder in Lower Wolfcamp zones. 
Highlighted on Slide 9 are recent global wells and those are some other operating in and around our acreage. For the Noble wells, the peak 30-day average production rates from a normalized 5,000-foot lateral is nearly 1,300 barrels of oil equivalent per day on a 2 stringed basses, and more than 70% of this production is crude oil. This production rates are impressive and consistent with other operator results in the area. Similar to what we have shown for the Eagle Ford, we have provided our 700,000-barrel of oil equivalent type curve, again for 5,000-foot lateral on Slide 10. This type curve is up 30% from Rosetta's previous type curve. Recent well performance represented by the 14 wells in the green line gives us a lot of confidence in the potential of these assets. 
We've also highlighted on the slide some of the anticipated operating efficiencies that Noble Energy will bring to these assets. You can see the substantial reduction in drilling cost per lateral foot that we have driven in the DJ Basin and Marcellus versus historical performance in these areas, combining Noble drilling expertise and knowledge of multizone development with Rosetta skill set said knowledge will no doubt deliver substantial operational improvement in the Delaware. 
On Slide 11, we have provided our detailed plans for acceleration in the Permian resulting in 70 wells drilled in 2018 and anticipating continued activity growth beyond that.  Under the current plan, capital investment in the Delaware is essentially equivalent to the Eagle Ford beginning next year and exceeds the Eagle Ford beginning in 2018 with an even earlier acceleration in the Delaware possible as our plans continue to evolve. 
Our outlook for the combined Texas assets has production growing to more than 100,000 barrels equivalent per day in 2018 as shown on Slide 12. We estimate substantial annual free cash flow at the end of our forecasted period, which would only provide additional investment flexibility. 
I'll now transition to the DJ Basin where both our underlying operational performance and the infrastructure capacity continue to improve. to rig release time averaged just over 6 days in the quarter for standard link lateral. Last quarter, it was 7 days, it was already below our budgeted assumption for 2015. Dave mentioned our well cost are trending under our target for the year second half 2015 all in well cost, including drilling, completion and allocated facilities are expected to be $3.5 million in Wells Ranch and $3.9 million in East Pony. These are both $300,000 below our budget assumptions. In addition, when you normalize our loan lateral well cost back to a normal link equivalent well, we are slightly below $3 million for these more capital efficient wells and roughly 60% of our drilling in the second half of this year will be extended laterals. 
With current rig efficiencies and 4 rigs for the rest of the year, we expect to drill a total of 240 equivalent wells in 2015 compared to our original budget expectation of about 200 with the same number of rigs. That's an amazing increase in performance and a key contributor to our 2015 production uplift. 
On the completion side, we continue to optimize stage links, profit loads and fluid types across our IDPs. Most recently, we've seen very strong performance utilizing slick water in East Pony with the majority of these wells are performing similar hybrid gel completions nearby. Our success and growth in East Pony has been tremendous. Net production in the East Pony IDP is now approximately 25,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up 100% from this time a year ago. And as a reminder, more than 75% of East Pony volumes are oil. 
At the end of the second quarter, third-party infrastructure in Greater Wattenberg got a much-needed boost with the start-up of the city gas processing plant, which is ramping the full capacity of 200 million cubic feet per day. The addition of the Lucerne-2 is increasing third-party gas capacity on the DCP system by 1/3 to a total of 800 million cubic feet per day. Now earlier this year in certain parts of the field, line pressure averaged north of 250 PSI, which created a tough producing environment for many of the legacy vertical and horizontal wells. Since Lucerne-2 start up, we've seen line pressure produce by as much as 50 to 70 psi in the early part of july and that should be even greater as the plant reaches full capacity. Volumes for July averaged to more than 110,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day with peak days greater than 115,000 per day. Additional infrastructure projects in the basin continues to progress on the schedule as well, including the Grand Parkway low pressure gathering loop. The combination of all of these projects position the basin well exiting 2015 and into 2016, and while we remain guarded in our production guidance until consistent midstream performance as seen, the early look is certainly very positive. 
Finally, in the Marcellus Shale, our operations continue to improve. Our drilling teams are performing extremely well, and we drilled our longest lateral ever as a company in the second quarter, nearly 14,000-foot horizontally. In addition, we're looking forward to the production results from our first Utica well before the end of the year. 
Given the price environment, we're further reducing drilling activity in the basin and alignment with our joint venture partner. In the middle part of the third quarter, operator and horizontal drilling will be reduced to 0 rigs for the remainder of the year. And on the dry gas nonoperated side, we anticipate going from 2 horizontal rigs to 0 early in the fourth quarter. These shifts in drilling do not impact our completion schedule for the remainder of 2015, and we're working with our partner on the right level of investment for 2016 with both companies focused on a cash-neutral program for the JV next year. Let me now been hand it back to Dave."

I want to spend a few minutes on the progress on the regulatory front in Israel and our updated 2015 outlook before opening for questions. 
Over the last several months, we've worked diligently with the government on establishing a regulatory framework to provide necessary certainty for future investment. The product is a comprehensive framework that addresses the needs and interests of all parties, including Noble Energy, the government and citizens of Israel and its neighbors who can all benefit from this abundant gas resources. Both the Prime Minister's Office and the Minister of Energy have endorsed the framework and are working to achieve final approval. For Noble Energy, this framework should provide certainty around regulatory and fiscal matters necessary to support future investment in the expansion of Tamar and the first phase of development Leviathan. For Israel, it provides price transparency and market competition. These projects can develop additional gas supplies within the country and bring the financial and geopolitical benefits of regional exports. We continue to engage with future export customers in the region on the potential to deliver both Israeli and word gas to market. The opportunity for expansion of natural gas used in Israel and the demand for natural gas in the region remains strong. I look forward to unlocking tremendous unrecognized value in Noble as these projects come together. Company-wide, there are a number of positive catalysts in the second half of the year, which provides both near and long-term benefit. We are encouraged that production capacity in the DJ Basin will continue to respond positively as we benefit from important infrastructure expansion, while we focus on long laterals and additional completion learnings through the remainder of the year. As Gary mentioned, the integration of the Rosetta assets is going very well with a strong second quarter, our volumes where higher and cost lower than expected, these assets are off to a great start and complementary to Noble's overall performance. Offshore, 2 new fields are anticipated to add 20,000 barrels equivalent per day by the end of the year in the Gulf of Mexico. In addition, we will have results from 2 material exploration prospects this quarter, including the 250 million barrels [indiscernible] prospect in the Falkland Islands and 100 million plus prospects in Cameroon. Success in either of these wells with our well in the later this year with derisk additional exploration potential provide new development opportunities and add significant value for Noble Energy. As mentioned earlier, we are raising our previous full year 2015 volume guidance. I'm pleased we complete this amounted increase while holding full year capital flat to original plan and maintaining flexibility on our onshore activity should conditions and cash flow outlook change. We've also provided new quarterly guidance for the remainder of the year, which includes the integration of the Eagle Ford and Permian assets. This guidance reflects the quarterly trend of lower capital and operating costs through the remainder of the year while underlying volumes growth. Yes, these are tough times, but we're well positioned with exceptional assets and strong operating and financial capacity to navigate through these challenges no matter the duration. We've been very thoughtful in our decision processes throughout the year as we continue to maintain strong capital discipline and manage the cash flow in the second half of the year. I am convinced Noble Energy's future is very bright. At this time, we would like to go ahead and open the call to questions."

But the actual last thing and sustainable framework in the nature of the framework and having a framework that allows us to move forward with investment in Israel is the most important element. I think what's very encouraging so far is that -- and think back about this. When you go back to over the last year, what's been accomplished. I mean in the progress on getting to a framework has been nothing short of a tremendous effort on all parties -- party like the government committed on doing this and on our team and our partners that have worked so hard to bring that to bear. I mean, a complete comprehensive framework that sets up the ability to go forward with confidence and investment is a big step. Another big step has been the commitment and support of the Prime Minister's Office and the Energy Ministry to make this happen. So I think when you look at it, the step again, the framework to where it is and now the recognition and understanding of how important this is, not only to the country but to the region, has just been tremendous."

I think on Humpback and Cheetah, they're both in that 25% -- plus-or-minus 25% range, both interesting, exciting prospects, both with a little different color. In Humpback, that's our first true exploration test on this huge acreage position down in the Falklands. I mean, you think about it, you think about how our acreage position overlays the North Sea, for example, its' just our position down there in the Falklands it's about half of the North sea. So it will be real interesting to see what transpires here as we break out a new play, but it's a new play in areas where there's been proven hydrocarbon discoveries, some fairly significant when you look at the whole scheme of things. In Cameroon, to me, what exciting to me is like Gulf of Mexico prospect on steroids as I talked about it. When you look at the shallow water depth and a high potential.

I'd say we're actually ahead of that plan. And I think that's framed in what you look after the outlook for the second half of the year. When you go back to what we've started the year, we've ramped down and pushed down the Marcellus program pretty quickly. We very quickly reduced activity levels in the DJ from 10 rigs to 4. We level loaded and kind of slowed down some of our completion activity, so we could get Lucerne-2 in place. As a result of how things have looked through the year, actually saw some of the Marcellus planned capital come down. Actually move some of that capital to the DJ. But if that was a reflection on the just the continued improvements on efficiency. We've talked before about those 4 rigs drilling about 70% of the total lateral footage that we did with 10 rigs.

We're seeing some very good encouraging results. I would say we expect volumes to be up from second quarter and the third and fourth. But I think it will be nice to get this Lucerne-2 plant fully ramped up. It's been down here for -- not down, but it's been impacted by fact that they've had another facility planned maintenance that we still got a couple of weeks to see the full impact out there.

And we've said we're north of 110 in July, peak days greater than 115. We've actually seen even a couple of days in 120 range. So that i all, without Lucerne-2 running at full capacity yet, they haven't yet made it to the 200 million a day. In the meantime, as Dave mentioned, they've had another facility down from some planned maintenance, which took about 120 million a day out of the system capacity. So that's part of the reason why we're still being a bit conservative for now until we see more than just a couple of days with some decent rates through the system. But I think from their the performance, we're seeing line pressures is down 50 to 75-psi across the field when they've got everything up and running. Very excited about what we're seeing.

All oil and natural gas companies are facing choppy seas right now, but I believe investors are very well positioned with Noble Energy. We continue to effectively manage the things that are within our control and position the business for long-term value creation. Our diversified portfolio underpins strong performance in the second quarter. Volumes again exceeded expectations, and meaningful reductions are being realized on both capital and operating cost. Sales volumes were nearly 300,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, even with the impact of scheduled facility maintenance in both the Gulf of Mexico and West Africa. For the second time this year, we raised our Noble Energy legacy volume outlook for the full year. This is a result of our flexibility to reallocate capital throughout the year as we continue to see efficiency improvements in the DJ Basin program. Second quarter capital expenditures declined sequentially to under $800 million and we remain on track to meet our original $2.9 billion capital forecast. Our capital is trending well quarterly for the year as we manage the cash flow in the second half of the year. 
I'm also extremely pleased with our progress in reducing cash cost, specifically in the onshore business, where lease operating expense was reduced to approximately $4 per barrel of oil equivalent in the quarter. This is down more than 20% from the first quarter. Total lease operating expense per barrel of oil equivalent for Noble Energy is now back to pre-2010 level reflecting our portfolio changes an intense focus on reducing controllable cost. 
Operational execution continues to be an area of keen focus as we look to maximize long-term profitability with a number of major accomplishments achieved during the second quarter. This included onshore horizontal production growth of 45% versus the same quarter of last year and record low drilling times in both the DJ Basin and Marcellus shale. Drilling complete cost, all in, are trending below targeted well cost in both plays.
In our offshore business, the Ashdod compression project in Israel has been completed, increasing our peak deliverability. And at the same time, pipeline installation and topside facility modifications are progressing as planned on Big Bend and Dantzler in the Gulf of Mexico. First production from these fields is expected in the fourth quarter and around the end of the year, respectively.  
On the offshore drilling side, we have 3 rigs currently operating. One progressing our Gunflint development, and two, drilling material exploration wells, including prospect offshore of the Falkland Islands and Cameroon. So from an execution standpoint, I am pleased with how our business is operating. 
The acquisition of Rosetta enhances and further diversifies our onshore and conventional portfolio by adding 2 premiere, low-cost operating assets. Strong underlying asset performance results from other operators in and around our acreage as well as recent M&A activity in these basins continues to affirm the long-term value of our transaction. It was the right opportunity at the right time for Noble Energy. These high-quality assets provide prolific and low-cost production in the Eagle Ford with running room and a deep inventory of liquids-rich opportunities in the emerging Delaware basin. Without question, these new areas will have a substantial impact to Noble Energy. When you think about more than 60,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day of production, at least 1,800 identifiable locations and around 1 billion barrels of oil equivalent potential, that's a very sizable business that can grow materially into the future. We've hit the ground running, and we're already seeing more value potential than we originally assumed. 
Combined, our Texas assets will deliver 15% compound annual growth for several years within the operating cash flow to this business. As such, we aren't pulling capital away from any of our strong return opportunities, which is one reason this investment was so unique. 
As shown on Slide 3, we now have sizable position in 4 of the premier U.S. unconventional plays. This provides substantial flexibility in our future capital allocation and the ability to accelerate activity when appropriate. We will also realize about $40 million per year in G&A synergies, while taking advantage of Noble's lower cost of capital.  
Let me now hand it over to Gary to walk through an operations update."

I'd like to start off by sharing my thoughts on why the Rosetta acquisition was such a great move for Noble Energy. Our technical knowledge of these basins was built over the last several years as our business development and new venture tea",1693,"Thanks, Dave. I'd like to start off by sharing my thoughts on why the Rosetta acquisition was such a great move for Noble Energy. Our technical knowledge of these basins was built over the last several years as our business development and new venture teams assessed all of the best basins in the U.S. From this work, two things became apparent. First, we needed to focus our existing onshore U.S. portfolio on the DJ Basin and Marcellus Shale, which consistently ranked among the top basins. This caused us to exit a number of other plays over the last few years. Second, we wanted to be ready to further enhance our portfolio by capturing opportunities and other competitive basins then they became available. The Eagle Ford and Delaware basins are both top-tier plays, and we've now obtained premier positions in some of the best parts of each. 
Over the last few years, we have dramatically improved performance in the DJ Basin, and then transferred and accelerated those learnings in the Marcellus. With the addition of the Eagle Ford in Delaware positions, we are confident that our operational expertise will again unlock incremental value that otherwise would not have been delivered. Our acquisition model applies value almost entirely through the existing production, the lower Eagle Ford inventory and the upper Wolfcamp potential in the Delaware. We see a lot of room to increase value further from multi-zone development in both plays, refrac potential and additional locations that are not assumed in our current counts. 
The high-quality nature of our Eagle Ford assets is demonstrated on Slide 5. The map illustrates estimated recoveries for lateral foot in the basin. You can see the outline of our acreage, the largest being a core position in northern West County where we will focus our Eagle Ford activity over the next few years. This is a sweet spot of some of the most productive rock in the play, with tremendous resource recoveries ranging between 1 million and 3 million-barrels of oil equivalent per well based on a 5,000-foot lateral. We have highlighted in the table our current assumptions, including inventory accounts based on current strip pricing and assumed spacing, estimated ultimate recoveries and average well costs.
Highlighted on Slide 6 is the 3 million barrel equivalent-type curve for South Gates Ranch, represented by the blue line. This is an increase of 25% from Rosetta's prior type curve shown in red. The green line is the average of 2 recent wells, which are outpacing even our increased type curve by another 20%. 
We have provided our detailed Eagle Ford activity plans on Slide 7 showing accelerating well activity through at least 2018. Our plan is to focus on the lower Eagle Ford for the next few years, increasing well lateral links to an average of around 7,000 feet. We are currently drilling our first Eagle Ford well and have already implemented improvements that have materially increased footage drilled per day. 
Moving over to the Permian. This is an area where we see tremendous value and upside as we accelerate the appraisal activities and move quickly to development boat. The Delaware is a emerging as a world-class basin with multi-zone potential. Development plans will include multi-well pad drilling, centralized production facilities and the potential for longer laterals, none of which were being done in the these assets. We will rapidly incorporate and leverage learnings from the DJ Basin and the Marcellus as we plan the long-term development of the basin. 
Our focus on the Permian will be on the Delaware basin position, which is a contiguous 45,000 net acres. In the DJ Basin, we've already experienced the significant value uplift of the large-scale systematic development approach can bring in terms of maximizing recoveries, lowering capital and operating costs and minimizing the aboveground impacts. 
On Slide 8, we have shown how these acreage compares to our DJ Basin, East Pony, IDP area in terms of size. And so this is clearly a material position for Noble. We've already identified over 1,200 gross locations based on current strip prices for development with 70% of these in the Wolfcamp A and 3rd Bone Spring and the remainder in Lower Wolfcamp zones. 
Highlighted on Slide 9 are recent Noble wells and those from other operators in and around our acreage. For the Noble wells, the peak 30-day average production rates from a normalized 5,000-foot lateral is nearly 1,300 barrels of oil equivalent per day on a 2-stringed basses, and more than 70% of this production is crude oil. These production rates are impressive and consistent with other operator results in the area. Similar to what we have shown for the Eagle Ford, we have provided our 700,000-barrel of oil equivalent type curve, again for a 5,000-foot lateral on Slide 10. This type curve is up 30% from Rosetta's previous type curve. Recent well performance represented by the 14 wells in the green line gives us a lot of confidence in the potential of these assets. 
We've also highlighted on this slide some of the anticipated operating efficiencies that Noble Energy will bring to these assets. You can see the substantial reduction in drilling cost per lateral foot that we have driven in the DJ Basin and Marcellus versus historical performance in these areas, combining Noble drilling expertise and knowledge of multi-zone developments with Rosetta skill set and knowledge will no doubt deliver substantial operational improvements in the Delaware.
On Slide 11, we have provided our detailed plans for acceleration in the Permian, resulting in 70 wells drilled in 2018 and anticipating continued activity growth beyond that. Under the current plan, capital investment in the Delaware is essentially equivalent to the Eagle Ford beginning next year and exceeds the Eagle Ford beginning in 2018, with even earlier acceleration in the Delaware possible as our plans continued to evolve. 
Our outlook for the combined Texas assets has production growing to more than 100,000 barrels equivalent per day in 2018 as shown on Slide 12. We estimate substantial annual free cash flow at the end of our forecasted period, which would only provide additional investment flexibility. 
I'll now transition to the DJ Basin where both our underlying operational performance and the infrastructure capacity continue to improve. to rig release time averaged just over 6 days in the quarter for a standard link lateral. Last quarter, it was 7 days, it was already below our budgeted assumption for 2015. Dave mentioned well cost are trending under our target for the year second half 2015 all in well cost, including drilling, completion and allocated facilities are expected to be $3.5 million in Wells Ranch and $3.9 million in East Pony. These are both $300,000 below our budgeted assumptions. In addition, when you normalize our long lateral well costs back to a normal linked equivalent well, we are slightly below $3 million for these more capital efficient wells and roughly 60% of our drilling in the second half of this year will be extended laterals. 
With current rig efficiencies and 4 rigs for the rest of the year, we expect to drill a total of 240 equivalent wells in 2015 compared to our original budget expectation of about 200, with the same number of rigs. That's an amazing increase in performance and a key contributor to our 2015 production uplift. 
On the completion side, we continue to optimize stage links, profit loads and fluid types across our IDPs. Most recently, we've seen very strong performance utilizing slick water in East Pony with the majority of these wells outperforming similar hybrid gel completions nearby. Our success and growth in East Pony has been tremendous. Net production in the East Pony IDP is now approximately 25,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up 100% from this time a year ago. And as a reminder, more than 75% of East Pony volumes are oil. 
At the end of the second quarter, third-party infrastructure in Greater Wattenberg got a much-needed boost, with the start-up of DCP's Lucerne-2 gas processing plant, which is ramping the full capacity of 200 million cubic feet per day. The addition of Lucerne-2 is increasing third-party gas capacity on the DCP system by 1/3 to a total of 800 million cubic feet per day. Now earlier this year in certain parts of the field, line pressure averaged north of 250 psi, which created a tough producing environment for many of the legacy vertical and horizontal wells. Since Lucerne-2 start up, we've seen line pressure produce by as much as 50 to 70 psi in the early part of July and that should be even greater as the plant reaches full capacity. 
Volumes through July averaged to more than 110,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with peak days greater than 115,000 per day. Additional infrastructure projects in the basin continue to progress on schedule as well, including the Grand Parkway low pressure gathering loop. The combination of all of these projects position the basin well, exiting 2015 and into 2016, and while we remain guarded in our production guidance until consistent midstream performance is seen, the early look is certainly very positive. 
Finally, in the Marcellus Shale, our operations continue to improve. Our drilling teams are performing extremely well, and we drilled our longest lateral ever as a company in the second quarter, nearly 14,000-foot horizontally. In addition, we're looking forward to the production results from our first Utica well before the end of the year. 
Given the price environment, we're further reducing drilling activity in the basin and alignment with our joint venture partner. In the middle part of the third quarter, operated horizontal drilling will be reduced to 0 rigs for the remainder of the year. And on the dry gas non-operated side, we anticipate going from 2 horizontal rigs to 0 early in the fourth quarter. These shifts in drilling do not impact our completion schedule for the remainder of 2015, and we are working with our partner on the right level of investment for 2016, with both companies focused on a cash-neutral program for the JV next year. 
Let me now been hand it back to Dave."

Over the last several months, we've worked diligently with the government on establishing a regulat",591,"Thanks, Gary. I want to spend a few minutes on the progress on the regulatory front in Israel and our upgraded 2015 outlook before opening for questions. 
Over the last several months, we've worked diligently with the government on establishing a regulatory framework to provide necessary certainty for future investments. The product is a comprehensive framework that addresses the needs and interest of all parties, including Noble Energy, the government and citizens of Israel and its neighbors who can all benefit from these abundant gas resources. Both the Prime Minister's Office and the Minister of Energy have endorsed the framework and are working to achieve final approval. For Noble Energy, this framework should provide certainty around regulatory and fiscal matters necessary to support future investment and the expansion of Tamar and the first phase of development at Leviathan. 
For Israel, it provides price transparency and market competition. These projects can develop additional gas supplies within the country and bring the financial and geopolitical benefits of regional exports. We continue to engage with future export customers in the region on the potential to deliver both Israeli and Cypriot gas to market. The opportunity for expansion of natural gas used in Israel and the demand for natural gas in the region remains strong. I look forward to unlocking tremendous unrecognized value in Noble as these projects come together. Company-wide, there are a number of positive catalysts in the second half of the year, which provides both near and long-term benefit. We are encouraged that production capacity in the DJ Basin will continue to respond positively as we benefit from important infrastructure expansion, while we focus on long laterals and additional completion learnings through the remainder of the year. 
As Gary mentioned, the integration of the Rosetta assets is going very well, with a strong second quarter, where volumes were higher and costs lower than expected, these assets are off to a great start and complementary to Noble's overall performance. Offshore, 2 new fields are anticipated to add 20,000 barrels equivalent per day by the end of the year in the Gulf of Mexico. In addition, we will have results from 2 material exploration prospects this quarter, including the 250 million barrel plus compact prospect in the Falkland Islands, and 100 million barrel plus Cheetah prospects in Cameroon. 
Success in either of these wells or with our Rhea well in the Falklands later this year with derisk additional exploration potential provide new development opportunities and add significant value for Noble Energy. As mentioned earlier, we are raising our previous full year 2015 volume guidance. I'm pleased we can see this amount of increase, while holding full year capital flat to original plan, and maintaining flexibility on our onshore activity should conditions and cash flow outlook change. 
We've also provided new quarterly guidance for the remainder of the year, which includes the integration of the Eagle Ford and Permian assets. Base guidance reflects a quarterly trend of lower capital and operating costs through the remainder of the year, while underlying volumes growth. 
Yes, these are tough times, but we are well positioned with exceptional asset and strong operating and financial capacity to navigate through these challenges no matter the duration. We've been very thoughtful in our decision processes throughout the year as we continue to maintain strong capital discipline and manage the cash flow in the second half of the year. I am convinced Noble Energy's future is very bright. 
At this time, we would like to go ahead and open the call to questions."

But overall, we're well positioned to bring capital down, continue to follow the trend that we've got into the fourth quarter this year, and then make sure we're managing through the outlook that we see."

I think what's very encouraging so far is that -- and think back about this. When you go back to over the last year, what's been accomplished. I mean the progress on getting to a framework has been nothing short of a tremendous effort on all parties -- party up the government that's been committed to doing this and on our team and our partners that have worked so hard to bring that to bear. I mean, a complete comprehensive framework that sets up the ability to go forward with confidence and investment is a big step.

As a result of how things have moved through the year, we actually  saw some of the Marcellus planned capital come down. We actually move some of that capital to the DJ.

But we continue to look for a periods, especially in any market upswings, which we'd like to see more of an a commodity basis. But as we get into some market upswings, how do we layer in some positions as we go forward? Our philosophy and objective has been to hedge up to 50% on those different streams for managing cash flow. I think with our legacy position on oil, we were about 30% for next year.

We don't typically make big moves all at one time, but average in, so we'll continue to look at that. And then we picked up the Rosetta hedge book as well, and they're pretty well hedged as well, about 35% for oil and 45% on gas production next year.

So that is all -- without Lucerne-2 running at full capacity yet, they haven't yet made it to the 200 million a day. In the meantime, as Dave mentioned, they've had another facility down for some planned maintenance, which took about 120 million a day out of the system capacity. So that's part of the reason we're still being a bit conservative for now until we see more than just a couple of days with some decent rates through the system.

I want to share with you why I continue to have great confidence in our business and strategy. While these are challenging times in our industry, it does not diminish the fact that Noble Energy has exceptional assets as well as the financial strength and operational excellence to realize their potential. Our positive momentum, including the recent closing of the Rosetta acquisition, gives us great optimism for the future as we continue to execute on our strategy of driving value from a high-quality diversified portfolio that provides investment choices. 
Our core competitive advantages continue to be focused in U.S. onshore unconventional development, combined with material offshore exploration and proven major project execution. Additionally, we have the financial strength to navigate through a volatile market and take advantage of opportunities. All oil and natural gas companies are facing choppy seas right now, but I believe investors are very well positioned with Noble Energy. We continue to effectively manage the things that are within our control and position the business for long-term value creation. Our diversified portfolio underpins strong performance in the second quarter. Volumes again exceeded expectations, and meaningful reductions are being realized on both capital and operating costs. Sales volumes were nearly 300,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, even with the impact of scheduled facility maintenance in both the Gulf of Mexico and West Africa. For the second time this year, we raised our Noble Energy legacy volume outlook for the full year. This is the result of our flexibility to reallocate capital throughout the year as we continue to see efficiency improvements in the DJ Basin program. Second quarter capital expenditures declined sequentially to under $800 million and we remain on track to meet our original $2.9 billion capital forecast. Our capital is trending lower quarterly through the year as we manage to cash flow in the second half of the year. 
I'm also extremely pleased with our progress in reducing cash costs, specifically in the onshore business, where lease operating expense was reduced to approximately $4 per barrel of oil equivalent in the quarter. This is down more than 20% from the first quarter. Total lease operating expense per barrel of oil equivalent for Noble Energy is now back to pre-2010 levels, reflecting our portfolio changes and an intense focus on reducing controllable costs. 
Operational execution continues to be an area of keen focus as we look to maximize long-term profitability with a number of major accomplishments achieved during the second quarter. This included onshore horizontal production growth of 45% versus the same quarter of last year and record low drilling times in both the DJ Basin and Marcellus Shale. Drilling complete costs, all in, are trending below targeted well costs in both plays.
In our offshore business, the Ashdod compression project in Israel has been completed, increasing our peak deliverability. And at the same time, pipeline installation and topside facility modifications are progressing as planned on Big Bend and Dantzler in the Gulf of Mexico. First production from these fields is expected in the fourth quarter and around the end of the year, respectively.  
On the offshore drilling side, we have 3 rigs currently operating. One progressing our Gunflint development, and 2 drilling material exploration wells, including prospects offshore of the Falkland Islands and Cameroon. So from an execution standpoint, I am pleased with how our business is operating. 
The acquisition of Rosetta enhances and further diversifies our onshore unconventional portfolio by adding 2 premiere, low-cost operating assets. Strong underlying asset performance results from other operators in and around our acreage as well as recent M&A activity in these basins continues to affirm the long-term value of our transaction. It was the right opportunity at the right time for Noble Energy. These high-quality assets provide prolific and low-cost production in the Eagle Ford with running room and a deep inventory of liquids-rich opportunities in the emerging Delaware basin. Without question, these new areas will have a substantial impact to Noble Energy. When you think about more than 60,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day of production, at least 1,800 identifiable locations, and around a billion barrels of oil equivalent potential, that's a very sizable business that can grow materially into the future. We've hit the ground running, and we're already seeing more value potential than we originally assumed. 
Combined, our Texas assets will deliver 15% compound annual growth for several years within the operating cash flows of this business. As such, we aren't pulling capital away from any of our other strong return opportunities, which is one reason this investment was so unique. 
As shown on Slide 3, we now have sizable position in 4 of the premier U.S. unconventional plays. This provides substantial flexibility in our future capital allocation and the ability to accelerate activity when appropriate. We will also realize about $40 million per year in G&A synergies, while taking advantage of Noble's lower cost of capital.  
Let me now hand it over to Gary to walk through an operations update."
292135,304432104,847070,"Noble Energy, Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2015",2015-08-03,"Earnings Calls","Noble Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Dave. I'd like to start off by sharing my thoughts on why the Rosetta acquisition was such a great move for Noble Energy. Our technical knowledge of these basins was built over the last several years as our business development and new venture tea",1692,"Thanks, Dave. I'd like to start off by sharing my thoughts on why the Rosetta acquisition was such a great move for Noble Energy. Our technical knowledge of these basins was built over the last several years as our business development and new venture teams assessed all of the best basins in the U.S. From this work, two things became apparent. First, we needed to focus our existing onshore U.S. portfolio on the DJ Basin and Marcellus Shale, which consistently ranked among the top basins. This caused us to exit a number of other plays over the last few years. Second, we wanted to be ready to further enhance our portfolio by capturing opportunities in other competitive basins then they became available. The Eagle Ford and Delaware basins are both top-tier plays, and we've now obtained premier positions in some of the best parts of each. 
Over the last few years, we have dramatically improved performance in the DJ Basin, and then transferred and accelerated those learnings in the Marcellus. With the addition of the Eagle Ford and Delaware positions, we are confident that our operational expertise will again unlock incremental value that otherwise would not have been delivered. Our acquisition model applied value almost entirely to the existing production, the lower Eagle Ford inventory and the upper Wolfcamp potential in the Delaware. We see a lot of room to increase value further from multi-zone development in both plays, refrack potential and additional locations that are not assumed in our current counts. 
The high-quality nature of our Eagle Ford assets is demonstrated on Slide 5. The map illustrates estimated recoveries per lateral foot in the basin. You can see the outline of our acreage, the largest being a core position in northern Webb County, where we will focus our Eagle Ford activity over the next few years. This is a sweet spot of some of the most productive rock in the play, with tremendous resource recoveries ranging between 1 million and 3 million barrels of oil equivalent per well based on a 5,000-foot lateral. We have highlighted in the table our current assumptions, including inventory accounts based on current strip pricing and assumed spacing, estimated ultimate recoveries and average well costs.
Highlighted on Slide 6 is the 3 million barrel equivalent type curve for South Gates Ranch, represented by the blue line. This is an increase of 25% from Rosetta's prior type curve, shown in red. The green line is the average of 2 recent wells, which are outpacing even our increased type curve by another 20%. 
We have provided our detailed Eagle Ford activity plans on Slide 7 showing accelerating well activity through at least 2018. Our plan is to focus on the lower Eagle Ford for the next few years, increasing well lateral links to an average of around 7,000 feet. We are currently drilling our first Eagle Ford well and have already implemented improvements that have materially increased footage drilled per day. 
Moving over to the Permian. This is an area where we see tremendous value and upside as we accelerate appraisal activities and move quickly to development mode. The Delaware is a emerging as a world-class basin with multi-zone potential. Development plans will include multi-well pad drilling, centralized production facilities and the potential for longer laterals, none of which were being done in the these assets. We will rapidly incorporate and leverage learnings from the DJ Basin and the Marcellus as we plan the long-term development of the basin. 
Our focus on the Permian will be on the Delaware basin position, which is a contiguous 45,000 net acres. In the DJ Basin, we've already experienced the significant value uplift that a large-scale systematic development approach can bring in terms of maximizing recoveries, lowering capital and operating costs and minimizing the aboveground impacts. 
On Slide 8, we have shown how this acreage compares to our DJ Basin East Pony IDP area in terms of size. And so this is clearly a material position for Noble. We've already identified over 1,200 gross locations based on current strip prices for development with 70% of these in the Wolfcamp A and 3rd Bone Spring and the remainder in Lower Wolfcamp zones. 
Highlighted on Slide 9 are recent Noble wells and those from other operators in and around our acreage. For the Noble wells, the peak 30-day average production rates from a normalized 5,000-foot lateral is nearly 1,300 barrels of oil equivalent per day on a two-stream basis, and more than 70% of this production is crude oil. These production rates are impressive and consistent with other operator results in the area. Similar to what we have shown for the Eagle Ford, we have provided our 700,000 barrel of oil equivalent type curve, again for a 5,000-foot lateral on Slide 10. This type curve is up 30% from Rosetta's previous type curve. Recent well performance represented by the 14 wells in the green line gives us a lot of confidence in the potential of these assets. 
We've also highlighted on this slide some of the anticipated operating efficiencies that Noble Energy will bring to these assets. You can see the substantial reduction in drilling cost per lateral foot that we have driven in the DJ Basin and Marcellus versus historical performance in these areas. Combining Noble's drilling expertise and knowledge of multi-zone developments with Rosetta's skill set and knowledge will no doubt deliver substantial operational improvements in the Delaware.
On Slide 11, we have provided our detailed plans for acceleration in the Permian, resulting in 70 wells drilled in 2018 and anticipating continued activity growth beyond that. Under the current plan, capital investment in the Delaware is essentially equivalent to the Eagle Ford beginning next year and exceeds the Eagle Ford beginning in 2018, with even earlier acceleration of the Delaware possible as our plans continued to evolve. 
Our outlook for the combined Texas assets has production growing to more than 100,000 barrels equivalent per day in 2018, as shown on Slide 12. We estimate substantial annual free cash flow at the end of our forecasted period, which would only provide additional investment flexibility. 
I'll now transition to the DJ Basin, where both our underlying operational performance and the infrastructure capacity continue to improve. Spud to rig release time averaged just over 6 days in the quarter for a standard length lateral. Last quarter, it was 7 days, which was already below our budgeted assumption for 2015. Dave mentioned well costs are trending under our target for the year. Second half 2015 all-in well costs, including drilling, completion and allocated facilities are expected to be $3.5 million in Wells Ranch and $3.9 million in East Pony. These are both $300,000 below our budgeted assumptions. In addition, when you normalize our long lateral well costs back to a normal length equivalent well, we are slightly below $3 million for these more capital efficient wells and roughly 60% of our drilling in the second half of this year will be extended laterals. 
With current rig efficiencies and 4 rigs for the rest of the year, we expect to drill a total of 240 equivalent wells in 2015 compared to our original budget expectation of about 200, with the same number of rigs. That's an amazing increase in performance and a key contributor to our 2015 production uplift. 
On the completion side, we continue to optimize stage links, profit loads and fluid types across our IDPs. Most recently, we've seen very strong performance utilizing slickwater in East Pony, with the majority of these wells outperforming similar hybrid gel completions nearby. Our success and growth in East Pony has been tremendous. Net production in the East Pony IDP is now approximately 25,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up 100% from this time a year ago. And as a reminder, more than 75% of East Pony volumes are oil. 
At the end of the second quarter, third-party infrastructure in Greater Wattenberg got a much-needed boost with the start-up of DCP's Lucerne-2 gas processing plant, which is ramping to full capacity of 200 million cubic feet per day. The addition of Lucerne-2 is increasing third-party gas capacity on the DCP system by 1/3 to a total of 800 million cubic feet per day. Now earlier this year in certain parts of the field, line pressures averaged north of 250 psi, which created a tough producing environment for many of the legacy vertical and horizontal wells. Since Lucerne-2's start up, we've seen line pressures reduced by as much as 50 to 70 psi in the early part of July, and that should be even greater as the plant reaches full capacity. 
Volumes through July averaged more than 110,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with peak days greater than 115,000 per day. Additional infrastructure projects in the basin continue to progress on schedule as well, including the Grand Parkway low pressure gathering loop. The combination of all of these projects position the basin well exiting 2015 and into 2016, and while we remain guarded in our production guidance until consistent midstream performance is seen, the early look is certainly very positive. 
Finally, in the Marcellus Shale, our operations continue to improve. Our drilling teams are performing extremely well, and we drilled our longest lateral ever as a company in the second quarter, nearly 14,000-foot horizontally. In addition, we're looking forward to production results from our first Utica well before the end of the year. 
Given the price environment, we're further reducing drilling activity in the basin in alignment with our joint venture partner. In the middle part of the third quarter, operated horizontal drilling will be reduced to 0 rigs for the remainder of the year. And on the dry gas non-operated side, we anticipate going from 2 horizontal rigs to 0 early in the fourth quarter. These shifts in drilling do not impact our completion schedule for the remainder of 2015, and we are working with our partner on the right level of investment for 2016, with both companies focused on a cash-neutral program for the JV next year. 
Let me now been hand it back to Dave."

Over the last several months, we've worked diligently with the government on establishing a regulat",591,"Thanks, Gary. I want to spend a few minutes on the progress on the regulatory front in Israel and our upgraded 2015 outlook before opening for questions. 
Over the last several months, we've worked diligently with the government on establishing a regulatory framework to provide necessary certainty for future investments. The product is a comprehensive framework that addresses the needs and interests of all parties, including Noble Energy, the government and citizens of Israel and its neighbors who can all benefit from these abundant gas resources. Both the Prime Minister's Office and the Minister of Energy have endorsed the framework and are working to achieve final approval. For Noble Energy, this framework should provide certainty around regulatory and fiscal matters necessary to support future investment in the expansion of Tamar and the first phase of development at Leviathan. 
For Israel, it provides price transparency and market competition. These projects can develop additional gas supplies within the country and bring the financial and geopolitical benefits of regional exports. We continue to engage with future export customers in the region on the potential to deliver both Israeli and Cypriot gas to market. The opportunity for expansion of natural gas use in Israel and the demand for natural gas in the region remains strong. I look forward to unlocking tremendous unrecognized value in Noble as these projects come together. Company-wide, there are a number of positive catalysts in the second half of the year, which provide both near and long-term benefit. We are encouraged that production capacity in the DJ Basin will continue to respond positively as we benefit from important infrastructure expansions, while we focus on long laterals and additional completion learnings through the remainder of the year. 
As Gary mentioned, the integration of the Rosetta assets is going very well. With a strong second quarter, where volumes were higher and costs lower than expected, these assets are off to a great start and complementary to Noble's overall performance. Offshore, 2 new fields are anticipated to add 20,000 barrels equivalent per day by the end of the year in the Gulf of Mexico. In addition, we will have results from 2 material exploration prospects this quarter, including the 250 million barrel plus Humpback prospect in the Falkland Islands, and 100 million barrel plus Cheetah prospect in Cameroon. 
Success in either of these wells, or with our Rhea well in the Falklands, later this year would derisk additional exploration potential, provide new development opportunities and add significant value for Noble Energy. As mentioned earlier, we are raising our previous full year 2015 volume guidance. I'm pleased we can see this amount of increase, while holding full year capital flat to original plans, and maintaining flexibility in our onshore activity should conditions and cash flow outlook change. 
We've also provided new quarterly guidance for the remainder of the year, which includes the integration of the Eagle Ford and Permian assets. Base guidance reflects a quarterly trend of lower capital and operating costs through the remainder of the year, while underlying volumes grow. 
Yes, these are tough times, but we are well positioned with exceptional assets and strong operating and financial capacity to navigate through these challenges no matter the duration. We've been very thoughtful in our decision processes throughout the year as we continue to maintain strong capital discipline and manage to cash flow in the second half of the year. I am convinced Noble Energy's future is very bright. 
At this time, we would like to go ahead and open the call to questions."

When you go back to what we've started the year, we ramped down the -- and pushed down the Marcellus program pretty quickly. We very quickly reduced activity levels in the DJ from 10 rigs to 4. We level loaded and kind of slowed down some of our completion activity until we could get Lucerne-2 in place. As a result of how things have moved through the year, we actually  saw some of the Marcellus planned capital come down. We actually moved some of that capital to the DJ. Part of that was a reflection on just the continued improvement on efficiency. We've talked before about those 4 rigs are drilling about 70% of the total lateral footage that we did with 10 rigs. So that's all enabled us to where the real driver in the second half of the year, and the biggest driver in that increased guidance, is the outlook on this activity and performance in the DJ."

Our philosophy and objective has been to hedge up to 50% on those different streams for managing cash flow. I think with our legacy position on oil, we were about 30% for next year.

In the meantime, as Dave mentioned, they've had another facility down for some planned maintenance, which took about 120 million a day out of the system capacity.

292135,311922481,889167,"Noble Energy, Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2015",2015-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Noble Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Brad. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We had a great quarter, and as you can see from our operating results, we were able to achieve more while spending less. Before discussing specific items, I want to take a moment",1705,"Thanks, Brad. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We had a great quarter, and as you can see from our operating results, we were able to achieve more while spending less. 
Before discussing specific items, I want to take a moment to reflect on the quarter. First, I'm extremely pleased with the fact that we were able to significantly reduce capital and controllable cost while still delivering outstanding organic volume growth. Second, it is notable that discretionary cash flow was greater than our capital this quarter. And third, we saw continued capital efficiencies in our onshore program supporting returns and margin improvements in the business. This all positions us extremely well for finishing the year strong and beginning 2016 even stronger. 
Starting the rest of our discussion with capital expenditures. We continue the trend of reducing our quarterly capital. This has come not only from adjusting our activity levels but also from our relentless focus on increasing operating efficiencies and driving down well cost. Capital expenditures for the third quarter were down approximately 20% from the second quarter of this year and 50% from the first quarter. This was accomplished despite the incremental capital allocated to our new Texas assets beginning this quarter. We've made great progress towards our goal of aligning capital with cash flows. Full year 2015 capital has now been reduced to slightly less than $3 billion, approximately $100 million under previous expectations. While working the capital side of the business, we've put an equal effort into bringing controllable unit cost down. We reduced third quarter lease operating expense and total production cost per barrel of oil equivalent to their lowest level in 5 years. These results have been delivered while maintaining a best-in-class safety record and the lowest recordable incident rate in our history. So I couldn't be more pleased with the efforts of our business units. 
Operationally, we've continued our tremendous momentum. Sales volumes for the third quarter totaled 379,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, substantially outperforming both original guidance and our raised expectations. I am pleased that each asset in the portfolio delivered higher volumes than our original forecast for the third quarter, and we're carrying that overall momentum into the fourth quarter. We have raised fourth quarter volumes now to range between 385,000 and 405,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. 
A major contributor to our performance has been the DJ Basin. The operating teams have done an amazing job enhancing value by realizing material efficiency gains, drilling longer laterals and improving completion techniques. Third quarter sales volumes averaged a record 116,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and total liquids production was a quarterly record as well, up 10,000 barrels per day from a year ago, most of which is crude volumes. This quarter, we saw the positive impact of the late June start-up of DCP's Lucerne-2-plant. Lower line pressures helped our legacy vertical production, which average 25,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day during the quarter. This is an increase of more than 5,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day above pre-Lucerne-2 rates. 
Additional infrastructure build-out continues with the Grand Parkway low pressure line loop system. This project is on schedule for start-up at the end of this year or early next year and will further improve gas infrastructure reliability in the basin. Drilling performance continues to be exceptional, and we have lowered spud-to-rig release time from standard lateral wells to between 5 and 6 days. Total well costs, including allocated facilities capital, are on track to be below $3.5 million in Wells Ranch for a standard lateral. We're also on track to be less than $3 million for a normalized long lateral. We've continued to modify completion techniques and we're seeing good success with slick water fluid completions in certain areas. 
On Slide 8, we have highlighted a recent development area, which includes our first slick water wells in Wells Ranch. Early results show strong production performance and lower overall well cost. During the quarter, we closed on the merger with Rosetta resources, which established a new core operating positions for Noble Energy in the Eagle Ford and Delaware basin. While still early, initial results show that we're materially enhancing the value of these assets. This closing, we drilled 7 lower Eagle Ford wells and 1 Delaware Wolfcamp A well. We have already substantially reduced spud-to-rig release times in both plays. In the Eagle Ford, spud to rig release times averaged 8 days for a 5,000-foot lateral, a reduction of approximately 30% from the average on these assets earlier this year. In our first operated well in the Delaware basin, we drilled 10 days faster than the average of prior wells on our acreage. 
Production performance in the lower Eagle Ford remains very strong. We've highlighted on Slide 9 the 2 most recent well results, which are Noble Energy's initial designed and executed completions in Eagle Ford. They include modified completion designs versus the historical practice on these assets. Both wells are performing materially above the 3 million-barrel type curve for the area. In fact, the most recent wells, which is still in flow back, looks to be the best well ever completed on the acreage. 
These are strong and improving early results. Highlighting the very productive nature of this acreage position and the value from Noble's technical expertise. Moving forward, we have plans to continue testing enhanced completion designs, including reduced stage and cluster spacing that we've brought from our other onshore plays. We anticipate a 1-rig program in the Eagle Ford and a 1-rig program in the Delaware as we exit this year. 
Now turning to our offshore operations. Both Big Bend and Dantzler recently commenced production. I want to commend our exploration, appraisal and development teams for their outstanding performance on this project. Delivering both fields ahead of schedule and on budget extends our exceptional track record of major project execution and highlights the competitive advantage for Noble. Production is quickly ramping to an expected combined gross maximum rate of over 40,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day or about 20,000 per day net to Noble. In fact, Big Bend is already tested close to full rate over the weekend, and Dantzler should ramp-up quickly as well. These fields are major contributors to our fourth quarter and 2016 cash flow and oil volume growth. 
At Gunflint, the rig has completed drilling operations and well completions are underway. Installation of pipelines and subsea equipment has began. And first production remains on schedule for mid 2016. 
Moving to West Africa. Our operated projects at both word and word continues to outperform internal estimates. The non-operated Alba compression project, which will stem fill decline and extent productive resource life advance to over 80% complete and is on schedule for start up mid next year. As expected, temporary Alba field shut-in while installing the compression module will result in a sizable impact to both first and the second quarter 2016 sales volume. 
On the exploration front. Our initial operated well offshore in the Falkland Islands provides substantial knowledge about the petroleum system. We will use well results to recalibrate the seismic interpretation. The Humpback play was just one of several play types across our vast 10 million acres. At the end of the year or beginning of next year, we will drilled the Rhea Prospect in the northern license area, which is adjacent to proven oil discoveries. Results should be available toward the end of the first quarter. 
In Israel, our natural gas sales averaged a record 305 million cubic feet of gas per day during the third quarter, an increase of 15% for the same period last year. For the month of August and most of September, the field averaged over 1 billion cubic feet per day, and stellar operational performance continued within nearly 100% uptime of the facilities. Marketing efforts in the Eastern Mediterranean continuous where original demand for our natural gas remains strong. The recent Egyptian discovery by another operator, which is targeted to domestic Egyptian use for power and industrials has heightened the interest in the basin. Regional customers remain undersupplied by almost 4 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day now, and we estimate that shortfall growing to 9 billion cubic feet per day by 2025. The proven reliability and performance of Tamar, along with the fully appraised and flow tested Leviathan field, have us well positioned to supply gas to this undersupplied region. 
During the third quarter, a number of significant steps were completed to provide a clear line of sight for the next round of project developments in the region. The regulatory framework for hydrocarbon development was finalized and approved by the Israeli cabinet and the word. In Israeli government is currently taking action to follow through on this framework. Yesterday's announcement from the Prime Minister's Office is a further indication that the commitment to moving forward with gas development. 
So as we are approaching 2016, we intend to be cash flow neutral or better while maintaining long-term operational capacity. Our diversified portfolio provides exceptional investment optionality, and we will continue to be extremely disciplined and diligent in our capital allocation process. Next year's onshore capital program will again, focus on those activities with the highest returns and value. Our positions in the DJ Basin and Texas should continue to attract the majority of our investment. Offshore capital will mainly be attributed to 1 rig to our 1 rig exploration and appraisal program in the Gulf of Mexico until Israel projects are sanctioned. While exploration capital will remain lower in 2016 and previous years, we believe this is a great environment to enhance and deepen our exploration inventory of high-quality opportunities at a relatively low cost of entry. Although production growth is not the focus, our 2016 volumes will likely be higher than pro forma 2015 levels. The momentum of our business can deliver this at significantly lower capital program within this year. As I mentioned at the beginning of my comments, we intend to continue achieving more while spending less. I believe we are well positioned to build a great future. With that, Jamie, I'd like to open the call for questions."

We've talked about many times in the past how we're constantly looking for ways to improve our completions out there and also how we don't expect 1 optimal completion design to work across the entire field is likely to be different depending on where we're operating at any given time. So where we've been focusing the slick water completion most recently is in East Pony and Wells Ranch, which is the oiler parts of the field. We haven't really had that much activity back in the core gassy part of Wattenberg recently. So too early to say whether slick water provide some benefit there in the future. Again, we're focused on Wells Ranch and East Pony right now. But we're seeing some very nice results. There's a slide in the pack that shows an area of Wells Ranch where we've got a number of slick water wells that are significantly outperforming the oil hybrid gels in those area. We're seeing similar results in East Pony, and we'll continue to test that as we go forward. And it also reduces our well cost by about $400,000 per well. So it's a performance today."

So reduced stage and cluster spacing that's most recent wells that we expect to be the best ever is a reduced stage and cluster spacing well, roughly 2,000 pounds of sand per foot, and like I said, performing very well.

Before discussing specific items, I want to take a moment",1704,"Thanks, Brad. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We had a great quarter, and as you can see from our operating results, we were able to achieve more while spending less. 
Before discussing specific items, I want to take a moment to reflect on the quarter. First, I'm extremely pleased with the fact that we were able to significantly reduce capital and controllable cost while still delivering outstanding organic volume growth. Second, it is notable that discretionary cash flow was greater than our capital this quarter. And third, we saw continued capital efficiencies in our onshore program, supporting returns and margin improvements in the business. This all positions us extremely well for finishing the year strong and beginning 2016 even stronger. 
Starting the rest of our discussion with capital expenditures. We continue the trend of reducing our quarterly capital. This has come not only from adjusting our activity levels but also from our relentless focus on increasing operating efficiencies and driving down well cost. Capital expenditures for the third quarter were down approximately 20% from the second quarter of this year and 50% from the first quarter. This was accomplished despite the incremental capital allocated to our new Texas assets beginning this quarter. We've made great progress towards our goal of aligning capital with cash flows. Full year 2015 capital has now been reduced to slightly less than $3 billion, approximately $100 million under previous expectations. While working the capital side of the business, we've put an equal effort into bringing controllable unit cost down. We reduced third quarter lease operating expense and total production cost per barrel of oil equivalent to their lowest level in 5 years. These results have been delivered while maintaining a best-in-class safety record and the lowest recordable incident rate in our history. So I couldn't be more pleased with the efforts of our business units. 
Operationally, we've continued our tremendous momentum. Sales volumes for the third quarter totaled 379,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, substantially outperforming both original guidance and our raised expectations. I am pleased that each asset in the portfolio delivered higher volumes than our original forecast for the third quarter, and we're carrying that overall momentum into the fourth quarter. We have raised fourth quarter volumes now to range between 385,000 and 405,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. 
A major contributor to our performance has been the DJ Basin. The operating teams have done an amazing job enhancing value by realizing material efficiency gains, drilling longer laterals and improving completion techniques. Third quarter sales volumes averaged a record 116,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, and total liquids production was a quarterly record as well, up 10,000 barrels per day from a year ago, most of which is crude volumes. This quarter, we saw the positive impact of the late June start-up of DCP's Lucerne-2-plant. Lower line pressures helped our legacy vertical production, which averaged 25,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day during the quarter. This is an increase of more than 5,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day above pre-Lucerne-2 rates. 
Additional infrastructure build-out continues with the Grand Parkway low-pressure line-loop system. This project is on schedule for start-up at the end of this year or early next year and will further improve gas infrastructure reliability in the basin. Drilling performance continues to be exceptional, and we have lowered spud-to-rig release time from standard lateral wells to between 5 and 6 days. Total well costs, including allocated facilities capital, are on track to be below $3.5 million in Wells Ranch for a standard lateral. We're also on track to be less than $3 million for a normalized long lateral. We've continued to modify completion techniques and we are seeing good success with slick water fluid completions in certain areas. 
On Slide 8, we have highlighted a recent development area, which includes our first slick water wells in Wells Ranch. Early results show strong production performance and lower overall well cost. During the quarter, we closed on the merger with Rosetta resources, which established the new core operating positions for Noble Energy in the Eagle Ford and Delaware basins. While still early, initial results show that we are materially enhancing the value of these assets. Its closing, we drilled 7 lower Eagle Ford wells and 1 Delaware Wolfcamp A well. We have already substantially reduced spud-to-rig release times in both plays. In the Eagle Ford, spud-to-rig release times averaged 8 days for a 5,000-foot lateral, a reduction of approximately 30% from the average on these assets earlier this year. And our first operated well in the Delaware basin was drilled 10 days faster than the average of prior wells on our acreage. 
Production performance in the lower Eagle Ford remains very strong. We've highlighted on Slide 9 the 2 most recent well results, which are Noble Energy's initial, designed and executed completions in the Eagle Ford. They include modified completion designs versus the historical practice on these assets. Both wells are performing materially above the 3 million-barrel type curve for the area. In fact, the most recent wells, which is still in flow back, looks to be the best well ever completed on the acreage. 
These are strong and improving early results, highlighting the very productive nature of this acreage position and the value from Noble's technical expertise. Moving forward, we have plans to continue testing enhanced completion designs, including reduced stage and cluster spacing that we've brought from our other onshore plays. We anticipate a 1-rig program in the Eagle Ford and a 1-rig program in the Delaware as we exit this year. 
Now turning to our offshore operations. Both Big Bend and Dantzler recently commenced production. I want to commend our exploration, appraisal and development teams for their outstanding performance on this project. Delivering both fields ahead of schedule and on budget extends our exceptional track record of major project execution and highlights the competitive advantage for Noble. Production is quickly ramping to an expected combined gross maximum rate of over 40,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day or about 20,000 per day net to Noble. In fact, Big Bend is already tested close to full rate over the weekend, and Dantzler should ramp up quickly as well. These fields are major contributors to our fourth quarter and 2016 cash flow and oil volume growth. 
At Gunflint, the rig has completed drilling operations, and well completions are underway. Installation of pipelines and subsea equipment has begun. And first production remains on schedule for mid-2016. 
Moving to West Africa. Our operated projects at both Aseng and Alen continued to outperform internal estimates. The nonoperated Alba compression project, which will stem fill decline and extend productive resource life, advance to over 80% complete and is on schedule for start up mid next year. As expected, temporary Alba field shut-in while installing the compression module will result, in a sizable impact to both first and second quarter 2016 sales volumes. 
On the exploration front. Our initial operated well offshore in the Falkland Islands provides substantial knowledge about the petroleum system. We will use well results to recalibrate the seismic interpretation. The Humpback play was just one of several play types across our vast 10 million acres. At the end of the year or beginning of next year, we will drill the Rhea prospect in the northern license area, which is adjacent to proven oil discoveries. Results should be available toward the end of the first quarter. 
In Israel, our natural gas sales averaged a record 305 million cubic feet of gas per day during the third quarter, an increase of 15% for the same period last year. For the month of August and most of September, the field averaged over 1 billion cubic feet per day, and stellar operational performance continued with nearly 100% uptime at the facilities. Marketing efforts in the Eastern Mediterranean continue where regional demand for our natural gas remains strong. The recent Egyptian discovery by another operator, which is targeted to domestic Egyptian use for power and industrials has heightened the interest in the basin. Regional customers remain undersupplied by almost 4 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day now, and we estimate that shortfall growing to 9 billion cubic feet per day by 2025. The proven reliability and performance at Tamar, along with the fully appraised and flow tested Leviathan field, have us well positioned to supply gas to this undersupplied region. 
During the third quarter, a number of significant steps were completed to provide a clear line of sight for the next round of project developments in the region. The regulatory framework for hydrocarbon development was finalized and approved by the Israeli cabinet and the Knesset. And the Israeli government is currently taking action to follow through on this framework. Yesterday's announcement from the Prime Minister's office is a further indication of the commitment to moving forward with gas development. 
So as we're approaching 2016, we intend to be cash flow neutral or better while maintaining long-term operational capacity. Our diversified portfolio provides exceptional investment optionality, and we will continue to be extremely disciplined and diligent in our capital allocation process. Next year's onshore capital program will again focus on those activities with the highest returns and value. Our positions in the DJ Basin and Texas should continue to attract the majority of our investment. Offshore capital will mainly be attributed to 1 rig -- to our 1 rig exploration and appraisal program in the Gulf of Mexico until Israel projects are sanctioned. While exploration capital will remain lower in 2016 and previous years, we believe this is a great environment to enhance and deepen our exploration inventory of high-quality opportunities at a relatively low cost of entry. Although production growth is not the focus, our 2016 volumes will likely be higher than pro forma 2015 levels. The momentum of our business can deliver this at significantly lower capital program within this year. As I mentioned at the beginning of my comments, we intend to continue achieving more while spending less. I believe we are well positioned to build a great future. With that, Jamie, I'd like to open the call for questions."

We've talked about many times in the past how we're constantly looking for ways to improve our completions out there and also how we don't expect one optimal completion design to work across the entire field is likely to be different depending on where we're operating at any given time. So where we've been focusing the slick water completions most recently is in East Pony and Wells Ranch, which is the oiler parts of the field. We haven't really had that much activity back in the core gassy part of Wattenberg recently. So too early to say whether slick waters might provide some benefit there in the future. Again, we're focused on Wells Ranch and East Pony right now. But we're seeing some very nice results. There's a slide in the pack that shows an area of Wells Ranch where we've got a number of slick water wells that are significantly outperforming the old hybrid gels in those areas. We're seeing similar results in East Pony, and we'll continue to test that as we go forward. And it also reduces our well cost by about $400,000 per well. So it's a good performance to-date."

And for example, in the DJ, we ramped down pretty quickly on activity. We brought the Marcellus and that alignment with our partner in the Marcellus to bring down activity there. Start to see some of the roll off in getting to the completion of some of the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico projects. So not a huge surprise to us, I think the other element there though, we started to see actual cost per well come down pretty dramatically, too. So that factored in, too. I guess being a little ahead of where we expected to be by that time in the third quarter, and you're seeing all of that carry over into the fourth quarter. I think as far as read through the next year, I mean, it's still too early to give out any specifics. But I think as we mentioned earlier, we're going to be managing within cash flow for next year.

So we don't have a big inventory. We've probably got probably 20,000 acres or so of Utica position that we've brought in along with our partners. We picked up additional acreage out in the basin, but we're probably in the early stages of us doing that.  Gary may have some other insights from his perspective."

We had a great quarter, and as you can see from our operating results, we were able to achieve more while spending less. 
Before discussing specific items, I want to take a moment to reflect on the quarter. First, I'm extremely pleased with the fact that we were able to significantly reduce capital and controllable cost while still delivering outstanding organic volume growth. Second, it is notable that discretionary cash flow was greater than our capital this quarter. And third, we saw continued capital efficiencies in our onshore program, supporting returns and margin improvements in the business. This all positions us extremely well for finishing the year strong and beginning 2016 even stronger. 
Starting the rest of our discussion with capital expenditures. We continue the trend of reducing our quarterly capital. This has come not only from adjusting our activity levels but also from our relentless focus on increasing operating efficiencies and driving down well cost. Capital expenditures for the third quarter were down approximately 20% from the second quarter of this year and 50% from the first quarter. This was accomplished despite the incremental capital allocated to our new Texas assets beginning this quarter. We've made great progress towards our goal of aligning capital with cash flows. Full year 2015 capital has now been reduced to slightly less than $3 billion, approximately $100 million under previous expectations. While working the capital side of the business, we've put an equal effort into bringing controllable unit cost down. We reduced third quarter lease operating expense and total production cost per barrel of oil equivalent to their lowest level in 5 years. These results have been delivered while maintaining a best-in-class safety record and the lowest recordable incident rate in our history. So I couldn't be more pleased with the efforts of our business units. 
Operationally, we've continued our tremendous momentum. Sales volumes for the third quarter totaled 379,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, substantially outperforming both original guidance and our raised expectations. I am pleased that each asset in the portfolio delivered higher volumes than our original forecast for the third quarter, and we're carrying that overall momentum into the fourth quarter. We have raised fourth quarter volumes now to range between 385,000 and 405,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. 
A major contributor to our performance has been the DJ Basin. The operating teams have done an amazing job enhancing value by realizing material efficiency gains, drilling longer laterals and improving completion techniques. Third quarter sales volumes averaged a record 116,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, and total liquids production was a quarterly record as well, up 10,000 barrels per day from a year ago, most of which is crude volumes. 
This quarter, we saw the positive impact of the late June start-up of DCP's Lucerne-2-plant. Lower line pressures helped our legacy vertical production, which averaged 25,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day during the quarter. This is an increase of more than 5,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day above pre-Lucerne-2 rates. 
Additional infrastructure build-out continues with the Grand Parkway low-pressure line-loop system. This project is on schedule for start-up at the end of this year or early next year and will further improve gas infrastructure reliability in the basin. Drilling performance continues to be exceptional, and we have lowered spud-to-rig release time from standard lateral wells to between 5 and 6 days. Total well costs, including allocated facilities capital, are on track to be below $3.5 million in Wells Ranch for a standard lateral. We're also on track to be less than $3 million for a normalized long lateral. We've continued to modify completion techniques and we are seeing good success with slick water fluid completions in certain areas. 
On Slide 8, we have highlighted a recent development area, which includes our first slick water wells in Wells Ranch. Early results show strong production performance and lower overall well cost. During the quarter, we closed on the merger with Rosetta Resources, which established the new core operating positions for Noble Energy in the Eagle Ford and Delaware basins. While still early, initial results show that we are materially enhancing the value of these assets. Since closing, we drilled 7 lower Eagle Ford wells and 1 Delaware Wolfcamp A well. We have already substantially reduced spud-to-rig release times in both plays. In the Eagle Ford, spud-to-rig release times averaged 8 days for a 5,000-foot lateral, a reduction of approximately 30% from the average on these assets earlier this year. And our first operated well in the Delaware basin was drilled 10 days faster than the average of prior wells on our acreage. 
Production performance in the lower Eagle Ford remains very strong. We've highlighted on Slide 9 the 2 most recent well results, which are Noble Energy's initial, designed and executed completions in the Eagle Ford. They include modified completion designs versus the historical practice on these assets. Both wells are performing materially above the 3 million-barrel type curve for the area. In fact, the most recent wells, which is still in flow back, looks to be the best well ever completed on the acreage. 
These are strong and improving early results, highlighting the very productive nature of this acreage position and the value from Noble's technical expertise. Moving forward, we have plans to continue testing enhanced completion designs, including reduced stage and cluster spacing that we've brought from our other onshore plays. We anticipate a 1-rig program in the Eagle Ford and a 1-rig program in the Delaware as we exit this year. 
Now turning to our offshore operations. Both Big Bend and Dantzler recently commenced production. I want to commend our exploration, appraisal and development teams for their outstanding performance on this project. Delivering both fields ahead of schedule and on budget extends our exceptional track record of major project execution and highlights the competitive advantage for Noble. Production is quickly ramping to an expected combined gross maximum rate of over 40,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day or about 20,000 per day net to Noble. In fact, Big Bend is already tested close to full rate over the weekend, and Dantzler should ramp up quickly as well. These fields are major contributors to our fourth quarter and 2016 cash flow and oil volume growth. 
At Gunflint, the rig has completed drilling operations, and well completions are underway. Installation of pipelines and subsea equipment has begun. And first production remains on schedule for mid-2016. 
Moving to West Africa. Our operated projects at both Aseng and Alen continued to outperform internal estimates. The nonoperated Alba compression project, which will stem fill decline and extend productive resource life, advanced to over 80% complete and is on schedule for startup mid- next year. As expected, temporary Alba field shut-in while installing the compression module will result in a sizable impact to both first and second quarter 2016 sales volumes. 
On the exploration front. Our initial operated well offshore in the Falkland Islands provides substantial knowledge about the petroleum system. We will use well results to recalibrate the seismic interpretation. The Humpback play was just one of several play types across our vast 10 million acres. At the end of the year or beginning of next year, we will drill the Rhea prospect in the northern license area, which is adjacent to proven oil discoveries. Results should be available toward the end of the first quarter. 
In Israel, our natural gas sales averaged a record 305 million cubic feet of gas per day during the third quarter, an increase of 15% for the same period last year. For the month of August and most of September, the field averaged over 1 billion cubic feet per day, and stellar operational performance continued with nearly 100% uptime at the facilities. Marketing efforts in the Eastern Mediterranean continue where regional demand for our natural gas remains strong. 
The recent Egyptian discovery by another operator, which is targeted to domestic Egyptian use for power and industrials has heightened the interest in the basin. Regional customers remain undersupplied by almost 4 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day now, and we estimate that shortfall growing to 9 billion cubic feet per day by 2025. The proven reliability and performance at Tamar, along with the fully appraised and flow tested Leviathan field, have us well positioned to supply gas to this undersupplied region. 
During the third quarter, a number of significant steps were completed to provide a clear line of sight for the next round of project developments in the region. The regulatory framework for hydrocarbon development was finalized and approved by the Israeli cabinet and the Knesset. And the Israeli government is currently taking action to follow through on this framework. Yesterday's announcement from the Prime Minister's office is a further indication of the commitment to moving forward with gas development. 
So as we're approaching 2016, we intend to be cash flow neutral or better while maintaining long-term operational capacity. Our diversified portfolio provides exceptional investment optionality, and we will continue to be extremely disciplined and diligent in our capital allocation process. Next year's onshore capital program will again focus on those activities with the highest returns and value. Our positions in the DJ Basin and Texas should continue to attract the majority of our investment. Offshore capital will mainly be attributed to 1 rig -- to our 1-rig exploration and appraisal program in the Gulf of Mexico until Israel projects are sanctioned. While exploration capital will remain lower in 2016 than previous years, we believe this is a great environment to enhance and deepen our exploration inventory of high-quality opportunities at a relatively low cost of entry. Although production growth is not the focus, our 2016 volumes will likely be higher than pro forma 2015 levels. The momentum of our business can deliver this at significantly lower capital program within this year. As I mentioned at the beginning of my comments, we intend to continue achieving more while spending less. I believe we are well positioned to build a great future. With that, Jamie, I'd like to open the call for questions."

And then at the same time, while we maintain the financial strength, we're going to watch and make sure we're keeping the operational capacity such that, as things do turn around and we get into a higher price environment, we're well positioned to be able to take advantage of that very quickly.

So where we've been focusing the slick water completions most recently is in East Pony and Wells Ranch, which is the oiler part of the field. We haven't really had that much activity back in the core gassy part of Wattenberg recently. So too early to say whether slick waters might provide some benefit there in the future. Again, we're focused on Wells Ranch and East Pony right now. But we're seeing some very nice results. There's a slide in the pack that shows an area of Wells Ranch where we've got a number of slick water wells that are significantly outperforming the old hybrid gels in those areas. We're seeing similar results in East Pony, and we'll continue to test that as we go forward. And it also reduces our well cost by about $400,000 per well. So it's a good performance to-date."

And then getting all the agreements with the owners of the pipeline in place and gas moving. But as far as physical activity to move gas, it doesn't take much, I don't think."

On the macro front, how closely linked in your mind are changes in commodity prices for changes in CapEx, so that's first. And then second on the micro front, just back up to the DJ and the slick water fracs. Can we think of applying this to the majority of the Wells Ranch wells and even at the longer lateral lengths?

That's where most of our activities going to be next year anyway. As far as the long laterals, we're certainly pumping slick water on long laterals, I would say, on the longest laterals, the 9,000-foot type wells, we're still pumping gelled hybrid in those first few stages in the tow just because if we have a screen-out situation, it's a bit more problematic and costly to get those cleaned out. So we want to make sure we can carry the sand whole way, but otherwise, we're pumping slick water on the majority of those as well."
