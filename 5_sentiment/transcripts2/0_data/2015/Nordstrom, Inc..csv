As we reflect on the year, we consider 2014 to be a watershed moment in our company history, with the successful entry into Canada; expansion of the Rack business through store growth and the launch of NordstromRac",1071,"Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. As we reflect on the year, we consider 2014 to be a watershed moment in our company history, with the successful entry into Canada; expansion of the Rack business through store growth and the launch of NordstromRack.com; the acquisition of the Trunk Club; and the decision to explore the potential sale of our credit receivables. These milestones are the outcome of our strategy, which is squarely focused on serving customers on their terms and delivering the Nordstrom experience that they expect from us. 
Several years ago, we began our path to accelerate growth in multiple channels, as we evolve with the changing needs of our customers. In 2014, we delivered tangible results in executing our strategy over the last several years. Today, we made Fortune's list of World's Most Admired Companies, ranking #14 overall and leading in our category. We continued to see the ongoing evolution of retail, with the accelerated growth of e-commerce, the continuing important of stores and the increasing customer interaction between them. Customers increasingly expect a personalized experience that merges the richness of stores with the convenience of online. We're uniquely positioned to serve customers through our focus on service, product and capabilities. 
We also believe we are competitively advantaged at serving customers better through our multiple touch points in full-price, off-price, stores and online. As a result, we have more customers shopping with us and more customers shopping 2 or more channels. This is meaningful as customers are shopping multiple channels than more and demonstrate for your loyalty. 
In 2014, we reached an important milestone with the Rack representing our biggest source of new customers, attracting nearly 4 million. Additionally, about 1/3 of our Rack customers also shopped in our full-line full-price business. A year ago, we enabled customers to reach our purchases from HauteLook and Nordstromrack.com at any of our Rack stores. This similar capability drove nearly 1 million in incremental trips to our Rack stores. 
In 2014, we expanded our capabilities to ensure we're relevant today and in the future. Our first store in Calgary far exceeded our expectations, reflecting a multiyear effort from our team to address the unique challenges [indiscernible]. In the U.S., we increased our presence with 2 full-in stores in Jacksonville, Florida and Houston, Texas. We feature our award-winning design concepts that incorporate flexibility and life. 
In Rack, we reached a record number of 27 store openings, which contributed to Rack's total sales growth of 17%. 
We've expanded our capabilities for the acquisition of HauteLook in 2011, which has grown nearly 150% in 3 years. 
HauteLook launched Nordstromrack.com in the spring, adding to its strong growth trajectory. We more than doubled collections since the launch, which accelerated sales growth for the combined business in the second half of the year. Finally, we strengthened our multichannel capabilities when we acquired Trunk Club, a high-growth business that offers a new approach to personalized service. 
In 2014, we also added capabilities to enhance the customer experience, with an emphasis on convenience. This includes an upgraded point-of-sale system, in addition to ongoing enhances for mobile, the online checkout rises and texting tools for our salespeople. We consider our product offering to be a key differentiator in providing customers with the top brands they want. This is enabled through our vendor partnerships, our own product group, where we can provide vendors new channels of distribution that are beneficial for our vendors and the overall customer experience. 
In our full-price business, we've tripled our selection on nordstrom.com since 2011. 
In Rack, we offer customers great brands at great prices with 48 of the top 50 full-line brands. In addition, our brand participated in dual [ph] flagship events, our Nordstromrack.com and HauteLook. We've seen a lift in brand sales across all 4 channels. 
Most recently, we announced our partnership with, starting with an offering and 15 stores and online. Similar to our partnerships with Topshop and Charlottesville, this is another way to enhance our product offering and create excitement for both new and existing customers. 
As we look ahead to 2015, we have a number of growth initiatives planned to support our efforts to improve the customer experience, including our ongoing expansion in Canada, with a store opening in Ottawa in the spring and Vancouver in the fall. In the U.S., we plan to expand our retail presence with 3 new full-line stores in Puerto Rico, Minneapolis and Milwaukee. We also plan to open 27 Rack stores this year and roughly 25 in 2016. 
Since we announced our growth plan a couple of years ago, we now see a clear path to reach 300 Rack stores by 2020. 
Our supply chain capabilities are another element in enhancing the customer experience through faster delivery. This fall, we are planning to open a third fulfillment center located in Pennsylvania. Adding fulfillment centers closer to the customer will enable us to offer 2-day shipping for free to more customer. 
We will continue to fuel our fastest-growing businesses through deeper integration of capabilities. Trunk Club doubled its sales in 2014 and plans to double in sales again this year. Our merchandise perspective, we've enjoyed our partnership with Topshop over the last 2 [ph] years, which has attracted new customers to Nordstrom. Based on the great reception we've heard from customers, we expect to expand the offer from roughly 50 to over 80 doors this year. 
In addition, the new partnerships with [indiscernible] is another way for us to provide sought-after brands that appeal to new and existing customers. 
And finally, we view our Nordstrom Rewards loyalty program as an important way for us to deepen our engagement with customers and attract new customers. Rewards numbers represent 40% of our sales volume. We welcomed over 1 million new members in 2014, a 15% increase from the previous year. We'd like to give customers more choices our loyalty program. Our goal is to provide an integrated, multi-tender program. 
Last year, we highlighted extension of our offering in Texas and in our first store in Canada. Based on the strong customer response, we look forward to rolling out the expanded program to all stores and online in the second half of the year. 
In closing, we are confident in our ability to execute our customer strategy, as we evolve with our customers to our focus on service, product and capabilities. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Mike."
32215,283827235,766450,"Nordstrom Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 19, 2015",2015-02-19,"Earnings Calls","Nordstrom, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Blake. As we wrap up another year, we are encouraged by the progress we've made in executing our customer strategy. Our efforts to provide best-in-class customer experience are centered on service, product and capabilities. To reinforce Blake's",1385,"Thanks, Blake. As we wrap up another year, we are encouraged by the progress we've made in executing our customer strategy. Our efforts to provide best-in-class customer experience are centered on service, product and capabilities. 
To reinforce Blake's comments, our strategy is driven by the changing expectations of our customers. As our business evolves with the customer, the way we create value is evolving, too. 
Over the last several years, we have accelerated our investments to fuel growth across our businesses in full-price, off-price, stores and online. 
About a decade ago, we started on the path of developing our multichannel capabilities by integrating our buying genes and inventory platform. In 2011, we accelerated online growth, starting with enhanced inabilities in e-commerce through the addition of talent, our acquisition of HauteLook and advancement in technology. 
In 2012, we announced our planned investments in new growth opportunities, including our entry into Canada, our Manhattan flagship store and the accelerated expansion of the Rack. 
Not only do these growth initiatives support our customer strategy, we expect even vestments did drive top line growth and deliver returns accretive to our business. 
Since then, in addition to executing our growth plans, we have increased our focus on our enterprise capabilities to enable a more seamless customer experience. This is reflected in the significant milestones achieved in 2014, including the launch of Nordstromrack.com, our successful entry into Canada and the extension of our service approach through the acquisition of Trunk Club. As we look ahead, we plan to further leverage our strategic inabilities through technology to flag chain merchandising and marketing. 
Now let's turn to our current financial results. We achieved our expectations for 2014, reflecting consistent strength in our sales trends and our investments to fuel growth. We added nearly $1 billion to our top line, with record sales of over $13 billion. Our sales growth of 7.8% and comparable sales increase of 4% were ahead of our expectations. Our ongoing investments contributed to top line growth of roughly 25% from 3 years ago. Not only did our overall business generate growth, we've aggressive investment in Rack stores and e-commerce, who's collectively made up over 40% of our sales today, up from 30% 3 years ago. 
Return on invested capital was 12.6%, reflecting a 50 basis point reduction related to the Trunk Club acquisition, the accelerated pace of capital investments that roughly doubled since 2011. 
For the sixth consecutive year, we generated operating cash flow in excess of $1 billion. 
Through our balanced capital allocation approach, this past year, we reinvested roughly $750 million back in the business and returned $860 million directly to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. 
In addition, we announced last week our quarterly dividend, which increased 12% over last year. 
Earnings per diluted share of $3.72 are consistent with our prior outlook on $3.70 to $3.75. Our results also included a $0.13 reduction from the Trunk Club acquisition, which was incorporated in our prior outlook. 
Now I would like to comment further on our fourth quarter performance. Our earnings per diluted share of $1.32 were a result of continued sales strength and operating execution. We achieved total sales growth of 9% and comparable sales increase of 4.7%, reflecting a strong holiday performance. 
In our full-price business, trend in full-line stores showed sequential improvement over the year, with nordstrom.com demonstrating continued momentum. 
In our off-price business, the Rack rebounded from the softness experienced late in the third quarter, and our combined channel of Nordstromrack.com and HauteLook delivered the highest growth. 
Moving to inventory and gross profit. We corrected our excess inventory at the Rack. We exited the year with inventory aligned to on appropriate level and gross profit performance consistent with our expectations. 
We are on track to achieve our goals of top quartile shareholder return, driven by high single-digit sales growth and mid-teens ROIC. We believe this will lead us to be a $20-plus billion business by 2020 while  creating to get shareholder value. 
As we shared with you previously, we expect operating margins to reflect the near-term impact of our customer strategy. This includes investments in stores and online growth, the expansion into Canada and foundational capabilities. As a result, we anticipate that these investments will contribute to double-digit increases in depreciation and rent. 
EBITDAR, which excludes these components, provides an indication of our core operating performance. We continue to focus on profitable growth in our core business, which is reflected by EBITDAR growth, in line with sales growth. Additionally, we made meaningful progress in increasing our operating efficiencies, particularly in our full-line business, and continue to evaluate our operating models throughout the company. 
Moving to our capital plan. We expect to invest $4.3 billion or 5% of sales over the next 5 years. Technology is 35% of the plan, reflecting an increased shift towards foundational investments. This includes a merchandising solution that enables our growth and a seamless integration across our multiple channels. It also includes the expansion of our fulfillment network. It does not only support our $2.5 billion online business today, as we anticipate it to grow by over $1 billion in the next several years, but also enables an integrated customer experience across stores and online. 
New markets, representing Canada and Manhattan, make up 25%, and new stores are 18%. The balance of 22% relates reinvestment in stores, significantly down from 40% over the last 5 years and to our remodeled reorganization towards high-profile stores and improved efficiencies. 
Now I'd like to provide additional color on our 2015 capital plan of approximately $1.2 billion. Relative to our 5-year capital plan, we expect that this year will represent our peak level of investment at roughly 8% of sales. The step-up in 2015 compared to $750 million in 2014 is primarily driven by new stores, including flagship stores in Vancouver, Toronto and Manhattan. 
In addition, the plan incorporates 3 flagship store remodels in Seattle, Chicago and San Francisco and the new East Coast fulfillment center. As the pace of investment begins to moderate beyond 2015, we expect to see an improvement in earnings growth. 
Finally, I'd like to turn to our 2015 financial outlook. Our plan for earnings per diluted share of $3.65 to $3.80 incorporates total sales growth of 7% to 9%. 
We are planning a comparable store increase of 2% to 4% based on current trends. Our sales outlook assumes, in full-price, flat comparable sales at full-line stores and roughly a 20% total sales increase from our online business at nordstrom.com and Trunk Club, with mid-teens growth at nordstrom.com. 
In off-price, that total sales growth in the low double digits, with a low single-digit comparable sales increase; and roughly a 25% increase from our combined channel of Nordstromrack.com and HauteLook. 
Other considerations incorporated in our outlook and impacting gross profit and SG&A include the following: the rollout into Canada estimated as an EBIT loss of $60 million compared to $32 million in 2014. This increase includes infrastructure and preopening costs of new stores. As we shared with you previously, we believe this market ultimately represents a $1 billion-plus sales opportunity. We expect this level of loss will begin to decline at 2017 and will become accretive as we reach scale. 
In addition, we anticipate $30 million in expenses associated with growth enablers, comprised of the additional fulfillment center and our expanded loyalty program planned in the second half of 2015. 
There's also an EBIT loss of roughly $30 million related to Trunk Club compared with a loss of $25 million in 2014. 
The dilutive impact is expected to moderate in 2016, resulting from increased operating profitability. 
These growth initiatives contribute to a 20% planned increase in depreciation and rent expense in 2015. 
EBITDAR, when excluding the impact of Canada and Trunk Club, is anticipated to grow roughly with sales. Please also refer to the earnings release for additional assumptions and timely considerations contemplated in our outlook. 
Before we close, we'd like to comment that the process in regards our potential sale of our credit receivable is expected to wrap up in the first half of 2015. 
We look forward to our opportunities ahead as we continue on a path to providing a best-in-class customer experience and deliver top quartile shareholder returns. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Trina."

It did have, as you talked about mentioned, an impact on the margin, cover the market out. We didn't see a material change in the average price, nor have we seen any change with, let's say, customer that diverse customer that shops with us. So the actual cetacean of the business is fairly consistent. This business did pick up. We talk about whether but when things got a little colder, November got better and our Rack business cut back to a trend that we haven't seen prior to. The third quarter was a little softer. With think we're in a good position here as we start the New Year of a both in the Rack in all of our business when it comes inventory. And so we're really fluid at this point."

As we reflect on the year, we consider 2014 to be a watershed moment in our company history, with the successful entry into Canada, the expansion of the Rack business through store growth and the launch of Nordstro",1080,"Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. As we reflect on the year, we consider 2014 to be a watershed moment in our company history, with the successful entry into Canada, the expansion of the Rack business through store growth and the launch of NordstromRack.com, the acquisition of the Trunk Club and the decision to explore the potential sale of our credit receivables. These milestones are the outcome of our strategy, which is squarely focused on serving customers on their terms and delivering the Nordstrom experience that they expect from us. 
Several years ago, we began our path to accelerate growth in multiple channels, as we evolve with the changing needs of our customers. In 2014, we delivered tangible results in executing our strategy over the last several years. Today, we made Fortune's list of the World's Most Admired Companies, ranking #14 overall and leading in our category. We continue to see the ongoing evolution of retail with the accelerated growth of e-commerce, the continuing importance of stores and the increasing customer interaction between them. Customers increasingly expect a personalized experience that merges the richness of stores with the convenience of online. We're uniquely positioned to serve customers through our focus on service, product and capabilities. 
We also believe we are competitively advantaged by serving customers better through our multiple touch points in full-price, off-price, stores and online. As a result, we have more customers shopping with us and more customers shopping 2 or more channels. This is meaningful as customers who shop multiple channels spend more and demonstrate greater your loyalty. 
In 2014, we reached an important milestone with the Rack representing our biggest source of new customers, attracting nearly 4 million. Additionally, about 1/3 of our Rack customers also shop in our full-line, full-price business. A year ago, we enabled customers to return purchases from HauteLook and NordstromRack.com to any of our Rack stores. This singular capability drove nearly 1 million incremental trips to our Rack stores. 
In 2014, we expanded our capabilities to ensure we're relevant today and in the future. Our first store in Calgary far exceeded our expectations, reflecting a multiyear effort from our team to address the unique challenges crossing the border.  In the U.S., we increased our presence with 2 full-line stores in Jacksonville, Florida and Houston, Texas. They feature our award-winning design concepts that incorporate flexibility and light.
In the Rack, we reached a record number of 27 store openings, which contributed to Rack's total sales growth of 17%. 
We've expanded our capabilities with the acquisition of HauteLook in 2011, which has grown nearly 150% in 3 years. HauteLook launched NordstromRack.com in the spring, adding to its strong growth trajectory. We more than doubled selections since the launch, which accelerated sales growth for the combined business in the second half of the year. Finally, we strengthened our multichannel capabilities when we acquired Trunk Club, a high-growth business that offers a new approach to personalized service. 
In 2014, we also added capabilities to enhance the customer experience, with an emphasis on convenience. This includes an upgraded point-of-sale system in addition to ongoing enhancements to mobile, the online checkout prices and texting tool for our salespeople. We consider our product offering to be a key differentiator in providing customers with the top brands they want. This is enabled through our vendor partnerships, our own product group, where we can provide vendors new channels of distribution that are beneficial for our vendors and the overall customer experience. 
In our full-price business, we've tripled our selection on nordstrom.com since 2011. 
In the Rack, we offer customers great brands at great prices with 48 of the top 50 full-line brands. In addition, when brand participates in dual-flash events on NordstromRack.com and HauteLook, we've seen a lift in brand sales across all 4 channels. 
Most recently, we announced our partnership with Madewell, starting with an offering in 15 stores and online. Similar to our partnerships with Topshop and Charlotte Tilbury, this is another way to enhance our product offering and create excitement for both new and existing customers. 
As we look ahead to 2015, we have a number of growth initiatives planned in support of our efforts to improve the customer experience, including our ongoing expansion in Canada, with a store opening in Ottawa in the spring and Vancouver in the fall. In the U.S., we plan to expand our retail presence with 3 new full-line stores in Puerto Rico, Minneapolis and Milwaukee. We also plan to open 27 Rack stores this year and roughly 25 in 2016. Since we announced our growth plan a couple of years ago, we now see a clear path to reach 300 Rack stores by 2020. 
Our supply chain capabilities are another element in enhancing the customer experience through faster delivery. This fall, we are planning to open a third fulfillment center located in Pennsylvania. Adding fulfillment centers closer to the customer will enable us to offer 2-day shipping for free to more customer. 
We will continue to fuel our fastest-growing businesses through deeper integration of capabilities. Trunk Club doubled its sales in 2014 and is planned to double in sales again this year. From a merchandise perspective, we've enjoyed our partnership with Topshop over the last 2 years, which has attracted new customers to Nordstrom. Based on the great reception we've heard from customers, we expect to expand the offer from roughly 50 to over 80 doors this year. In addition, the new partnership with Madewell is another way for us to provide sought-after brands that appeal to new and existing customers. 
And finally, we view our Nordstrom Rewards loyalty program as an important way for us to deepen our engagement with customers and attract new customers. Rewards members represent 40% of our sales volume. We welcomed over 1 million new members in 2014, a 15% increase from the previous year. We would like to give customers more choices with our loyalty program. Our goal is to provide an integrated, multi-tender program. 
Last year, we piloted an extension of our offering in Texas and in our first store in Canada. Based on the strong customer response, we look forward to rolling out the extended program to all stores and online in the second half of the year. 
In closing, we are confident in our ability to execute our customer strategy, as we evolve with our customers to our focus on service, product and capabilities. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Mike."
32215,283827235,766760,"Nordstrom Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 19, 2015",2015-02-19,"Earnings Calls","Nordstrom, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Blake. As we wrap up another year, we are encouraged with the progress we've made in executing our customer strategy. Our efforts to provide best-in-class customer experience are centered on service, product and capabilities. To reinforce Blake'",1382,"Thanks, Blake. As we wrap up another year, we are encouraged with the progress we've made in executing our customer strategy. Our efforts to provide best-in-class customer experience are centered on service, product and capabilities. 
To reinforce Blake's comments, our strategy is driven by the changing expectations of our customers. As our business evolves with the customer, the way we create value is evolving, too. 
Over the last several years, we have accelerated our investments to fuel growth across our businesses in full-price, off-price, stores and online. 
About a decade ago, we started on the path of developing our multichannel capabilities by integrating our buying teams and inventory platform. In 2011, we accelerated online growth, starting with enhanced capabilities in e-commerce through the addition of talent, our acquisition of HauteLook and advancements in technology. 
In 2012, we announced our planned investments in new growth opportunities, including our entry into Canada, our Manhattan flagship store and the accelerated expansion of the Rack. Not only do these growth initiatives support our customer strategy, we expect these investments to drive top line growth and deliver returns accretive to our business. Since then, in addition to executing our growth plans, we have increased our focus on our enterprise capabilities to enable a more seamless customer experience. This is reflected in the significant milestones achieved in 2014, including the launch of NordstromRack.com, our successful entry into Canada and the extension of our service approach through the acquisition of Trunk Club. As we look ahead, we plan to further leverage our strategic capabilities through technology, supply chain, merchandising and marketing. 
Now let's turn to our current financial results. We achieved our expectations for 2014, reflecting consistent strength in our sales trends and our investments to fuel growth. We added nearly $1 billion to our top line, with record sales of over $13 billion. Our sales growth of 7.8% and comparable sales increase of 4% were ahead of our expectations. Our ongoing investments contributed to top line growth of roughly 25% from 3 years ago. Not only did our overall business generate growth, we've aggressively invested in Rack stores and e-commerce, which collectively make up over 40% of our sales today, up from 30% 3 years ago. 
Return on invested capital was 12.6%, reflecting a 50-basis-point reduction related to the Trunk Club acquisition and the accelerated pace of capital investments that have roughly doubled since 2011. 
For the sixth consecutive year, we generated operating cash flow in excess of $1 billion. 
Through our balanced capital allocation approach, this past year, we reinvested roughly $750 million back in the business and returned $860 million directly to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. In addition, we announced last week our quarterly dividend, which increased 12% over last year. 
Earnings per diluted share of $3.72 were consistent with our prior outlook of $3.70 to $3.75. Our results also included a $0.13 reduction from the Trunk Club acquisition, which was incorporated in our prior outlook. 
Now I would like to comment further on our fourth quarter performance. Our earnings per diluted share of $1.32 were a result of continued sales strength and operating execution. We achieved total sales growth of 9% and comparable sales increase of 4.7%, reflecting a strong holiday performance. 
In our full-price business, trends in full-line stores showed sequential improvement over the year, with nordstrom.com demonstrating continued momentum. In our off-price business, the Rack rebounded from the softness experienced late in the third quarter, and our combined channel of NordstromRack.com and HauteLook delivered the highest growth. 
Moving to inventory and gross profit. We corrected our excess inventory at the Rack. We exited the year with inventory aligned to an appropriate level and gross profit performance consistent with our expectations. We are on track to achieve our goals of top-quartile shareholder return, driven by high single-digit sales growth and mid-teens ROIC. We believe this will lead us to be a $20-plus billion business by 2020 while creating significant shareholder value. 
As we shared with you previously, we expect operating margins to reflect the near-term impact of our customer strategy. This includes investments in stores and online growth, the expansion into Canada and foundational capabilities. As a result, we anticipate that these investments will contribute to double-digit increases in depreciation and rent. EBITDAR, which excludes these components, provides an indication of our core operating performance. We continue to focus on profitable growth in our core business, which is reflected by EBITDAR growth in line with sales growth. Additionally, we made meaningful progress in increasing our operating efficiencies, particularly in our full-line business, and continue to evaluate our operating model throughout the company. 
Moving to our capital plan. We expect to invest $4.3 billion or 5% of sales over the next 5 years. Technology is 35% of the plan, reflecting an increased shift towards foundational investments. This includes a merchandising solution that enables our growth and a seamless integration across our multiple channels. It also includes the expansion of our fulfillment network. This not only supports a $2.5 billion online business today as we anticipate it to grow by over $1 billion in the next several years, but also enables an integrated customer experience across stores and online. 
New markets, representing Canada and Manhattan, make up 25%, and new stores are 18%. The balance of 22% relates to reinvestment in stores, significantly down from 40% over the last 5 years, into our remodeled prioritization towards high-profile stores and improved efficiencies. 
Now I'd like to provide additional color on our 2015 capital plan of approximately $1.2 billion. Relative to our 5-year capital plan, we expect that this year will represent our peak level of investment at roughly 8% of sales. The step-up in 2015 compared to $750 million in 2014 is primarily driven by new stores, including flagship stores in Vancouver, Toronto and Manhattan. 
In addition, the plan incorporates 3 flagship store remodels in Seattle, Chicago and San Francisco and the new East Coast fulfillment center. As the pace of investment begins to moderate beyond 2015, we expect to see an improvement in earnings growth. 
Finally, I'd like to turn to our 2015 financial outlook. Our plan for earnings per diluted share of $3.65 to $3.80 incorporates total sales growth of 7% to 9%. 
We are planning a comparable store increase of 2% to 4% based on current trends. Our sales outlook assumes in full-price flat comparable sales at full-line stores and roughly a 20% total sales increase from our online business at nordstrom.com and Trunk Club, with mid-teens growth at nordstrom.com. 
In off-price, Rack total sales growth in the low double digits, with a low single-digit comparable sales increase and roughly a 25% increase from our combined channel of NordstromRack.com and HauteLook. 
Other considerations incorporated in our outlook impacting gross profit and SG&A include the following: the rollout into Canada estimated as an EBIT loss of $60 million compared to $32 million in 2014. This increase includes infrastructure and preopening costs of new stores. As we shared with you previously, we believe this market ultimately represents a $1 billion-plus sales opportunity. We expect this level of loss will begin to decline in 2017 and become -- and become accretive as we reach scale. In addition, we anticipate $30 million in expenses associated with growth enablers, comprised of the additional fulfillment center and our expanded loyalty program planned in the second half of 2015. 
There's also an EBIT loss of roughly $30 million related to Trunk Club compared with a loss of $25 million in 2014. The dilutive impact is expected to moderate in 2016, resulting from increased operating profitability. These growth initiatives contribute to a 20% planned increase in depreciation and rent expense in 2015. 
EBITDAR, when excluding the impact of Canada and Trunk Club, is anticipated to grow roughly with sales. Please also refer to the earnings release for additional assumptions and timely considerations contemplated in our outlook. 
Before we close, we'd like to comment that the process in regards to our potential sale of our credit receivables is expected to ramp up in the first half of 2015. 
We look forward to our opportunities ahead, as we continue on our path to provide a best-in-class customer experience and deliver top-quartile shareholder returns. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Trina."

They have 5 showrooms, and the third part is their custom business that they take on road before. We actually have that roadshow in our downtown Seattle store last week, and they're just really beginning to start to find some synergies there. So that business, without being specific, I'll say we think it could be very big. The other part is a little less formal and the integration is they can do for our stores.

As you know, our personal styling program in our stores is about 1,500 stylists and a very important part of our growth. They just have different things that there's starting.

We've got some significant investments in our store openings in Canada, which include some pretty large stores in Vancouver and Toronto. We have a continued ongoing investment in Manhattan, which, right now, is purely a capital investment. But it's a fair amount of capital. And then in addition, we are investing in our infrastructure to support all this growth. This growth is a wonderful thing, but if you don't have the tools and systems to support it, it's not going to work very well. And so what you're seeing here is a kind of a coming together of a lot of activity in this year. Post-2015, as we start to see that all those capital outlays somewhat moderate and become more consistent, we should see the operating model start to catch up a little bit more to those investments, and we should start to see earnings growth to be a little bit better than it's been the last couple of years."

And that has been driven by a program that has been entirely connected to one of our tenders, whether it's our debit card, whether it's our private-label credit card or a co-branded Visa card. And one of the things that we learned with our pilot this last year is we had a lot of customers out there and a lot of potential future customers that would love to engage with us but don't necessarily want to open up another tender. And so the addition to our overall loyalty offering is going to include a tender-neutral offering, which we're not going to disclose specifics yet, but we will have a way of connecting with those customers other than through a credit card or a debit card. And the tests we have both in Canada and in Texas really have some great results and reinforce to us that this is another way that we can connect and build lifetime loyalty with our customers. Currently, today, we have about 4.3 million active members in the rewards program. Last year, we added about 1 million. Clearly, we add and we are trying as the years go on.

Pack-and-hold enables us to execute that. So that's an approach with our vendor partnerships and vendor. Our inventory maximization that's -- we're really pleased with them working well. In terms of the 300 stores, it's a pretty fluid model opening the Rack's in terms of the lead time, particularly compared to full-line stores. And we're just learning with each one, and we continue to get great reception from the customer. I think it's really reflected in, and we've said this before, in the productivity of the stores. They both maintain and enhance slightly with the addition of these new stores. So we're encouraged by those opportunities. Sometimes there are some vagaries in the retail or the real estate market year-to-year, but we feel very confident looking ahead between now and 2020, given the criteria we use for new stores, the customer demand, the opportunities that are out there. And we feel very confident to publicly state that we should have cleaner stores by 2020."

Should we be successful, we would look at the proceeds the same way as the same filters that we've always thought about capital allocation and that is, first and foremost, we always reinvest back in the business. That's where we get the highest returns. And any excess capital that we have, we'll return to shareholders. And we're going to put any proceeds we might get from that through that identical lens. In terms of the Rack, the Rack has and consistently operates with a four-wall operating margin, consistent with the full-line stores. As we go through this accelerated phase, you have a little bit of a uplift because you're recognizing rent on an accelerated basis before the store opens. But as those new stores start to become a smaller piece of the pie, we should see that four-wall contribution start to get back to what is a more normal run rate."

As we reflect on the year, we consider 2014 to be a watershed moment in our company history, with the successful entry into Canada, the expansion of the Rack business through store growth and the launch of Nordstro",1080,"Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. As we reflect on the year, we consider 2014 to be a watershed moment in our company history, with the successful entry into Canada, the expansion of the Rack business through store growth and the launch of NordstromRack.com, the acquisition of the Trunk Club and the decision to explore the potential sale of our credit receivables. These milestones are the outcome of our strategy, which is squarely focused on serving customers on their terms and delivering the Nordstrom experience that they expect from us. 
Several years ago, we began our path to accelerate growth in multiple channels, as we evolve with the changing needs of our customers. In 2014, we delivered tangible results in executing our strategy over the last several years. Today, we made Fortune's list of the World's Most Admired Companies, ranking #14 overall and leading in our category. We continue to see the ongoing evolution of retail with the accelerated growth of e-commerce, the continuing importance of stores and the increasing customer interaction between them. Customers increasingly expect a personalized experience that merges the richness of stores with the convenience of online. We're uniquely positioned to serve customers through our focus on service, product and capabilities. 
We also believe we are competitively advantaged by serving customers better through our multiple touch points in full-price, off-price, stores and online. As a result, we have more customers shopping with us and more customers shopping 2 or more channels. This is meaningful as customers who shop multiple channels spend more and demonstrate greater loyalty. 
In 2014, we reached an important milestone with the Rack representing our biggest source of new customers, attracting nearly 4 million. Additionally, about 1/3 of our Rack customers also shop in our full-line, full-price business. A year ago, we enabled customers to return purchases from HauteLook and NordstromRack.com to any of our Rack stores. This singular capability drove nearly 1 million incremental trips to our Rack stores. 
In 2014, we expanded our capabilities to ensure we're relevant today and in the future. Our first store in Calgary far exceeded our expectations, reflecting a multiyear effort from our team to address the unique challenges of crossing the border.  In the U.S., we increased our presence with 2 full-line stores in Jacksonville, Florida and Houston, Texas. They feature our award-winning design concepts that incorporate flexibility and light.
In the Rack, we reached a record number of 27 store openings, which contributed to Rack's total sales growth of 17%. 
We've expanded our capabilities with the acquisition of HauteLook in 2011, which has grown nearly 150% in 3 years. HauteLook launched NordstromRack.com in the spring, adding to its strong growth trajectory. We more than doubled selections since the launch, which accelerated sales growth for the combined business in the second half of the year. Finally, we strengthened our multichannel capabilities when we acquired Trunk Club, a high-growth business that offers a new approach to personalized service. 
In 2014, we also added capabilities to enhance the customer experience, with an emphasis on convenience. This includes an upgraded point-of-sale system in addition to ongoing enhancements to mobile, the online checkout process and texting tool for our salespeople. We consider our product offering to be a key differentiator in providing customers with the top brands they want. This is enabled through our vendor partnerships, our own product group, where we can provide vendors new channels of distribution that are beneficial for our vendors and the overall customer experience. 
In our full-price business, we've tripled our selection on nordstrom.com since 2011. 
In the Rack, we offer customers great brands at great prices with 48 of the top 50 full-line brands. In addition, when brands participates in dual-flash events on NordstromRack.com and HauteLook, we've seen a lift in brand sales across all 4 channels. 
Most recently, we announced our partnership with Madewell, starting with an offering in 15 stores and online. Similar to our partnerships with Topshop and Charlotte Tilbury, this is another way to enhance our product offering and create excitement for both new and existing customers. 
As we look ahead to 2015, we have a number of growth initiatives planned in support of our efforts to improve the customer experience, including our ongoing expansion in Canada, with a store opening in Ottawa in the spring and Vancouver in the fall. In the U.S., we plan to expand our retail presence with 3 new full-line stores in Puerto Rico, Minneapolis and Milwaukee. We also plan to open 27 Rack stores this year and roughly 25 in 2016. Since we announced our growth plan a couple of years ago, we now see a clear path to reach 300 Rack stores by 2020. 
Our supply chain capabilities are another element in enhancing the customer experience through faster delivery. This fall, we are planning to open a third fulfillment center located in Pennsylvania. Adding fulfillment centers closer to the customer will enable us to offer 2-day shipping for free to more customers. 
We will continue to fuel our fastest-growing businesses through deeper integration of capabilities. Trunk Club doubled its sales in 2014 and is planned to double in sales again this year. From a merchandise perspective, we've enjoyed our partnership with Topshop over the last 2 years, which has attracted new customers to Nordstrom. Based on the great reception we've heard from customers, we expect to expand the offer from roughly 50 to over 80 doors this year. In addition, the new partnership with Madewell is another way for us to provide sought-after brands that appeal to new and existing customers. 
And finally, we view our Nordstrom Rewards loyalty program as an important way for us to deepen our engagement with customers and attract new customers. Rewards members represent 40% of our sales volume. We welcomed over 1 million new members in 2014, a 15% increase from the previous year. We would like to give customers more choices with our loyalty program. Our goal is to provide an integrated, multi-tender program. 
Last year, we piloted an extension of our offering in Texas and in our first store in Canada. Based on the strong customer response, we look forward to rolling out the expanded program to all stores and online in the second half of the year. 
In closing, we are confident in our ability to execute our customer strategy, as we evolve with our customers through our focus on service, product and capabilities. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Mike."
32215,283827235,766828,"Nordstrom Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 19, 2015",2015-02-19,"Earnings Calls","Nordstrom, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Blake. As we wrap up another year, we are encouraged with the progress we've made in executing our customer strategy. Our efforts to provide best-in-class customer experience are centered on service, product and capabilities. To reinforce Blake'",1379,"Thanks, Blake. As we wrap up another year, we are encouraged with the progress we've made in executing our customer strategy. Our efforts to provide best-in-class customer experience are centered on service, product and capabilities. 
To reinforce Blake's comments, our strategy is driven by the changing expectations of our customers. As our business evolves with the customer, the way we create value is evolving, too. 
Over the last several years, we have accelerated our investments to fuel growth across our businesses in full-price, off-price, stores and online. 
About a decade ago, we started on the path of developing our multichannel capabilities by integrating our buying teams and inventory platform. In 2011, we accelerated online growth, starting with enhanced capabilities in e-commerce through the addition of talent, our acquisition of HauteLook and advancements in technology. 
In 2012, we announced our planned investments in new growth opportunities, including our entry into Canada, our Manhattan flagship store and the accelerated expansion of the Rack. Not only do these growth initiatives support our customer strategy, we expect these investments to drive top line growth and deliver returns accretive to our business. Since then, in addition to executing our growth plans, we have increased our focus on our enterprise capabilities to enable a more seamless customer experience. This is reflected in the significant milestones achieved in 2014, including the launch of NordstromRack.com, our successful entry into Canada and the extension of our service approach through the acquisition of Trunk Club. As we look ahead, we plan to further leverage our strategic capabilities through technology, supply chain, merchandising and marketing. 
Now let's turn to our current financial results. We achieved our expectations for 2014, reflecting consistent strength in our sales trends and our investments to fuel growth. We added nearly $1 billion to our top line, with record sales of over $13 billion. Our sales growth of 7.8% and comparable sales increase of 4% were ahead of our expectations. Our ongoing investments contributed to top line growth of roughly 25% from 3 years ago. Not only did our overall business generate growth, we've aggressively invested in Rack stores and e-commerce, which collectively make up over 40% of our sales today, up from 30% 3 years ago. 
Return on invested capital was 12.6%, reflecting a 50-basis-point reduction related to the Trunk Club acquisition and the accelerated pace of capital investments that have roughly doubled since 2011. 
For the sixth consecutive year, we generated operating cash flow in excess of $1 billion. 
Through our balanced capital allocation approach, this past year, we reinvested roughly $750 million back in the business and returned $860 million directly to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. In addition, we announced last week our quarterly dividend, which increased 12% over last year. 
Earnings per diluted share of $3.72 were consistent with our prior outlook of $3.70 to $3.75. Our results also included a $0.13 reduction from the Trunk Club acquisition, which was incorporated in our prior outlook. 
Now I would like to comment further on our fourth quarter performance. Our earnings per diluted share of $1.32 were a result of continued sales strength and operating execution. We achieved total sales growth of 9% and comparable sales increase of 4.7%, reflecting a strong holiday performance. 
In our full-price business, trends in full-line stores showed sequential improvement over the year, with nordstrom.com demonstrating continued momentum. In our off-price business, the Rack rebounded from the softness experienced late in the third quarter, and our combined channel of NordstromRack.com and HauteLook delivered the highest growth. 
Moving to inventory and gross profit. We corrected our excess inventory at the Rack. We exited the year with inventory aligned to an appropriate level and gross profit performance consistent with our expectations. We are on track to achieve our goals of top-quartile shareholder return, driven by high single-digit sales growth and mid-teens ROIC. We believe this will lead us to be a $20-plus billion business by 2020 while creating significant shareholder value. 
As we shared with you previously, we expect operating margins to reflect the near-term impact of our customer strategy. This includes investments in stores and online growth, the expansion into Canada and foundational capabilities. As a result, we anticipate that these investments will contribute to double-digit increases in depreciation and rent. EBITDAR, which excludes these components, provides an indication of our core operating performance. We continue to focus on profitable growth in our core business, which is reflected by EBITDAR growth in line with sales growth. Additionally, we made meaningful progress in increasing our operating efficiencies, particularly in our full-line business, and continue to evaluate our operating model throughout the company. 
Moving to our capital plan. We expect to invest $4.3 billion or 5% of sales over the next 5 years. Technology is 35% of the plan, reflecting an increased shift towards foundational investments. This includes a merchandising solution that enables our growth and a seamless integration across our multiple channels. It also includes the expansion of our fulfillment network. This not only supports a $2.5 billion online business today that is anticipated to grow by over $1 billion in the next several years, but also enables an integrated customer experience across stores and online. 
New markets, representing Canada and Manhattan, make up 25%, and new stores are 18%. The balance of 22% relates to reinvestment in stores, significantly down from 40% over the last 5 years, into our remodeled prioritization towards high-profile stores and improved efficiencies. 
Now I'd like to provide additional color on our 2015 capital plan of approximately $1.2 billion. Relative to our 5-year capital plan, we expect that this year will represent our peak level of investment at roughly 8% of sales. The step-up in 2015 compared to $750 million in 2014 is primarily driven by new stores, including flagship stores in Vancouver, Toronto and Manhattan. 
In addition, the plan incorporates 3 flagship store remodels in Seattle, Chicago and San Francisco and the new East Coast fulfillment center. As the pace of investment begins to moderate beyond 2015, we expect to see an improvement in earnings growth. 
Finally, I'd like to turn to our 2015 financial outlook. Our plan for earnings per diluted share of $3.65 to $3.80 incorporates total sales growth of 7% to 9%. 
We are planning a comparable store increase of 2% to 4% based on current trends. Our sales outlook assumes in full-price, flat comparable sales at full-line stores and roughly a 20% total sales increase from our online business at nordstrom.com and Trunk Club, with mid-teens growth at nordstrom.com. 
In off-price, Rack total sales growth in the low double digits, with a low single-digit comparable sales increase and roughly a 25% increase from our combined channel of NordstromRack.com and HauteLook. 
Other considerations incorporated in our outlook impacting gross profit and SG&A include the following: the rollout into Canada estimated as an EBIT loss of $60 million compared to $32 million in 2014. This increase includes infrastructure and preopening costs of new stores. As we shared with you previously, we believe this market ultimately represents a $1 billion-plus sales opportunity. We expect this level of loss will begin to decline in 2017 and will become accretive as we reach scale. In addition, we anticipate $30 million in expenses associated with growth enablers, comprised of the additional fulfillment center and our expanded loyalty program planned in the second half of 2015. 
There's also an EBIT loss of roughly $30 million related to Trunk Club compared with a loss of $25 million in 2014. The dilutive impact is expected to moderate in 2016, resulting from increased operating profitability. These growth initiatives contribute to a 20% planned increase in depreciation and rent expense in 2015. 
EBITDAR, when excluding the impact of Canada and Trunk Club, is anticipated to grow roughly with sales. Please also refer to the earnings release for additional assumptions and timing considerations contemplated in our outlook. 
Before we close, we'd like to comment that the process in regards to our potential sale of our credit receivables is expected to ramp up in the first half of 2015. 
We look forward to our opportunities ahead, as we continue on our path to provide a best-in-class customer experience and deliver top-quartile shareholder returns. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Trina."

Pete was just in market, and I know a number of the vendors are talking about it. But we have a pretty balanced approach, and we work closely with our vendor partners. And to date, we've been able to manage it fairly well, but our team's watching it closely. I'll turn the gross margin part over to Mike."

Right now, our focus is mainly around supporting their growth plan. And there's areas like supply chain, alterations, some supply around vendors that we can help them with. We had -- just last week, here in Seattle, their custom business, which, as you may know, they have 3 parts to their business. They have the Trunk business that's basically online, personal styling. They have 5 showrooms, and the third part is their custom business that they take on road before. We actually have that roadshow in our downtown Seattle store last week, and they're just at the very beginning of starting to find some synergies there. So that business, without being specific, I'll say we think it could be very big. The other part is a little less formal and the integration is they can do for our stores. Like that customer experience, we're testing some things there. But we do believe there's a way they can help us. As you know, our personal styling program in our stores is about 1,500 stylists and a very important part of our growth.

And so the addition to our overall loyalty offering is going to include a tender-neutral offering, which we're not going to disclose specifics yet, but we will have a way of connecting with those customers other than through a credit card or a debit card. And the tests we have both in Canada and in Texas really have some great results and reinforce to us that this is another way that we can connect and build lifetime loyalty with our customers.

Our pack-and-hold has been fairly consistent now over the last, let's say, 1.5 years or 2 years. It's about 11% of the total company's inventory, and so we continue through the vendor partnerships and relationships to have a terrific access to product that's closed out in the season that we're able to literally pack and hold in a warehouse and use the following -- 6 months later. It helps us turn the corner in each of the existing stores. It particularly is a key component for the new store growth. We mentioned that we opened 27 stores last year and 27 this year. Pack-and-hold enables us to execute that. So that's an approach with our vendor partnerships and vendor -- or inventory maximization that's -- we're really pleased with them working well. 
In terms of the 300 stores, it's a pretty fluid model opening the Rack's in terms of the lead time, particularly compared to full-line stores. And we're just learning with each one, and we continue to get great reception from the customer. I think it's really reflected in, and we've said this before, in the productivity of the stores. They both maintained and enhanced slightly with the addition of these new stores. So we're encouraged by those opportunities. Sometimes there are some vagaries in the retail or the real estate market year-to-year, but we feel very confident looking ahead between now and 2020, given the criteria we use for new stores, the customer demand, the opportunities that are out there, that we feel very confident to publicly state that we should have 300 stores by 2020."

Should we be successful, we would look at the proceeds the same way, through the same filters that we've always thought about capital allocation and that is, first and foremost, we always reinvest back in the business. That's where we get the highest returns, and any excess capital that we have we'll return to shareholders. And we're going to put any proceeds we might get from that through that identical lens. In terms of the Rack, the Rack has and consistently operates with a 4-wall operating margin, consistent with the full-line stores. As we go through this accelerated phase, you have a little bit of a uplift because you're recognizing rent on an accelerated basis before the store opens. But as those new stores start to become a smaller piece of the pie, we should see that 4-wall contribution start to get back to what is a more normal run rate."

As we reflect on the year, we consider 2014 to be a watershed moment in our company history, with the successful entry into Canada, the expansion of the Rack business through store growth and the launch of NordstromRack.com, the acquisition of the Trunk Club and the decision to explore the potential sale of our credit receivables. These milestones are the outcome of our strategy, which is squarely focused on serving customers on their terms and delivering the Nordstrom experience that they expect from us. 
Several years ago, we began our path to accelerate growth in multiple channels, as we evolve with the changing needs of our customers. In 2014, we delivered tangible results in executing our strategy over the last several years. Today, we made Fortune's list of the World's Most Admired Companies, ranking #14 overall and leading in our category. We continue to see the ongoing evolution of retail with the accelerated growth of e-commerce, the continuing importance of stores and the increasing customer interaction between them. Customers increasingly expect a personalized experience that merges the richness of stores with the convenience of online. We're uniquely positioned to serve customers through our focus on service, product and capabilities. 
We also believe we are competitively advantaged by serving customers better through our multiple touch points in full-price, off-price, stores and online. As a result, we have more customers shopping with us and more customers shopping 2 or more channels. This is meaningful as customers who shop multiple channels spend more and demonstrate greater loyalty. 
In 2014, we reached an important milestone with the Rack representing our biggest source of new customers, attracting nearly 4 million. Additionally, about 1/3 of our Rack customers also shop in our full-line, full-price business. A year ago, we enabled customers to return purchases from HauteLook and NordstromRack.com to any of our Rack stores. This singular capability drove nearly 1 million incremental trips to our Rack stores. 
In 2014, we expanded our capabilities to ensure we're relevant today and in the future. Our first store in Calgary far exceeded our expectations, reflecting a multiyear effort from our team to address the unique challenges of crossing the border.  In the U.S., we increased our presence with 2 full-line stores in Jacksonville, Florida and Houston, Texas. They feature our award-winning design concepts that incorporate flexibility and light.
In the Rack, we reached a record number of 27 store openings, which contributed to Rack's total sales growth of 17%. 
We've expanded our capabilities with the acquisition of HauteLook in 2011, which has grown nearly 150% in 3 years. HauteLook launched NordstromRack.com in the spring, adding to its strong growth trajectory. We more than doubled selections since the launch, which accelerated sales growth for the combined business in the second half of the year. Finally, we strengthened our multichannel capabilities when we acquired Trunk Club, a high-growth business that offers a new approach to personalized service. 
In 2014, we also added capabilities to enhance the customer experience, with an emphasis on convenience. This includes an upgraded point-of-sale system in addition to ongoing enhancements to mobile, the online checkout process and texting tool for our salespeople. We consider our product offering to be a key differentiator in providing customers with the top brands they want. This is enabled through our vendor partnerships, our own product group, where we can provide vendors new channels of distribution that are beneficial for our vendors and the overall customer experience. 
In our full-price business, we've tripled our selection on nordstrom.com since 2011. 
In the Rack, we offer customers great brands at great prices with 48 of the top 50 full-line brands. In addition, when brands participates in dual-flash events on NordstromRack.com and HauteLook, we've seen a lift in brand sales across all 4 channels. 
Most recently, we announced our partnership with Madewell, starting with an offering in 15 stores and online. Similar to our partnerships with Topshop and Charlotte Tilbury, this is another way to enhance our product offering and create excitement for both new and existing customers. 
As we look ahead to 2015, we have a number of growth initiatives planned in support of our efforts to improve the customer experience, including our ongoing expansion in Canada, with a store opening in Ottawa in the spring and Vancouver in the fall. In the U.S., we plan to expand our retail presence with 3 new full-line stores in Puerto Rico, Minneapolis and Milwaukee. We also plan to open 27 Rack stores this year and roughly 25 in 2016. Since we announced our growth plan a couple of years ago, we now see a clear path to reach 300 Rack stores by 2020. 
Our supply chain capabilities are another element in enhancing the customer experience through faster delivery. This fall, we are planning to open a third fulfillment center located in Pennsylvania. Adding fulfillment centers closer to the customer will enable us to offer 2-day shipping for free to more customers. 
We will continue to fuel our fastest-growing businesses through deeper integration of capabilities. Trunk Club doubled its sales in 2014 and is planned to double in sales again this year. From a merchandise perspective, we've enjoyed our partnership with Topshop over the last 2 years, which has attracted new customers to Nordstrom. Based on the great reception we've heard from customers, we expect to expand the offer from roughly 50 to over 80 doors this year. In addition, the new partnership with Madewell is another way for us to provide sought-after brands that appeal to new and existing customers. 
And finally, we view our Nordstrom Rewards loyalty program as an important way for us to deepen our engagement with customers and attract new customers. Rewards members represent 40% of our sales volume. We welcomed over 1 million new members in 2014, a 15% increase from the previous year. We would like to give customers more choices with our loyalty program. Our goal is to provide an integrated, multi-tender program. 
Last year, we piloted an extension of our offering in Texas and in our first store in Canada. Based on the strong customer response, we look forward to rolling out the expanded program to all stores and online in the second half of the year. 
In closing, we are confident in our ability to execute our customer strategy, as we evolve with our customers through our focus on service, product and capabilities. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Mike."

As we wrap up another year, we are encouraged with the progress we've made in executing our customer strategy. Our efforts to provide best-in-class customer experience are centered on service, product and capabilities. To reinforce Blake'",1379,"Thanks, Blake. As we wrap up another year, we are encouraged with the progress we've made in executing our customer strategy. Our efforts to provide best-in-class customer experience are centered on service, product and capabilities. 
To reinforce Blake's comments, our strategy is driven by the changing expectations of our customers. As our business evolves with the customer, the way we create value is evolving, too. 
Over the last several years, we have accelerated our investments to fuel growth across our businesses in full-price, off-price, stores and online. 
About a decade ago, we started on the path of developing our multichannel capabilities by integrating our buying teams and inventory platform. In 2011, we accelerated online growth, starting with enhanced capabilities in e-commerce through the addition of talent, our acquisition of HauteLook and advancements in technology. 
In 2012, we announced our planned investments in new growth opportunities, including our entry into Canada, our Manhattan flagship store and the accelerated expansion of the Rack. Not only do these growth initiatives support our customer strategy, we expect these investments to drive top line growth and deliver returns accretive to our business. Since then, in addition to executing our growth plans, we have increased our focus on our enterprise capabilities to enable a more seamless customer experience. This is reflected in the significant milestones achieved in 2014, including the launch of NordstromRack.com, our successful entry into Canada and the extension of our service approach through the acquisition of Trunk Club. As we look ahead, we plan to further leverage our strategic capabilities through technology, supply chain, merchandising and marketing. 
Now let's turn to our current financial results. We achieved our expectations for 2014, reflecting consistent strength in our sales trends and our investments to fuel growth. We added nearly $1 billion to our top line, with record sales of over $13 billion. Our sales growth of 7.8% and comparable sales increase of 4% were ahead of our expectations. Our ongoing investments contributed to top line growth of roughly 25% from 3 years ago. Not only did our overall business generate growth, we've aggressively invested in Rack stores and e-commerce, which collectively make up over 40% of our sales today, up from 30% 3 years ago. 
Return on invested capital was 12.6%, reflecting a 50-basis-point reduction related to the Trunk Club acquisition and the accelerated pace of capital investments that have roughly doubled since 2011. 
For the sixth consecutive year, we generated operating cash flow in excess of $1 billion. 
Through our balanced capital allocation approach, this past year, we reinvested roughly $750 million back in the business and returned $860 million directly to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. In addition, we announced last week our quarterly dividend, which increased 12% over last year. 
Earnings per diluted share of $3.72 were consistent with our prior outlook of $3.70 to $3.75. Our results also included a $0.13 reduction from the Trunk Club acquisition, which was incorporated in our prior outlook. 
Now I would like to comment further on our fourth quarter performance. Our earnings per diluted share of $1.32 were a result of continued sales strength and operating execution. We achieved total sales growth of 9% and comparable sales increase of 4.7%, reflecting a strong holiday performance. 
In our full-price business, trends in full-line stores showed sequential improvement over the year, with nordstrom.com demonstrating continued momentum. In our off-price business, the Rack rebounded from the softness experienced late in the third quarter, and our combined channel of NordstromRack.com and HauteLook delivered the highest growth. 
Moving to inventory and gross profit. We corrected our excess inventory at the Rack. We exited the year with inventory aligned to an appropriate level and gross profit performance consistent with our expectations. We are on track to achieve our goals of top-quartile shareholder return, driven by high single-digit sales growth and mid-teens ROIC. We believe this will lead us to be a $20-plus billion business by 2020 while creating significant shareholder value. 
As we shared with you previously, we expect operating margins to reflect the near-term impact of our customer strategy. This includes investments in stores and online growth, the expansion into Canada and foundational capabilities. As a result, we anticipate that these investments will contribute to double-digit increases in depreciation and rent. EBITDAR, which excludes these components, provides an indication of our core operating performance. We continue to focus on profitable growth in our core business, which is reflected by EBITDAR growth in line with sales growth. Additionally, we made meaningful progress in increasing our operating efficiencies, particularly in our full-line business, and continue to evaluate our operating model throughout the company. 
Moving to our capital plan. We expect to invest $4.3 billion or 5% of sales over the next 5 years. Technology is 35% of the plan, reflecting an increased shift towards foundational investments. This includes a merchandising solution that enables our growth and a seamless integration across our multiple channels. It also includes the expansion of our fulfillment network. This not only supports a $2.5 billion online business today that is anticipated to grow by over $1 billion in the next several years, but also enables an integrated customer experience across stores and online. 
New markets, representing Canada and Manhattan, make up 25%, and new stores are 18%. The balance of 22% relates to reinvestment in stores, significantly down from 40% over the last 5 years, into our remodeled prioritization towards high-profile stores and improved efficiencies. 
Now I'd like to provide additional color on our 2015 capital plan of approximately $1.2 billion. Relative to our 5-year capital plan, we expect that this year will represent our peak level of investment at roughly 8% of sales. The step-up in 2015 compared to $750 million in 2014 is primarily driven by new stores, including flagship stores in Vancouver, Toronto and Manhattan. 
In addition, the plan incorporates 3 flagship store remodels in Seattle, Chicago and San Francisco and the new East Coast fulfillment center. As the pace of investment begins to moderate beyond 2015, we expect to see an improvement in earnings growth. 
Finally, I'd like to turn to our 2015 financial outlook. Our plan for earnings per diluted share of $3.65 to $3.80 incorporates total sales growth of 7% to 9%. 
We are planning a comparable store increase of 2% to 4% based on current trends. Our sales outlook assumes in full-price, flat comparable sales at full-line stores and roughly a 20% total sales increase from our online business at nordstrom.com and Trunk Club, with mid-teens growth at nordstrom.com. 
In off-price, Rack total sales growth in the low double digits, with a low single-digit comparable sales increase and roughly a 25% increase from our combined channel of NordstromRack.com and HauteLook. 
Other considerations incorporated in our outlook impacting gross profit and SG&A include the following: the rollout into Canada estimated as an EBIT loss of $60 million compared to $32 million in 2014. This increase includes infrastructure and preopening costs of new stores. As we shared with you previously, we believe this market ultimately represents a $1 billion-plus sales opportunity. We expect this level of loss will begin to decline in 2017 and will become accretive as we reach scale. In addition, we anticipate $30 million in expenses associated with growth enablers, comprised of the additional fulfillment center and our expanded loyalty program planned in the second half of 2015. 
There's also an EBIT loss of roughly $30 million related to Trunk Club compared with a loss of $25 million in 2014. The dilutive impact is expected to moderate in 2016, resulting from increased operating profitability. These growth initiatives contribute to a 20% planned increase in depreciation and rent expense in 2015. 
EBITDAR, when excluding the impact of Canada and Trunk Club, is anticipated to grow roughly with sales. Please also refer to the earnings release for additional assumptions and timing considerations contemplated in our outlook. 
Before we close, we'd like to comment that the process in regards to our potential sale of our credit receivables is expected to ramp up in the first half of 2015. 
We look forward to our opportunities ahead, as we continue on our path to provide a best-in-class customer experience and deliver top-quartile shareholder returns. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Trina."

Right now, our focus is mainly around supporting their growth plan. And there's areas like supply chain, alterations, some supply around vendors that we can help them with. We had -- just last week, here in Seattle, their custom business, which, as you may know, they have 3 parts to their business. They have the Trunk business that's basically online, personal styling. They have 5 showrooms, and the third part is their custom business that they take on road before. We actually have that roadshow in our downtown Seattle store last week, and they're just at the very beginning of starting to find some synergies there. So that business, without being specific, I'll say we think it could be very big. The other part is a little less formal and the integration is they can do for our stores. Like that customer experience, we're testing some things there. But we do believe there's a way they can help us. As you know, our personal styling program in our stores is about 1,500 stylists and a very important part of our growth.

That's leveled out a little bit here as the year is going on and where we are now, and that -- things have moderated at least for now. I'm sorry, the second part of the question?"

Now we will still ship some orders from our Cedar Rapids fulfillment center to the northeast. We won't have perfect allocation there. But mainly, we continue to focus on, and the long-term strategy here is to have a fulfillment network that gets practically, at least over 90% of our customers in the United States within a 2-day ground, and this is one step in that direction."

I think you mentioned that it delivered a $25 million loss in 2014 for Nordstrom and $30 million in 2015 is expected. Is that differential just a step-up from purchase accounting?

It's about 11% of the total company's inventory, and so we continue through the vendor partnerships and relationships to have a terrific access to product that's closed out in the season that we're able to literally pack and hold in a warehouse and use the following -- 6 months later. It helps us turn the corner in each of the existing stores. It particularly is a key component for the new store growth. We mentioned that we opened 27 stores last year and 27 this year. Pack-and-hold enables us to execute that. So that's an approach with our vendor partnerships and vendor -- or inventory maximization that's -- we're really pleased with them working well. 
In terms of the 300 stores, it's a pretty fluid model opening the Rack's in terms of the lead time, particularly compared to full-line stores. And we're just learning with each one, and we continue to get great reception from the customer. I think it's really reflected in, and we've said this before, in the productivity of the stores. They both maintained and enhanced slightly with the addition of these new stores. So we're encouraged by those opportunities. Sometimes there are some vagaries in the retail or the real estate market year-to-year, but we feel very confident looking ahead between now and 2020, given the criteria we use for new stores, the customer demand, the opportunities that are out there, that we feel very confident to publicly state that we should have 300 stores by 2020."

That's where we get the highest returns, and any excess capital that we have we'll return to shareholders. And we're going to put any proceeds we might get from that through that identical lens. In terms of the Rack, the Rack has and consistently operates with a 4-wall operating margin, consistent with the full-line stores. As we go through this accelerated phase, you have a little bit of a uplift because you're recognizing rent on an accelerated basis before the store opens. But as those new stores start to become a smaller piece of the pie, we should see that 4-wall contribution start to get back to what is a more normal run rate."

As you know, our customer strategy is squarely focused on serving customers on their terms and delivering the high level of service they expect from us. While we are uniquely positioned to serve customers through multiple ways, full-price, off-price, stores and online, we know customers simply view us as Nordstrom.
The core of our #1  goal of improving the customer experience, we are focused on a One Nordstrom approach that links our businesses through service, product and capabilities. This is important for our customers and critical in generating long-term profitable growth. We shared our sales ambition of over $20 million by 2020. To achieve this, increasing customer acquisition and cross shopping are important outcomes to improve our relevance with both new and existing customers. We made notable progress over the last year exceeding our strongest gain in new customer growth in recent history. We've also seen increased cross shopping across our businesses, reflecting our efforts to give customers more choices, how and where they would like to shop.
Turning to our first quarter performance, we're pleased with our results, which were in line with our expectations. Our top line momentum continued with total sales growth of 10% and comp sales increase of 4.4%. This also reflect the disciplined execution and planned growth initiatives. Later, Mike will provide more color on our performance. We are encouraged with our ongoing rollout into Canada, which over time, represents $1 billion sales opportunity. In March, we open our second store in Canada in Ottawa, Ontario. This fall, we will open our flagship store in Vancouver, which we expect to be one of our largest volume stores. This effort will also strengthen our capabilities leading to our outcoming flagship stores in Toronto and Manhattan. In addition to 6 full-line stores announced in Canada, we also look forward to hear and see Nordstrom Rack in the fall of 2017.
In March, we also expanded our full-line presence with our store opening in San Juan, Puerto Rico. In October, we will add to our 116 full-line stores in the U.S. with our second store in Minneapolis and our first in Milwaukee. We're also relocating our south-based store in Los Angeles to the nearby fashion center. With respect to the Rack, we are on track with our accelerated growth plan, opening 10 stores this quarter. These stores exceeded our expectations and continued the Rack's 12% sales growth. Just last week, we opened another Rack store in Bellman, California with 16 more planned this fall. A year ago, the HauteLook team launched NordstromRack.com to elevate the Nordstrom experience -- customer experience. The moment continues with our online off-price business, which delivered tremendous sales growth of 50% in the first quarter.
From a merchandise perspective, we're responding to our customers desire for fresh, relevant brands with the introduction of Charlotte Tilbury, Madewell, Randy Mill Golf and several others, including those offered in our curated shop-in-shops. We're making progress in providing our customers with a shopping experience that is seamless and relevant. For example, we've experienced outside growth in our BP, Topshop and Savvy Department, particularly where we've created strong adjacencies in our stores. Topshop continues to be a terrific partnership for us, attracting new customers with on-trend fashion at accessible prices.
A few years ago, we started with an offer of 15 doors and online. Based on strong sales performance and customer demand, we planned to expand to roughly 90 doors by the end of the year from 67 today. Our personalization efforts are another way for us to elevate the customer experience. In 2014, we saw tangible results from our mobile enhancements to make shopping easier and more convenient. We added location-based features that are driving in-store sales and enabling a more seamless experience. More recently, we integrated our rewards program to make it more convenient for customers to receive notifications as well as check and redeem their rewards.
As we looked ahead, in addition to our upcoming store openings, we are on track with our other initiatives to improve the customer experience. This fall, we look forward to providing our customers the faster delivery enabled by our third fulfillment center located in Pennsylvania. Additionally, we will roll out our expanded multi rewards program to all stores and online in the second half of the year.
In closing, our customer strategy is guided by customer expectations around speed, convenience and personalization. We believe we are well-positioned to deliver an exemplary experience for our customers, no matter how they choose to shop with us.
With that, I'll turn it over to Mike."

Our first quarter earnings per diluted share of $0.66 were in line with our expectations. We delivered strong top line results, achieving total sales growth of 10% and a comp increase of 4.4%. Over the past several years, we've been making strategic investments in Canada, Trunk Club and HauteLook. In the first quarter, these businesses added $100 million in sales. As Blake mentioned, our online off-price business generated an impressive 50% increase, significantly accelerating since the launch of NordstromRack.com, a year ago.
The full-price business generated total sales increase of 5%. This included full-line stores comp increase of 0.5%, reflecting improving trends over the last year. Additionally, NordstromRack.com's momentum continues with a 20% increase. In off-price, the store and online businesses [indiscernible] 15%. [indiscernible] sales were up 12%, reflecting above planned performance in these stores. Backend slide comp decrease of 0.2%. We believe these results are temporary and are maintaining full year expectations of low single digit comp increase in the Rack.
Our EBIT performance in the first quarter reflects planned growth initiatives including Trunk Club and Canada. These initiatives are expected to have a relatively larger dilutive impact in the first half of the year. With our first quarter performance on plan, we are reiterating our full year earnings outlook of $3.65 to $3.80 and sales growth of 7% to 9%. Our first quarter performance was consistent with expectations, notably in gross profit, inventory and SG&A. Gross profit increased slightly over the last year by 7 basis points. Our SG&A ranging increased roughly 140 basis points over last year, due to our planned investments in Trunk Club, Canada, fulfillment and technology.
Inventory grew 19% over last year compared with sales growth of 10%. We continue to make the necessary inventory investments to fuel our store and online growth. We ended the quarter on plan and current across our businesses. Now we'd like to provide additional color on our long-term growth plan. 
Our strategic investments are a critical driver behind our ambition to deliver a best-in-class customer experience and long-term profitable growth. Over the next 5 years, we plan to invest $4.3 billion [ph] in CapEx or roughly 5% of sales, which we plan to fund through our current operations. Approximately $1 billion or 25% is planned for Canada and Manhattan. We view these projects as generational investments to meaningfully elevate our brand and gain market share over the next several decades. We are also investing for growth in existing channels. As stores represents the core of our brand and the foundation for a multichannel experience, 20% of our plan will support new store growth and reinvestment. Additionally, technology and fulfillment are key enablers in creating synergies across our business, making up the remainder of the plan at 35%.
We previously shared with you this year's CapEx plan of $1.2 billion or 8% of sales. As we stated, we expect 2015 to be the peak investment year due to the concurrent timing of multiple growth initiatives. This includes Canada, Manhattan, several flagship, remodels and a third fulfillment center. We expect CapEx in subsequent years to normalize below our planned average of 0.5% of sales.
Finally, we'd like to comment on the potential sale of our credit receivables. As a reminder, we started this process a year ago with the goal of maintaining the important relationship we have with our customers while allowing for improvement in our capital efficiency. We are nearing the end of the process and will be in position to provide an update in the second quarter.
In closing, our focus on serving more customers while delivering an exemplary experience is driving both top line sales growth and shareholder return. We're excited about the momentum in our business and look forward to the opportunities ahead.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Trina."

We're seeing synergies of those businesses with things like a product, I think our product in NordstromRack.com has improved significantly since launch. There's -- we're continuing to explore some synergies with marketing. But again, there's a point while there are some customers that go back and forth, there's -- there are separate customers.

As you know, our customer strategy is squarely focused on serving customers on their terms and delivering the high level of service they expect from us. While we are uniquely positioned to serve customers through multiple ways, full-price, off-price, stores and online, we know customers simply view us as Nordstrom.
To support our #1 goal of improving the customer experience, we are focused on a One Nordstrom approach that links our businesses through service, product and capabilities. This is important for our customers and critical in generating long-term profitable growth. 
We've shared our sales ambition of over $20 billion by 2020. To achieve this, increasing customer acquisition and cross-shopping are important outcomes to improve our relevance with both new and existing customers. We've made notable progress over the last year, achieving our strongest gain in new customer growth in recent history. We've also seen increased cross-shopping across our businesses, reflecting our efforts to give customers more choices in how and where they would like to shop.
Turning to our first quarter performance, we're pleased with our results, which were in line with our expectations. Our top line momentum continued with total sales growth of 10% and a comp sales increase of 4.4%. Results reflected disciplined execution and planned growth initiatives. Later, Mike will provide more color on our performance. 
We are encouraged with our ongoing rollout into Canada, which over time, represents $1 billion sales opportunity. In March, we opened our second store in Canada, in Ottawa, Ontario. This fall, we will open our flagship store in Vancouver, which we expect to be one of our largest volume stores. This effort will also strengthen our capabilities leading to our upcoming flagship stores in Toronto and Manhattan. In addition to 6 full-line stores announced in Canada, we also look forward to introducing Nordstrom Rack in the fall of 2017.
In March, we also expanded our full-line presence with our store opening in San Juan, Puerto Rico. In October, we will add to our 116 full-line stores in the U.S. with our second store in Minneapolis and our first in Milwaukee. We are also relocating our South Bay store in Los Angeles to the nearby Del Amo Fashion Center. 
With respect to the Rack, we are on track with our accelerated growth plan, opening 10 stores this quarter. These stores exceeded our expectations and continued to Rack's 12% total sales growth. Just last week, we opened another Rack store in Dublin, California, with 16 more planned this fall. 
A year ago, the HauteLook team launched NordstromRack.com to elevate the Nordstrom experience -- customer experience. The moment continues with our online off-price business, which delivered tremendous sales growth of 50% in the first quarter.
From a merchandise perspective, we're responding to our customers' desire for fresh, relevant brands with the introduction of Charlotte Tilbury, Madewell, Brandy Melville and several others, including those offered in our curated pop-in shops. We're making progress in providing our customers with a shopping experience that is seamless and relevant. For example, we've experienced outsized growth in our BP, Topshop and Savvy departments, particularly where we've created strong adjacencies in our stores. Topshop continues to be a terrific partnership for us, attracting new customers with on-trend fashion at accessible prices. 3 years ago, we started with an offer of 15 doors and online. Based on strong sales performance and customer demand, we plan to expand to roughly 90 doors by the end of the year, from 67 today. 
Our personalization efforts are another way for us to elevate the customer experience. In 2014, we saw tangible results from our mobile enhancements to make shopping easier and more convenient. We've added location-based features that are driving in-store sales and enabling a more seamless experience. More recently, we integrated our rewards program to make it more convenient for customers to receive notifications as well as check and redeem their rewards.
As we looked ahead, in addition to our upcoming store openings, we are on track with our other initiatives to improve the customer experience. This fall, we look forward to providing our customers with faster delivery enabled by our third fulfillment center located in Pennsylvania. Additionally, we will roll out our expanded multi-tender rewards program to all stores and online in the second half of the year.
In closing, our customer strategy is guided by customer expectations around speed, convenience and personalization. We believe we are well positioned to deliver an exemplary experience for our customers, no matter how they choose to shop with us.
With that, I'll turn it over to Mike."

Reinforcing Blake's comments, our #1 goal is to improve the customer experience. Knowing customers increasingly expect both a personalized and convenient experience, we will continue to make investments that enable us to serve customers on their terms.
Our first quarter earnings per diluted share of $0.66 were in line with our expectations. We delivered strong top line results, achieving total sales growth of 10% and a comp increase of 4.4%. Over the past several years, we've been making strategic investments in Canada, Trunk Club and HauteLook. In the first quarter, these businesses added $100 million in sales. As Blake mentioned, our online/off-price business generated an impressive 50% increase, significantly accelerating since the launch of NordstromRack.com, a year ago.
Our full-price business generated a total sales increase of 5%. This included full-line stores' comp increase of 0.5%, reflecting improving trends over the last year. Additionally, Nordstrom.com's momentum continues with a 20% increase. In off-price, the store and online businesses grew 16%. Rack sales were up 12%, reflecting above-plan performance in new stores. Rack had a slight comp decrease of 0.2%. We believe these results are temporary and are maintaining full year expectations of low single digit comp increases at the Rack.
Our EBIT performance in the first quarter reflects planned growth initiatives including Trunk Club and Canada. These initiatives are expected to have a relatively larger dilutive impact in the first half of the year. With our first quarter performance on plan, we are reiterating our full year earnings outlook of $3.65 to $3.80 and sales growth of 7% to 9%. 
Our first quarter performance was consistent with expectations, notably in gross profit, inventory and SG&A. Gross profit increased slightly over the last year by 7 basis points. Our SG&A rate increased roughly 140 basis points over last year, due to our planned investments in Trunk Club, Canada, fulfillment and technology.
Inventory grew 19% over last year compared with sales growth of 10%. We continue to make the necessary inventory investments to fuel our store and online growth. We ended the quarter on plan and current across our businesses. 
Now we'd like to provide additional color on our long-term growth plan. Our strategic investments are a critical driver behind our ambition to deliver a best-in-class customer experience and long-term profitable growth. Over the next 5 years, we plan to invest $4.3 billion in CapEx or roughly 5% of sales, which we plan to fund through our current operations. Approximately $1 billion or 25% is planned for Canada and Manhattan. We view these projects as generational investments to meaningfully elevate our brand and gain market share over the next several decades. We are also investing for growth in existing channels. As our stores represent the core of our brand and the foundation for a multi-channel experience, 40% of our plan will support new store growth and reinvestment. Additionally, technology and fulfillment are key enablers in creating synergies across our business, making up the remainder of the plan at 35%.
We previously shared with you this year's CapEx plan of $1.2 billion or 8% of sales. As we've stated, we expect 2015 to be the peak investment year due to the concurrent timing of multiple growth initiatives. This includes Canada, Manhattan, several flagship remodels and a third fulfillment center. We expect CapEx in subsequent years to normalize below our planned average of 0.5% of sales.
Finally, we'd like to comment on the potential sale of our credit receivables. As a reminder, we started this process a year ago with the goal of maintaining the important relationship we have with our customers while allowing for improvement in our capital efficiency. We are nearing the end of the process and will be in a position to provide an update in the second quarter.
In closing, our focus on serving more customers, while delivering an exemplary experience, is driving both top line sales growth and shareholder returns. We're excited about the momentum in our business and look forward to the opportunities ahead.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Trina."

So as I think we've been talking about we're trying to make improvements with those clearances to make it more efficient, more compelling for customers and ultimately, we'll have less days of clearance over time. We're on track to do that this year. We are going to be making some changes with what they look like, how they look like online, what we call them, how we communicate with customers. We see some pretty exciting opportunities to make those more effective and that will evolve over the rest of the year."

A Half Yearly is a brand that we've used over the years to communicate what that event is all about. But we typically use that last weekend, Memorial Day weekend, in May to clear out a big chunk of our early spring assortment and make room for -- more room for the anniversary goods that are coming in. So really nothing has changed about that. We are going from having that late May event from just women's and kids' to include men's as well. So it's all stores, they're all store event.

As you know, our customer strategy is squarely focused on serving customers on their terms and delivering the high level of service they expect from us. While we are uniquely positioned to serve customers through multiple ways, full-price, off-price, stores and online, we know customers simply view us as Nordstrom.
To support our #1 goal of improving the customer experience, we are focused on a One Nordstrom approach that links our businesses through service, product and capabilities. This is important for our customers and critical in generating long-term profitable growth. 
We've shared our sales ambition of over $20 billion by 2020. To achieve this, increasing customer acquisition and cross-shopping are important outcomes to improve our relevance with both new and existing customers. We've made notable progress over the last year, achieving our strongest gain in new customer growth in recent history. We've also seen increased cross-shopping across our businesses, reflecting our efforts to give customers more choices in how and where they would like to shop.
Turning to our first quarter performance, we're pleased with our results, which were in line with our expectations. Our top line momentum continued with total sales growth of 10% and a comp sales increase of 4.4%. Results reflected disciplined execution and planned growth initiatives. Later, Mike will provide more color on our performance. 
We are encouraged with our ongoing rollout into Canada, which over time, represents $1 billion sales opportunity. In March, we opened our second store in Canada, in Ottawa, Ontario. This fall, we will open our flagship store in Vancouver, which we expect to be one of our largest volume stores. This effort will also strengthen our capabilities leading to our upcoming flagship stores in Toronto and Manhattan. In addition to 6 full-line stores announced in Canada, we also look forward to introducing Nordstrom Rack in the fall of 2017.
In March, we also expanded our full-line presence with our store opening in San Juan, Puerto Rico. In October, we will add to our 116 full-line stores in the U.S. with our second store in Minneapolis and our first in Milwaukee. We are also relocating our South Bay store in Los Angeles to the nearby Del Amo Fashion Center. 
With respect to the Rack, we are on track with our accelerated growth plan, opening 10 stores this quarter. These stores exceeded our expectations and continued to Rack's 12% total sales growth. Just last week, we opened another Rack store in Dublin, California, with 16 more planned this fall. 
A year ago, the HauteLook team launched NordstromRack.com to elevate the Nordstrom experience -- customer experience. The moment continues with our online off-price business, which delivered tremendous sales growth of 50% in the first quarter.
From a merchandise perspective, we're responding to our customers' desire for fresh, relevant brands with the introduction of Charlotte Tilbury, Madewell, Brandy Melville and several others, including those offered in our curated pop-in shops. We're making progress in providing our customers with a shopping experience that is seamless and relevant. For example, we've experienced outsized growth in our BP, Topshop and Savvy departments, particularly where we've created strong adjacencies in our stores. Topshop continues to be a terrific partnership for us, attracting new customers with on-trend fashion at accessible prices. Three years ago, we started with an offer of 15 doors and online. Based on strong sales performance and customer demand, we plan to expand to roughly 90 doors by the end of the year, from 67 today. 
Our personalization efforts are another way for us to elevate the customer experience. In 2014, we saw tangible results from our mobile enhancements to make shopping easier and more convenient. We've added location-based features that are driving in-store sales and enabling a more seamless experience. More recently, we integrated our rewards program to make it more convenient for customers to receive notifications as well as check and redeem their rewards.
As we looked ahead, in addition to our upcoming store openings, we are on track with our other initiatives to improve the customer experience. This fall, we look forward to providing our customers with faster delivery enabled by our third fulfillment center located in Pennsylvania. Additionally, we will roll out our expanded multi-tender rewards program to all stores and online in the second half of the year.
In closing, our customer strategy is guided by customer expectations around speed, convenience and personalization. We believe we are well positioned to deliver an exemplary experience for our customers, no matter how they choose to shop with us.
With that, I'll turn it over to Mike."

Reinforcing Blake's comments, our #1 goal is to improve the customer experience. Knowing customers increasingly expect both a personalized and convenient experience, we will continue to make investments that enable us to serve customers on their terms.
Our first quarter earnings per diluted share of $0.66 were in line with our expectations. We delivered strong top line results, achieving total sales growth of 10% and a comp increase of 4.4%. Over the past several years, we've been making strategic investments in Canada, Trunk Club and HauteLook. In the first quarter, these businesses added $100 million in sales. As Blake mentioned, our online/off-price business generated an impressive 50% increase, significantly accelerating since the launch of NordstromRack.com, a year ago.
Our full-price business generated a total sales increase of 5%. This included full-line stores' comp increase of 0.5%, reflecting improving trends over the last year. Additionally, Nordstrom.com's momentum continues with a 20% increase. In off-price, the store and online businesses grew 16%. Rack sales were up 12%, reflecting above-plan performance in new stores. Rack had a slight comp decrease of 0.2%. We believe these results are temporary and are maintaining full year expectations of low single-digit comp increases at the Rack.
Our EBIT performance in the first quarter reflects planned growth initiatives including Trunk Club and Canada. These initiatives are expected to have a relatively larger dilutive impact in the first half of the year. With our first quarter performance on plan, we are reiterating our full year earnings outlook of $3.65 to $3.80 and sales growth of 7% to 9%. 
Our first quarter performance was consistent with expectations, notably in gross profit, inventory and SG&A. Gross profit increased slightly over the last year by 7 basis points. Our SG&A rate increased roughly 140 basis points over last year, due to our planned investments in Trunk Club, Canada, fulfillment and technology.
Inventory grew 19% over last year compared with sales growth of 10%. We continue to make the necessary inventory investments to fuel our store and online growth. We ended the quarter on plan and current across our businesses. 
Now we'd like to provide additional color on our long-term growth plan. Our strategic investments are a critical driver behind our ambition to deliver a best-in-class customer experience and long-term profitable growth. Over the next 5 years, we plan to invest $4.3 billion in CapEx or roughly 5% of sales, which we plan to fund through our current operations. Approximately $1 billion or 25% is planned for Canada and Manhattan. We view these projects as generational investments to meaningfully elevate our brand and gain market share over the next several decades. We are also investing for growth in existing channels. As our stores represent the core of our brand and the foundation for a multi-channel experience, 40% of our plan will support new store growth and reinvestment. Additionally, technology and fulfillment are key enablers in creating synergies across our business, making up the remainder of the plan at 35%.
We previously shared with you this year's CapEx plan of $1.2 billion or 8% of sales. As we've stated, we expect 2015 to be the peak investment year due to the concurrent timing of multiple growth initiatives. This includes Canada, Manhattan, several flagship remodels and a third fulfillment center. We expect CapEx in subsequent years to normalize below our planned average of 0.5% of sales.
Finally, we'd like to comment on the potential sale of our credit receivables. As a reminder, we started this process a year ago with the goal of maintaining the important relationship we have with our customers while allowing for improvement in our capital efficiency. We are nearing the end of the process and will be in a position to provide an update in the second quarter.
In closing, our focus on serving more customers, while delivering an exemplary experience, is driving both top line sales growth and shareholder returns. We're excited about the momentum in our business and look forward to the opportunities ahead.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Trina."

I understand you use a grid, but would you expect to offset the options dilution that your share count would be lower over the course of the year?

I'll tell you from a merchandise margin standpoint, we're relatively even with last year. We had some deleverage and some components of the expense and some leverage in other components of the expense that make up that line. The other thing to understand is that the Rack becomes a larger percentage total of the business. Rack has a lower merchandise margin than the rest of the business. And so you're going to have just, by the very nature, a mixed impact of that. But our margins, overall, were on plan, so we felt good about the performance there. In terms of share repurchase, we, every quarter, we recalibrate our buyback matrix. We still have a substantial amount of authorization left to buy back shares and we're still committed to a balanced approach to reallocating -- to allocating that capital.

As you know, our customer strategy is squarely focused on serving customers on their terms and delivering the high level of service they expect from us. While we are uniquely positioned to serve customers through multiple ways, full-price, off-price, stores and online, we know customers simply view us as Nordstrom.
To support our #1 goal of improving the customer experience, we are focused on a One Nordstrom approach that links our businesses through service, product and capabilities. This is important for our customers and critical in generating long-term profitable growth. 
We've shared our sales ambition of over $20 billion by 2020. To achieve this, increasing customer acquisition and cross-shopping are important outcomes to improve our relevance with both new and existing customers. We've made notable progress over the last year, achieving our strongest gain in new customer growth in recent history. We've also seen increased cross-shopping across our businesses, reflecting our efforts to give customers more choices in how and where they would like to shop.
Turning to our first quarter performance, we're pleased with our results, which were in line with our expectations. Our top line momentum continued with total sales growth of 10% and a comp sales increase of 4.4%. Results reflected disciplined execution and planned growth initiatives. Later, Mike will provide more color on our performance. 
We are encouraged with our ongoing rollout into Canada, which over time, represents $1 billion sales opportunity. In March, we opened our second store in Canada, in Ottawa, Ontario. This fall, we will open our flagship store in Vancouver, which we expect to be one of our largest volume stores. This effort will also strengthen our capabilities leading to our upcoming flagship stores in Toronto and Manhattan. In addition to 6 full-line stores announced in Canada, we also look forward to introducing Nordstrom Rack in the fall of 2017.
In March, we also expanded our full-line presence with our store opening in San Juan, Puerto Rico. In October, we will add to our 116 full-line stores in the U.S. with our second store in Minneapolis and our first in Milwaukee. We are also relocating our South Bay store in Los Angeles to the nearby Del Amo Fashion Center. 
With respect to the Rack, we are on track with our accelerated growth plan, opening 10 stores this quarter. These stores exceeded our expectations and continued to Rack's 12% total sales growth. Just last week, we opened another Rack store in Dublin, California, with 16 more planned this fall. 
A year ago, the HauteLook team launched NordstromRack.com to elevate the Nordstrom experience -- customer experience. The moment continues with our online off-price business, which delivered tremendous sales growth of 50% in the first quarter.
From a merchandise perspective, we're responding to our customers' desire for fresh, relevant brands with the introduction of Charlotte Tilbury, Madewell, Brandy Melville and several others, including those offered in our curated pop-in shops. We're making progress in providing our customers with a shopping experience that is seamless and relevant. For example, we've experienced outsized growth in our BP, Topshop and Savvy departments, particularly where we've created strong adjacencies in our stores. Topshop continues to be a terrific partnership for us, attracting new customers with on-trend fashion at accessible prices. Three years ago, we started with an offer of 15 doors and online. Based on strong sales performance and customer demand, we plan to expand to roughly 90 doors by the end of the year, from 67 today. 
Our personalization efforts are another way for us to elevate the customer experience. In 2014, we saw tangible results from our mobile enhancements to make shopping easier and more convenient. We've added location-based features that are driving in-store sales and enabling a more seamless experience. More recently, we integrated our rewards program to make it more convenient for customers to receive notifications as well as check and redeem their rewards.
As we looked ahead, in addition to our upcoming store openings, we are on track with our other initiatives to improve the customer experience. This fall, we look forward to providing our customers with faster delivery enabled by our third fulfillment center located in Pennsylvania. Additionally, we will roll out our expanded multi-tender rewards program to all stores and online in the second half of the year.
In closing, our customer strategy is guided by customer expectations around speed, convenience and personalization. We believe we are well positioned to deliver an exemplary experience for our customers, no matter how they choose to shop with us.
With that, I'll turn it over to Mike."

Reinforcing Blake's comments, our #1 goal is to improve the customer experience. Knowing customers increasingly expect both a personalized and convenient experience, we will continue to make investments that enable us to serve customers on their terms.
Our first quarter earnings per diluted share of $0.66 were in line with our expectations. We delivered strong top line results, achieving total sales growth of 10% and a comp increase of 4.4%. Over the past several years, we've been making strategic investments in Canada, Trunk Club and HauteLook. In the first quarter, these businesses added $100 million in sales. As Blake mentioned, our online/off-price business generated an impressive 50% increase, significantly accelerating since the launch of NordstromRack.com, a year ago.
Our full-price business generated a total sales increase of 5%. This included full-line stores' comp increase of 0.5%, reflecting improving trends over the last year. Additionally, Nordstrom.com's momentum continues with a 20% increase. In off-price, the store and online businesses grew 16%. Rack sales were up 12%, reflecting above-plan performance in new stores. Rack had a slight comp decrease of 0.2%. We believe these results are temporary and are maintaining full year expectations of low single-digit comp increases at the Rack.
Our EBIT performance in the first quarter reflects planned growth initiatives including Trunk Club and Canada. These initiatives are expected to have a relatively larger dilutive impact in the first half of the year. With our first quarter performance on plan, we are reiterating our full year earnings outlook of $3.65 to $3.80 and sales growth of 7% to 9%. 
Our first quarter performance was consistent with expectations, notably in gross profit, inventory and SG&A. Gross profit increased slightly over the last year by 7 basis points. Our SG&A rate increased roughly 140 basis points over last year, due to our planned investments in Trunk Club, Canada, fulfillment and technology.
Inventory grew 19% over last year compared with sales growth of 10%. We continue to make the necessary inventory investments to fuel our store and online growth. We ended the quarter on plan and current across our businesses. 
Now we'd like to provide additional color on our long-term growth plan. Our strategic investments are a critical driver behind our ambition to deliver a best-in-class customer experience and long-term profitable growth. Over the next 5 years, we plan to invest $4.3 billion in CapEx or roughly 5% of sales, which we plan to fund through our current operations. Approximately $1 billion or 25% is planned for Canada and Manhattan. We view these projects as generational investments to meaningfully elevate our brand and gain market share over the next several decades. We are also investing for growth in existing channels. As our stores represent the core of our brand and the foundation for a multi-channel experience, 40% of our plan will support new store growth and reinvestment. Additionally, technology and fulfillment are key enablers in creating synergies across our business, making up the remainder of the plan at 35%.
We previously shared with you this year's CapEx plan of $1.2 billion or 8% of sales. As we've stated, we expect 2015 to be the peak investment year due to the concurrent timing of multiple growth initiatives. This includes Canada, Manhattan, several flagship remodels and a third fulfillment center. We expect CapEx in subsequent years to normalize below our planned average of 0.5% of sales.
Finally, we'd like to comment on the potential sale of our credit receivables. As a reminder, we started this process a year ago with the goal of maintaining the important relationship we have with our customers while allowing for improvement in our capital efficiency. We are nearing the end of the process and will be in a position to provide an update in the second quarter.
In closing, our focus on serving more customers, while delivering an exemplary experience, is driving both top line sales growth and shareholder returns. We're excited about the momentum in our business and look forward to the opportunities ahead.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Trina."

In terms of capital, I would just reiterate at this point in time, we've got a very balanced approach in terms of how we not only invest our capital, but also how we return it to our shareholders. And so should we be successful with the sale of the credit receivables, then we'll apply those lenses and we'll study what the most appropriate way is to deal with that excess capital and we'll certainly let you know of what we decide."

I'll tell you from a merchandise margin standpoint, we're relatively even with last year.

The other thing to understand is that the Rack becomes a larger percentage total of the business. Rack has a lower merchandise margin than the rest of the business. And so you're going to have just, by the very nature, a mixed impact of that. But our margins, overall, were on plan, so we felt good about the performance there.

As we've previously shared with you, our customer is at the center of our strategy, as we focus on creating a differentiated experience in each of our businesses.

As we've previously shared with you, our customer is at the center of our strategy, as we focus on creating a differentiated experience in each of our businesses. While we've been pursuing distinct strategy to grow each business, we're also working to link them together to provide our customers with a seamless experience. This is important because we know when customers and engage with us across multiple touch points, their lifetime value and spend increase significantly. 
Our second quarter performance demonstrated the ongoing execution of our customer strategy, which is driving continued strength in our business. We achieved total sales growth of 9% and a comp increase of 4.9%. The Anniversary Sale, our largest event of the year, performed on plan and was consistent with our trend, led by strength in Cosmetics and Women's Apparel. 
This past May, we announced our strategic credit partnership with TD Bank. We are pleased to be partnering with a premier financial institution that shares our customer focus and align with our approach of having Nordstrom employees serve our customers directly. We're planning to wrap-up the process by the end of the year, and Mike will provide more detail in his remarks.
As we mentioned, we are focused on further integrating our businesses through service and experience, product and capabilities. Our recent addition of stores and mobile, along with our Trunk Club acquisition, are ways to create a more relevant experience with our customers. We consider full-line stores to be the core of our brand, providing our customers with the high level of service they expect from us. Not only are we serving more customers through new stores, they're benefiting from synergies across our channels.
For example, when we opened in Calgary and Ottawa, we saw meaningful increase in online sales in those markets. With 2 stores opened today, our Canada business is performing ahead of plan. Next month, we will open our Vancouver flagship store, with an elevated service offering. We plan to open 3 stores in Toronto over the next couple of years and introduce Rack's in the fall of 2017.
In the U.S., this October, we will also open full-line stores in Minneapolis and Milwaukee and relocate a store in Los Angeles.
The growth of the Rack is also an important element the for strategy to gain new customers and increase engagement across channels. As we mentioned before, the Rack business now represents our biggest source of new customers, attracting around 4 million in 2014. The Rack also serves an entry point to the Nordstrom brand, providing an opportunities for customers to cross-shopping. For example, last year, we have 1 million Rack customers start to shop at our full-line stores or NordstromRack.com for the first time. We are on track with our Rack growth, with 16 openings planned in the third quarter for a total of 194 stores by the end of the year.
Mobile is an important enabler of convenience, as customers increasingly desire a more seamless shopping experience. Of the U.S. population, 2/3 own a smartphone, and roughly 1/2 shops on their device, presenting a meaningful opportunity for us, with over 90% of our customers using smartphones.
To evolve with our customers' rapidly changing expectations, we're rolling out new features at a rate 3x faster than last year. In addition to our ongoing mobile enhancements, we launched a unique text device future for our salespeople, enabling customers to buy products via text. As customers continue to want a more integrated shopping experience, we view mobile as a long-term priority to provide a richer experience for our customers. 
Roughly a year ago, we acquired Trunk Club, a personalized innovative clothing service for men. Trunk Club is planning to roughly double its sales this year, with opportunity to leverage our existing capabilities and resources. Additionally, Trunk Club stylists have collaborated with our teams to pileup Trunk Club service to women, with a full launched expected in September. We're excited about the shared synergies similar to our experience with the launch of Nordstromrack.com last spring, where we combined e-commerce talent with Rack's merchant expertise. 
From a merchandising perspective, we're also focused on integrating our focus business to provide our customers with a differentiated offering. This is enabled by our vendor partnerships, so we can offer a one-stop shop for distributions across channels and categories. Through these partnerships, we've been able to better serve customers by complementing our and in-store with breadth online. For the past several years, we've expanded online selection by over 20% annually to key brands that are resonating with customers. These brands also help us create excitement and attract new customers.
In particular, we're having success at our younger customer-focused department, which are now among our fastest-growing categories. As recent examples, we're expanding Topshop, Madewell and Brandy Madewell to more doors this year. This unique brand are increasing our fashion relevance with customers, in addition to creating synergies and strength across Women's Apparel.
Lastly, we're building on our enterprise capabilities to support a seamless customer experience. Over the last decade, we have made significant investments to develop our multichannel capabilities. Today, we're also focused on offering our customers faster delivery. This will be enabled by our third fulfillment center, which opens this month and will be fully operational by holiday. The center is expected to increase our fulfillment capacity by over 50% supporting our long-term growth.
In closing, we are confident in our ability to execute our customer strategy as we have all with our customers, focusing on service and experience product and capabilities. 
With that, I'd like to turn over to Mike."

This quarter marked continued progress executing our customer-based strategy and evidence that we are on track to reach our growth ambition of $20 billion by 2020. To achieve this long-term growth, we made a strategic decision several years",991,"Thanks, Blake. This quarter marked continued progress executing our customer-based strategy and evidence that we are on track to reach our growth ambition of $20 billion by 2020. To achieve this long-term growth, we made a strategic decision several years ago to accelerate our investments to gain market share and strengthen our capability. These include generational investments in Canada and Manhattan as well as our strategic investments in Trunk Club and HauteLook.
Technology is also an integral enabler of the customer experience, representing a critical element in linking our enterprise.
Just as importantly, we are adapting to ensure a strong technology platform that delivers the necessary flexibility and scale to achieve our growth ambitions. Given the dynamic nature of customer expectations and its impact to our business, we're committed to evolving our financial model to ensure that we deliver sustainable, profitable growth over the long term. 
In the near term, we are seeing the benefits from our investments, which are driving top line strength in our business. Our 9% sales gain marks the fourth consecutive quarter of high single-digit sales growth. We've invested in new markets and concepts with our entry into Canada and the acquisition of Trunk Club and the at NordstromRack.com launch. In the second quarter, these new businesses collectively added over $100 million to our top line.
We're also seeing continued strength in our existing business. Our combined full-line store and nordstrom.com business delivered mid-single-digit comp increases over the past year. The growth in our off-price business continues with Rack's total sales increase of 13%, which represented 26 consecutive quarters of double-digit growth. Rack had a comp increase of 1.7%, on plan for low single-digit comp for the year.
Nordstromrack.com and HauteLook grew 50% in the first half of the year, on track to reach $0.5 billion by the end of the year.
As discussed previously, we're evolving our clearance strategy to make these events more relevant for our customers. Historically, our merchants had category specific strategies to clear goods. Over the past year, we recognized an opportunity to leverage and scale our business by having all categories participate in clearance events, aligning with the seasonal markdown cadence during major holidays. We believe this is an opportunity to drive more trips and improve sellthrough with fewer days on clearance. This year, we are moving towards 20% fewer clearance days relative to a couple of years ago, with another 25% reduction planned next year.
The quarter demonstrated good execution with respect to inventory and expense. Our gross profit rate was comparable to the prior year. We ended the quarter in a good inventory position, on plan and current. Our inventory growth of 11% reflect the planned growth and was roughly in line with our sales growth of 9%. The underlying inventory trends of our existing business continue to be healthy, reflecting inventory levels and terms in line with our expectations.
Our SG&A rate increased roughly 85 basis points, primarily due to our planned investments in Trunk Club and Canada.
Our Nordstrom Rewards loyalty program is an important way for us to create new and strengthen customer relationships. With 4.5 million customers in our program, Nordstrom numbers increased 10% and represented roughly 44% of our volume this quarter. In addition,, early access to shopping anniversary event continues to be an important benefit, attracting 7% more new members. As we look ahead, we are planning to expand our program to include a tender neutral option for customers, which is targeted for next year.
Next, we'd like to provide additional or our capital framework. We maintain a strong financial position, ending the quarter with a cash balance of $425 million and adjusted debt-to-EBITDA of 2.1x. Maintaining balance capital allocation year-to-date, we incurred $425 million in net CapEx, paid $140 million in dividends and repurchased 265 million of shares with $735 million remaining under current repurchase authorization.
Return on invested capital of 11.9% decreased from 13.2% a year ago, primarily reflecting the acceleration of our growth investments. Our credit card portfolio remains healthy, with delinquencies and write-offs around prerecession levels.
Moving on to the credit transaction. The sale of the receivables will improve our capital efficiency. We expect to receive approximately $1.8 billion in net proceeds at closing.
Because we are planning on fully funding our long-term growth through our current operations, we're not intending to apply the proceeds to our incremental investments. While we are currently evaluating our plans, we are committed to maintaining our capital structure using a balanced approach.
In terms of the financial impact of the transaction, we reclassify the receivables and held for sale in the second quarter, resulting in the reversal of the allowance for bad debt. In addition, under the program agreement with TD Bank, we will be entitled a substantial portion of net revenue generated by the portfolio. We estimate the cash impact of this revenue share agreement, while maintaining our credit operating expenses, will result in roughly 50% of credit EBIT retained. This is based on our current level of receivables. We believe that going forward, this EBITDA could narrow due to our growth in the portfolio.
Lastly, we are working through the details of the transaction and its related accounting treatment. An update of the overall financial impacts will be provided following closing, which is expected by the end of the year.
Now let's turn to our 2015 outlook, which remains on track for the year. Relative to our prior outlook, we narrowed our EPS expectations to the high-end of the range before factoring the second quarter credit impact. At half [ph] 1 [ph] expectations reflect the continuation of current trends, with total sales growth of 8.5% to 9.5% and a comp sales increase of 3.5% to 4.5%.
In closing, we're making progress in executing our strategy in achieving our growth ambitions, which is centered on our goal of delivering a superior customer experience.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Trina."

The comment around capital structure is -- frankly it's about those 2 items you mentioned, but it's also about how we deploy capital. And in one of the things you might have noticed in the last quarter that the amount of capital that we invested was almost equal to the amount of capital that we deployed back to shareholders. And so the inference there is that we want to continue to have a very strong balance sheet, and we want to allocate our capital in a way that delivers the best returns both by reinvesting the business and returning it back to shareholders. So that's basically what we're saying. In terms of the leverage of the investment, well, certainly our intend and what we do is we wouldn't make these investments unless we thought we were creating value, and we still expect them to create value. I think one of the challenges we all face right now, we're still in relatively early stages, particularly in the e-commerce space in terms of understanding how that model is evolving and the element to that model that we need to find to be more productive. So we do expect to continue to create value. We have a long-term aspiration to get back to that midteens ROIC, and that will come from these investments starting to generate some additional profit."

As we've previously shared with you, our customer is at the center of our strategy, as we focus on creating a differentiated experience in each of our businesses. While we've been pursuing distinct strategies to grow each business, we're also working to link them together to provide our customers with a seamless experience. This is important because we know that when customers engage with us across multiple touch points, their lifetime value and spend increase significantly. 
Our second quarter performance demonstrated the ongoing execution of our customer strategy, which is driving continued strength in our business. We achieved total sales growth of 9% and a comp increase of 4.9%. The Anniversary Sale, our largest event of the year, performed on plan and was consistent with our trend, led by strength in Cosmetics and Women's Apparel. 
This past May, we announced our strategic credit partnership with TD Bank. We are pleased to be partnering with a premier financial institution that shares our customer focus and aligns with our approach of having Nordstrom employees serve our customers directly. We're planning to ramp up the process by the end of the year, and Mike will provide more detail in his remarks.
As we mentioned, we are focused on further integrating our businesses through service and experience, product and capabilities. Our recent initiatives around stores and mobile, along with our Trunk Club acquisition, are ways to create a more relevant experience with our customers. We consider full-line stores to be the core of our brand, providing our customers with the high level of service they expect from us. Not only are we serving more customers through new stores, they're benefiting from synergies across our channels.
For example, when we opened in Calgary and Ottawa, we saw meaningful increase in online sales in those markets. With 2 stores opened to date, our Canada business is performing ahead of plan. Next month, we will open our Vancouver flagship store, with an elevated service offering. We plan to open 3 stores in Toronto over the next couple of years and introduce Rack's in the fall of 2017.
In the U.S., this October, we will also open full-line stores in Minneapolis and Milwaukee and relocate a store in Los Angeles.
The growth of the Rack is also an important element of our strategy to gain new customers and increase engagement across channels. As we mentioned before, the Rack business now represents our biggest source of new customers, attracting around 4 million in 2014. The Rack also serves an entry point to the Nordstrom brand, providing an opportunities for customers to cross-shop. For example, last year, we have 1 million Rack customers start to shop at our full-line stores or nordstrom.com for the first time. We are on track with our Rack growth, with 16 openings planned in the third quarter for a total of 194 stores by the end of the year.
Mobile is an important enabler of convenience, as customers increasingly desire a more seamless shopping experience. Of the U.S. population, 2/3 own a smartphone, and roughly 1/2 shops on their device, presenting a meaningful opportunity for us, with over 90% of our customers using smartphones.
To evolve with our customers' rapidly changing expectations, we're rolling out new features at a rate 3x faster than last year. In addition to our ongoing mobile enhancements, we launched a unique text-to-buy future for our salespeople, enabling customers to buy products via text. As customers continue to want a more integrated shopping experience, we view mobile as a long-term priority to provide a richer experience for our customers. 
Roughly a year ago, we acquired Trunk Club, a personalized innovative clothing service for men. Trunk Club is planning to roughly double its sales this year, with opportunities to leverage our existing capabilities and resources. Additionally, Trunk Club stylists have collaborated with the buying -- our buying teams to pilot Trunk Club service to women, with a full launch expected in September. We're excited about the shared synergies similar to our experience with the launch of Nordstromrack.com last spring, and we combined HauteLook's e-commerce talent with Rack's merchant expertise. 
From a merchandising perspective, we're also focused on integrating our business to provide our customers with a differentiated offering. This is enabled by our vendor partnerships, where we can offer a one-stop shop for distribution across channels and categories. Through these partnerships, we've been able to better serve customers by complementing our curation in-store with breadth online. For the past several years, we've expanded online selection by over 20% annually to key brands that are resonating with customers. These brands also help us create excitement and attract new customers.
In particular, we're having success at our younger-customer-focused departments, which are now among our fastest-growing categories. As recent examples, we're expanding Topshop, Madewell and Brandy Melville to more doors this year. These unique brand are increasing our fashion relevance with customers in addition to creating synergies and strength across Women's Apparel.
Lastly, we're building on our enterprise capabilities to support a seamless customer experience. Over the last decade, we have made significant investments to develop our multichannel capabilities. Today, we're also focused on offering our customers faster delivery. This will be enabled by our third fulfillment center, which opens this month and will be fully operational by holiday. The center is expected to increase our fulfillment capacity by over 50%, supporting our long-term growth.
In closing, we are confident in our ability to execute our customer strategy as we evolve with our customers, focusing on service and experience, products and capabilities. 
With that, I'd like to turn it over to Mike."

This quarter marked continued progress executing our customer-based strategy, an evidence that we are on track to reach our growth ambition of $20 billion by 2020. To achieve this long-term growth, we made a strategic decision several years ago to accelerate our investments to gain market share and strengthen our capability. These include generational investments in Canada and Manhattan as well as our strategic investments in Trunk Club and HauteLook. Technology is also an integral enabler of the customer experience, representing a critical element in linking our enterprise.
Just as importantly, we are investing to ensure a strong technology platform that delivers the necessary flexibility and scale to achieve our growth ambitions. Given the dynamic nature of customer expectations and its impact to our business, we are committed to evolving our financial model to ensure that we deliver sustainable, profitable growth over the long term. 
In the near term, we are seeing the benefits from our investments, which are driving top line strength in our business. Our 9% sales gain marks the fourth consecutive quarter of high single-digit sales growth. We've invested in new markets and concepts with our entry into Canada and the acquisition of Trunk Club and the Nordstromrack.com launch. In the second quarter, these new businesses collectively added over $100 million to our top line.
We are also seeing continued strength in our existing business. Our combined full-line store and nordstrom.com business delivered mid-single-digit comp increases over the past year. The growth in our off-price business continues with Rack's total sales increase of 13%, which represented 26 consecutive quarters of double-digit growth. Rack had a comp increase of 1.7%, on plan for low single-digit comp for the year. Nordstromrack.com and HauteLook grew 50% in the first half of the year, on track to reach $0.5 billion by the end of the year.
As discussed previously, we're evolving our clearance strategy to make these events more relevant for our customers. Historically, our merchants had category-specific strategies to clear goods. Over the past year, we recognized an opportunity to leverage and scale our business by having all categories participate in clearance events, aligning with the seasonal markdown cadence during major holidays. We believe this is an opportunity to drive more trips and improve sell-through with fewer days on clearance. This year, we are moving towards 20% fewer clearance days relative to a couple of years ago, with another 25% reduction planned next year.
The quarter demonstrated good execution with respect to inventory and expense. Our gross profit rate was comparable to the prior year. We ended the quarter in a good inventory position, on plan and current. Our inventory growth of 11% reflect that planned growth and was roughly in line with our sales growth of 9%. The underlying inventory trends of our existing business continue to be healthy, reflecting inventory levels and turns in line with our expectations.
Our SG&A rate increased roughly 85 basis points, primarily due to our planned investments in Trunk Club and Canada.
Our Nordstrom Rewards loyalty program is an important way for us to create new and strengthen existing customer relationships. With 4.5 million customers in our program, Nordstrom members increased 10% and represented roughly 44% of our volume this quarter. In addition, early access to shopping anniversary event continues to be an important benefit, attracting 7% more new members. As we look ahead, we are planning to expand our program to include a tender-neutral option for customers, which is targeted for next year.
Next, we'd like to provide additional color on our capital framework. We maintain a strong financial position, ending the quarter with a cash balance of $425 million and adjusted debt-to-EBITDA of 2.1x. Maintaining balance capital allocation year-to-date, we incurred $425 million in net CapEx, paid $140 million in dividends and repurchased $265 million in shares with $735 million remaining under current repurchase authorization.
Return on invested capital of 11.9% decreased from 13.2% a year ago, primarily reflecting the acceleration of our growth investments. Our credit card portfolio remains healthy, with delinquencies and write-offs around prerecession levels.
Moving on to the credit transaction. The sale of the receivables will improve our capital efficiency. We expect to receive approximately $1.8 billion in net proceeds at closing. Because we are planning on fully funding our long-term growth through our current operations, we're not intending to apply the proceeds to our incremental investments. While we are currently evaluating our plans, we are committed to maintaining our capital structure using a balanced approach.
In terms of the financial impact of the transaction, we reclassified our receivables and held for sale in the second quarter, resulting in the reversal of the allowance for bad debt. In addition, under the program agreement with TD Bank, we will be entitled to a substantial portion of net revenue generated by the portfolio. We estimate the cash impact of this revenue share agreement, while maintaining our credit operating expenses will result in roughly 50% of credit EBIT retained. This is based on our current level of receivables. We believe that going forward, this EBIT gap could narrow due to future growth in the portfolio.
Lastly, we are working through the details of the transaction and its related accounting treatment. An update of the overall financial impacts will be provided following closing, which is expected by the end of the year.
Now let's turn to our 2015 outlook, which remains on track for the year. Relative to our prior outlook, we narrowed our EPS expectations to the high end of the range before factoring the second quarter credit impact. Our top line expectations reflect the continuation of current trends, with total sales growth of 8.5% to 9.5% and a comp sales increase of 3.5% to 4.5%.
In closing, we're making progress in executing our strategy in achieving our growth ambitions, which is centered on our goal of delivering a superior customer experience.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Trina."

The comment around capital structure is -- frankly, it's about those 2 items you mentioned, but it's also about how we deploy capital. I think one of the things you might have noticed in the last quarter that the amount of capital that we invested was almost equal to the amount of capital that we deployed back to shareholders. And so the inference there is that we want to continue to have a very strong balance sheet, and we want to allocate our capital in a way that delivers the best returns both by reinvesting in the business and returning it back to shareholders. So that's basically what we're saying. In terms of the leverage of the investment well, certainly, our intent and what we do is we wouldn't make these investments unless we thought we were creating value. And we still expect them to create value. I think one of the challenges we all face right now, we're still in relatively early stages, particularly in the e-commerce space, in terms of understanding how that model is evolving and the element to that model that we need to find to be more productive. So we do expect to continue to create value. We have a long-term aspiration to get back to that mid-teens ROIC, and that will come from these investments starting to generate some additional profit."

Now early on, that building isn't going to be quite as productive as it will be as our business continues to expand, so we will see some drag from that. In terms of Trunk Club, Trunk Club is starting to anniversary the recognition of the acquisition accounting because we acquired that business last year at this time.

We have found some opportunities for our merchandising group to help them. But Trunk Club for women is really a transformational effort for our 2 teams, much like launching rack.com was for our HauteLook team. That was an initiative that really brought our teams together and had to be executed in a highly integrated way. Trunk Club for women is the same.

As we've previously shared with you, our customer is at the center of our strategy, as we focus on creating a differentiated experience in each of our businesses. While we've been pursuing distinct strategies to grow each business, we're also working to link them together to provide our customers with a seamless experience. This is important because we know that when customers engage with us across multiple touch points, their lifetime value and spend increase significantly. 
Our second quarter performance demonstrated the ongoing execution of our customer strategy, which is driving continued strength in our business. We achieved total sales growth of 9% and a comp increase of 4.9%. The Anniversary Sale, our largest event of the year, performed on plan and was consistent with our trend, led by strength in Cosmetics and Women's Apparel. 
This past May, we announced our strategic credit partnership with TD Bank. We are pleased to be partnering with a premier financial institution that shares our customer focus and is aligned with our approach of having Nordstrom employees serve our customers directly. We're planning to ramp up the process by the end of the year, and Mike will provide more detail in his remarks.
As we mentioned, we are focused on further integrating our businesses through service and experience, product and capabilities. Our recent initiatives around stores and mobile, along with our Trunk Club acquisition, are ways to create a more relevant experience with our customers. We consider full-line stores to be the core of our brand, providing our customers with the high level of service they expect from us. Not only are we serving more customers through new stores, they're benefiting from synergies across our channels.
For example, when we opened in Calgary and Ottawa, we saw meaningful increase in online sales in those markets. With 2 stores opened to date, our Canada business is performing ahead of plan. Next month, we will open our Vancouver flagship store, with an elevated service offering. We plan to open 3 stores in Toronto over the next couple of years and introduce Racks in the fall of 2017.
In the U.S., this October, we will also open full-line stores in Minneapolis and Milwaukee and relocate a store in Los Angeles.
The growth of the Rack is also an important element of our strategy to gain new customers and increase engagement across channels. As we mentioned before, the Rack business now represents our biggest source of new customers, attracting around 4 million in 2014. The Rack also serves an entry point to the Nordstrom brand, providing an opportunities for customers to cross-shop. For example, last year, we had 1 million Rack customers start to shop at our full-line stores or nordstrom.com for the first time. We are on track with our Rack growth, with 16 openings planned in the third quarter for a total of 194 stores by the end of the year.
Mobile is an important enabler of convenience, as customers increasingly desire a more seamless shopping experience. Of the U.S. population, 2/3 own a smartphone, and roughly 1/2 shops on their device, presenting a meaningful opportunity for us, with over 90% of our customers using smartphones.
To evolve with our customers' rapidly changing expectations, we're rolling out new features at a rate 3x faster than last year. In addition to our ongoing mobile enhancements, we launched a unique text-to-buy future for our salespeople, enabling customers to buy products via text. As customers continue to want a more integrated shopping experience, we view mobile as a long-term priority to provide a richer experience for our customers. 
Roughly a year ago, we acquired Trunk Club, a personalized innovative clothing service for men. Trunk Club is planning to roughly double its sales this year, with opportunities to leverage our existing capabilities and resources. Additionally, Trunk Club stylists have collaborated with the buying -- our buying teams to pilot Trunk Club service to women, with a full launch expected in September. We're excited about the shared synergies similar to our experience with the launch of Nordstromrack.com last spring, and we combined HauteLook's e-commerce talent with Rack's merchant expertise. 
From a merchandising perspective, we're also focused on integrating our business to provide our customers with a differentiated offering. This is enabled by our vendor partnerships, where we can offer a one-stop shop for distribution across channels and categories. Through these partnerships, we've been able to better serve customers by complementing our curation in-store with breadth online. For the past several years, we've expanded online selection by over 20% annually to key brands that are resonating with customers. These brands also help us create excitement and attract new customers.
In particular, we're having success at our younger-customer-focused departments, which are now among our fastest-growing categories. As recent examples, we're expanding Topshop, Madewell and Brandy Melville to more doors this year. These unique brands are increasing our fashion relevance with customers in addition to creating synergies and strength across Women's Apparel.
Lastly, we're building on our enterprise capabilities to support a seamless customer experience. Over the last decade, we have made significant investments to develop our multichannel capabilities. Today, we're also focused on offering our customers faster delivery. This will be enabled by our third fulfillment center, which opens this month and will be fully operational by holiday. The center is expected to increase our fulfillment capacity by over 50%, supporting our long-term growth.
In closing, we are confident in our ability to execute our customer strategy as we evolve with our customers, focusing on service and experience, products and capabilities. 
With that, I'd like to turn it over to Mike."
32215,308188673,859262,"Nordstrom Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 13, 2015",2015-08-13,"Earnings Calls","Nordstrom, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Blake. This quarter marked continued progress executing our customer-based strategy and evidenced that we are on track to reach our growth ambition of $20 billion by 2020. To achieve this long-term growth, we made a strategic decision several year",994,"Thanks, Blake. This quarter marked continued progress executing our customer-based strategy and evidenced that we are on track to reach our growth ambition of $20 billion by 2020. To achieve this long-term growth, we made a strategic decision several years ago to accelerate our investments to gain market share and strengthen our capability. These include generational investments in Canada and Manhattan as well as our strategic investments in Trunk Club and HauteLook. Technology is also an integral enabler of the customer experience, representing a critical element in linking our enterprise.
Just as importantly, we are investing to ensure a strong technology platform that delivers the necessary flexibility and scale to achieve our growth ambitions. Given the dynamic nature of customer expectations and its impact to our business, we are committed to evolving our financial model to ensure that we deliver sustainable, profitable growth over the long term. 
In the near term, we are seeing the benefits from our investments, which are driving top line strength in our business. Our 9% sales gain marks the fourth consecutive quarter of high single-digit sales growth. We've invested in new markets and concepts with our entry into Canada and the acquisition of Trunk Club and the Nordstromrack.com launch. In the second quarter, these new businesses collectively added over $100 million to our top line.
We are also seeing continued strength in our existing business. Our combined full-line store and nordstrom.com business delivered mid-single-digit comp increases over the past year. The growth in our off-price business continues with Rack's total sales increase of 13%, which represented 26 consecutive quarters of double-digit growth. Rack had a comp increase of 1.7%, on plan for low single-digit comp for the year. Nordstromrack.com and HauteLook grew 50% in the first half of the year, on track to reach $0.5 billion by the end of the year.
As discussed previously, we're evolving our clearance strategy to make these events more relevant for our customers. Historically, our merchants had category-specific strategies to clear goods. Over the past year, we recognized an opportunity to leverage and scale our business by having all categories participate in clearance events, aligning with the seasonal markdown cadence during major holidays. We believe this is an opportunity to drive more trips and improve sell-through with fewer days on clearance. This year, we are moving towards 20% fewer clearance days relative to a couple of years ago, with another 25% reduction planned next year.
The quarter demonstrated good execution with respect to inventory and expense. Our gross profit rate was comparable to the prior year. We ended the quarter in a good inventory position, on plan and current. Our inventory growth of 11% reflected planned growth and was roughly in line with our sales growth of 9%. The underlying inventory trends of our existing business continue to be healthy, reflecting inventory levels and turns in line with our expectations.
Our SG&A rate increased roughly 85 basis points, primarily due to our planned investments in Trunk Club and Canada.
Our Nordstrom Rewards loyalty program is an important way for us to create new and strengthen existing customer relationships. With 4.5 million customers in our program, Nordstrom [ph] members increased 10% and represented roughly 44% of our volume this quarter. In addition, early access to shop the anniversary event continues to be an important benefit, attracting 7% more new members. As we look ahead, we are planning to expand our program to include a tender-neutral option for customers, which is targeted for next year.
Next, we'd like to provide additional color on our capital framework. We maintain a strong financial position, ending the quarter with a cash balance of $425 million and adjusted debt-to-EBITDAR of 2.1x. Maintaining balance capital allocation year-to-date, we incurred $425 million in net CapEx, paid $140 million in dividends and repurchased $265 million in shares with $735 million remaining under current repurchase authorization.
Return on invested capital of 11.9% decreased from 13.2% a year ago, primarily reflecting the acceleration of our growth investments. Our credit card portfolio remains healthy, with delinquencies and write-offs around prerecession levels.
Moving on to the credit transaction. The sale of the receivables will improve our capital efficiency. We expect to receive approximately $1.8 billion in net proceeds at closing. Because we are planning on fully funding our long-term growth through our current operations, we're not intending to apply the proceeds to our incremental investments. While we are currently evaluating our plans, we are committed to maintaining our capital structure using a balanced approach.
In terms of the financial impact of the transaction, we reclassified our receivables as held for sale in the second quarter, resulting in the reversal of the allowance for bad debt. In addition, under the program agreement with TD Bank, we will be entitled to a substantial portion of net revenue generated by the portfolio. We estimate the cash impact of this revenue share agreement, while maintaining our credit operating expenses will result in roughly 50% of credit EBIT retained. This is based on our current level of receivables. We believe that going forward, this EBIT gap could narrow due to future growth in the portfolio.
Lastly, we are working through the details of the transaction and its related accounting treatment. An update of the overall financial impact will be provided following closing, which is expected by the end of the year.
Now let's turn to our 2015 outlook, which remains on track for the year. Relative to our prior outlook, we narrowed our EPS expectations to the high end of the range before factoring the second quarter credit impact. Our top line expectations reflect the continuation of current trends, with total sales growth of 8.5% to 9.5% and a comp sales increase of 3.5% to 4.5%.
In closing, we're making progress in executing our strategy in achieving our growth ambitions, which is centered on our goal of delivering a superior customer experience.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Trina."

So it's less about selling merchandise that our customers put away in their closet for October and November than it used to be.

I think if you look at our top line and overall performance over the last few quarters, you can infer that our evolving clearance strategy is driving part of that. It -- we're pretty happy with our progress there. Clearly, we're moving some sales around on the calendar, and the history gets a little mixed up. But overall, we're pretty happy with the performance so far and results we've had. In terms of promotion, we're not really a promotional retailer. We do compete in an industry that is pretty promotional, and we do often have to compete on price when another retailer might get promotional on a certain brand or classification. We would certainly hope that, as an industry, there is less promotion. And we get more focused on service and differentiated product assortments. We think that's what drives the healthiest business over time and not the short-term promotion. So we certainly welcome that, and we hope that does happen."

The comment around capital structure is -- frankly, it's about those 2 items you mentioned, but it's also about how we deploy capital. I think one of the things you might have noticed in the last quarter that the amount of capital that we invested was almost equal to the amount of capital that we deployed back to shareholders. And so the inference there is that we want to continue to have a very strong balance sheet, and we want to allocate our capital in a way that delivers the best returns both by reinvesting in the business and returning it back to shareholders. So that's basically what we're saying. In terms of the leverage of the investment well, certainly, our intent and what we do is we wouldn't make these investments unless we thought we were creating value. And we still expect them to create value. I think one of the challenges we all face right now, we're still in relatively early stages, particularly in the e-commerce space, in terms of understanding how that model is evolving and the element to that model that we need to find to be more productive.

Now early on, that building isn't going to be quite as productive as it will be as our business continues to expand, so we will see some drag from that. In terms of Trunk Club, Trunk Club is starting to anniversary the recognition of the acquisition accounting because we acquired that business last year at this time.

It's hard to have -- be above average every single year, but those areas I would call out. For the Trunk Club inventory, to date, it's been a men's business and they buy their own inventory. We have found some opportunities for our merchandising group to help them. But Trunk Club for women is really a transformational effort for our 2 teams, much like launching rack.com was for our HauteLook team. That was an initiative that really brought our teams together and had to be executed in a highly integrated way. Trunk Club for women is the same. To execute that successfully, our teams needed to work together. So we will be leveraging our women's inventory to support that business. We'll be buying a little bit extra for it but mainly leveraging our nordstrom.com inventory that is housed in our Cedar Rapids fulfillment center.

While we're on track with executing our long-term strategy, I'd like to first comment on our current performance.

While we're on track with executing our long-term strategy, I'd like to first comment on our current performance. Over the past couple of years, we've had consistent topline trends, delivering 6 straight quarters of mid-single-digit comp increases. Beginning in August, we experienced a slowdown across our full-price and off-price businesses. We had a 6.6% increase in total sales, and our comp sales were 0.9%, which resulted in third quarter earnings that were below our expectations.
While we haven't seen a meaningful change to our customer growth metrics, we did see a decline in our transaction growth relative to the first half of the year. As this softness continued, we've been able to quickly respond, ending the third quarter with inventory aligned with our expected sales plans. As we head into holiday, we don't anticipate a measurable change in current trends, and we've made appropriate adjustments to our operating plans, including our inventory levels. As we look ahead, we remain confident in our strategy, making progress through multiple growth initiatives to enhance the customer experience and serve more customers.
In the third quarter, we had unprecedented number of store openings, with 3 new full-line stores, 1 relocation and 16 Rack stores. This was a noteworthy effort reflecting our investments and our team's successful execution. 
Our total full-price business had a 3.2% sales growth and a comp increase of 0.3%. This includes our continued expansion in Canada, which represents a $1 billion sales opportunity by 2020, with 6 announced full-line stores and potential for roughly 15 Rack stores.
On September 18, we achieved a new milestone with our first international flagship opening in Vancouver, British Columbia. Not only was it the most successful opening we've experienced in our company's history, it is a major step forward in store experience and services. This store will provide learnings as we expand our flagship presence to Toronto next year and later in [indiscernible]
In our U.S. full-line businesses, we opened our second store in Minneapolis, our first in Milwaukee and our relocation in Los Angeles. These stores reflect our latest store designs, which are now featured in 9 locations. We're also investing in our flagship stores in Chicago and Seattle, which are currently undergoing significant remodels.
At Nordstrom.com, we made ongoing progress on our strategic priorities around selection, convenience and experience. This included expanded selection of roughly 20% and an increased capacity with our new East Coast fulfillment center.
Our off-price business, inclusive of Rack stores and online, had a 12% sales growth and a 2.4% comp increase. This business gives us access to new markets and a pipeline of new and younger customers at Nordstrom. Since the launch of NordstromRack.com over a year ago, we are finding that the pace of growth is accelerating faster than we anticipated. To put it in perspective, it took our Nordstrom.com business nearly 15 years to reach $1 billion in sales. From the time we acquired HauteLook in 2011, we expect our online off-price business to achieve this milestone in roughly half that time. 
Similar to our full-price business, we see meaningful synergies for customers to engage with us across stores and online. We are serving more customers with 16 additional stores, taking our total Rack store count to 194. Additionally, our online business had a meaningful gain in new customers to Nordstrom over the last year.
Lastly, on October 1, we completed the sale of our credit portfolio to TD Bank. Our mutual commitment to having Nordstrom employees serve our customers directly was paramount to this partnership. We're also pleased to be returning $1.8 billion in capital directly to our shareholders through a balanced approach. On October 27, we paid a special cash dividend of $900 million or $4.85 per share, and the remaining proceeds will be applied toward share repurchase.
In closing, we are well positioned to our customer strategy while remaining focused on our current execution.
I'd like to now turn it over to Mike, who'll provide more color on our performance and the credit transaction."

This quarter, we experienced a sequential slowdown in sales trends. For several previous quarters, our comp sales were solidly in the mid-single-digit range, driving a high single-digit total sales growth. In August, we began to see a slowdown and that progressed throughout the quarter, remaining relatively steady at a 1% comp sales trend. As these lower trends persisted, we immediately began to adjust our operating plans, including aligning our inventories with expected sales. Our results reflect those efforts, which included increased markdowns and a reduction in sales plans for the remainder of the year. We believe we have made the appropriate adjustments and will continue to move forward with our growth strategies, including Canada,; e-commerce initiatives; and the expansion of our off-price business through new Rack stores and Nordstromrack.com/HauteLook, which are performing above expectations.
Our full-price business, inclusive of full-line stores, Nordstrom.com, Canada and Trunk Club, grew 3.2%, driven by online and new store growth. Canada continues to exceed expectations. Trunk Club is projected to grow at a healthy rate, as we position the company to leverage Nordstrom product and introduce Trunk Club for women.
Turning to our off-price business. We continue to invest in stores and online capabilities, which have [indiscernible] of nearly 20% annualized growth over the last 5 years.
In the third quarter, our off-price sales increased 12%, reflecting online growth that has well surpassed expectations.
Since our acquisition of HauteLook less than 5 years ago, this channel now represents over 10% of our off-price business. In contrast, it took us over 10 years for Nordstrom.com to reach this level of online penetration.
Next, we'd like to provide additional color on our gross profit and inventory performance. Gross profit was negatively impacted by the low planned sales and higher markdowns coming in 163 basis points lower than last year. Inventory growth of 8% was in line with sales growth, reflecting adjustments made to a line inventory levels with our expected sales plans.
Turning to SG&A. Our core operations were well managed, with expenses consistent with expectations. Our SG&A rate increased 68 basis points, primarily due to our growth initiatives at Trunk Club, Canada and fulfillment.
This quarter, we completed the sale of our credit card receivables and would like to provide further detail on that transaction. As previously shared, $1.8 billion of net proceeds are being returned to shareholders, evenly split between the special dividend and share repurchase. We recently completed the payment of a dividend, and we are now preparing to execute the share repurchase portion, which is expected to begin this quarter. 
For 2016, we estimate that the financial impact will be approximately breakeven to earnings per share, considering both the retention of roughly 50% of credit EBIT and $900 million of share repurchase. Going forward, we believe this reduction of credit EBIT will narrow based on portfolio growth through TD's partnership.
Finally, let's turn to our 2015 outlook, which incorporates our third quarter performance and an adjustment to our fourth quarter plans based on current sales trends. When excluding the credit transaction impact, our earnings per diluted share outlook is $3.40 to $3.50 compared with the prior outlook of $3.70 to $3.80. 
As we look ahead, we remain on track to achieve our sales ambition of $20 billion plus by 2020. To reiterate our long-term expectations, we anticipate improvement in earnings growth beginning in 2016, as we move beyond this year's peak level of investment. More specifically, we expect the gap between the sales and earnings growth to narrow over time, as our investments deliver earnings accretion.
As we head into the fourth quarter, we are being rigorous in making the appropriate adjustments to our operating plans in response to current sales trends. Over the longer term, we remain confident that the execution of our strategy will deliver top quartile shareholder return. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Trina."

We think we have the type of functionality and experiences the customer's desire and stuff.

While we're on track with executing our long-term strategy, I'd like to first comment on our current performance.

While we're on track with executing our long-term strategy, I'd like to first comment on our current performance. Over the past couple of years, we've had consistent top line trends, delivering 6 straight quarters of mid-single-digit comp increases. Beginning in August, we experienced a slowdown across our full-price and off-price businesses. We had a 6.6% increase in total sales, and our comp sales were 0.9%, which resulted in third quarter earnings that were below our expectations.
While we haven't seen a meaningful change to our customer growth metrics, we did see a decline in our transaction growth relative to the first half of the year. As this softness continued, we've been able to quickly respond, ending the third quarter with inventory aligned with our expected sales plans. As we head into holiday, we don't anticipate a measurable change in current trends, and we've made appropriate adjustments to our operating plans, including our inventory levels. As we look ahead, we remain confident in our strategy, making progress through multiple growth initiatives to enhance the customer experience and serve more customers.
In the third quarter, we had unprecedented number of store openings, with 3 new full-line stores, 1 relocation and 16 Rack stores. This was a noteworthy effort reflecting our investments and our team's successful execution. 
Our total full-price business had a 3.2% sales growth and a comp increase of 0.3%. This includes our continued expansion in Canada, which represents a $1 billion sales opportunity by 2020, with 6 announced full-line stores and potential for roughly 15 Rack stores.
On September 18, we achieved a new milestone with our first international flagship opening in Vancouver, British Columbia. Not only was it the most successful opening we've experienced in our company's history, it is a major step forward in store experience and services. This store will provide learnings as we expand our flagship presence to Toronto next year and later in Manhattan.
In our U.S. full-line businesses, we opened our second store in Minneapolis, our first in Milwaukee and a relocation in Los Angeles. These stores reflect our latest store design, which are now featured in 9 locations. We're also investing in our flagship stores in Chicago and Seattle, which are currently undergoing significant remodels.
At Nordstrom.com, we made ongoing progress on our strategic priorities around selection, convenience and experience. This included expanded selection of roughly 20% and an increased capacity with our new East Coast fulfillment center.
Our off-price business, inclusive of Rack stores and online, had a 12% sales growth and a 2.4% comp increase. This business gives us access to new markets and a pipeline of new and younger customers to Nordstrom. Since the launch of Nordstromrack.com over a year ago, we are finding that the pace of growth is accelerating faster than we anticipated. 
To put it in perspective, it took our Nordstrom.com business nearly 15 years to reach $1 billion in sales. From the time we acquired HauteLook in 2011, we expect our online off-price business to achieve this milestone in roughly half that time. 
Similar to our full-price business, we see meaningful synergies for customers to engage with us across stores and online. We are serving more customers with 16 additional stores, taking our total Rack store count to 194. Additionally, our online business had a meaningful gain in new customers to Nordstrom over the last year.
Lastly, on October 1, we completed the sale of our credit portfolio to TD Bank. Our mutual commitment to having Nordstrom employees serve our customers directly was paramount to this partnership. 
We're also pleased to be returning $1.8 billion in capital directly to our shareholders through a balanced approach. On October 27, we paid a special cash dividend of $900 million or $4.85 per share, and the remaining proceeds will be applied toward share repurchase. In closing, we are well positioned through our customer strategy while remaining focused on our current execution.
I'd like to now turn it over to Mike, who'll provide more color on our performance and the credit transaction."

This quarter, we experienced a sequential slowdown in sales trends.

This quarter, we experienced a sequential slowdown in sales trends. For several previous quarters, our comp sales were solidly in the mid-single-digit range, driving a high single-digit total sales growth. In August, we began to see a slowdown that progressed throughout the quarter, remaining relatively steady at a 1% comp sales trend. As these lower trends persisted, we immediately began to adjust our operating plans, including aligning our inventories with expected sales. Our results reflect those efforts, which included increased markdowns and a reduction in sales plans for the remainder of the year. We believe we have made the appropriate adjustments and will continue to move forward with our growth strategies, including Canada, e-commerce initiatives and the expansion of our off-price business through new Rack stores and Nordstromrack.com/HauteLook, which are performing above expectations.
Our full-price business, inclusive of full-line stores, Nordstrom.com, Canada and Trunk Club, grew 3.2%, driven by online and new store growth. Canada continues to exceed expectations. Trunk Club is projected to grow at a healthy rate, as we position the company to leverage Nordstrom product and introduce Trunk Club for women.
Turning to our off-price business. We continue to invest in stores and online capabilities, which have fueled nearly 20% annualized growth over the last 5 years. In the third quarter, our off-price sales increased 12%, reflecting online growth that has well surpassed expectations. Since our acquisition of HauteLook less than 5 years ago, this channel now represents over 10% of our off-price business. In contrast, it took us over 10 years for Nordstrom.com to reach this level of online penetration.
Next, we'd like to provide additional color on our gross profit and inventory performance. Gross profit was negatively impacted by the low planned sales and higher markdowns, coming in 163 basis points lower than last year. Inventory growth of 8% was in line with sales growth, reflecting adjustments made to align inventory levels with our expected sales plans.
Turning to SG&A. Our core operations were well managed, with expenses consistent with expectations. Our SG&A rate increased 68 basis points, primarily due to our growth initiatives at Trunk Club, Canada and fulfillment.
This quarter, we completed the sale of our credit card receivables and would like to provide further detail on that transaction. As previously shared, $1.8 billion of net proceeds are being returned to shareholders, evenly split between the special dividend and share repurchase. We recently completed the payment of a dividend, and we are now preparing to execute the share repurchase portion, which is expected to begin this quarter. 
For 2016, we estimate that the financial impact will be approximately breakeven to earnings per share, considering both the retention of roughly 50% of credit EBIT and $900 million of share repurchase. Going forward, we believe this reduction of credit EBIT will narrow based on portfolio growth through TD's partnership.
Finally, let's turn to our 2015 outlook, which incorporates our third quarter performance and an adjustment to our fourth quarter plans based on current sales trends. When excluding the credit transaction impact, our earnings per diluted share outlook is $3.40 to $3.50 compared with the prior outlook of $3.70 to $3.80. 
As we look ahead, we remain on track to achieve our sales ambition of $20 billion plus by 2020. To reiterate our long-term expectations, we anticipate improvement in earnings growth beginning in 2016, as we move beyond this year's peak level of investment. More specifically, we expect the gap between the sales and earnings growth to narrow over time, as our investments deliver earnings accretion.
As we head into the fourth quarter, we are being rigorous in making the appropriate adjustments to our operating plans in response to current sales trends. Over the longer term, we remain confident that the execution of our strategy will deliver top-quartile shareholder return. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Trina."

That being said, again, I'd reiterate that there's really not a seasonal component to where we've seen transactions slow down. Our coat business has been really strong, having big increases. It's just a traffic thing. We've got less people buying clothes this quarter than we expected, and there's really nothing else to point to."

While we're on track with executing our long-term strategy, I'd like to first comment on our current performance.

While we're on track with executing our long-term strategy, I'd like to first comment on our current performance. Over the past couple of years, we've had consistent top line trends, delivering 6 straight quarters of mid-single-digit comp increases. Beginning in August, we experienced a slowdown across our full-price and off-price businesses. We had a 6.6% increase in total sales, and our comp sales were 0.9%, which resulted in third quarter earnings that were below our expectations.
While we haven't seen a meaningful change to our customer growth metrics, we did see a decline in our transaction growth relative to the first half of the year. As this softness continued, we've been able to quickly respond, ending the third quarter with inventory aligned with our expected sales plans. As we head into holiday, we don't anticipate a measurable change in current trends, and we've made appropriate adjustments to our operating plans, including our inventory levels. As we look ahead, we remain confident in our strategy, making progress through multiple growth initiatives to enhance the customer experience and serve more customers.
In the third quarter, we had an unprecedented number of store openings, with 3 new full-line stores, 1 relocation and 16 Rack stores. This was a noteworthy effort reflecting our investments and our team's successful execution. 
Our total full-price business had a 3.2% sales growth and a comp increase of 0.3%. This includes our continued expansion in Canada, which represents a $1 billion sales opportunity by 2020, with 6 announced full-line stores and potential for roughly 15 Rack stores.
On September 18, we achieved a new milestone with our first international flagship opening in Vancouver, British Columbia. Not only was it the most successful opening we've experienced in our company's history, it is a major step forward in store experience and services. This store will provide learnings as we expand our flagship presence to Toronto next year and later in Manhattan.
In our U.S. full-line businesses, we opened our second store in Minneapolis, our first in Milwaukee and a relocation in Los Angeles. These stores reflect our latest store design, which are now featured in 9 locations. We're also investing in our flagship stores in Chicago and Seattle, which are currently undergoing significant remodels.
At Nordstrom.com, we made ongoing progress on our strategic priorities around selection, convenience and experience. This includes expanded selection of roughly 20% and an increased capacity with our new East Coast fulfillment center.
Our off-price business, inclusive of Rack stores and online, had a 12% sales growth and a 2.4% comp increase. This business gives us access to new markets and a pipeline of new and younger customers to Nordstrom. Since the launch of Nordstromrack.com over a year ago, we are finding that the pace of growth is accelerating faster than we anticipated. 
To put it in perspective, it took our Nordstrom.com business nearly 15 years to reach $1 billion in sales. From the time we acquired HauteLook in 2011, we expect our online off-price business to achieve this milestone in roughly half that time. 
Similar to our full-price business, we see meaningful synergies for customers to engage with us across stores and online. We are serving more customers with 16 additional stores, taking our total Rack store count to 194. Additionally, our online business had a meaningful gain in new customers to Nordstrom over the last year.
Lastly, on October 1, we completed the sale of our credit portfolio to TD Bank. Our mutual commitment to having Nordstrom employees serve our customers directly was paramount to this partnership. 
We're also pleased to be returning $1.8 billion in capital directly to our shareholders through a balanced approach. On October 27, we paid a special cash dividend of $900 million or $4.85 per share, and the remaining proceeds will be applied toward share repurchase. In closing, we are well positioned through our customer strategy while remaining focused on our current execution.
I'd like to now turn it over to Mike, who'll provide more color on our performance and the credit transaction."

This quarter, we experienced a sequential slowdown in sales trends.

This quarter, we experienced a sequential slowdown in sales trends. For several previous quarters, our comp sales were solidly in the mid-single-digit range, driving a high single-digit total sales growth. In August, we began to see a slowdown that progressed throughout the quarter, remaining relatively steady at a 1% comp sales trend. As these lower trends persisted, we immediately began to adjust our operating plans, including aligning our inventories with expected sales. Our results reflect those efforts, which included increased markdowns and a reduction in sales plans for the remainder of the year. We believe we have made the appropriate adjustments and will continue to move forward with our growth strategies, including Canada, e-commerce initiatives and the expansion of our off-price business through new Rack stores and Nordstromrack.com/HauteLook, which are performing above expectations.
Our full-price business, inclusive of full-line stores, Nordstrom.com, Canada and Trunk Club, grew 3.2%, driven by online and new store growth. Canada continues to exceed expectations. Trunk Club is projected to grow at a healthy rate, as we position the company to leverage Nordstrom product and introduce Trunk Club for women.
Turning to our off-price business. We continue to invest in stores and online capabilities, which have fueled nearly 20% annualized growth over the last 5 years. In the third quarter, our off-price sales increased 12%, reflecting online growth that has well surpassed expectations. Since our acquisition of HauteLook less than 5 years ago, this channel now represents over 10% of our off-price business. In contrast, it took us over 10 years for Nordstrom.com to reach this level of online penetration.
Next, we'd like to provide additional color on our gross profit and inventory performance. Gross profit was negatively impacted by the low planned sales and higher markdowns, coming in 163 basis points lower than last year. Inventory growth of 8% was in line with sales growth, reflecting adjustments made to align inventory levels with our expected sales plans.
Turning to SG&A. Our core operations were well managed, with expenses consistent with expectations. Our SG&A rate increased 68 basis points, primarily due to our growth initiatives at Trunk Club, Canada and fulfillment.
This quarter, we completed the sale of our credit card receivables and would like to provide further detail on that transaction. As previously shared, $1.8 billion of net proceeds are being returned to shareholders, evenly split between the special dividend and share repurchase. We recently completed the payment of a dividend, and we are now preparing to execute the share repurchase portion, which is expected to begin this quarter. 
For 2016, we estimate that the financial impact will be approximately breakeven to earnings per share, considering both the retention of roughly 50% of credit EBIT and $900 million of share repurchase. Going forward, we believe this reduction of credit EBIT will narrow based on portfolio growth through TD's partnership.
Finally, let's turn to our 2015 outlook, which incorporates our third quarter performance and an adjustment to our fourth quarter plans based on current sales trends. When excluding the credit transaction impact, our earnings per diluted share outlook is $3.40 to $3.50 compared with the prior outlook of $3.70 to $3.80. 
As we look ahead, we remain on track to achieve our sales ambition of $20 billion plus by 2020. To reiterate our long-term expectations, we anticipate improvement in earnings growth beginning in 2016, as we move beyond this year's peak level of investment. More specifically, we expect the gap between sales and earnings growth to narrow over time, as our investments deliver earnings accretion.
As we head into the fourth quarter, we are being rigorous in making the appropriate adjustments to our operating plans in response to current sales trends. Over the longer term, we remain confident that the execution of our strategy will deliver top-quartile shareholder return. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Trina."

Maybe just -- can you talk about what you saw in each of those 2 businesses? And then separately, any thoughts about relaxing the credit standards on the credit card? As you guys determine with TD what the right standards are, you guys run at a very low rate of write-off, bad debt.

We actually saw a little bit of the opposite of what you described. Full-line was fairly consistent with their margin performance this year versus last year and Racks were up -- or down slightly due to increased markdown. And I guess, the biggest contributor to that would be -- we're really pleased with the online, off-price part of the business, Nordstromrack.com and HauteLook. The vast majority of the HauteLook customers, when engaging in a return, are visiting our Rack, and we think that's a real plus to the company. But that's generated a comparison from last year some more markdowns to move some of those goods. So totally for Nordstrom, Inc., it's a good thing, but the Rack incurred some more markdowns on that."

The first thing is we've always tried to build a long-term relationship with our customer through our credit card. And the customers that have joined us and that have opened accounts have been very loyal. As a matter of fact, this year, we're on track to open another million new accounts, and we've opened those accounts with the same credit standards we've always had. So in terms of using that as a lever, I think we would be very thoughtful and cautious about that. Sometimes those generate near-term sales, but don't necessarily generate the healthiest sales. And so we'll continue to look at that as perhaps pockets of opportunity, but I wouldn't say that is a material lever to impacting sales."
