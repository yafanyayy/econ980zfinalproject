Thank you for joining us today and thank you for your interest in CenterPoint Energy. This morning, we reported full-year earnings of $611 million or $1.42 per diluted share as compared to $311 million or $0.72 per diluted share in 2013. Using the same basis that we used when providing guidance, full-year adjusted earnings would have been $1.27 per diluted share in 2014 compared to $1.20 for 2013.
Included in 2014 earnings is a $29 million tax benefit, which equates to $0.07 per share, which Gary will discuss later. Utility Operations contributed $0.83 per diluted share and Midstream Investments contributed $0.44 for 2014.
I'm pleased with our overall 2014 performance. With a new leadership team, refreshed corporate vision and strategy and successful IPO of Enable Midstream Partners, we took important steps in 2014 to set a new foundation for the company, while delivering strong business results.
In June of last year, we laid out our investment and growth plans for our utilities, and I'm happy to confirm, we remained on target to achieve those goals.
Further, our management transition plan has gone very smoothly. With the addition of Bill Rogers, as the incoming CFO, the new senior management team is now in place. The new team has the right mix of industry experience, functional knowledge and personal dedication necessary to continue moving our company forward.
Our financial performance is driven by customer growth, capital additions, timely recovery of investments and ongoing cost management. 2014 was a record year for capital investments at our utilities and our new 5-year plan includes approximately $7.4 billion of capital spend for Utility Operations, which is in line with our upside case presented in June of 2014.
In 2014, we continue to benefit from a number of positive trends. Economic and customer growth was strong within our footprint, especially in Texas and Minnesota. Growth in the Houston area will continue to benefit from 3 key themes. First, construction remain strong across the residential, commercial and industrial sectors and the inventories are maintaining at reasonable levels.
According to Mark, the chief economist and director of research at Texas A&M Real Estate Center, 8 million square feet of new industrial space will be completed in 2015, much of it will be used to support continued growth in the petrochemical sector.
Additionally, vacancy rates in some parts of the city are at all-time lows. Second, Houston has demonstrated the ability to grow in both high and low energy commodity cycles. The Houston area population has grown steadily since 1990, despite oil prices cycling between $20 and $150 per barrel. And third, the local economy is much more diversed than in years past. According to the City of Houston, in 1981, the economic base was dominated by energy-related businesses, with nearly 85% of all jobs in those sectors. Today, nearly 1/2 of all jobs are in nonenergy sectors, such as business services, technology, aerospace, medicine and manufacturing.
While Houston's projected job growth is below last year's near record pace, the forecasted increase of 60,000 jobs, or 2%, remains in line with long-term trends.
Much attention lately has been on energy commodity prices and their impact on Enable. Last week, Enable provided a reduced 2015 guidance range, which reflects the near-term effects of those lower prices and a recent decline in rig count in the areas in which Enable operates.
From a longer-term perspective, we remained positive on the fundamental that underline Enable's growth story. Enable set itself apart from other MLPs with their investment grade balance sheet, strong organic growth opportunities and a constructive balance of acreage dedications, fixed fee contracts and minimum volume commitment contracts that support much of their income.
Enable's customer base in relationships as well as the geographic base and diversity will continue to provide opportunities, even with energy price volatility. Enable provides a significant contribution to our dividend, while allowing us to focus our capital investment on our utility businesses.
As you all know, today will be Gary Whitlock's last earnings call as CFO of CenterPoint Energy. Gary has been with the company since its inception in 2002 and was a key part of the management team that dealt with several challenges and opportunities. I worked closely with Gary over his entire time and his experience, knowledge and counsel will be missed. His replacement, Bill Rodgers, comes to us with many years of utility and banking experience. And while it will be tough to fill Gary's shoes, Bill will certainly bring his own brand of experience and leadership capabilities to our senior management team and the

Looking forward, we will drive our strategy to operate, serve and grow. From an operation perspective, we will continue to emphasize safety, reliability and efficiency. We will enhance service to our customers and our communities. Our capital investments will support growth and our service territories ensure central system upgrade and improve customer service, which will position the company for success and as a leader in our industry.
Let me wrap by commending our employees who met challenges of 2014 head on. They implemented innovative solutions for our customers, executed on a large capital program to meet the current and future infrastructure needs and gave back to their communities in their spare time.
This year, we were named as a Civic 50 award recipient for our contributions to our communities. This award recognizes the nation's most civic minded companies. And I'm honored that we were selected as the 2014 utility sector recipient. Our employees are the heart of our success and their collective performance is much appreciated.
I will now ask Tracy to discuss electric operations"
279513,281254683,771151,"CenterPoint Energy, Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 26, 2015",2015-02-26,"Earnings Calls","CenterPoint Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Scott. Houston Electric's 2014 financial performance was solid and in line with our expectations. Core operating income was $477 million compared to $474 million in 2013. Growth of nearly 55,000 customers in 2014 contributed $33 million of incr",708,"Thank you, Scott. Houston Electric's 2014 financial performance was solid and in line with our expectations. Core operating income was $477 million compared to $474 million in 2013. Growth of nearly 55,000 customers in 2014 contributed $33 million of incremental revenue. We benefited $15 million from a higher energy efficiency performance bonus in 2014, $8 million of which is related to the resolution of our bonus appeal. We also benefited $23 million from higher equity returns, primarily related to throughput proceeds. These increases were partially offset by milder weather, lower right-of-way revenue, higher operating and maintenance expense and depreciation.
As you have heard, Houston continues to be a vibrant place to work and live, which is reflected in our throughput and customer growth for 2014. Global throughput increased over 2% and customer growth increased over 2.4% in 2014. Of the top 10 most populous metro areas in the nation, the greater Houston area's population growth rate consistently ranked in the top 2.
In response ongoing customer and load growth, Houston Electric has been investing significant capital to ensure that our customers' electricity needs are reliably and safely met.
In 2014, Houston Electric invested $818 million of capital, which represents an approximate 8% increase over 2013's capital expenditure level.
This year, we expect Houston Electric to continue delivering solid results. Given the current commodity price environment, we anticipate customer growth will decline, but remain healthy at 2% in 2015. We plan to invest over $900 million of capital this year and approximately $4.4 billion over the next 5 years. This investment will be use to improve service reliability and system resiliency, enhance our customer service systems and support load growth and ongoing system maintenance. This level of capital investment results in rate base growth consistent with the growth rate we have previously provided despite the rate base reduction associated with bonus depreciation in 2014.
I'd like to discussed 2 projects in our capital investment plan that help demonstrate the growth in our service territory. Many of you are familiar with the Houston Import Project. We are responsible for the southern half of this project, known as the Abrazo's Valley Connection. This project is critical for electric reliability in the Houston region as a result of forecasted load growth and insufficient local generation. Houston Electric will file for approval and its portion of the project with the Public Utility Commission of Texas in April. We anticipate the capital cost of the Abrazo Valley connection will be approximately $300 million. 
Another project that demonstrates the load growth in our service territory is our Jones Creek project. This $86 million transmission investment will enable the delivery of 656 megawatts of power to serve 3 port LNGs new $10 billion plus natural gas liquefaction export facility.
The LNG plant will help drive economic growth in our service area. Our Jones Creek project is expected to be in service beginning in the December of 2017 and Freeport LNG will be one of our largest industrial customers, once the project is fully operational in 2018?
In addition to growth products, we continue to see strong interest in the use of our right-of-way, indicating continued pipeline expansion activity associated with growth in our service area.
In 2015, we are forecasting right-of-way revenue in the range of $10 million to $20 million. Regarding regulatory matters, we do not anticipate the need for a general rate case filing at Houston Electric in the near-term. We do, however, plan to make a distribution cost recovery factor filing in April, which will allow us to earn a return on distribution capital invested since our last rate case.
Rate increases from the filing will go into effect later this year, and most of the benefit will be realized in 2016.
This recovery mechanism, along with our transmission cost of service mechanism, will be very effective in reducing recovery lag and mitigating the need for time-consuming, possibly general rate cases.
I am pleased with the results this year and with our prospects for the future. Houston Electric continues to execute on its plan to provide safe, reliable and efficient electric service for its growing service territory.
I'll now turn the call over to Joe McGoldrick, who will update you on Gas Operations."

We continue to invest in system upgrades and growth, while pursuing new technology to improve system safety, reliability and enhance customer service. The natural gas utility business has been successful in part by proactively working with the regulatory commissions to implement innovative rate mechanisms that reduce lag and recovering these investments.
In addition, our Energy Services business was able to take advantage of basis volatility, which created asset optimization opportunities and increased throughput and margin due to extreme cold weather. 
Gas Operations reported $339 million in operating income for 2014 comprised of a record-setting $287 million in our natural gas utilities and $52 million from our Energy Services business.
By comparison, Gas Operations reported $276 million in 2013, comprised of $263 million in our natural gas utilities and $30 million in our Energy Services business.
National gas utilities had an outstanding year. We added nearly 36,000 new customers, a 1% increase, with the strongest growth in Minnesota and Texas and throughput in our system increased by 4%.
This business also benefited from the extreme cold weather in the first quarter of 2014 as we reached the cap on our weather hedge by February and consequently, enjoyed the benefit of adding margin for the rest of the winter and early spring.
Rate increases accounted for $37 million of improved revenue, helping us increase in O&M and D&A during the year.
Natural gas utilities invested $525 million in 2014, which represents an approximate 22% increase over 2013. We anticipate that this elevated capital investment will continue to drive rate base and earnings growth. Our new 5-year plan includes $2.7 billion of capital, which is slightly above the high end of the capital investment plan we shared with you last June.
A $170 million conversion of automated metering technology is substantially complete in 4 of the 6 states we server. We plan to upgrade the remaining 420,000 meters this year to complete the project. Upon completion, we will upgrade 3.4 million meters. We also continue to invest in capital and replacement. 2 good examples of this are the multiyear $400 million Minnesota Belt Line project and our accelerated cast iron and bare steel replacement program.
These investments have improved our system reliability, safety and our customer experience and we are proud of what we have accomplished.
Our increased capital spending is impacting D&A, which was up $16 million or approximately 9% versus 2013. While 2014 O&M expenses were up 4% over the prior year, the annual growth rate between 2011 and 2014 was 1% after adjusting for pass-through expenses.
Going forward, we will manage O&M expenses to approximately a 3% compound annual growth rate. On the regulatory front, we anticipate filing general rate cases in 2015 in our Texas Coast, Minnesota and Arkansas rate jurisdictions. will also file annual rate mechanisms in other service territories, including our grip asset recovery mechanism in our Houston, South Texas and East Texas divisions.
Implementation of new rates will be staggered over 2015 and 2016. In Minnesota, interim rates will go in effect approximately 60 days after filing the rate case later this summer and will be threw up once final rates are determined in 2016.
The majority of increases related to all of these filings will be reflected in 2016 results. The Energy Services business, after adjusting for mark-to-market accounting, would have reported operating income of $23 million in 2014 compared to $15 million in 2013. This business benefited from 2 key factors in 2014. First, basis volatility created asset optimization revenues not experienced in many years. And second, the extreme cold weather increased throughput and margin from our weather-sensitive customers.
When combined with solid expense management, including some workforce reductions, Energy Services had a very good year. Going forward, we will focus on opportunities within our core footprint.
I am proud of the reliable service we continue to deliver to our customers, often volatile and constrained market conditions, such as those created by last year's extreme weather. We remained focused on delivering gas safely and reliably, creating first-rate customer service experiences and providing customers with product and service options that meet their growing needs.
I'll now turn the call over to Gary for an update on financial activities."
279513,281254683,771151,"CenterPoint Energy, Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 26, 2015",2015-02-26,"Earnings Calls","CenterPoint Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Joe, and good morning to everyone.

A few topics to review this morning and we'd like to start by discussing the financial results for our businesses. Our Utility Operations reported very solid earnings of $0.83 per diluted share on a guidance basis. These results included a tax benefit of $29 million or $0.07 per diluted share from the periodic reconciliation of deferred taxes related to booked and tax balance sheet.
After adjusting for this tax benefit, Utility Operations would have reported $0.76 per diluted share, which is at the upper end of our 2014 guidance range of $0.72 to $0.76. Additionally, Enable reported strong fourth quarter and full-year earnings. They delivered solid increases in net income, adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow and increased their fourth quarter 2014 unit distribution by 7% over the partnership's minimum quarterly distribution.
The strong performance of Enable in 2014 resulted in our Midstream Investments reporting earnings of $0.44 per diluted share for the full year, which is also at the upper end of our 2014 guidance range of $0.42 to $0.45 per diluted share.
In addition, we received $305 million of cash distributions from Midstream Investment. Consistent with our dividend policy, this cash distribution, net of tax, are used to support our dividend.
I would now like to discuss our earnings guidance for 2015. As Carla noted in providing this guidance, we take into account certain, but not all variables, that may impact actual performance. Let me start with our Midstream Investment. Enable is well positioned to be successful in today's lower and changing energy commodity market. Enable has investment grade credit rating, low leverage and substantial liquidity. When combined with a significant fee-based margin business, minimum volume commitment contracts and thoughtful hedging strategy, integrated assets and a seasoned management team, we expect they will continue to execute their business plan, by taking the necessary actions to be successful and is more challenging business environment.
Based on the latest outlook and guidance provided by Enable, we estimate the equity earnings from our Midstream Investments to be in the range of $0.29 to $0.35 per diluted share. This guidance range our current LP ownership interest of 55.4% and includes the amortization of a basis difference in Enable. 
Now, let me turn to our earnings guidance for Utility Operations, which includes the earnings at the parent company and our Energy Services businesses. I would like to describe 3 items that favorably impacted our 2014 Utility Operations result by $0.06 per diluted share.
Taking these 3 items into consideration, provides our 2014 Utility Operations baseline earnings. First, our 2014 equity return, related to true-up proceeds, is $0.03 per share higher that anticipated in 2015 as a result of the to true-up the amounts recorded inception today. Second, we benefited $0.02 per share from favorable weather. And third, we received a $0.01 per share benefit from a favorable ruling related to our 2008 energy efficiency bonus appeal. We have included a reconciliation to the $0.70 baseline earning in our year-end supplemental materials.
Our earnings guidance range for Utility Operations for 2015 is $0.71 to $0.75 per diluted share. Using the midpoint of this earnings guidance range of $0.73 compared to the 2014 baseline of $0.70, we expect Utility Operations to grow 4.2% this year, with a 4% to 6% compound annual growth rate expected through 2019.
We have assumed a consolidated effective tax rate of approximately 37%, which includes a 38% booked tax rate for Enable's earning and an average share count of 431 million shares.
The resulting consolidated earnings guidance range for 2015 is $1 to $1.10 per diluted share. And we will keep you updated on our earnings expectation on a quarterly basis.
As you have previously heard, our 5-year plan outlines approximately $7.4 billion of capital investment. We expect to finance this capital spending would a thoughtful approach of raising equity and debt on a timeframe as needed to ensure that our regulatory capital structure are appropriate and our debt credit rating remain strong investment grade. Due to the cash flow benefit of bonus depreciation being extended in 2014, we do not see any need for equity in 2015.
In future years, we expect to raise equity to fund our capital plan, through the sale of additional issue shares through our saving and investment choice plans.
Next, I would like to remind you of our dividend policy. In the 24 and 3 quarter cent per share, quarterly dividend declared by Board of Directors on January 31. This dividend rate represents a 4.2% increase from our 2014 dividend when annualized and represents a 19% increase in the dividend rate since the formation of Enable in 2013.
Although this dividend increase is lower than what we had anticipated when we provided a dividend growth rate forecast last year, it nonetheless represents a significant increase and reflects the latest outlook and guidance from Enable. It also includes the projected cash tax rate for Enable distributions, averaging approximately 25%, increasing from 15% to 32% through 2018.
Due to the limited forward-looking time frame with Enable's guided, we don't feel it's appropriate to find a dividend growth rate forecast at this time. However, our objective remains unchanged, which is to provide our shareholders a growing dividend that reflects the long-term stability and growth in our regulated utilities, combined with after-tax cash distributions we received from Enable. We believe this policy represents a strong commitment to our shareholders.
As mentioned earlier, I will be retiring from the company and Bill Rodgers has been named my successor. Bill is an outstanding finance professional and is a servant leader with great integrity. Bill, Scott and the entire executive management team are talented professionals who are committed to serve our shareholders, employees, customers, creditors and the communities where we live and work, and CenterPoint Energy could not be in better hands.
And finally, I want to acknowledge David McClanahan, Scott Rozzell and Tom. We all worked together from the formation of the company and I want to thank them for affording me the privilege of working beside them this past years to help CenterPoint Energy become a stronger company.
Most importantly, I want to thank all of our employees, who worked safely each day to serve our customers and our community. Thank you for your continued interest in CenterPoint Energy. And I would now turn the call back over to Carla."

We've now redone our full 5-year capital plan to include '15 through '19 and that '15 through '19 number, which drops '14 adds '19, is now 7.4. So that number, that new 5-year number is now at the top line of the range. So hopefully, that clarifies the capital fees, if Andrew is still listening, that may provide a little more clarity for him as well. You then asked about the growth and rate base. We have said that the rate base growth for the utilities would be, depending on which 1 you're looking at, somewhere around 7 to 10 or 8 to 10. And then on the electric 1, the new forecast, is it's at the high end of that range. We describe it now at 8 to 10. The gas utility rate base is still in that same range, it still falls on that same range. And what we've indicated around our earnings growth is that at the high end of this investment, we would be moving towards the top end or the higher end of our earnings growth range. We did not have a different earnings growth range number. We just said we would be striving towards the higher end. The dynamic that affects this growth rate on our earnings is there's a few of them. One is that I think you -- we've mentioned to you all, we have some high starting points for some of our utilities, either full-year earnings, or in some cases, they were slightly above allowed return. And that affects the starting point of this growth rate. There certainly is a fair amount of regulatory lag, even though we have these mechanism since that time period is so short, if you're investing all of this capital, by the time you get to year 5, you've essentially financed all this capital, but you don't have a good amount of that capital yet in rate base earning. Said another way, if you were to taper off capital or capital were to taper off towards the end, the earnings would improve, but you would be paying for that through reductions and earnings down the road because your capital investment had slowed down. So that is a factor. And then the other factor is that over this period of time, there are some assumptions for some amount of equity issuance, so that we maintain the right balance between debt and equity. So all 3 of those factors lead into the fact that the rate base growth is more than what we experienced on our earnings growth."

So that rebaselining goes back to essentially the guidance that we provided at the start of last year. And then of course as we went through the year, as we do each year, we will adjust guidance based on what we've actually experienced as well as leaving the range in tact to account for additional variabilities throughout the year."

Scott Prochazka, President and CEO; Tracy Bridge, Executive Vice President and President of our Electric Division; Joe McGoldrick, Executive Vice President and President of our Gas Division; and Gary Whitlock, Executive Vice President and CFO, will discuss our fourth quarter 2014 results and provide highlights on other key areas.
We also have with us our new incoming CFO, Bill Rogers, and other members of management present who may assist in answering questions following the prepared remarks.
Please note that we may announce material information using SEC filings, press releases, public conference calls, webcasts and posts to the Investors section of our website. In the future, we will continue to use these channels to communicate important information about the company, key personnel, corporate initiatives, regulatory updates and other matters. Information that we post on our website could be deemed material. Therefore, we encourage investors, the media, our customers, business partners, and others interested in our company to review the information we post on our website.
Today, management is going to discuss certain topics that will contain projections and forward-looking information that are based on management's beliefs as well as assumptions made by and information currently available to management. These forward-looking statements suggest predictions or expectations and thus are subject to risks or uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially based upon factors, including weather variations, legislative and regulatory actions, timing and extent of changes in commodity prices, growth or decline in our service territories and other risk factors noted in our SEC filings.
With the formation of Enable Midstream Partners, the way we present our financial results have changed. As a result, we will refer to our equity investment in Enable as Midstream Investments and to the remainder of our businesses as Utility Operations. 
We will also discuss our guidance for 2015. The Utility Operations guidance range considers performance to date and certain significant variables that may impact earnings such as weather, regulatory, and judicial proceedings, volumes, commodity prices, ancillary services, tax rate, interest rate and financing activity.
In providing this guidance, the company does not include other potential impacts, such as the impact of any changes in accounting standards, any impact to earnings from the change in the value of ZENS securities and the related stock or the timing effects of mark-to-market and inventory accounting in the company's energy services business.
In providing Midstream Investments' guidance, the company takes into account such factors as Enable's most recent public forecast, effective tax rate, the amortization of our basis differential in Enable and other factors. The company does not include other potential impact such as the impacts of any changes in accounting standards for Enable's unusual items. 
For the reconciliation of the earnings guidance provided in today's call, please refer to our earnings press release, which along with our Form 10-K, updated debt maturity and equity return amortization schedule and year-end supplemental materials have been posted on our website, centerpointenergy.com underneath the Investor section.

This morning, we reported full-year earnings of $611 million or $1.42 per diluted share as compared to $311 million or $0.72 per diluted share in 2013. Using the same basis that we use when providing guidance, full-year adjusted earnings would have been $1.27 per diluted share in 2014 compared to $1.20 for 2013.
Included in 2014 earnings is a $29 million tax benefit, which equates to $0.07 per share, which Gary will discuss later. Utility Operations contributed $0.83 per diluted share and Midstream Investments contributed $0.44 for 2014.
I'm pleased with our overall 2014 performance. With a new leadership team, refreshed corporate vision and strategy and successful IPO of Enable Midstream Partners, we took important steps in 2014 to set a new foundation for the company while delivering strong business results.
In June of last year, we laid out our investment and growth plans for our utilities, and I'm happy to confirm, we remain on target to achieve those goals. Further, our management transition plan has gone very smoothly. With the addition of Bill Rogers, as the incoming CFO, the new senior management team is now in place. The new team has the right mix of industry experience, functional knowledge and personal dedication necessary to continue moving our company forward.
Our financial performance is driven by customer growth, capital additions, timely recovery of investments and ongoing cost management. 2014 was a record year for capital investments at our utilities, and our new 5-year plan includes approximately $7.4 billion of capital spend for Utility Operations, which is in line with our upside case presented in June of 2014.
In 2014, we continued to benefit from a number of positive trends. Economic and customer growth was strong within our footprint, especially in Texas and Minnesota. Growth in the Houston area will continue to benefit from 3 key themes. 
First, construction remain strong across our residential, commercial and industrial sectors and the inventories are maintaining at reasonable levels. According to Mark Dotzour, the Chief Economist and Director of Research at Texas A&M Real Estate Center, 8 million square feet of new industrial space will be completed in 2015, much of which will be used to support continued growth in the petrochemical sector. Additionally, vacancy rates in some parts of the city are at all-time lows. 
Second, Houston has demonstrated the ability to grow in both high and low-energy commodity cycles. The Houston area population has grown steadily since 1990, despite oil prices cycling between $20 and $150 per barrel. 
And third, the local economy is much more diversed than in years past. According to the City of Houston, in 1981, the economic base was dominated by energy-related businesses with nearly 85% of all jobs in those sectors. Today, nearly 1/2 of all jobs are in non-energy sectors, such as business services, technology, aerospace, medicine and manufacturing. While Houston's projected job growth is below last year's near-record pace, the forecasted increase of 60,000 jobs or 2% remains in line with long-term trends.
Much attention lately has been on energy commodity prices and their impact on Enable. Last week, Enable provided a reduced 2015 guidance range, which reflects the near-term effects of those lower prices and a recent decline in rig count in the areas in which Enable operates.
From a longer-term perspective, we remained positive on the fundamentals that underlie Enable's growth story. Enable sets itself apart from other MLPs with their investment-grade balance sheet, strong organic growth opportunities and a constructive balance of acreage dedications, fixed-fee contracts and minimum-volume-commitment contracts that support much of their income.
Enable's customer base and relationships as well as their geographic base and diversity will continue to provide opportunities, even with energy price volatility. Enable provides a significant contribution to our dividend, while allowing us to focus our capital investment on our utility businesses.
As you all know, today will be Gary Whitlock's last earnings call as CFO of CenterPoint Energy. Gary has been with the company since its inception in 2002 and was a key part of the management team that dealt with several challenges and opportunities. I worked closely with Gary over his entire time and his experience, knowledge, and counsel will be missed. His replacement, Bill Rogers, comes to us with many years of utility and banking experience and while it will be tough to fill Gary's shoes, Bill will certainly bring his own brand of experience and leadership capabilities to our senior management team and the

Looking forward, we will drive our strategy to operate, serve and grow. From an operations perspective, we will continue to emphasize safety, reliability and efficiency. We will enhance service to our customers and our communities. Our capital investments will support growth and our service territories ensure essential system upgrades and improve customer service, which will position the company for success and as a leader in our industry.
Let me wrap up by commending our employees, who met challenges of 2014 head on. They implemented innovative solutions for our customers, executed on a large capital program to meet the current and future infrastructure needs and gave back to their communities in their spare time.
This year, we were named as a Civic 50 award recipient for our contributions to our communities. This award recognizes the nation's most civic minded companies and I'm honored that we were selected as the 2014 Utilities Sector recipient. Our employees are the heart of our success and their collective performance is much appreciated.
I will now ask Tracy to discuss electric operations"
279513,281254683,771587,"CenterPoint Energy, Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 26, 2015",2015-02-26,"Earnings Calls","CenterPoint Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Scott. Houston Electric's 2014 financial performance was solid and in line with our expectations. Core operating income was $477 million compared to $474 million in 2013. Growth of nearly 55,000 in metered customers in 2014 contributed $33 mill",706,"Thank you, Scott. Houston Electric's 2014 financial performance was solid and in line with our expectations. Core operating income was $477 million compared to $474 million in 2013. Growth of nearly 55,000 in metered customers in 2014 contributed $33 million of incremental revenue. We benefited $15 million from a higher energy efficiency performance bonus in 2014, $8 million of which is related to the resolution of our bonus appeal. We also benefited $23 million from higher equity returns, primarily related to true-up proceeds. 
These increases were partially offset by milder weather, lower rights-of-way revenue, higher operating and maintenance expense and depreciation.
As you have heard, Houston continues to be a vibrant place to work and live, which is reflected in our throughput and customer growth for 2014. Home throughput increased over 2% and customer growth increased over 2.4% in 2014. Of the top 10 most populous metro areas in the nation, the greater Houston area's population growth rate consistently ranked in the top 2. In response ongoing customer and load growth, Houston Electric has been investing significant capital to ensure that our customers' electricity needs are reliably and safely met.
In 2014, Houston Electric invested $818 million of capital, which represents an approximate 8% increase over 2013's capital expenditure level. This year, we expect Houston Electric to continue delivering solid results. Given the current commodity price environment, we anticipate customer growth will decline but remain healthy at 2% in 2015. We plan to invest over $900 million of capital this year and approximately $4.4 billion over the next 5 years. 
This investment will be used to improve service reliability and system resiliency, enhance our customer service systems and support load growth and ongoing system maintenance. This level of capital investment results in rate base growth consistent with the growth rate we have previously provided, despite the rate base reduction associated with bonus depreciation in 2014.
I'd like to discussed 2 projects in our capital investment plan that help demonstrate the growth in our service territory. Many of you are familiar with the Houston Import Project. We are responsible for the southern half of this project known as the Brazos Valley Connection. 
This project is critical for electric reliability in the Houston region as a result of forecasted load growth and insufficient local generation. Houston Electric will file for approval in its portion of the project with the Public Utility Commission of Texas in April. We anticipate the capital cost of the Brazos Valley Connection will be approximately $300 million. 
Another project that demonstrates the load growth in our service territory is our Jones Creek Project. This $86 million transmission investment will enable the delivery of 656 megawatts of power to serve Freeport LNG's new $10 billion-plus natural gas liquefaction export facility. The LNG plant will help drive economic growth in our service area. Our Jones Creek Project is expected to be in service beginning in December of 2017, and Freeport LNG will be one of our largest industrial customers once the project is fully operational in 2018.
In addition to growth products, we continue to see strong interest in the use of our rights-of-way, indicating continued pipeline expansion activity associated with growth in our service area. In 2015, we are forecasting rights-of-way revenue in the range of $10 million to $20 million. 
Regarding regulatory matters, we do not anticipate the need for a general rate case filing at Houston Electric in the near-term. We do, however, plan to make a Distribution Cost Recovery Factor filing in April, which will allow us to earn return on distribution capital invested since our last rate case.
Rate increases from the filing would go into effect later this year, however, most of the benefit would be realized in 2016. This recovery mechanism, along with our transmission cost-of-service mechanism will be very effective in reducing recovery lag and mitigating the need for time-consuming, possibly [ph] general rate cases.
I am pleased with the results of this year and with our prospects for the future. Houston Electric continues to execute on its plan to provide safe, reliable, and efficient electric service for its growing service territory.
I'll now turn the call over to Joe McGoldrick, who will update you on gas operations."

We continued to invest in system upgrades and growth while pursuing new technology to improve system safety, reliability and enhance customer service. The natural gas utility business has been successful, in part, by proactively working with the regulatory commissions to implement innovative rate mechanisms that reduce lag in recovering these investments.
In addition, our energy services business was able to take advantage of basis volatility, which created asset optimization opportunities and increased throughput and margin due to extreme cold weather. 
Gas Operations reported $339 million in operating income for 2014 comprised of a record-setting $287 million in our natural gas utilities and $52 million from our energy services business. By comparison, Gas Operations reported $276 million in 2013, comprised of $263 million in our natural gas utilities and $30 million in our energy services business.
Natural gas utilities had an outstanding year. We added nearly 36,000 new customers, a 1% increase, with the strongest growth in Minnesota and Texas, and throughput on our system increased by 4%. This business also benefited from the extreme cold weather in the first quarter of 2014, as we reached the cap on our weather-hedge by February and consequently, enjoyed the benefit of added margins the rest of the winter and early spring.
Rate increases accounted for $37 million of improved revenue, helping offset increases in O&M and D&A during the year. Natural gas utilities invested $525 million in 2014, which represents an approximate 22% increase over 2013. We anticipate that this elevated capital investment will continue to drive rate base and earnings growth. 
Our new 5-year plan includes $2.7 billion of capital, which is slightly above the high end of the capital investment plan we shared with you last June. Our $170 million conversion of automated metering technology is substantially complete in 4 of the 6 states we serve. We plan to upgrade the remaining 420,000 meters this year to complete the project. Upon completion, we will have upgraded 3.4 million meters. 
We also continued to invest capital in pipe replacement. 2 good examples of this are: the multiyear, $400 million Minnesota Beltline Project; and our accelerated cast-iron- and bare-steel-main-replacement program. These investments have improved our system reliability, safety and our customer experience and we are proud of what we have accomplished.
Our increased capital spending is impacting D&A, which was up $16 million or approximately 9% versus 2013. While 2014 O&M expenses were up 4% over the prior year, the annual growth rate between 2011 and 2014 was 1%, after adjusting for pass-through expenses.
Going forward, we'll manage O&M expenses to approximately a 3% compound annual growth rate. On the regulatory front, we anticipate filing general rate cases in 2015 in our Texas Coast, Minnesota and Arkansas rate jurisdictions. We will also file annual rate mechanisms in other service territories, including our GRIP asset recovery mechanism in our Houston, South Texas and East Texas divisions.
Implementation of new rates will be staggered over 2015 and 2016. In Minnesota, interim rates will go in effect approximately, 60 days after filing the rate case later this summer, and will be trued-up once final rates are determined in 2016. The majority of increases related to all of these filings will be reflected in 2016 results. 
The energy services business, after adjusting for mark-to-market accounting, would have reported operating income of $23 million in 2014 compared to $15 million in 2013. This business benefited from 2 key factors in 2014: first, basis volatility created asset optimization revenues, not experienced in many years; and second, the extreme cold weather increased throughput and margin from our weather-sensitive customers.
When combined with solid expense management, including some workforce reductions, energy services had a very good year. Going forward, we will focus on opportunities within our core footprint. I am proud of the reliable service we continue to deliver to our customers, often in volatile and constrained market conditions such as those created by last year's extreme weather. 
We remained focused on delivering gas safely and reliably, creating first-rate customer-service experiences and providing customers with product and service options that meet their growing needs.
I'll now turn the call over to Gary for an update on financial activities."

I had a few topics to review this morning and would like to start by discussing the financial results for our businesses. Our Utility Operations reported very solid earnings of $0.83 per diluted share on a guidance basis. These results included a tax benefit of $29 million or $0.07 per diluted share from the periodic reconciliation of deferred taxes related to book and tax balance sheet.
After adjusting for this tax benefit, Utility Operations would have reported $0.76 per diluted share, which is at the upper end of our 2014 guidance range of $0.72 to $0.76. Additionally, Enable reported strong fourth quarter and full-year earnings. They delivered solid increases in net income, adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow and increased their fourth quarter 2014 unit distribution by 7% over the partnership's minimum quarterly distribution.
This strong performance of Enable in 2014 resulted in our Midstream Investment's reporting earnings of $0.44 per diluted share for the full year, which is also at the upper end of our 2014 guidance range of $0.42 to $0.45 per diluted share. In addition, we received $305 million in cash distributions from Midstream Investment. Consistent with our dividend policy, these cash distributions net of tax are used to support our dividend.
I would now like to discuss our earnings guidance for 2015. As Carla noted in providing this guidance, we take into account certain, but not all variables that may impact actual performance. Let me start with our Midstream Investments. Enable is well-positioned to be successful in today's low and changing energy commodity market. Enable has investment-grade credit rating, low leverage and substantial liquidity. When combined with a significant fee-based margin business, minimum-volume-commitment contracts, a thoughtful hedging strategy, integrated assets and a seasoned management team, we expect they will continue to execute their business plan by taking the necessary actions to be successful in this more challenging business environment.
Based on the latest outlook and guidance provided by Enable, we estimate the equity earnings from our Midstream Investments to be in the range of $0.29 to $0.35 per diluted share. This guidance range assumes our current LP ownership interest of 55.4% and includes the amortization of our basis difference in Enable. 
Now, let me turn to our earnings guidance for Utility Operations, which includes the earnings at the parent company and our energy services business. I would like to describe 3 items that have favorably impacted our 2014 Utility Operations' result by $0.06 per diluted share. Taking these 3 items into consideration, provides our 2014 Utility Operations' baseline earnings: first, our 2014 equity return related to true-up proceeds is $0.03 per share higher than anticipated in 2015, as a result of the need to true-up the amounts reported from inception to todate; second, we benefited $0.02 per share from favorable weather; and third, we received a $0.01 per share benefit from a favorable ruling related to our 2008 energy efficiency bonus appeal. We have included a reconciliation to the $0.70 baseline earning in our year-end supplemental materials.
Our earnings guidance range for Utility Operations for 2015 is $0.71 to $0.75 per diluted share. Using the midpoint of this earnings guidance range of $0.73, compared to the 2014 baseline of $0.70, we expect Utility Operations to grow 4.2% this year with a 4% to 6% compound annual growth rate expected through 2019.
We have assumed a consolidated effective tax rate of approximately 37%, which includes a 38% booked tax rate for Enable's earning and an average share count of 431 million shares. The resulting consolidated earnings guidance range for 2015 is $1 to $1.10 per diluted share. And we will keep you updated on our earnings expectations on a quarterly basis.
As you have previously heard, our 5-year plan outlines approximately $7.4 billion of capital investment. We expect to finance this capital spending would a thoughtful approach of raising equity and debt on a timeframe, as needed, to ensure that our regulatory capital structure's appropriate and that our debt credit ratings remain strong investment-grade. Due to the cash flow benefit of bonus depreciation being extended in 2014, we do not see any need for equity in 2015. In future years, we expect to raise equity to fund our capital plan through the sale of original issue shares through our savings and Investor's Choice Plan.
Next, I would like to remind you of our dividend policy and the $0.2475 per share quarterly dividend declared by Board of Directors on January 31. This dividend rate represents a 4.2% increase from our 2014 dividend when annualized, and represents a 19% increase in the dividend rate since the formation of Enable in 2013. 
Although this dividend increase is lower than what we had anticipated, when we provided a dividend growth rate forecast last year, it nonetheless represents a significant increase and reflects the latest outlook and guidance from Enable. It also includes the projected cash tax rate for Enable distributions, averaging approximately 25%, increasing from 15% to 32% through 2018.
Due to the limited forward-looking timeframe of Enable's guidance, we do not feel it's appropriate to provide a dividend growth rate forecast at this time. However, our objective remains unchanged, which is to provide our shareholders a growing dividend that reflects the long-term stability, and growth in our regulated utilities combined with after-tax cash distributions we received from Enable. We believe this policy represents a strong commitment to our shareholders.
As mentioned earlier, I will be retiring from the company and Bill Rogers has been named my successor. Bill is an outstanding finance professional and is a servant leader with great integrity. Bill, Scott and the entire executive management team are talented professionals, who are committed to serve our shareholders, employees, customers, creditors and the communities where we live and work and CenterPoint Energy could not be in better hands.
And finally, I want to acknowledge David McClanahan, Scott Rozzell and Tom Standish. We all worked together from the formation of the company, and I want to thank them for affording me the privilege of working beside them these past years to help CenterPoint Energy become a stronger company.
Most importantly, I want to thank all of our employees who work safely [ph] each day to serve our customers and our community. Thank you for your continued interest in CenterPoint Energy and I will now turn the call back over to Carla."

So they average 25% but they move from 15% to 32% over that time, and as you know, it's an important point. As you think about our dividend which, as you know, we increased this year by 4.2%, and we annualized that dividend, 19% since we formed Enable. Certainly, when we were at the Analyst Day we laid out an 8% to 10% growth rate in the dividend. Now we're subsequent to that, as you know, there's been somewhat precipitous fall in commodity prices and challenges there. And Enable then -- that was based, by the way, on Enable's growth rate of 10% to 12%, they've lowered that, they provided 1-year guidance, as you know, and moved that down to more of a per-unit distribution growth rate of 3% to 7%, still solid.

Look, we're still delighted, it's a low-cash tax rate early but it does ramp up, and overtime, we're no different than any other taxpayer, We won't have these remedials and those things that allow you to have a lower tax rate earlier. But we're going to always constantly look for ways to lower our taxes. And hopefully, if there's corporate tax reform by the way, that will be terrific.

And I would think the tax rate would then start to roll back to a better rate, am I thinking about that correctly?"

I think the most important thing to take away is that the company is committed to its dividend policy and that is the pass-through that's after-tax distributions of Enable. So as they -- we want Enable to be bigger, better, stronger, grow their distributions and our shareholders benefit from that, which should ultimately lower our cost to capital and allow us to finance our utility and grow our utility which as Scott and Tracy and Joe described, we have terrific capital opportunities, accretive capital to invest, so it will all be helpful to us."

When we showed you consolidated utility CapEx in June, we showed a 2014 to '18 number of $6.2 billion on the low end and then $7.4 billion was the upside number we had shown. We've now redone our full 5-year capital plan to include '15 through '19 and that '15 through '19 number, which drops '14 adds '19 is now $7.4 billion. So that number, that new 5-year number is now at the top end of the range. So hopefully, that clarifies the capital piece, if Andrew's still listening, that may provide a little more clarity for him as well. You then asked about the growth in rate base. We had said that the rate base growth for the utilities would be, depending on which one you were looking at, somewhere around 7% to 10% or 8% to 10%. And then on the electric one, the new forecast, is it's at the higher end of that range, we describe it now at 8% to 10%. The gas utility rate base is still in that same range, it still falls in that same range. And what we had indicated around our earnings growth is that at the high end of this investment, we would be moving towards the top end or the higher end of our earnings growth range. We did not have a different earnings growth range number. We just said we would be striving towards the higher end. The dynamic that affects this growth rate on our earnings is -- there's a few of them. One is, that I think you told, we mentioned to you all, we have some high starting points for some of our utilities, either fully earning or in some cases, they were slightly above allowed returns and that affects the starting point of these -- of this growth rate. There certainly is a fair amount of regulatory lag, even though we have these mechanisms, since the time period is so short if you're investing all this capital, by the time you get to year 5, you've essentially financed all this capital but you don't have a good amount of that capital yet in rate base earning. Said another way, if you were to taper off capital or if capital were to taper off towards the end the earnings would improve, but you would be paying for that through reductions and earnings down the road because your capital investment had slowed down, so that is a factor. And then, the other factor is that over this period of time, there are some assumptions for some amount of equity issuance so that we maintain the right balance between debt and equity. So all 3 of those factors lead into the fact that the rate base growth is more than what we experienced on our earnings growth."

If they can provide multiyear with confidence around their growth and then, that gives us confidence around providing compound growth rate. But I think an important takeaway, we're going to continue to grow our dividend. Our utilities will grow. We have a payout ratio of 60% to 70%. We've got room to work around that as the utility grows. And the takeaway from our investors -- for our investors should be, we are going to continue to grow the dividend but we'll do it in a thoughtful way, and we do have to be very thoughtful and mindful of Enable and really follow their information and try not to leave it."

Welcome to our fourth quarter 2014 earnings conference call. Thank you for joining us today.
Scott Prochazka, President and CEO; Tracy Bridge, Executive Vice President and President of our Electric Division; Joe McGoldrick, Executive Vice President and President of our Gas Division; and Gary Whitlock, Executive Vice President and CFO, will discuss our fourth quarter 2014 results and provide highlights on other key areas.
We also have with us our new incoming CFO, Bill Rogers, and other members of management present who may assist in answering questions following the prepared remarks.
Please note that we may announce material information using SEC filings, press releases, public conference calls, webcasts and posts to the Investors section of our website. In the future, we will continue to use these channels to communicate important information about the company, key personnel, corporate initiatives, regulatory updates and other matters. Information that we post on our website could be deemed material. Therefore, we encourage investors, the media, our customers, business partners, and others interested in our company to review the information we post on our website.
Today, management is going to discuss certain topics that will contain projections and forward-looking information that are based on management's beliefs as well as assumptions made by and information currently available to management. These forward-looking statements suggest predictions or expectations and thus are subject to risks or uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially based upon factors, including weather variations, legislative and regulatory actions, timing and extent of changes in commodity prices, growth or decline in our service territories and other risk factors noted in our SEC filings.
With the formation of Enable Midstream Partners, the way we present our financial results have changed. As a result, we will refer to our equity investment in Enable as Midstream Investments and to the remainder of our businesses as Utility Operations. 
We will also discuss our guidance for 2015. The Utility Operations guidance range considers performance to date and certain significant variables that may impact earnings such as weather, regulatory, and judicial proceedings, volumes, commodity prices, ancillary services, tax rate, interest rate and financing activity.
In providing this guidance, the company does not include other potential impacts, such as the impact of any changes in accounting standards, any impact to earnings from the change in the value of ZENS securities and the related stock or the timing effects of mark-to-market and inventory accounting in the company's energy services business.
In providing Midstream Investments' guidance, the company takes into account such factors as Enable's most recent public forecast, effective tax rate, the amortization of our basis differential in Enable and other factors. The company does not include other potential impact such as the impacts of any changes in accounting standards for Enable's unusual items. 
For the reconciliation of the earnings guidance provided in today's call, please refer to our earnings press release, which along with our Form 10-K, updated debt maturity and equity return amortization schedule and year-end supplemental materials have been posted on our website, centerpointenergy.com underneath the Investor section.

279513,281254683,771832,"CenterPoint Energy, Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 26, 2015",2015-02-26,"Earnings Calls","CenterPoint Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Carla. And good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us today, and thank you for your interest in CenterPoint Energy. This morning, we reported full-year earnings of $611 million or $1.42 per diluted share as compared to $311 mi",945,"Thank you, Carla. And good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us today, and thank you for your interest in CenterPoint Energy. This morning, we reported full-year earnings of $611 million or $1.42 per diluted share as compared to $311 million or $0.72 per diluted share in 2013. Using the same basis that we use when providing guidance, full-year adjusted earnings would have been $1.27 per diluted share in 2014 compared to $1.20 for 2013.
Included in 2014 earnings is a $29 million tax benefit, which equates to $0.07 per share, which Gary will discuss later. Utility Operations contributed $0.83 per diluted share and Midstream Investments contributed $0.44 for 2014.
I'm pleased with our overall 2014 performance. With a new leadership team, refreshed corporate vision and strategy and successful IPO of Enable Midstream Partners, we took important steps in 2014 to set up a new foundation for the company while delivering strong business results.
In June of last year, we laid out our investment and growth plans for our utilities, and I'm happy to confirm, we remain on target to achieve those goals. Further, our management transition plan has gone very smoothly. With the addition of Bill Rogers, as the incoming CFO, the new senior management team is now in place. The new team has the right mix of industry experience, functional knowledge and personal dedication necessary to continue moving our company forward.
Our financial performance is driven by customer growth, capital additions, timely recovery of investments and ongoing cost management. 2014 was a record year for capital investments at our utilities, and our new 5-year plan includes approximately $7.4 billion of capital spend for Utility Operations, which is in line with our upside case presented in June of 2014.
In 2014, we continued to benefit from a number of positive trends. Economic and customer growth was strong within our footprint, especially in Texas and Minnesota. Growth in the Houston area will continue to benefit from 3 key themes: 
First, construction remain strong across our residential, commercial and industrial sectors and the inventories are maintaining at reasonable levels. According to Mark Dotzour, the Chief Economist and Director of Research at Texas A&M Real Estate Center, 8 million square feet of new industrial space will be completed in 2015, much of which will be used to support continued growth in the petrochemical sector. Additionally, vacancy rates in some parts of the city are at all-time lows. 
Second, Houston has demonstrated the ability to grow in both high and low-energy commodity cycles. The Houston area population has grown steadily since 1990, despite oil prices cycling between $20 and $150 per barrel. 
And third, the local economy is much more diverse than in years past. According to the City of Houston, in 1981, the economic base was dominated by energy-related businesses with nearly 85% of all jobs in those sectors. Today, nearly 1/2 of all jobs are in non-energy sectors, such as business services, technology, aerospace, medicine and manufacturing. While Houston's projected job growth is below last year's near-record pace, the forecasted increase of 60,000 jobs or 2% remains in line with long-term trends.
Much attention lately has been on energy commodity prices and their impact on Enable. Last week, Enable provided a reduced 2015 guidance range, which reflects the near-term effects of those lower prices and a recent decline in rig count in the areas in which Enable operates.
From a longer-term perspective, we remained positive on the fundamentals that underlie Enable's growth story. Enable sets itself apart from other MLPs with their investment-grade balance sheet, strong organic growth opportunities and a constructive balance of acreage dedications, fixed-fee contracts and minimum-volume-commitment contracts that support much of their income.
Enable's customer base and relationships as well as their geographic base and diversity will continue to provide opportunities, even with energy price volatility. Enable provides a significant contribution to our dividend, while allowing us to focus our capital investment on our utility businesses.
As you all know, today will be Gary Whitlock's last earnings call as CFO of CenterPoint Energy. Gary has been with the company since its inception in 2002 and was a key part of the management team that dealt with several challenges and opportunities. I worked closely with Gary over his entire time and his experience, knowledge, and counsel will be missed. His replacement, Bill Rogers, comes to us with many years of utility and banking experience and while it will be tough to fill Gary's shoes, Bill will certainly bring his own brand of experience and leadership capabilities to our senior management team and the

Looking forward, we will drive our strategy to operate, serve and grow. From an operations perspective, we will continue to emphasize safety, reliability and efficiency. We will enhance service to our customers and our communities. Our capital investments will support growth and our service territories ensure essential system upgrades and improve customer service, which will position the company for success and as a leader in our industry.
Let me wrap up by commending our employees, who met challenges of 2014 head on. They implemented innovative solutions for our customers, executed on a large capital program to meet the current and future infrastructure needs and gave back to their communities in their spare time.
This year, we were named as a Civic 50 award recipient for our contributions to our communities. This award recognizes the nation's most civic minded companies and I'm honored that we were selected as the 2014 Utilities Sector recipient. Our employees are the heart of our success and their collective performance is much appreciated.
I will now ask Tracy to discuss electric operations"
279513,281254683,771832,"CenterPoint Energy, Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 26, 2015",2015-02-26,"Earnings Calls","CenterPoint Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Scott. Houston Electric's 2014 financial performance was solid and in line with our expectations. Core operating income was $477 million compared to $474 million in 2013. Growth of nearly 55,000 in metered customers in 2014 contributed $33 mill",706,"Thank you, Scott. Houston Electric's 2014 financial performance was solid and in line with our expectations. Core operating income was $477 million compared to $474 million in 2013. Growth of nearly 55,000 in metered customers in 2014 contributed $33 million of incremental revenue. We benefited $15 million from a higher energy efficiency performance bonus in 2014, $8 million of which is related to the resolution of our bonus appeal. We also benefited $23 million from higher equity returns, primarily related to true-up proceeds. 
These increases were partially offset by milder weather, lower rights-of-way revenue, higher operating and maintenance expense and depreciation.
As you have heard, Houston continues to be a vibrant place to work and live, which is reflected in our throughput and customer growth for 2014. Home throughput increased over 2% and customer growth increased over 2.4% in 2014. Of the top 10 most populous metro areas in the nation, the greater Houston area's population growth rate consistently ranked in the top 2. In response ongoing customer and load growth, Houston Electric has been investing significant capital to ensure that our customers' electricity needs are reliably and safely met.
In 2014, Houston Electric invested $818 million of capital, which represents an approximate 8% increase over 2013's capital expenditure level. This year, we expect Houston Electric to continue delivering solid results. Given the current commodity price environment, we anticipate customer growth will decline but remain healthy at 2% in 2015. We plan to invest over $900 million of capital this year and approximately $4.4 billion over the next 5 years. 
This investment will be used to improve service reliability and system resiliency, enhance our customer service systems and support load growth and ongoing system maintenance. This level of capital investment results in rate base growth consistent with the growth rate we have previously provided, despite the rate base reduction associated with bonus depreciation in 2014.
I'd like to discuss 2 projects in our capital investment plan that help demonstrate the growth in our service territory. Many of you are familiar with the Houston Import Project. We are responsible for the southern half of this project known as the Brazos Valley Connection. 
This project is critical for electric reliability in the Houston region as a result of forecasted load growth and insufficient local generation. Houston Electric will file for approval in its portion of the project with the Public Utility Commission of Texas in April. We anticipate the capital cost of the Brazos Valley Connection will be approximately $300 million. 
Another project that demonstrates the load growth in our service territory is our Jones Creek Project. This $86 million transmission investment will enable the delivery of 656 megawatts of power to serve Freeport LNG's new $10 billion-plus natural gas liquefaction export facility. The LNG plant will help drive economic growth in our service area. Our Jones Creek Project is expected to be in service beginning in December of 2017, and Freeport LNG will be one of our largest industrial customers once the project is fully operational in 2018.
In addition to growth products, we continue to see strong interest in the use of our rights-of-way, indicating continued pipeline expansion activity associated with growth in our service area. In 2015, we are forecasting rights-of-way revenue in the range of $10 million to $20 million. 
Regarding regulatory matters, we do not anticipate the need for a general rate case filing at Houston Electric in the near-term. We do, however, plan to make a Distribution Cost Recovery Factor filing in April, which will allow us to earn a return on distribution capital invested since our last rate case.
Rate increases from the filing would go into effect later this year, however, most of the benefit would be realized in 2016. This recovery mechanism, along with our transmission cost-of-service mechanism will be very effective in reducing recovery lag and mitigating the need for time-consuming, costly general rate cases.
I am pleased with the results of this year and with our prospects for the future. Houston Electric continues to execute on its plan to provide safe, reliable, and efficient electric service for its growing service territory.
I'll now turn the call over to Joe McGoldrick, who will update you on gas operations."
279513,281254683,771832,"CenterPoint Energy, Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 26, 2015",2015-02-26,"Earnings Calls","CenterPoint Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Tracy. 2014 was another great year for gas operations.

We continued to invest in system upgrades and growth while pursuing new technology to improve system safety, reliability and enhance customer service. The natural gas utility business has been successful, in part, by proactively working with the regulatory commissions to implement innovative rate mechanisms that reduce lag in recovering these investments.
In addition, our energy services business was able to take advantage of basis volatility, which created asset optimization opportunities and increased throughput and margin due to extreme cold weather. 
Gas Operations reported $339 million in operating income for 2014 comprised of a record-setting $287 million in our natural gas utilities and $52 million from our energy services business. By comparison, Gas Operations reported $276 million in 2013, comprised of $263 million in our natural gas utilities and $13 million in our energy services business.
Natural gas utilities had an outstanding year. We added nearly 36,000 new customers, a 1% increase, with the strongest growth in Minnesota and Texas, and throughput on our system increased by 4%. This business also benefited from the extreme cold weather in the first quarter of 2014, as we reached the cap on our weather-hedge by February and consequently, enjoyed the benefit of added margins the rest of the winter and early spring.
Rate increases accounted for $37 million of improved revenue, helping offset increases in O&M and D&A during the year. Natural gas utilities invested $525 million in 2014, which represents an approximate 22% increase over 2013. We anticipate that this elevated capital investment will continue to drive rate base and earnings growth. 
Our new 5-year plan includes $2.7 billion of capital, which is slightly above the high end of the capital investment plan we shared with you last June. Our $170 million conversion of automated metering technology is substantially complete in 4 of the 6 states we serve. We plan to upgrade the remaining 420,000 meters this year to complete the project. Upon completion, we will have upgraded 3.4 million meters. 
We also continued to invest capital in pipe replacement. 2 good examples of this are: the multiyear, $400 million Minnesota Beltline Project; and our accelerated cast-iron- and bare-steel-main-replacement program. These investments have improved our system reliability, safety and our customer experience and we are proud of what we have accomplished.
Our increased capital spending is impacting D&A, which was up $16 million or approximately 9% versus 2013. While 2014 O&M expenses were up 4% over the prior year, the annual growth rate between 2011 and 2014 was 1%, after adjusting for pass-through expenses.
Going forward, we'll manage O&M expenses to approximately a 3% compound annual growth rate. On the regulatory front, we anticipate filing general rate cases in 2015 in our Texas Coast, Minnesota and Arkansas rate jurisdictions. We will also file annual rate mechanisms in other service territories, including our GRIP asset recovery mechanism in our Houston, South Texas and East Texas divisions.
Implementation of new rates will be staggered over 2015 and 2016. In Minnesota, interim rates will go in effect approximately, 60 days after filing the rate case later this summer, and will be trued-up once final rates are determined in 2016. The majority of increases related to all of these filings will be reflected in 2016 results. 
The energy services business, after adjusting for mark-to-market accounting, would have reported operating income of $23 million in 2014 compared to $15 million in 2013. This business benefited from 2 key factors in 2014: first, basis volatility created asset optimization revenues, not experienced in many years; and second, the extreme cold weather increased throughput and margin from our weather-sensitive customers.
When combined with solid expense management, including some workforce reductions, energy services had a very good year. Going forward, we will focus on opportunities within our core footprint. I am proud of the reliable service we continue to deliver to our customers, often in volatile and constrained market conditions such as those created by last year's extreme weather. 
We remained focused on delivering gas safely and reliably, creating first-rate customer-service experiences and providing customers with product and service options that meet their growing needs.
I'll now turn the call over to Gary for an update on financial activities."

And good morning to everyone. I had a few topics to review this morning and would like to start by discussing the financial results for our businesses.

I had a few topics to review this morning and would like to start by discussing the financial results for our businesses. Our Utility Operations reported very solid earnings of $0.83 per diluted share on a guidance basis. These results included a tax benefit of $29 million or $0.07 per diluted share from the periodic reconciliation of deferred taxes related to book and tax balance sheet.
After adjusting for this tax benefit, Utility Operations would have reported $0.76 per diluted share, which is at the upper end of our 2014 guidance range of $0.72 to $0.76. Additionally, Enable reported strong fourth quarter and full-year earnings. They delivered solid increases in net income, adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow and increased their fourth quarter 2014 unit distribution by 7% over the partnership's minimum quarterly distribution.
This strong performance of Enable in 2014 resulted in our Midstream Investment's reporting earnings of $0.44 per diluted share for the full year, which is also at the upper end of our 2014 guidance range of $0.42 to $0.45 per diluted share. In addition, we received $305 million in cash distributions from Midstream Investment. Consistent with our dividend policy, these cash distributions net of tax are used to support our dividend.
I would now like to discuss our earnings guidance for 2015. As Carla noted in providing this guidance, we take into account certain, but not all variables that may impact actual performance. Let me start with our Midstream Investments. Enable is well-positioned to be successful in today's lower and changing energy commodity market. Enable has investment-grade credit rating, low leverage and substantial liquidity. When combined with a significant fee-based margin business, minimum-volume-commitment contracts, a thoughtful hedging strategy, integrated assets and a seasoned management team, we expect they will continue to execute their business plan by taking the necessary actions to be successful in this more challenging business environment.
Based on the latest outlook and guidance provided by Enable, we estimate the equity earnings from our Midstream Investments to be in the range of $0.29 to $0.35 per diluted share. This guidance range assumes our current LP ownership interest of 55.4% and includes the amortization of our basis difference in Enable. 
Now, let me turn to our earnings guidance for Utility Operations, which includes the earnings at the parent company and our energy services business. I would like to describe 3 items that have favorably impacted our 2014 Utility Operations' results by $0.06 per diluted share. Taking these 3 items into consideration, provides our 2014 Utility Operations' baseline earnings: first, our 2014 equity return related to true-up proceeds is $0.03 per share higher than anticipated in 2015, as a result of the need to true-up the amounts reported from inception to date; second, we benefited $0.02 per share from favorable weather; and third, we received a $0.01 per share benefit from a favorable ruling related to our 2008 energy efficiency bonus appeal. We have included a reconciliation to the $0.70 baseline earning in our year-end supplemental materials.
Our earnings guidance range for Utility Operations for 2015 is $0.71 to $0.75 per diluted share. Using the midpoint of this earnings guidance range of $0.73, compared to the 2014 baseline of $0.70, we expect Utility Operations to grow 4.2% this year with a 4% to 6% compound annual growth rate expected through 2019.
We have assumed a consolidated effective tax rate of approximately 37%, which includes a 38% booked tax rate for Enable's earning and an average share count of 431 million shares. The resulting consolidated earnings guidance range for 2015 is $1 to $1.10 per diluted share. And we will keep you updated on our earnings expectations on a quarterly basis.
As you have previously heard, our 5-year plan outlines approximately $7.4 billion of capital investment. We expect to finance this capital spending with a thoughtful approach of raising equity and debt on a timeframe, as needed, to ensure that our regulatory capital structure's appropriate and that our debt credit ratings remain strong investment-grade. Due to the cash flow benefit of bonus depreciation being extended in 2014, we do not see any need for equity in 2015. In future years, we expect to raise equity to fund our capital plan through the sale of original issue shares through our savings and Investor's Choice Plan.
Next, I would like to remind you of our dividend policy and the $0.2475 per share quarterly dividend declared by Board of Directors on January 22. This dividend rate represents a 4.2% increase from our 2014 dividend when annualized, and represents a 19% increase in the dividend rate since the formation of Enable in 2013. 
Although this dividend increase is lower than what we had anticipated, when we provided a dividend growth rate forecast last year, it nonetheless represents a significant increase and reflects the latest outlook and guidance from Enable. It also includes the projected cash tax rate for Enable distributions, averaging approximately 25%, increasing from 15% to 32% through 2018.
Due to the limited forward-looking timeframe of Enable's guidance, we do not feel it's appropriate to provide a dividend growth rate forecast at this time. However, our objective remains unchanged, which is to provide our shareholders a growing dividend that reflects the long-term stability, and growth in our regulated utilities combined with after-tax cash distributions we received from Enable. We believe this policy represents a strong commitment to our shareholders.
As mentioned earlier, I will be retiring from the company and Bill Rogers has been named my successor. Bill is an outstanding finance professional and is a servant leader with great integrity. Bill, Scott and the entire executive management team are talented professionals, who are committed to serve our shareholders, employees, customers, creditors and the communities where we live and work and CenterPoint Energy could not be in better hands.
And finally, I want to acknowledge David McClanahan, Scott Rozzell and Tom Standish. We all worked together from the formation of the company, and I want to thank them for affording me the privilege of working beside them these past years to help CenterPoint Energy become a stronger company.
Most importantly, I want to thank all of our employees who work safely each day to serve our customers and our community. Thank you for your continued interest in CenterPoint Energy and I will now turn the call back over to Carla."

Certainly, when we were at the Analyst Day we laid out an 8% to 10% growth rate in the dividend. Now we're subsequent to that, as you know, there's been somewhat precipitous fall in commodity prices and challenges there. And Enable then -- that was based, by the way, on Enable's growth rate of 10% to 12%, they've lowered that, they provided 1-year guidance, as you know, and moved that down to more of a per-unit distribution growth rate of 3% to 7%, still solid. But as we -- we will continue to get increasing cash distributions from Enable but the tax rate goes up as well. So again, their rate of growth is not as much and then the tax -- our tax rate that we had originally anticipated to be more lower teens during this timeframe, but it looks like it's going to average 25%."

So as they -- we want Enable to be bigger, better, stronger, grow their distributions and our shareholders benefit from that, which should ultimately lower our cost to capital and allow us to finance our utility and grow our utility which as Scott and Tracy and Joe described, we have terrific capital opportunities, accretive capital to invest, so it will all be helpful to us."

When we showed you consolidated utility CapEx in June, we showed a 2014 to '18 number of $6.2 billion on the low end and then $7.4 billion was the upside number we had shown. We've now redone our full 5-year capital plan to include '15 through '19 and that '15 through '19 number, which drops '14 adds '19 is now $7.4 billion. So that number, that new 5-year number is now at the top end of the range. So hopefully, that clarifies the capital piece, if Andrew's still listening, that may provide a little more clarity for him as well. You then asked about the growth in rate base. We had said that the rate base growth for the utilities would be, depending on which one you were looking at, somewhere around 7% to 10% or 8% to 10%. And then on the electric one, the new forecast, is it's at the higher end of that range, we describe it now at 8% to 10%. The gas utility rate base is still in that same range, it still falls in that same range. And what we had indicated around our earnings growth is that at the high end of this investment, we would be moving towards the top end or the higher end of our earnings growth range. We did not have a different earnings growth range number. We just said we would be striving towards the higher end. The dynamic that affects this growth rate on our earnings is -- there's a few of them. One is, that I think you told, we mentioned to you all, we have some high starting points for some of our utilities, either fully earning or in some cases, they were slightly above allowed returns and that affects the starting point of these -- of this growth rate. There certainly is a fair amount of regulatory lag, even though we have these mechanisms, since the time period is so short if you're investing all this capital, by the time you get to year 5, you've essentially financed all this capital but you don't have a good amount of that capital yet in rate base earning. Said another way, if you were to taper off capital or if capital were to taper off towards the end the earnings would improve, but you would be paying for that through reductions and earnings down the road because your capital investment had slowed down, so that is a factor. And then, the other factor is that over this period of time, there are some assumptions for some amount of equity issuance so that we maintain the right balance between debt and equity. So all 3 of those factors lead into the fact that the rate base growth is more than what we experienced on our earnings growth."

We also have with us our new incoming CFO, Bill Rogers, and other members of management present who may assist in answering questions following the prepared remarks.
Please note that we may announce material information using SEC filings, press releases, public conference calls, webcasts and posts to the Investors section of our website. In the future, we will continue to use these channels to communicate important information about the company, key personnel, corporate initiatives, regulatory updates and other matters. Information that we post on our website could be deemed material. Therefore, we encourage investors, the media, our customers, business partners, and others interested in our company to review the information we post on our website.
Today, management is going to discuss certain topics that will contain projections and forward-looking information that are based on management's beliefs as well as assumptions made by and information currently available to management. These forward-looking statements suggest predictions or expectations and thus are subject to risks or uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially based upon factors, including weather variations, legislative and regulatory actions, timing and extent of changes in commodity prices, growth or decline in our service territories and other risk factors noted in our SEC filings.
With the formation of Enable Midstream Partners, the way we present our financial results have changed. As a result, we will refer to our equity investment in Enable as Midstream Investments and to the remainder of our businesses as Utility Operations. 
We will also discuss our guidance for 2015. The Utility Operations guidance range considers performance to date and certain significant variables that may impact earnings such as weather, regulatory, and judicial proceedings, volumes, commodity prices, ancillary services, tax rate, interest rate and financing activity. In providing this guidance, the company does not include other potential impacts, such as the impact of any changes in accounting standards, any impact to earnings from the change in the value of ZENS securities and the related stock or the timing effects of mark-to-market and inventory accounting in the company's energy services business.
In providing Midstream Investments' guidance, the company takes into account such factors as Enable's most recent public forecast, effective tax rate, the amortization of our basis differential in Enable and other factors. The company does not include other potential impact such as the impacts of any changes in accounting standards for Enable's unusual items. 
For the reconciliation of the earnings guidance provided in today's call, please refer to our earnings press release, which along with our Form 10-K, updated debt maturity and equity return amortization schedule and year-end supplemental materials have been posted on our website, centerpointenergy.com underneath the Investor section.

This morning, we reported full-year earnings of $611 million or $1.42 per diluted share as compared to $311 million or $0.72 per diluted share in 2013. Using the same basis that we use when providing guidance, full-year adjusted earnings would have been $1.27 per diluted share in 2014 compared to $1.20 for 2013.
Included in 2014 earnings is a $29 million tax benefit, which equates to $0.07 per share, which Gary will discuss later. Utility Operations contributed $0.83 per diluted share and Midstream Investments contributed $0.44 for 2014.
I'm pleased with our overall 2014 performance. With a new leadership team, refreshed corporate vision and strategy and successful IPO of Enable Midstream Partners, we took important steps in 2014 to set up a new foundation for the company while delivering strong business results.
In June of last year, we laid out our investment and growth plans for our utilities, and I'm happy to confirm, we remain on target to achieve those goals. Further, our management transition plan has gone very smoothly. With the addition of Bill Rogers, as the incoming CFO, the new senior management team is now in place. The new team has the right mix of industry experience, functional knowledge and personal dedication necessary to continue moving our company forward.
Our financial performance is driven by customer growth, capital additions, timely recovery of investments and ongoing cost management. 2014 was a record year for capital investments at our utilities, and our new 5-year plan includes approximately $7.4 billion of capital spend for Utility Operations, which is in line with our upside case presented in June of 2014.
In 2014, we continued to benefit from a number of positive trends. Economic and customer growth was strong within our footprint, especially in Texas and Minnesota. Growth in the Houston area will continue to benefit from 3 key themes: 
First, construction remain strong across our residential, commercial and industrial sectors and the inventories are maintaining at reasonable levels. According to Mark Dotzour, the Chief Economist and Director of Research at Texas A&M Real Estate Center, 8 million square feet of new industrial space will be completed in 2015, much of which will be used to support continued growth in the petrochemical sector. Additionally, vacancy rates in some parts of the city are at all-time lows. 
Second, Houston has demonstrated the ability to grow in both high and low-energy commodity cycles. The Houston area population has grown steadily since 1990, despite oil prices cycling between $20 and $150 per barrel. 
And third, the local economy is much more diverse than in years past. According to the City of Houston, in 1981, the economic base was dominated by energy-related businesses with nearly 85% of all jobs in those sectors. Today, nearly 1/2 of all jobs are in non-energy sectors, such as business services, technology, aerospace, medicine and manufacturing. While Houston's projected job growth is below last year's near-record pace, the forecasted increase of 60,000 jobs or 2% remains in line with long-term trends.
Much attention lately has been on energy commodity prices and their impact on Enable. Last week, Enable provided a reduced 2015 guidance range, which reflects the near-term effects of those lower prices and a recent decline in rig count in the areas in which Enable operates.
From a longer-term perspective, we remained positive on the fundamentals that underlie Enable's growth story. Enable sets itself apart from other MLPs with their investment-grade balance sheet, strong organic growth opportunities and a constructive balance of acreage dedications, fixed-fee contracts and minimum-volume-commitment contracts that support much of their income.
Enable's customer base and relationships as well as their geographic base and diversity will continue to provide opportunities, even with energy price volatility. Enable provides a significant contribution to our dividend, while allowing us to focus our capital investment on our utility businesses.
As you all know, today will be Gary Whitlock's last earnings call as CFO of CenterPoint Energy. Gary has been with the company since its inception in 2002 and was a key part of the management team that dealt with several challenges and opportunities. I worked closely with Gary over his entire time and his experience, knowledge, and counsel will be missed. His replacement, Bill Rogers, comes to us with many years of utility and banking experience and while it will be tough to fill Gary's shoes, Bill will certainly bring his own brand of experience and leadership capabilities to our senior management team and the

Looking forward, we will drive our strategy to operate, serve and grow. From an operations perspective, we will continue to emphasize safety, reliability and efficiency. We will enhance service to our customers and our communities. Our capital investments will support growth and our service territories ensure essential system upgrades and improve customer service, which will position the company for success and as a leader in our industry.
Let me wrap up by commending our employees, who met challenges of 2014 head on. They implemented innovative solutions for our customers, executed on a large capital program to meet the current and future infrastructure needs and gave back to their communities in their spare time.
This year, we were named as a Civic 50 award recipient for our contributions to our communities. This award recognizes the nation's most civic minded companies and I'm honored that we were selected as the 2014 Utilities Sector recipient. Our employees are the heart of our success and their collective performance is much appreciated.
I will now ask Tracy to discuss electric operations"
279513,281254683,773334,"CenterPoint Energy, Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 26, 2015",2015-02-26,"Earnings Calls","CenterPoint Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Scott. Houston Electric's 2014 financial performance was solid and in line with our expectations. Core operating income was $477 million compared to $474 million in 2013. Growth of nearly 55,000 in metered customers in 2014 contributed $33 mill",706,"Thank you, Scott. Houston Electric's 2014 financial performance was solid and in line with our expectations. Core operating income was $477 million compared to $474 million in 2013. Growth of nearly 55,000 in metered customers in 2014 contributed $33 million of incremental revenue. We benefited $15 million from a higher energy efficiency performance bonus in 2014, $8 million of which is related to the resolution of our bonus appeal. We also benefited $23 million from higher equity returns, primarily related to true-up proceeds. 
These increases were partially offset by milder weather, lower rights-of-way revenue, higher operating and maintenance expense and depreciation.
As you have heard, Houston continues to be a vibrant place to work and live, which is reflected in our throughput and customer growth for 2014. Home throughput increased over 2% and customer growth increased over 2.4% in 2014. Of the top 10 most populous metro areas in the nation, the greater Houston area's population growth rate consistently ranked in the top 2. In response ongoing customer and load growth, Houston Electric has been investing significant capital to ensure that our customers' electricity needs are reliably and safely met.
In 2014, Houston Electric invested $818 million of capital, which represents an approximate 8% increase over 2013's capital expenditure level. This year, we expect Houston Electric to continue delivering solid results. Given the current commodity price environment, we anticipate customer growth will decline but remain healthy at 2% in 2015. We plan to invest over $900 million of capital this year and approximately $4.4 billion over the next 5 years. 
This investment will be used to improve service reliability and system resiliency, enhance our customer service systems and support load growth and ongoing system maintenance. This level of capital investment results in rate base growth consistent with the growth rate we have previously provided, despite the rate base reduction associated with bonus depreciation in 2014.
I'd like to discuss 2 projects in our capital investment plan that help demonstrate the growth in our service territory. Many of you are familiar with the Houston Import Project. We are responsible for the southern half of this project known as the Brazos Valley Connection. 
This project is critical for electric reliability in the Houston region as a result of forecasted load growth and insufficient local generation. Houston Electric will file for approval in its portion of the project with the Public Utility Commission of Texas in April. We anticipate the capital cost of the Brazos Valley Connection will be approximately $300 million. 
Another project that demonstrates the load growth in our service territory is our Jones Creek Project. This $86 million transmission investment will enable the delivery of 656 megawatts of power to serve Freeport LNG's new $10 billion-plus natural gas liquefaction export facility. The LNG plant will help drive economic growth in our service area. Our Jones Creek Project is expected to be in service beginning in December of 2017, and Freeport LNG will be one of our largest industrial customers once the project is fully operational in 2018.
In addition to growth products, we continue to see strong interest in the use of our rights-of-way, indicating continued pipeline expansion activity associated with growth in our service area. In 2015, we are forecasting rights-of-way revenue in the range of $10 million to $20 million. 
Regarding regulatory matters, we do not anticipate the need for a general rate case filing at Houston Electric in the near-term. We do, however, plan to make a Distribution Cost Recovery Factor filing in April, which will allow us to earn a return on distribution capital invested since our last rate case.
Rate increases from the filing would go into effect later this year, however, most of the benefit would be realized in 2016. This recovery mechanism, along with our transmission cost-of-service mechanism will be very effective in reducing recovery lag and mitigating the need for time-consuming, costly general rate cases.
I am pleased with the results of this year and with our prospects for the future. Houston Electric continues to execute on its plan to provide safe, reliable, and efficient electric service for its growing service territory.
I'll now turn the call over to Joe McGoldrick, who will update you on gas operations."

We continued to invest in system upgrades and growth while pursuing new technology to improve system safety, reliability and enhance customer service. The natural gas utility business has been successful, in part, by proactively working with the regulatory commissions to implement innovative rate mechanisms that reduce lag in recovering these investments.
In addition, our energy services business was able to take advantage of basis volatility, which created asset optimization opportunities and increased throughput and margin due to extreme cold weather. 
Gas Operations reported $339 million in operating income for 2014 comprised of a record-setting $287 million in our natural gas utilities and $52 million from our energy services business. By comparison, Gas Operations reported $276 million in 2013, comprised of $263 million in our natural gas utilities and $13 million in our energy services business.
Natural gas utilities had an outstanding year. We added nearly 36,000 new customers, a 1% increase, with the strongest growth in Minnesota and Texas, and throughput on our system increased by 4%. This business also benefited from the extreme cold weather in the first quarter of 2014, as we reached the cap on our weather-hedge by February and consequently, enjoyed the benefit of added margins the rest of the winter and early spring.
Rate increases accounted for $37 million of improved revenue, helping offset increases in O&M and D&A during the year. Natural gas utilities invested $525 million in 2014, which represents an approximate 22% increase over 2013. We anticipate that this elevated capital investment will continue to drive rate base and earnings growth. 
Our new 5-year plan includes $2.7 billion of capital, which is slightly above the high end of the capital investment plan we shared with you last June. Our $170 million conversion of automated metering technology is substantially complete in 4 of the 6 states we serve. We plan to upgrade the remaining 420,000 meters this year to complete the project. Upon completion, we will have upgraded 3.4 million meters. 
We also continued to invest capital in pipe replacement. 2 good examples of this are: the multiyear, $400 million Minnesota Beltline Project; and our accelerated cast-iron- and bare-steel-main-replacement program. These investments have improved our system reliability, safety and our customer experience and we are proud of what we have accomplished.
Our increased capital spending is impacting D&A, which was up $16 million or approximately 9% versus 2013. While 2014 O&M expenses were up 4% over the prior year, the annual growth rate between 2011 and 2014 was 1%, after adjusting for pass-through expenses.
Going forward, we'll manage O&M expenses to approximately a 3% compound annual growth rate. On the regulatory front, we anticipate filing general rate cases in 2015 in our Texas Coast, Minnesota and Arkansas rate jurisdictions. We will also file annual rate mechanisms in other service territories, including our GRIP asset recovery mechanism in our Houston, South Texas and East Texas divisions.
Implementation of new rates will be staggered over 2015 and 2016. In Minnesota, interim rates will go in effect approximately, 60 days after filing the rate case later this summer, and will be trued-up once final rates are determined in 2016. The majority of increases related to all of these filings will be reflected in 2016 results. 
The energy services business, after adjusting for mark-to-market accounting, would have reported operating income of $23 million in 2014 compared to $15 million in 2013. This business benefited from 2 key factors in 2014: first, basis volatility created asset optimization revenues, not experienced in many years; and second, the extreme cold weather increased throughput and margin from our weather-sensitive customers.
When combined with solid expense management, including some workforce reductions, energy services had a very good year. Going forward, we will focus on opportunities within our core footprint. I am proud of the reliable service we continue to deliver to our customers, often in volatile and constrained market conditions such as those created by last year's extreme weather. 
We remained focused on delivering gas safely and reliably, creating first-rate customer-service experiences and providing customers with product and service options that meet their growing needs.
I'll now turn the call over to Gary for an update on financial activities."

I had a few topics to review this morning and would like to start by discussing the financial results for our businesses. Our Utility Operations reported very solid earnings of $0.83 per diluted share on a guidance basis. These results included a tax benefit of $29 million or $0.07 per diluted share from the periodic reconciliation of deferred taxes related to book and tax balance sheet.
After adjusting for this tax benefit, Utility Operations would have reported $0.76 per diluted share, which is at the upper end of our 2014 guidance range of $0.72 to $0.76. Additionally, Enable reported strong fourth quarter and full-year earnings. They delivered solid increases in net income, adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow and increased their fourth quarter 2014 unit distribution by 7% over the partnership's minimum quarterly distribution.
This strong performance of Enable in 2014 resulted in our Midstream Investment's reporting earnings of $0.44 per diluted share for the full year, which is also at the upper end of our 2014 guidance range of $0.42 to $0.45 per diluted share. In addition, we received $305 million in cash distributions from Midstream Investment. Consistent with our dividend policy, these cash distributions net of tax are used to support our dividend.
I would now like to discuss our earnings guidance for 2015. As Carla noted in providing this guidance, we take into account certain, but not all variables that may impact actual performance. Let me start with our Midstream Investments. Enable is well-positioned to be successful in today's lower and changing energy commodity market. Enable has investment-grade credit rating, low leverage and substantial liquidity. When combined with a significant fee-based margin business, minimum-volume-commitment contracts, a thoughtful hedging strategy, integrated assets and a seasoned management team, we expect they will continue to execute their business plan by taking the necessary actions to be successful in this more challenging business environment.
Based on the latest outlook and guidance provided by Enable, we estimate the equity earnings from our Midstream Investments to be in the range of $0.29 to $0.35 per diluted share. This guidance range assumes our current LP ownership interest of 55.4% and includes the amortization of our basis difference in Enable. 
Now, let me turn to our earnings guidance for Utility Operations, which includes the earnings at the parent company and our energy services business. I would like to describe 3 items that have favorably impacted our 2014 Utility Operations' results by $0.06 per diluted share. Taking these 3 items into consideration, provides our 2014 Utility Operations' baseline earnings: first, our 2014 equity return related to true-up proceeds is $0.03 per share higher than anticipated in 2015, as a result of the need to true-up the amounts reported from inception to date; second, we benefited $0.02 per share from favorable weather; and third, we received a $0.01 per share benefit from a favorable ruling related to our 2008 energy efficiency bonus appeal. We have included a reconciliation to the $0.70 baseline earning in our year-end supplemental materials.
Our earnings guidance range for Utility Operations for 2015 is $0.71 to $0.75 per diluted share. Using the midpoint of this earnings guidance range of $0.73, compared to the 2014 baseline of $0.70, we expect Utility Operations to grow 4.2% this year with a 4% to 6% compound annual growth rate expected through 2019.
We have assumed a consolidated effective tax rate of approximately 37%, which includes a 38% booked tax rate for Enable's earning and an average share count of 431 million shares. The resulting consolidated earnings guidance range for 2015 is $1 to $1.10 per diluted share. And we will keep you updated on our earnings expectations on a quarterly basis.
As you have previously heard, our 5-year plan outlines approximately $7.4 billion of capital investment. We expect to finance this capital spending with a thoughtful approach of raising equity and debt on a timeframe, as needed, to ensure that our regulatory capital structure's appropriate and that our debt credit ratings remain strong investment-grade. Due to the cash flow benefit of bonus depreciation being extended in 2014, we do not see any need for equity in 2015. In future years, we expect to raise equity to fund our capital plan through the sale of original issue shares through our savings and Investor's Choice Plan.
Next, I would like to remind you of our dividend policy and the $0.2475 per share quarterly dividend declared by Board of Directors on January 22. This dividend rate represents a 4.2% increase from our 2014 dividend when annualized, and represents a 19% increase in the dividend rate since the formation of Enable in 2013. 
Although this dividend increase is lower than what we had anticipated, when we provided a dividend growth rate forecast last year, it nonetheless represents a significant increase and reflects the latest outlook and guidance from Enable. It also includes the projected cash tax rate for Enable distributions, averaging approximately 25%, increasing from 15% to 32% through 2018.
Due to the limited forward-looking timeframe of Enable's guidance, we do not feel it's appropriate to provide a dividend growth rate forecast at this time. However, our objective remains unchanged, which is to provide our shareholders a growing dividend that reflects the long-term stability, and growth in our regulated utilities combined with after-tax cash distributions we received from Enable. We believe this policy represents a strong commitment to our shareholders.
As mentioned earlier, I will be retiring from the company and Bill Rogers has been named my successor. Bill is an outstanding finance professional and is a servant leader with great integrity. Bill, Scott and the entire executive management team are talented professionals, who are committed to serve our shareholders, employees, customers, creditors and the communities where we live and work and CenterPoint Energy could not be in better hands.
And finally, I want to acknowledge David McClanahan, Scott Rozzell and Tom Standish. We all worked together from the formation of the company, and I want to thank them for affording me the privilege of working beside them these past years to help CenterPoint Energy become a stronger company.
Most importantly, I want to thank all of our employees who work safely each day to serve our customers and our community. Thank you for your continued interest in CenterPoint Energy and I will now turn the call back over to Carla."

As you think about our dividend which, as you know, we increased this year by 4.2%, if you annualized that dividend, 19% since we formed Enable. Certainly, when we were at the Analyst Day we laid out an 8% to 10% growth rate in the dividend. Now we're subsequent to that, as you know, there's been somewhat precipitous fall in commodity prices and challenges there. And Enable then -- that was based, by the way, on Enable's growth rate of 10% to 12%, they've lowered that, they provided 1-year guidance, as you know, and moved that down to more of a per-unit distribution growth rate of 3% to 7%, still solid.

Look, we're still delighted, it's a low-cash tax rate early but it does ramp up, and overtime, we're no different than any other taxpayer, we won't have these remedials and those things that allow you to have a lower tax rate earlier. But we're going to always constantly look for ways to lower our taxes. And hopefully, if there's corporate tax reform by the way, that will be terrific. Like you say, it's different for the regulated utility but for distributions we receive from Enable that would be important to us. So…"

And I would think the tax rate would then start to roll back to a better rate, am I thinking about that correctly?"

I think the most important thing to take away is that the company is committed to its dividend policy and that is the pass-through that's after-tax distributions of Enable. So as they -- we want Enable to be bigger, better, stronger, grow their distributions and our shareholders benefit from that, which should ultimately lower our cost to capital and allow us to finance our utility and grow our utility which as Scott and Tracy and Joe described, we have terrific capital opportunities, accretive capital to invest, so it will all be helpful to us."

When we showed you consolidated utility CapEx in June, we showed a 2014 to '18 number of $6.2 billion on the low end and then $7.4 billion was the upside number we had shown. We've now redone our full 5-year capital plan to include '15 through '19 and that '15 through '19 number, which drops '14 adds '19 is now $7.4 billion. So that number, that new 5-year number is now at the top end of the range. So hopefully, that clarifies the capital piece, if Andrew's still listening, that may provide a little more clarity for him as well. You then asked about the growth in rate base. We had said that the rate base growth for the utilities would be, depending on which one you were looking at, somewhere around 7% to 10% or 8% to 10%. And then on the electric one, the new forecast, is it's at the higher end of that range, we describe it now at 8% to 10%. The gas utility rate base is still in that same range, it still falls in that same range. And what we had indicated around our earnings growth is that at the high end of this investment, we would be moving towards the top end or the higher end of our earnings growth range. We did not have a different earnings growth range number. We just said we would be striving towards the higher end. The dynamic that affects this growth rate on our earnings is -- there's a few of them. One is, that I think you told, we mentioned to you all, we have some high starting points for some of our utilities, either fully earning or in some cases, they were slightly above allowed returns and that affects the starting point of these -- of this growth rate. There certainly is a fair amount of regulatory lag, even though we have these mechanisms, since the time period is so short if you're investing all this capital, by the time you get to year 5, you've essentially financed all this capital but you don't have a good amount of that capital yet in rate base earning. Said another way, if you were to taper off capital or if capital were to taper off towards the end the earnings would improve, but you would be paying for that through reductions and earnings down the road because your capital investment had slowed down, so that is a factor. And then, the other factor is that over this period of time, there are some assumptions for some amount of equity issuance so that we maintain the right balance between debt and equity. So all 3 of those factors lead into the fact that the rate base growth is more than what we experienced on our earnings growth."

If they can provide multiyear with confidence around their growth and then, that gives us confidence around providing compound growth rate. But I think an important takeaway, we're going to continue to grow our dividend. Our utilities will grow. We have a payout ratio of 60% to 70%. We've got room to work around that as the utility grows. And the takeaway from our investors -- for our investors should be, we are going to continue to grow the dividend but we'll do it in a thoughtful way, and we do have to be very thoughtful and mindful of Enable and really follow their information and try not to lead it."

As Carla mentioned, this morning, we will be referring to slides during our call. They can be located on our website under the Investors section. 
I will start with Slide 4. This morning we reported first quarter 2015 earnings of $131 million or $0.30 per diluted share compared with $185 million or $0.43 per diluted share in 2014. Using the same basis that we use when providing guidance, first quarter 2015 adjusted earnings would've also been $0.30 per diluted share compared to $0.40 for 2014. On a guidance basis, Utility Operations contributed $0.22 per diluted share and Midstream Investments contributed $0.08. Compared to baseline earnings of $0.21 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2014, which Bill will discuss in more detail, Utility Operations earnings are up 4.8%. This is consistent with the Utility EPS guidance provided earlier this year. Our Utility Operations continue to perform well supported by growing service territories, robust capital investment, constructive regulatory environments and limited business risks. These dynamics allow Utility Operations to be the balance of our diversified portfolio and will help to continue to provide earnings growth. Weather-related impacts across all of our businesses caused most of the variability this quarter. Tracy, Joe and Bill will share more details about this and other drivers for the quarter. 
Despite the challenges that midstream companies have recently experienced due to lower energy commodity prices, we continue to see opportunity in this space and believe that Enable Midstream Partners is well-positioned to succeed. Drilling technology has fundamentally changed the landscape of the energy market, as well as the role the United States plays in the global energy and feedstock market. We believe domestic and global demand, coupled with continued progress towards greater energy independence, will require significant capital investment and infrastructure. Enable remains well-positioned to participate in this infrastructure build-out, as evidenced by their recent completion of the Bradley processing plant in the SCOOP, as well as the Baird crude and produce water gathering system in the Bakken. Last week, Enable announced their acquisition of Monarch Natural Gas Gathering assets in the Cleveland Sands Play and has stated it is immediately accretive. 
Early indications show that the Houston economy remain strong despite press coverage regarding recently announced layoffs in the energy sector. Houston Electric's meter count increased by more than 11,000 in the first quarter, which equates to an annualized growth rate of 2%. This is consistent with employment and other economic data we are seeing. According to the Greater Houston partnership, last year, the Houston metro area led the nation by adding a record-setting 157,000 residents between July of 2013 and July of 2014. The partnership forecast the addition of 120,000 new residents in 2015. 
Our projected capital spending remains on target for the year at $1.5 billion, a 9% increase over 2014. We continue to utilize timely recovery mechanisms, as well as rate case proceedings to help ensure effective and timely return on our investment. Tracy and Joe will provide additional color on a number of these. 
Before I wrap up, let me note that CenterPoint continues to be recognized for its strong customer service. We were recently ranked first in the Midwest region and second in the South region among the largest natural gas utilities in the U.S. for operational satisfaction and a 2014 Cogent Report conducted by Market Strategies International. This report evaluated residential brand trust and engagement and the results reinforced our ongoing strategy to utilize technology to improve the customer experience. We continue to focus on safe, reliable and efficient operations, coupled with improved services for our customers as our path to success and value creation for our shareholders. I will now ask Tracy to discuss electric operations."

First quarter 2015 core operating income was $68 million compared with $75 million for the same period last year. The business benefited from higher net transmission-related revenue and strong customer growth. These benefits were more than offset by the impacts of milder weather, reduced equity return, primarily related to true-up proceeds and lower right to revenue. Importantly, growth continues to be strong. Houston Electric added more than 11,000 metered customers during the first quarter of 2015, and if annualized, this represents 2% meter growth. 
On Page 6, we show a chart contrasting oil prices, employment and residential metered customers in the Houston area since 1980. This chart shows steady customer growth despite large swings in oil prices and smaller variations in employment. We believe long-term annual customer growth of 2% will be supported by Houston's diversified economy and culture, as well as mild winters in a low cost of living. Houston Electric continues to focus on O&M expenses management, even as we address customer growth and robust capital spending. During the first quarter of 2015, Houston Electric's O&M increased less than 2% versus the first quarter of 2014. This growth rate excludes certain expenses, which have revenue offsets. 
Next, I will update you on our 345 KV transmission project, which we call the Brazos Valley Connection detailed on Slide 7. On April 24 we filed an application for a certificate of convenience and necessity with the Public Utility Commission of Texas. We estimate the total project cost will be between $276 million and $383 million, depending on the route approved by the PUC. We expect the PUC will issue a final order in the fourth quarter addressing all issues, including which route should be used. Upon final approval, we will begin construction and anticipate completing the project no later than mid-2018. The new import project will improve the capacity of the Texas electric grid, with strengthened regional transmission capabilities and help support growing demand in the greater Houston area. 
Turning to capital cost recovery mechanisms. Our transmission capital costs are recovered to be a transmission cost of service or TCOS filings. The rate adjustment from our fourth quarter 2014 TCOS filing totaling over $23 million annually went into effect on February 25. We anticipate making the 2 allowed TCOS filings this year. For distribution capital cost recovery, you will see on Slide 8 that we filed on April 6th to increase rates by $16.7 million annually using for the first time the distribution cost recovery factor mechanism or DCRF. We expect the decision in July and have requested that rates become effective on September 1. I would also like to note that legislative authority for the DCRF mechanism currently sunsets [ph] on January 1, 2017. And as a result, we have been working to get the legislation extended. The DCRF Sunset Extension Bills, which moves the sunset to September 1, 2019, have successfully passed through the Texas House and Senate, and we anticipate enactment by the end of the second part. 
I will conclude by highlighting our successful smart meter deployment and ongoing intelligent grid implementation referenced on Slide 9. In addition to reducing costs, these projects delivered additional reliability and efficiency benefits, provide enhanced customer functionality optionality and have the environment. As a result of the smart meter project, our customers have saved over $23 million per year in service fees. Additionally, our residential customers are charge covering part of the cost of the smart meter project will end this month, reducing overall customer rates, which are already among the most competitive in the nation. Further, since the beginning of this project, we have saved more than 1 million gallons of fuel, avoided [ph] 9300 metric tons of CO2 and restored power to nearly 1.2 million customers without a phone call. CenterPoint is at the forefront of the industry in this area, and we are proud of our environmental contributions and our ability to manage expenses through the use of this technology. I am pleased with Houston Electric's first quarter performance. Growth remains strong and we will continue to focus on delivering safe, reliable and efficient service. 
Joe will now update you on the results for gas operations."
279513,290854287,810731,"CenterPoint Energy, Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, May 11, 2015",2015-05-11,"Earnings Calls","CenterPoint Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Tracy. Our natural gas operations, which includes both our gas utilities and our nonregulated Energy Services business, also had a solid quarter in line with our expectations. Natural gas utilities first quarter 2015 operating income was $146 m",778,"Thank you, Tracy. Our natural gas operations, which includes both our gas utilities and our nonregulated Energy Services business, also had a solid quarter in line with our expectations. Natural gas utilities first quarter 2015 operating income was $146 million compared with $162 million for the same period last year, while Energy Services reported operating income of $13 million this quarter compared with $26 million last year. During the quarter, our natural gas utilities business continued to benefit from rate relief and customer growth. Robust economies in our service territories led to the addition of approximately 37,000 new customers year-over-year, and we are on track for continuing our 1% growth in 2015. We were also successful in controlling O&M expenses. These benefits were more than offset by a decrease in usage related to less extreme weather in 2015 compared to 2014, higher depreciation and amortization and higher property taxes. 
Although heating degree days were higher-than-normal across our service territories. They were significantly lower than the first quarter order of last year. As a reminder, since 2007, we have hedged winter weather at our LDCs in those jurisdictions where we do not have weather normalization adjustments. Normally, the hedges mitigate significant year-over-year fluctuations. However, weather in the first quarter of 2014 was so cold, we exceeded that cap on that hedge by the end of January 2014. As a result, we were unhedged in February and March of 2014 and booked significant income from weather-related usage in those 2 months. This variance alone accounted for $9 million of the operating income decline in the first quarter of 2015. Additionally, the capital investments we're making to meet growth and ensure system reliability and safety have increased depreciation and amortization expenses. These higher G&A expenses will be recovered through rate recovery mechanisms and rate cases. In addition, operating income was reduced $3 million in the first quarter of '15 as compared to the same quarter in 2014 due to a change in a customer charge in our last Minnesota rate case. This reduction is primarily timing-related and will reverse in subsequent quarters as the higher customer charge has the effect of smoothing revenues throughout the year. 
As indicated on Slide 11, we have made, and will make, several important regulatory filings in 2015. These filings represent a combination of rate cases and annual recovery mechanisms and are intended to compensate for substantial investment made to better serve our growing customer base. We filed a Texas Coast rate case in late March seeking a nearly $7 million increase. We expect the Texas Railroad Commission will issue a final order in the fourth quarter of this year. Once the Texas Coast case is finalized, we expect to utilize GRIP, the annual infrastructure recovery mechanism, to recover future incremental capital investment which will help reduce regulatory lag. We also made GRIP filings in our Texas jurisdictions during the first quarter, seeking a combined annual increase in rates of $10 million in 2 of those jurisdictions. Additionally, we plan to file rate cases in Minnesota during the third quarter and in Arkansas during the fourth quarter. The majority of increases will be reflected in 2016 results, and we will update you on the specifics later in the year. 
As noted on Slide 12, Act 725 [ph] was recently passed by the Arkansas legislature, and we believe this new law will benefit our Utility Operations in future years. We have worked closely with Arkansas PUC and its staff over the years in utilizing multiple alternative rate mechanisms. Act 725 allows utility to move away from filing multiple annual mechanisms to requesting a comprehensive formula rate time that includes a forward test year with annual true-up rates around the banded ROE. We view this regulatory options as positive with a potential to reduce regulatory lag in Arkansas and recover capital investment in a more timely manner. 
Turning to our nonregulated Energy Services business. The first quarter's results include a $4 million mark-to-market loss compared with a $4 million gain the previous year. The remaining decrease was margin-related, resulting primarily from reduced weather-related optimization opportunities compared the first quarter of 2014. Our Energy Services business continued to grow its retail customers with a solid place, adding over 800 commercial and industrial customers or a 5% increase over last year. 
This was a solid quarter despite the impact of quarter-over-quarter weather variances, and again, consistent with our expectations. We continue to focus on delivering safe and reliable natural gas, as well as creating first-rate customer experiences by providing customers with more choices and customized services. 
I'll now turn the call over to Bill Rogers who will cover financial activities."
279513,290854287,810731,"CenterPoint Energy, Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, May 11, 2015",2015-05-11,"Earnings Calls","CenterPoint Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Joe, and good morning to everyone. I have a few topics to review this morning and we'll start by discussing the quarter-over-quarter earnings drivers, some of which Tracy and Joe addressed. As Scott mentioned earlier, and as Slide 14 shows, o",837,"Thank you, Joe, and good morning to everyone. I have a few topics to review this morning and we'll start by discussing the quarter-over-quarter earnings drivers, some of which Tracy and Joe addressed. 
As Scott mentioned earlier, and as Slide 14 shows, our earnings per share on a guidance basis was $0.30 in the first quarter of 2015 compared with $0.40 per share earned in the 2014 quarter. As a reminder, our EPS on a guidance basis excludes impacts of items such as mark-to-market adjustments at our Energy Services business and securities and related reference shares. At Midstream Investments, lower equity income from Enable impacted EPS by $0.05 per diluted share. At the Utility Operations level, we have provided 2 waterfall charge to help illustrate our normalized operational performance on a quarter-to-quarter basis. The first of these charge is at the bottom of the Page 14 and shows Utility Operations first quarter 2014 EPS on a guidance basis of $0.27 per share. After normalizing $0.05 to exclude the benefit of colder weather, and $0.01 associated with 2014's higher equity return, primarily associated with Houston Electric's true-up proceeds, we arrive at a 2014 first quarter Utility Operations baseline of $0.21 per diluted share. These adjustments are consistent with the baseline adjustments we highlighted for you in our 2014 year-end call when we provided our 2014 full year Utility Operations baseline of $0.70. This is the baseline from which we feel operational performance should be measured. 
Turning to Slide 15. This second chart takes you from the first quarter 2014 Utility Operations baseline of $0.21 to the first quarter 2015 Utility Operations of $0.22. As you can see, strong customer growth and rate relief benefited the quarter by $0.03 per diluted share. These benefits were partially offset by $0.01 of higher interest expense and another $0.01 of a number of factors such as higher depreciation expense, lower rights-of-way revenue and higher O&M. These drivers resulted in 2015 first quarter Utility Operations EPS on a guidance basis of $0.22 per diluted share. This 4.8% growth rate from our 2014 first quarter baseline of $0.21 is in line with our 2015 guidance and our longer-term EPS growth rate of 4% to 6%. 
Turning to O&M, CenterPoint's total O&M, excluding expenses that are corresponding revenue offset such as TCOS, was up just under 2% on a quarter-to-quarter basis. This increase in O&M expenses, primarily due to higher labor costs, including benefits. We are committed to looking for further opportunities to optimize our operating cost structure. 
Now turning to cash flow. During the quarter, we posted strong cash flow from operations activities, including $165 million from a retroactive bonus depreciation and $72 million in distributions received from Enable. Further, with respect to cash distributions from Enable, Enable Board of Directors declared on April 24 a quarterly cash distribution of which we expect to receive approximately $73 million. This represents a 1.2% increase over the prior quarter distribution, and if annualized, is consistent with the midpoint of Enable's 2015 forecast of 3% to 7% distribution growth. 
Our $1.5 billion capital plan for 2015 is on track. Through the end of the first quarter, we have invested $309 million. As described in our 2014 Form 10-K, we plan to invest $7.4 billion over the next 5 years. As a consider how to finance this capital plan, we are continually looking for opportunities to optimize our capital structure through our debt and equity capital formation activities, and we are diligent in considering if and when equity is appropriate. We have strong financial liquidity at the company and plan to use our existing debt capacity to source the majority of our financing needs. As we do this, we will be a tenant of debt refinancing opportunities to further reduce our interest expense, as well as to maintain our regulatory capital structures and our solid investment grade credit ratings. Additionally, as we shared in our February earnings call, we are now planning a secondary offering of common equity over the next 5 years. However, if appropriate, we may consider issuing original issue shares through our benefits and investor choice plants. Based on CenterPoint's results and the most recent public forecast made by Enable, we reaffirm our 2015 consolidated earnings estimates of $1 to $1.10 per diluted share. We reaffirm component parts of that with Utility Operations of $0.71 to $0.75 and the Midstream Investments of $0.29 to $0.35. This guidance assumes consolidated attempted tax rate of approximately 37% and an average share count of 431 million shares. 
Before I turn the call back over to Carla, I would like to remind you of the $0.2475 per share quarterly dividend declared by our Board of Directors on April 23. We believe that the strength of our balance sheet, coupled with strong earnings and cash flow, support our dividends under a wide variety of circumstances. 
With that, I would like you thank you for continued interest in CenterPoint Energy, and I will now turn the call back over to Carla."

In other words, beyond 2015. At this point, they've said that they anticipate being able to provide more projection on their second quarter call. So that's where we should have more information. I will tell you though that just from a dividend standpoint, we remain committed to providing a secure, competitive and growing dividend, and we're going to keep focused on that.

As Carla mentioned, this morning, we will be referring to slides during our call. They can be located on our website under the Investors section. 
I will start with Slide 4. This morning, we reported first quarter 2015 earnings of $131 million or $0.30 per diluted share compared with $185 million or $0.43 per diluted share in 2014. Using the same basis that we use when providing guidance, first quarter 2015 adjusted earnings would've also been $0.30 per diluted share compared to $0.40 for 2014. On a guidance basis, Utility Operations contributed $0.22 per diluted share and Midstream Investments contributed $0.08. Compared to baseline earnings of $0.21 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2014, which Bill will discuss in more detail, Utility Operations earnings are up 4.8%. This is consistent with the Utility EPS guidance provided earlier this year. Our Utility Operations continue to perform well, supported by growing service territories, robust capital investment, constructive regulatory environments and limited business risks. These dynamics allow Utility Operations to be the ballast of our diversified portfolio and will help to continue to provide earnings growth. Weather-related impacts across all of our businesses caused most of the variability this quarter. Tracy, Joe and Bill will share more details about this and other drivers for the quarter. 
Despite the challenges that midstream companies have recently experienced due to lower energy commodity prices, we continue to see opportunity in this space and believe that Enable Midstream Partners is well positioned to succeed. Drilling technology has fundamentally changed the landscape of the energy market as well as the role the United States plays in the global energy and feedstock market. We believe domestic and global demand, coupled with continued progress towards greater energy independence, will require significant capital investment and infrastructure. Enable remains well positioned to participate in this infrastructure build-out, as evidenced by their recent completion of the Bradley Processing Plant in the SCOOP as well as the Bear Den Crude & Produced Water Gathering System in the Bakken. Last week, Enable announced their acquisition of Monarch Natural Gas gathering assets in the Cleveland Sands Play, and has stated it is immediately accretive. 
Early indications show that the Houston economy remains strong, despite press coverage regarding recently announced layoffs in the energy sector. Houston Electric's meter count increased by more than 11,000 in the first quarter, which equates to an annualized growth rate of 2%. This is consistent with employment and other economic data we are seeing. According to the greater Houston partnership, last year, the Houston metro area led the nation by adding a record-setting 157,000 residents between July of 2013 and July of 2014. The partnership forecast the addition of 120,000 new residents in 2015. 
Our projected capital spending remains on target for the year at $1.5 billion, a 9% increase over 2014. We continue to utilize timely recovery mechanisms as well as rate case proceedings to help ensure effective and timely return on our investment. Tracy and Joe will provide additional color on a number of these. 
Before I wrap up, let me note that CenterPoint continues to be recognized for its strong customer service. We were recently ranked first in the Midwest region and second in the South region among the largest natural gas utilities in the U.S. for operational satisfaction in a 2014 Cogent Report conducted by Market Strategies International. This report evaluated residential brand trust and engagement, and the results reinforced our ongoing strategy to utilize technology to improve the customer experience. We continue to focus on safe, reliable and efficient operations, coupled with improved services for our customers as our path to success and value creation for our shareholders. 
I will now ask Tracy to discuss Electric operations."
279513,290854287,810950,"CenterPoint Energy, Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, May 11, 2015",2015-05-11,"Earnings Calls","CenterPoint Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Scott. Houston Electric had a solid quarter, consistent with our expectations. First quarter 2015 core operating income was $68 million compared with $75 million for the same period last year. The business benefited from higher net transmission",707,"Thank you, Scott. Houston Electric had a solid quarter, consistent with our expectations. First quarter 2015 core operating income was $68 million compared with $75 million for the same period last year. The business benefited from higher net transmission-related revenue and strong customer growth. These benefits were more than offset by the impacts of milder weather, reduced equity return, primarily related to true-up proceeds and lower right-of-way revenue. Importantly, growth continues to be strong. Houston Electric added more than 11,000 metered customers during the first quarter of 2015, and if annualized, this represents 2% meter growth. 
On Page 6, we show a chart contrasting oil prices, employment and residential metered customers in the Houston area since 1980. This chart shows steady customer growth, despite large swings in oil prices and smaller variations in employment. We believe long-term annual customer growth of 2% will be supported by Houston's diversified economy and culture as well as mild winters and a low cost of living. Houston Electric continues to focus on O&M expenses management, even as we address customer growth and robust capital spending. During the first quarter of 2015, Houston Electric's O&M increased less than 2% versus the first quarter of 2014. This growth rate excludes certain expenses, which have revenue offsets. 
Next, I will update you on our 345 KV transmission project, which we call the Brazos Valley Connection, detailed on Slide 7. On April 24, we filed an application for a Certificate of Convenience and Necessity with the Public Utility Commission of Texas. We estimate the total project cost will be between $276 million and $383 million, depending on the route approved by the PUC. We expect the PUC will issue a final order in the fourth quarter addressing all issues, including which route should be used. Upon final approval, we will begin construction and anticipate completing the project no later than mid-2018. The new Import Project will improve the capacity of the Texas electric grid, strengthen regional transmission capabilities and help support growing demand in the greater Houston area. 
Turning to capital cost recovery mechanisms. Our transmission capital costs are recovered to be a Transmission Cost of Service, or TCOS, filings. The rate adjustment from our fourth quarter 2014 TCOS filing, totaling over $23 million annually, went into effect on February 25. We anticipate making the 2 allowed TCOS filings this year. For distribution capital cost recovery, you will see on Slide 8 that we filed on April 6th to increase rates by $16.7 million annually using, for the first time, the Distribution Cost Recovery Factor mechanism, or DCRF. We expect the decision in July, and have requested that rates become effective on September 1. I would also like to note that legislative authority for the DCRF mechanism currently sunsets on January 1, 2017 and, as a result, we have been working to get the legislation extended. The DCRF sunset extension bills, which move the sunset to September 1, 2019, have successfully passed through the Texas House and Senate, and we anticipate enactment by the end of the second quarter. 
I will conclude by highlighting our successful Smart Meter deployment and ongoing Intelligent Grid implementation referenced on Slide 9. In addition to reducing costs, these projects deliver additional reliability and efficiency benefits, provide enhanced customer functionality optionality and help the environment. As a result of the Smart Meter project, our customers have saved over $23 million per year in service fees. Additionally, a residential customer surcharge covering part of the cost of the Smart Meter project will end this month, reducing overall customer rates, which are already among the most competitive in the nation. Further, since the beginning of this project, we have saved more than 1 million gallons of fuel, avoided 9,300 metric tons of CO2 and restored power to nearly 1.2 million customers without a phone call. CenterPoint is at the forefront of the industry in this area, and we are proud of our environmental contributions and our ability to manage expenses through the use of this technology. I am pleased with Houston Electric's first quarter performance. Growth remains strong, and we will continue to focus on delivering safe, reliable and efficient service. 
Joe will now update you on the results for Gas operations."
279513,290854287,810950,"CenterPoint Energy, Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, May 11, 2015",2015-05-11,"Earnings Calls","CenterPoint Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Tracy. Our natural gas operations, which includes both our gas utilities and our nonregulated Energy Services business, also had a solid quarter, in line with our expectations. Natural gas utilities first quarter 2015 operating income was $146",782,"Thank you, Tracy. Our natural gas operations, which includes both our gas utilities and our nonregulated Energy Services business, also had a solid quarter, in line with our expectations. Natural gas utilities first quarter 2015 operating income was $146 million compared with $162 million for the same period last year, while Energy Services reported operating income of $13 million this quarter compared with $26 million last year. During the quarter, our natural gas utilities business continued to benefit from rate relief and customer growth. Robust economies in our service territories led to the addition of approximately 37,000 new customers year-over-year, and we are on track for continuing our 1% growth in 2015. We were also successful in controlling O&M expenses. These benefits were more than offset by a decrease in usage related to less extreme weather in 2015 compared to 2014, higher depreciation and amortization and higher property taxes. 
Although heating degree days were higher than normal across our service territories, they were significantly lower than the first quarter of last year. As a reminder, since 2007, we have hedged winter weather at our LDCs in those jurisdictions where we do not have weather normalization adjustments. Normally, the hedges mitigate significant year-over-year fluctuations. However, weather in the first quarter of 2014 was so cold, we exceeded the cap on that hedge by the end of January 2014. As a result, we were unhedged in February and March of 2014 and booked significant income from weather-related usage in those 2 months. This variance alone accounted for $9 million of the operating income decline in the first quarter of 2015. Additionally, the capital investments we're making to meet growth and ensure system reliability and safety have increased depreciation and amortization expenses. These higher D&A expenses will be recovered through rate recovery mechanisms and rate cases. In addition, operating income was reduced $3 million in the first quarter of '15 as compared to the same quarter in 2014 due to a change in a customer charge in our last Minnesota rate case. This reduction is primarily timing related and will reverse in subsequent quarters, as the higher customer charge has the effect of smoothing revenues throughout the year. 
As indicated on Slide 11, we have made, and will make, several important regulatory filings in 2015. These filings represent a combination of rate cases and annual recovery mechanisms and are intended to compensate for substantial investment made to better serve our growing customer base. We filed a Texas Coast rate case in late March, seeking a nearly $7 million increase. We expect the Texas Railroad Commission will issue a final order in the fourth quarter of this year. Once the Texas Coast case is finalized, we expect to utilize GRIP, the annual infrastructure recovery mechanism, to recover future incremental capital investment which will help reduce regulatory lag. We also made GRIP filings in our Texas jurisdictions during the first quarter, seeking a combined annual increase in rates of $10 million in 2 of those jurisdictions. Additionally, we plan to file rate cases in Minnesota during the third quarter and in Arkansas during the fourth quarter. A majority of the increases will be reflected in 2016 results, and we will update you on the specifics later in the year. 
As noted on Slide 12, Act 725 was recently passed by the Arkansas legislature, and we believe this new law will benefit our Utility Operations in future years. We have worked closely with the Arkansas PUC and its staff over the years in utilizing multiple alternative rate mechanisms. Act 725 allows utility to move away from filing multiple annual mechanisms to requesting a comprehensive formula rate plan that includes a forward test year, with annual true-up at rates around a banded ROE. We view this regulatory options as positive, with a potential to reduce regulatory lag in Arkansas and recover capital investment in a more timely manner. 
Turning to our nonregulated Energy Services business. The first quarter's results include a $4 million mark-to-market loss compared with a $4 million gain the previous year. The remaining decrease was margin-related, resulting primarily from reduced weather-related optimization opportunities compared the first quarter of 2014. Our Energy Services business continued to grow its retail customers at a solid place, adding over 800 commercial and industrial customers or a 5% increase over last year. 
This was a solid quarter despite the impact of quarter-over-quarter weather variances, and again, consistent with our expectations. We continue to focus on delivering safe and reliable natural gas as well as creating first-rate customer experiences by providing customers with more choices and customized services. 
I'll now turn the call over to Bill Rogers, who will cover financial activities."
279513,290854287,810950,"CenterPoint Energy, Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, May 11, 2015",2015-05-11,"Earnings Calls","CenterPoint Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Joe, and good morning to everyone. I have a few topics to review this morning and we'll start by discussing the quarter-over-quarter earnings drivers, some of which Tracy and Joe addressed. As Scott mentioned earlier, and as Slide 14 shows, o",843,"Thank you, Joe, and good morning to everyone. I have a few topics to review this morning and we'll start by discussing the quarter-over-quarter earnings drivers, some of which Tracy and Joe addressed. 
As Scott mentioned earlier, and as Slide 14 shows, our earnings per share on a guidance basis was $0.30 in the first quarter of 2015 compared with $0.40 per share earned in the 2014 quarter. As a reminder, our EPS on a guidance basis excludes impacts of items such as mark-to-market adjustments at our Energy Services business and our ZENS securities and related reference shares. At Midstream Investments, lower equity income from Enable impacted EPS by $0.05 per diluted share. At the Utility Operations level, we have provided 2 waterfall charts to help illustrate our normalized operational performance on a quarter-to-quarter basis. The first of these charts is at the bottom of Page 14, and shows Utility Operations first quarter 2014 EPS on a guidance basis of $0.27 per share. After normalizing $0.05 to exclude the benefit of colder weather and $0.01 associated with 2014's higher equity return, primarily associated with Houston Electric's true-up proceeds, we arrive at a 2014 first quarter Utility Operations baseline of $0.21 per diluted share. These adjustments are consistent with the baseline adjustments we highlighted for you in our 2014 year-end call when we provided our 2014 full year Utility Operations baseline of $0.70. This is the baseline from which we feel operational performance should be measured. 
Turning to Slide 15. This second chart takes you from the first quarter 2014 Utility Operations baseline of $0.21 to the first quarter 2015 Utility Operations of $0.22. As you can see, strong customer growth and rate relief benefited the quarter by $0.03 per diluted share. These benefits were partially offset by $0.01 of higher interest expense and another $0.01 of a number of factors, such as higher depreciation expense, lower right-of-way revenue and higher O&M. These drivers resulted in 2015 first quarter Utility Operations EPS on a guidance basis of $0.22 per diluted share. This 4.8% growth rate from our 2014 first quarter baseline of $0.21 is in line with our 2015 guidance and our longer-term EPS growth rate of 4% to 6%. 
Turning to O&M. CenterPoint's total O&M, excluding expenses that have corresponding revenue offset, such as TCOS, was up just under 2% on a quarter-to-quarter basis. This increase in O&M expense is primarily due to higher labor costs, including benefits. We are committed to looking for further opportunities to optimize our operating cost structure. 
Now turning to cash flow. During the quarter, we posted strong cash flow from operating activities, including $165 million from a retroactive bonus depreciation and $72 million in distributions received from Enable. Further, with respect to cash distributions from Enable, the Enable Board of Directors declared on April 24 a quarterly cash distribution, of which we expect to receive approximately $73 million. This represents a 1.2% increase over the prior quarter distribution and, if annualized, is consistent with the midpoint of Enable's 2015 forecast of 3% to 7% distribution growth. 
Our $1.5 billion capital plan for 2015 is on track. Through the end of the first quarter, we have invested $309 million. As described in our 2014 Form 10-K, we plan to invest $7.4 billion over the next 5 years. As I consider how to finance this capital plan, we are continually looking for opportunities to optimize our capital structure through our debt and equity capital formation activities, and we are diligent in considering if and when equity is appropriate. We have strong financial liquidity at the company and plan to use our existing debt capacity to source the majority of our financing needs. As we do this, we will be attentive of the debt refinancing opportunities to further reduce our interest expense as well as to maintain our regulatory capital structures and our solid investment grade credit ratings. 
Additionally, as we shared on our February earnings call, we are now planning a secondary offering of common equity over the next 5 years. However, if appropriate, we may consider issuing original issue shares through our benefits and investor choice plans. Based on CenterPoint's results and the most recent public forecast made by Enable, we reaffirm our 2015 consolidated earnings estimates of $1 to $1.10 per diluted share. We reaffirm the component parts of that, with Utility Operations of $0.71 to $0.75 and the Midstream Investments of $0.29 to $0.35. This guidance assumes a consolidated effective tax rate of approximately 37% and an average share count of 431 million shares. 
Before I turn the call back over to Carla, I would like to remind you of the $0.2475 per share quarterly dividend declared by our Board of Directors on April 23. We believe that the strength of our balance sheet, coupled with strong earnings and cash flow, support our dividend under a wide variety of circumstances. 
With that, I would like to thank you for your continued interest in CenterPoint Energy, and I will now turn the call back over to Carla."

As Carla mentioned, this morning, we will be referring to slides during our call. They can be located on our website under the Investors section.
I will start with Slide 4. This morning, we reported first quarter 2015 earnings of $131 million or $0.30 per diluted share compared with $185 million or $0.43 per diluted share in 2014. Using the same basis that we use when providing guidance, first quarter 2015 adjusted earnings would've also been $0.30 per diluted share compared to $0.40 for 2014. On a guidance basis, Utility Operations contributed $0.22 per diluted share, and Midstream Investments contributed $0.08. Compared to baseline earnings of $0.21 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2014, which Bill will discuss in more detail, Utility Operations earnings are up 4.8%. This is consistent with the Utility EPS guidance provided earlier this year. Our Utility Operations continue to perform well, supported by growing service territories, robust capital investment, constructive regulatory environments and limited business risk. These dynamics allow Utility Operations to be the ballast of our diversified portfolio and will help to continue to provide earnings growth. Weather-related impacts across all of our businesses caused most of the variability this quarter. Tracy, Joe and Bill will share more details about this and other drivers for the quarter. 
Despite the challenges that midstream companies have recently experienced due to lower energy commodity prices, we continue to see opportunity in this space and believe that Enable Midstream Partners is well positioned to succeed. Drilling technology has fundamentally changed the landscape of the energy market as well as the role the United States plays in the global energy and feedstock market. We believe domestic and global demand, coupled with continued progress towards greater energy independence, will require significant capital investment and infrastructure. Enable remains well positioned to participate in this infrastructure build-out, as evidenced by their recent completion of the Bradley Processing Plant in the SCOOP as well as the Bear Den Crude & Produced Water Gathering System in the Bakken. Last week, Enable announced their acquisition of Monarch Natural Gas gathering assets in the Cleveland Sands Play and has stated it is immediately accretive. 
Early indications show that the Houston economy remains strong, despite press coverage regarding recently announced layoffs in the energy sector. Houston Electric's meter count increased by more than 11,000 in the first quarter, which equates to an annualized growth rate of 2%. This is consistent with employment and other economic data we are seeing. According to the greater Houston partnership, last year, the Houston metro area led the nation by adding a record-setting 157,000 residents between July of 2013 and July of 2014. The partnership forecasts the addition of 120,000 new residents in 2015. 
Our projected capital spending remains on target for the year at $1.5 billion, a 9% increase over 2014. We continue to utilize timely recovery mechanisms as well as rate case proceedings to help ensure effective and timely return on our investment. Tracy and Joe will provide additional color on a number of these. 
Before I wrap up, let me note that CenterPoint continues to be recognized for its strong customer service. We were recently ranked first in the Midwest region and second in the South region among the largest natural gas utilities in the U.S. for operational satisfaction in a 2014 Cogent report conducted by Market Strategies International. This report evaluated residential brand trust and engagement, and the results reinforce our ongoing strategy to utilize technology to improve the customer experience. We continue to focus on safe, reliable and efficient operations, coupled with improved services for our customers as our path to success and value creation for our shareholders. 
I will now ask Tracy to discuss Electric operations."
279513,290854287,811143,"CenterPoint Energy, Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, May 11, 2015",2015-05-11,"Earnings Calls","CenterPoint Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Scott. Houston Electric had a solid quarter, consistent with our expectations. First quarter 2015 core operating income was $68 million compared with $75 million for the same period last year. The business benefited from higher net transmission",704,"Thank you, Scott. Houston Electric had a solid quarter, consistent with our expectations. First quarter 2015 core operating income was $68 million compared with $75 million for the same period last year. The business benefited from higher net transmission-related revenue and strong customer growth. These benefits were more than offset by the impacts of milder weather; reduced equity return, primarily related to true-up proceeds; and lower right-of-way revenue. Importantly, growth continues to be strong. Houston Electric added more than 11,000 metered customers during the first quarter of 2015, and if annualized, this represents 2% meter growth. 
On Page 6, we show a chart contrasting oil prices, employment and residential metered customers in the Houston area since 1980. This chart shows steady customer growth, despite large swings in oil prices and smaller variations in employment. We believe long-term annual customer growth of 2% will be supported by Houston's diversified economy and culture as well as mild winters and a low cost of living. Houston Electric continues to focus on O&M expenses management, even as we address customer growth and robust capital spending. During the first quarter of 2015, Houston Electric's O&M increased less than 2% versus the first quarter of 2014. This growth rate excludes certain expenses which have revenue offsets. 
Next, I will update you on our 345 KV transmission project, which we call the Brazos Valley Connection, detailed on Slide 7. On April 24, we filed an application for a Certificate of Convenience and Necessity with the Public Utility Commission of Texas. We estimate the total project cost will be between $276 million and $383 million, depending on the route approved by the PUC. We expect the PUC will issue a final order in the fourth quarter addressing all issues, including which route should be used. Upon final approval, we will begin construction and anticipate completing the project no later than mid-2018. The new Import Project will improve the capacity of the Texas electric grid, strengthen regional transmission capabilities and help support growing demand in the greater Houston area. 
Turning to capital cost recovery mechanisms. Our transmission capital costs are recovered via Transmission Cost of Service, or TCOS, filings. The rate adjustment from our fourth quarter 2014 TCOS filing, totaling over $23 million annually, went into effect on February 25. We anticipate making the 2 allowed TCOS filings this year. For distribution capital cost recovery, you will see on Slide 8 that we filed on April 6 to increase rates by $16.7 million annually using, for the first time, the Distribution Cost Recovery Factor mechanism, or DCRF. We expect the decision in July and have requested that rates become effective on September 1. I would also like to note that legislative authority for the DCRF mechanism currently sunsets on January 1, 2017 and, as a result, we have been working to get the legislation extended. The DCRF sunset extension bills, which move the sunset to September 1, 2019, have successfully passed through the Texas House and Senate, and we anticipate enactment by the end of the second quarter.
I will conclude by highlighting our successful Smart Meter deployment and ongoing Intelligent Grid implementation referenced on Slide 9. In addition to reducing costs, these projects deliver additional reliability and efficiency benefits, provide enhanced customer functionality and help the environment. As a result of the Smart Meter project, our customers have saved over $23 million per year in service fees. Additionally, a residential customer surcharge covering part of the cost of the Smart Meter project will end this month, reducing overall customer rates, which are already among the most competitive in the nation. Further, since the beginning of this project, we have saved more than 1 million gallons of fuel, avoided 9,300 metric tons of CO2 and restored power to nearly 1.2 million customers without a phone call. CenterPoint is at the forefront of the industry in this area, and we are proud of our environmental contributions and our ability to manage expenses through the use of this technology. I am pleased with Houston Electric's first quarter performance. Growth remains strong, and we will continue to focus on delivering safe, reliable and efficient service. 
Joe will now update you on the results for Gas operations."
279513,290854287,811143,"CenterPoint Energy, Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, May 11, 2015",2015-05-11,"Earnings Calls","CenterPoint Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Tracy. Our natural gas operations, which includes both our gas utilities and our nonregulated Energy Services business, also had a solid quarter, in line with our expectations. Natural gas utilities first quarter 2015 operating income was $146",784,"Thank you, Tracy. Our natural gas operations, which includes both our gas utilities and our nonregulated Energy Services business, also had a solid quarter, in line with our expectations. Natural gas utilities first quarter 2015 operating income was $146 million compared with $162 million for the same period last year, while Energy Services reported operating income of $13 million this quarter compared with $26 million last year. During the quarter, our natural gas utilities business continued to benefit from rate relief and customer growth. Robust economies in our service territories led to the addition of approximately 37,000 new customers year-over-year, and we are on track for continuing our 1% growth in 2015. We were also successful in controlling O&M expenses. These benefits were more than offset by a decrease in usage related to less extreme weather in 2015 compared to 2014, higher depreciation and amortization and higher property taxes. 
Although heating degree days were higher than normal across our service territories, they were significantly lower than the first quarter of last year. As a reminder, since 2007, we have hedged winter weather at our LDCs in those jurisdictions where we do not have weather normalization adjustments. Normally, the hedges mitigate significant year-over-year fluctuations. However, weather in the first quarter of 2014 was so cold, we exceeded the cap on that hedge by the end of January 2014. As a result, we were unhedged in February and March of 2014 and booked significant income from weather-related usage in those 2 months. This variance alone accounted for $9 million of the operating income decline in the first quarter of 2015. Additionally, the capital investments we're making to meet growth and ensure system reliability and safety have increased depreciation and amortization expenses. These higher D&A expenses will be recovered through rate recovery mechanisms and rate cases. In addition, operating income was reduced $3 million in the first quarter of '15 as compared to the same quarter in 2014 due to a change in a customer charge in our last Minnesota rate case. This reduction is primarily timing-related and will reverse in subsequent quarters, as the higher customer charge has the effect of smoothing revenues throughout the year. 
As indicated on Slide 11, we have made and will make several important regulatory filings in 2015. These filings represent a combination of rate cases and annual recovery mechanisms and are intended to compensate us for the substantial investment made to better serve our growing customer base. We filed a Texas Coast rate case in late March, seeking a nearly $7 million increase. We expect the Texas Railroad Commission will issue a final order in the fourth quarter of this year. Once the Texas Coast case is finalized, we expect to utilize GRIP, the annual infrastructure recovery mechanism, to recover future incremental capital investment, which will help reduce regulatory lag. We also made GRIP filings in our Texas jurisdictions during the first quarter, seeking a combined annual increase in rates of $10 million in 2 of those jurisdictions. Additionally, we plan to file rate cases in Minnesota during the third quarter and in Arkansas during the fourth quarter. A majority of the increases will be reflected in 2016 results, and we will update you on the specifics later in the year.
As noted on Slide 12, Act 725 was recently passed by the Arkansas legislature, and we believe this new law will benefit our Utility Operations in future years. We have worked closely with the Arkansas PUC and its staff over the years in utilizing multiple alternative rate mechanisms. Act 725 allows a utility to move away from filing multiple annual mechanisms to requesting a comprehensive formula rate plan that includes a forward test year, with annual true-up of rates around a banded ROE. We view this regulatory options as positive, with the potential to reduce regulatory lag in Arkansas and recover capital investment in a more timely manner. 
Turning to our nonregulated Energy Services business. The first quarter's results include a $4 million mark-to-market loss compared with a $4 million gain the previous year. The remaining decrease was margin-related, resulting primarily from reduced weather-related optimization opportunities compared the first quarter of 2014. Our Energy Services business continued to grow its retail customers at a solid place, adding over 800 commercial and industrial customers, or a 5% increase over last year. 
This was a solid quarter despite the impact of quarter-over-quarter weather variances, and again, consistent with our expectations. We continue to focus on delivering safe and reliable natural gas as well as creating first-rate customer experiences by providing customers with more choices and customized services.
I'll now turn the call over to Bill Rogers, who will cover financial activities."
279513,290854287,811143,"CenterPoint Energy, Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, May 11, 2015",2015-05-11,"Earnings Calls","CenterPoint Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Joe, and good morning to everyone. I have a few topics to review this morning and will start by discussing the quarter-over-quarter earnings drivers, some of which Tracy and Joe addressed. As Scott mentioned earlier, and as Slide 14 shows, ou",843,"Thank you, Joe, and good morning to everyone. I have a few topics to review this morning and will start by discussing the quarter-over-quarter earnings drivers, some of which Tracy and Joe addressed. 
As Scott mentioned earlier, and as Slide 14 shows, our earnings per share on a guidance basis was $0.30 in the first quarter of 2015 compared with $0.40 per share earned in the 2014 quarter. As a reminder, our EPS on a guidance basis excludes impacts of items such as mark-to-market adjustments at our Energy Services business and our ZENS securities and related reference shares. At Midstream Investments, lower equity income from Enable impacted EPS by $0.05 per diluted share. At the Utility Operations level, we have provided 2 waterfall charts to help illustrate our normalized operational performance on a quarter-to-quarter basis. The first of these charts is at the bottom of Page 14 and shows Utility Operations' first quarter 2014 EPS on a guidance basis of $0.27 per share. After normalizing $0.05 to exclude the benefit of colder weather and $0.01 associated with 2014's higher equity return, primarily associated with Houston Electric's true-up proceeds, we arrive at a 2014 first quarter Utility Operations baseline of $0.21 per diluted share. These adjustments are consistent with the baseline adjustments we highlighted for you in our 2014 year-end call when we provided our 2014 full year Utility Operations baseline of $0.70. This is the baseline from which we feel operational performance should be measured.
Turning to Slide 15. This second chart takes you from the first quarter 2014 Utility Operations baseline of $0.21 to the first quarter 2015 Utility Operations of $0.22. As you can see, strong customer growth and rate relief benefited the quarter by $0.03 per diluted share. These benefits were partially offset by $0.01 of higher interest expense and another $0.01 of a number of factors, such as higher depreciation expense, lower right-of-way revenue and higher O&M. These drivers resulted in 2015 first quarter Utility Operations EPS on a guidance basis of $0.22 per diluted share. This 4.8% growth rate from our 2014 first quarter baseline of $0.21 is in line with our 2015 guidance and our longer-term EPS growth rate of 4% to 6%.
Turning to O&M. CenterPoint's total O&M, excluding expenses that have corresponding revenue offset, such as TCOS, was up just under 2% on a quarter-to-quarter basis. This increase in O&M expense is primarily due to higher labor costs, including benefits. We are committed to looking for further opportunities to optimize our operating cost structure. 
Now turning to cash flow. During the quarter, we posted strong cash flows from operating activities, including $165 million from a retroactive bonus depreciation [ph] and $72 million in distributions received from Enable. Further, with respect to cash distributions from Enable, the Enable Board of Directors declared on April 24 a quarterly cash distribution, of which we expect to receive approximately $73 million. This represents a 1.2% increase over the prior quarter distribution and, if annualized, is consistent with the midpoint of Enable's 2015 forecast of 3% to 7% distribution growth. 
Our $1.5 billion capital plan for 2015 is on track. Through the end of the first quarter, we have invested $309 million. As described in our 2014 Form 10-K, we plan to invest $7.4 billion over the next 5 years. As we consider how to finance this capital plan, we are continually looking for opportunities to optimize our capital structure through our debt and equity capital formation activities, and we are diligent in considering if and when equity is appropriate. We have strong financial liquidity at the company and plan to use our existing debt capacity to source the majority of our financing needs. As we do this, we will be attentive to debt refinancing opportunities to further reduce our interest expense as well as to maintain our regulatory capital structures and our solid investment-grade credit ratings.
Additionally, as we shared on our February earnings call, we are not planning a secondary offering of common equity over the next 5 years. However, if appropriate, we may consider issuing original issue shares through our benefits and Investor's Choice Plans. Based on CenterPoint's results and the most recent public forecast made by Enable, we reaffirm our 2015 consolidated earnings estimates of $1 to $1.10 per diluted share. We reaffirm the component parts of that, with the Utility Operations of $0.71 to $0.75 and the Midstream Investments of $0.29 to $0.35. This guidance assumes a consolidated effective tax rate of approximately 37% and an average share count of 431 million shares. 
Before I turn the call back over to Carla, I would like to remind you of the $0.2475 per share quarterly dividend declared by our Board of Directors on April 23. We believe that the strength of our balance sheet, coupled with strong earnings and cash flow, support our dividend under a wide variety of circumstances.

In conjunction with the call today, we will be using slides which can be found under the Investors section of our website, centerpointenergy.com. For a reconciliation of the earnings guidance provided in today's call, please refer to our earnings press release, along with our Form 10-Q, which have been posted on our website. Please note that we may announce material information using SEC filings, press releases, public conference calls, webcasts and posts to the Investors section of our website. In the future, we will continue to use these channels to communicate important information about the company, key personnel, corporate initiatives, regulatory updates and other matters. We encourage investors, the media, our customers, business partners and other interested parties in our company to review the information we post on our website. 
Today, management is going to discuss certain topics that will contain projections and forward-looking information that are based on management's beliefs, assumptions and information currently available to management. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks or uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially based upon factors including weather variations, regulatory actions, economic conditions, commodity prices, changes in our service territories and other risk factors noted in our SEC filings. We will also discuss our guidance for 2015. The Utility Operations guidance range considers performance to date and certain significant variables that may impact earnings, such as weather, regulatory and judicial proceedings, volumes, commodity prices, ancillary services, tax rates, interest rates and financing activities. In providing this guidance, the company does not include other potential impacts, such as changes in accounting standards, the value of ZENS securities and the related stocks or the timing effects of mark-to-market and inventory. 
In providing Midstream Investments guidance, the company takes into account such factors as Enable's most recent public forecast, effective tax rates, the amortization of our basis difference (sic) [differential] in Enable and other factors. The company does not include other potential impacts such as the impact of any changes in accounting standards or Enable's unusual items. 
Before Scott begins, I'd like to mention that this call is being recorded. Information on how to access the replay can be found on our website. And with that, I will now turn the call over to Scott."

I will start with Slide 4. This morning, we reported first quarter 2015 earnings of $131 million or $0.30 per diluted share compared with $185 million or $0.43 per diluted share in 2014. Using the same basis that we use when providing guidance, first quarter 2015 adjusted earnings would've also been $0.30 per diluted share compared to $0.40 for 2014. On a guidance basis, Utility Operations contributed $0.22 per diluted share, and Midstream Investments contributed $0.08. Compared to baseline earnings of $0.21 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2014, which Bill will discuss in more detail, Utility Operations earnings are up 4.8%. This is consistent with the Utility EPS guidance provided earlier this year. Our Utility Operations continue to perform well, supported by growing service territories, robust capital investment, constructive regulatory environments and limited business risk. These dynamics allow Utility Operations to be the ballast of our diversified portfolio and will help to continue to provide earnings growth. Weather-related impacts across all of our businesses caused most of the variability this quarter. Tracy, Joe and Bill will share more details about this and other drivers for the quarter. 
Despite the challenges that midstream companies have recently experienced due to lower energy commodity prices, we continue to see opportunity in this space and believe that Enable Midstream Partners is well positioned to succeed. Drilling technology has fundamentally changed the landscape of the energy market as well as the role the United States plays in the global energy and feedstock market. We believe domestic and global demand, coupled with continued progress towards greater energy independence, will require significant capital investment in infrastructure. Enable remains well positioned to participate in this infrastructure build-out, as evidenced by their recent completion of the Bradley Processing Plant in the SCOOP as well as the Bear Den Crude & Produced Water Gathering System in the Bakken. Last week, Enable announced their acquisition of Monarch Natural Gas gathering assets in the Cleveland Sands Play and has stated it is immediately accretive. 
Early indications show that the Houston economy remains strong, despite press coverage regarding recently announced layoffs in the energy sector. Houston Electric's meter count increased by more than 11,000 in the first quarter, which equates to an annualized growth rate of 2%. This is consistent with employment and other economic data we are seeing. According to the greater Houston partnership, last year, the Houston metro area led the nation by adding a record-setting 157,000 residents between July of 2013 and July of 2014. The partnership forecasts the addition of 120,000 new residents in 2015. 
Our projected capital spending remains on target for the year at $1.5 billion, a 9% increase over 2014. We continue to utilize timely recovery mechanisms as well as rate case proceedings to help ensure effective and timely return on our investment. Tracy and Joe will provide additional color on a number of these. 
Before I wrap up, let me note that CenterPoint continues to be recognized for its strong customer service. We were recently ranked first in the Midwest region and second in the South region among the largest natural gas utilities in the U.S. for operational satisfaction in a 2014 Cogent report conducted by Market Strategies International. This report evaluated residential brand trust and engagement, and the results reinforce our ongoing strategy to utilize technology to improve the customer experience. We continue to focus on safe, reliable and efficient operations, coupled with improved services for our customers as our path to success and value creation for our shareholders. 
I will now ask Tracy to discuss Electric operations."
279513,290854287,831887,"CenterPoint Energy, Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, May 11, 2015",2015-05-11,"Earnings Calls","CenterPoint Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Scott. Houston Electric had a solid quarter, consistent with our expectations. First quarter 2015 core operating income was $68 million compared with $75 million for the same period last year. The business benefited from higher net transmission",704,"Thank you, Scott. Houston Electric had a solid quarter, consistent with our expectations. First quarter 2015 core operating income was $68 million compared with $75 million for the same period last year. The business benefited from higher net transmission-related revenue and strong customer growth. These benefits were more than offset by the impacts of milder weather; reduced equity return, primarily related to true-up proceeds; and lower right-of-way revenue. Importantly, growth continues to be strong. Houston Electric added more than 11,000 metered customers during the first quarter of 2015, and if annualized, this represents 2% meter growth. 
On Page 6, we show a chart contrasting oil prices, employment and residential metered customers in the Houston area since 1980. This chart shows steady customer growth, despite large swings in oil prices and smaller variations in employment. We believe long-term annual customer growth of 2% will be supported by Houston's diversified economy and culture as well as mild winters and a low cost of living. Houston Electric continues to focus on O&M expenses management, even as we address customer growth and robust capital spending. During the first quarter of 2015, Houston Electric's O&M increased less than 2% versus the first quarter of 2014. This growth rate excludes certain expenses which have revenue offsets. 
Next, I will update you on our 345 KV transmission project, which we call the Brazos Valley Connection, detailed on Slide 7. On April 24, we filed an application for a Certificate of Convenience and Necessity with the Public Utility Commission of Texas. We estimate the total project cost will be between $276 million and $383 million, depending on the route approved by the PUC. We expect the PUC will issue a final order in the fourth quarter addressing all issues, including which route should be used. Upon final approval, we will begin construction and anticipate completing the project no later than mid-2018. The new Import Project will improve the capacity of the Texas electric grid, strengthen regional transmission capabilities and help support growing demand in the greater Houston area. 
Turning to capital cost recovery mechanisms. Our transmission capital costs are recovered via Transmission Cost of Service, or TCOS, filings. The rate adjustment from our fourth quarter 2014 TCOS filing, totaling over $23 million annually, went into effect on February 25. We anticipate making the 2 allowed TCOS filings this year. For distribution capital cost recovery, you will see on Slide 8 that we filed on April 6 to increase rates by $16.7 million annually using, for the first time, the Distribution Cost Recovery Factor mechanism, or DCRF. We expect the decision in July and have requested that rates become effective on September 1. I would also like to note that legislative authority for the DCRF mechanism currently sunsets on January 1, 2017 and, as a result, we have been working to get the legislation extended. The DCRF sunset extension bills, which move the sunset to September 1, 2019, have successfully passed through the Texas House and Senate, and we anticipate enactment by the end of the second quarter.
I will conclude by highlighting our successful Smart Meter deployment and ongoing Intelligent Grid implementation referenced on Slide 9. In addition to reducing costs, these projects deliver additional reliability and efficiency benefits, provide enhanced customer functionality and help the environment. As a result of the Smart Meter project, our customers have saved over $23 million per year in service fees. Additionally, a residential customer surcharge covering part of the cost of the Smart Meter project will end this month, reducing overall customer rates, which are already among the most competitive in the nation. Further, since the beginning of this project, we have saved more than 1 million gallons of fuel, avoided 9,300 metric tons of CO2 and restored power to nearly 1.2 million customers without a phone call. CenterPoint is at the forefront of the industry in this area, and we are proud of our environmental contributions and our ability to manage expenses through the use of this technology. I am pleased with Houston Electric's first quarter performance. Growth remains strong, and we will continue to focus on delivering safe, reliable and efficient service. 
Joe will now update you on the results for Gas operations."
279513,290854287,831887,"CenterPoint Energy, Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, May 11, 2015",2015-05-11,"Earnings Calls","CenterPoint Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Tracy. Our natural gas operations, which includes both our gas utilities and our nonregulated Energy Services business, also had a solid quarter, in line with our expectations. Natural gas utilities first quarter 2015 operating income was $146",784,"Thank you, Tracy. Our natural gas operations, which includes both our gas utilities and our nonregulated Energy Services business, also had a solid quarter, in line with our expectations. Natural gas utilities first quarter 2015 operating income was $146 million compared with $162 million for the same period last year, while Energy Services reported operating income of $13 million this quarter compared with $26 million last year. During the quarter, our natural gas utilities business continued to benefit from rate relief and customer growth. Robust economies in our service territories led to the addition of approximately 37,000 new customers year-over-year, and we are on track for continuing our 1% growth in 2015. We were also successful in controlling O&M expenses. These benefits were more than offset by a decrease in usage related to less extreme weather in 2015 compared to 2014, higher depreciation and amortization and higher property taxes. 
Although heating degree days were higher than normal across our service territories, they were significantly lower than the first quarter of last year. As a reminder, since 2007, we have hedged winter weather at our LDCs in those jurisdictions where we do not have weather normalization adjustments. Normally, the hedges mitigate significant year-over-year fluctuations. However, weather in the first quarter of 2014 was so cold, we exceeded the cap on that hedge by the end of January 2014. As a result, we were unhedged in February and March of 2014 and booked significant income from weather-related usage in those 2 months. This variance alone accounted for $9 million of the operating income decline in the first quarter of 2015. Additionally, the capital investments we're making to meet growth and ensure system reliability and safety have increased depreciation and amortization expenses. These higher D&A expenses will be recovered through rate recovery mechanisms and rate cases. In addition, operating income was reduced $3 million in the first quarter of '15 as compared to the same quarter in 2014 due to a change in a customer charge in our last Minnesota rate case. This reduction is primarily timing-related and will reverse in subsequent quarters, as the higher customer charge has the effect of smoothing revenues throughout the year. 
As indicated on Slide 11, we have made and will make several important regulatory filings in 2015. These filings represent a combination of rate cases and annual recovery mechanisms and are intended to compensate us for the substantial investment made to better serve our growing customer base. We filed a Texas Coast rate case in late March, seeking a nearly $7 million increase. We expect the Texas Railroad Commission will issue a final order in the fourth quarter of this year. Once the Texas Coast case is finalized, we expect to utilize GRIP, the annual infrastructure recovery mechanism, to recover future incremental capital investment, which will help reduce regulatory lag. We also made GRIP filings in our Texas jurisdictions during the first quarter, seeking a combined annual increase in rates of $10 million in 2 of those jurisdictions. Additionally, we plan to file rate cases in Minnesota during the third quarter and in Arkansas during the fourth quarter. A majority of the increases will be reflected in 2016 results, and we will update you on the specifics later in the year.
As noted on Slide 12, Act 725 was recently passed by the Arkansas legislature, and we believe this new law will benefit our Utility Operations in future years. We have worked closely with the Arkansas PUC and its staff over the years in utilizing multiple alternative rate mechanisms. Act 725 allows a utility to move away from filing multiple annual mechanisms to requesting a comprehensive formula rate plan that includes a forward test year, with annual true-up of rates around a banded ROE. We view this regulatory options as positive, with the potential to reduce regulatory lag in Arkansas and recover capital investment in a more timely manner. 
Turning to our nonregulated Energy Services business. The first quarter's results include a $4 million mark-to-market loss compared with a $4 million gain the previous year. The remaining decrease was margin-related, resulting primarily from reduced weather-related optimization opportunities compared the first quarter of 2014. Our Energy Services business continued to grow its retail customers at a solid pace, adding over 800 commercial and industrial customers, or a 5% increase over last year. 
This was a solid quarter despite the impact of quarter-over-quarter weather variances, and again, consistent with our expectations. We continue to focus on delivering safe and reliable natural gas as well as creating first-rate customer experiences by providing customers with more choices and customized services.
I'll now turn the call over to Bill Rogers, who will cover financial activities."
279513,290854287,831887,"CenterPoint Energy, Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, May 11, 2015",2015-05-11,"Earnings Calls","CenterPoint Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Joe, and good morning to everyone. I have a few topics to review this morning and will start by discussing the quarter-over-quarter earnings drivers, some of which Tracy and Joe addressed. As Scott mentioned earlier, and as Slide 14 shows, ou",843,"Thank you, Joe, and good morning to everyone. I have a few topics to review this morning and will start by discussing the quarter-over-quarter earnings drivers, some of which Tracy and Joe addressed. 
As Scott mentioned earlier, and as Slide 14 shows, our earnings per share on a guidance basis was $0.30 in the first quarter of 2015 compared with $0.40 per share earned in the 2014 quarter. As a reminder, our EPS on a guidance basis excludes impacts of items such as mark-to-market adjustments at our Energy Services business and our ZENS securities and related reference shares. At Midstream Investments, lower equity income from Enable impacted EPS by $0.05 per diluted share. At the Utility Operations level, we have provided 2 waterfall charts to help illustrate our normalized operational performance on a quarter-to-quarter basis. The first of these charts is at the bottom of Page 14 and shows Utility Operations' first quarter 2014 EPS on a guidance basis of $0.27 per share. After normalizing $0.05 to exclude the benefit of colder weather and $0.01 associated with 2014's higher equity return, primarily associated with Houston Electric's true-up proceeds, we arrive at a 2014 first quarter Utility Operations baseline of $0.21 per diluted share. These adjustments are consistent with the baseline adjustments we highlighted for you in our 2014 year-end call when we provided our 2014 full year Utility Operations baseline of $0.70. This is the baseline from which we feel operational performance should be measured.
Turning to Slide 15. This second chart takes you from the first quarter 2014 Utility Operations baseline of $0.21 to the first quarter 2015 Utility Operations of $0.22. As you can see, strong customer growth and rate relief benefited the quarter by $0.03 per diluted share. These benefits were partially offset by $0.01 of higher interest expense and another $0.01 of a number of factors, such as higher depreciation expense, lower right-of-way revenue and higher O&M. These drivers resulted in 2015 first quarter Utility Operations EPS on a guidance basis of $0.22 per diluted share. This 4.8% growth rate from our 2014 first quarter baseline of $0.21 is in line with our 2015 guidance and our longer-term EPS growth rate of 4% to 6%.
Turning to O&M. CenterPoint's total O&M, excluding expenses that have corresponding revenue offset, such as TCOS, was up just under 2% on a quarter-to-quarter basis. This increase in O&M expense is primarily due to higher labor costs, including benefits. We are committed to looking for further opportunities to optimize our operating cost structure. 
Now turning to cash flow. During the quarter, we posted strong cash flows from operating activities, including $165 million from a retroactive bonus depreciation [ph] and $72 million in distributions received from Enable. Further, with respect to cash distributions from Enable, the Enable Board of Directors declared on April 24 a quarterly cash distribution, of which we expect to receive approximately $73 million. This represents a 1.2% increase over the prior quarter distribution and, if annualized, is consistent with the midpoint of Enable's 2015 forecast of 3% to 7% distribution growth. 
Our $1.5 billion capital plan for 2015 is on track. Through the end of the first quarter, we have invested $309 million. As described in our 2014 Form 10-K, we plan to invest $7.4 billion over the next 5 years. As we consider how to finance this capital plan, we are continually looking for opportunities to optimize our capital structure through our debt and equity capital formation activities, and we are diligent in considering if and when equity is appropriate. We have strong financial liquidity at the company and plan to use our existing debt capacity to source the majority of our financing needs. As we do this, we will be attentive to debt refinancing opportunities to further reduce our interest expense as well as to maintain our regulatory capital structures and our solid investment-grade credit ratings.
Additionally, as we shared on our February earnings call, we are not planning a secondary offering of common equity over the next 5 years. However, if appropriate, we may consider issuing original issue shares through our benefits and Investor's Choice Plans. Based on CenterPoint's results and the most recent public forecast made by Enable, we reaffirm our 2015 consolidated earnings estimates of $1 to $1.10 per diluted share. We reaffirm the component parts of that, with the Utility Operations of $0.71 to $0.75 and the Midstream Investments of $0.29 to $0.35. This guidance assumes a consolidated effective tax rate of approximately 37% and an average share count of 431 million shares. 
Before I turn the call back over to Carla, I would like to remind you of the $0.2475 per share quarterly dividend declared by our Board of Directors on April 23. We believe that the strength of our balance sheet, coupled with strong earnings and cash flow, support our dividend under a wide variety of circumstances.

We've completed our Smart Meter deployment of 2.3 million meters in 2012, and we're in the process of deploying our Intelligent Grid. That automates what were previously very manually intensive processes. So that definitely helps us convert manual expense-driven things into capital-driven things. And also customer service on the electric side. The best example we have there is Power Alert Service. We have 400,000 of our 2.3 million customers enrolled in this voluntary program. And it allows us to proactively send them messages on what we know, when we know it so that they don't have to call us. And if they don't have to call us, we don't have to have as much customer service expense, and customer satisfaction increases. So discipline, efficiency, substituting capital for expense, those are all themes that we continue to drive."

Thank you for joining us today, and thank you for your interest in CenterPoint Energy.

Thank you for joining us today, and thank you for your interest in CenterPoint Energy. This morning, as noted on Slide 4, we reported second quarter 2015 earnings of $77 million or $0.18 per diluted share compared with $107 million or $0.25 per diluted share in the same quarter of last year. Using the same basis that we used when providing guidance, second quarter 2015 adjusted earnings would've been $0.19 per diluted share compared with $0.21 for 2014. 
On a guidance basis, Utility Operations contributed $0.13 per diluted share versus $0.10 in 2014. Midstream Investments contributed $0.06 per diluted share compared to $0.11 in 2014. Though we'll discuss these results in more detail later on the call. Our Utility Operations continue to perform well. We have added over 85,000 metered customers during the last 12 months. Growth, along with system improvements, remain key drivers behind our robust capital spending. We are carefully managing cost as O&M expenses, net of revenue offsets, are up 1% versus the second quarter of 2014. We continue to execute our regulatory strategy, filing rate increases and annual recovery mechanisms as needed in pursuit of earning our allowed returns. Our growing service territories and capital plan, coupled with constructive regulatory environments and disciplined O&M spending continues to support strong performance by our Utility Operations. Next, let me turn to Enable midstream, which we highlight on Slide 5. 
As many of you know, Enable recently shared it's growth outlook of 3% to 7% per unit annual distribution growth in 2016 and 2017. This includes the forecast for high-single-digit growth in natural gas gathering volumes, 25% growth in natural gas processing volumes and a doubling of crude oil gathering volumes. As Enable set on their earnings call, they are well positioned for growth with assets and some of the best shale plays, including the SCOOP, the Stack, Canyon Woodford and Cleveland Sands Plays. Enable has connected more well year-to-date through July of 2015 than year-to-date through July of 2014. For 2016 and 2017 combined, Enable's expansion capital outlook ranges from $1.6 billion to $2.5 billion. We continue to believe in the value of our Enable Midstream investment and remain focused on providing governance in support of enhancing Enable's performance. 
Overall, I'm pleased with our second quarter results. Utility Operations experienced strong ongoing growth and Enable performed as anticipated in a challenging commodity market. Today, we are updating our dialogue regarding how we think about returning capital to our investors. After consideration of the current market environment, input from the investment community and discussions with our board, we believe an earnings-based approach to our dividend practice will help provide clarity, simplicity and consistency. Our objective will simply be to grow our dividend in line with our consolidated earnings growth, which Bill will discuss in more detail later on the call. I want to express my appreciation to our employees who, after a series of severe storms in April, May and June, worked countless hours to restore power safely and efficiently. You may have seen some of the images of flooding in Houston on national news. More than 25 inches of rain fell over 2 concentrated periods of time and our collective utility systems performed well. The gas system was essentially not impacted by the rains and the customer effects of outages on our electric system were reduced by distribution automation. Proactive communications to those customers enrolled in our new Power Alert Service provided them with timely outage and restoration information. I'm extremely proud of our employees and their commitment to ensuring that every day, our customers receive energy from safe, reliable energy delivery systems. I will now ask Tracy and Joe to discuss quarter-over-quarter operating income, as well as provide updates on their respective businesses. Bill will follow by bridging operating income to EPS and contrasting our performance with the last year's baseline number. Tracy?"

As you can see on Slide 8, second quarter 2015 core operating income was $131 million compared with $115 million for the same period last year. The business benefited",637,"Thank you, Scott. Houston Electric had a solid quarter consistent with our expectations. As you can see on Slide 8, second quarter 2015 core operating income was $131 million compared with $115 million for the same period last year. The business benefited from higher net transmission-related revenue, continued strong customer growth and a return to more normal weather. These benefits were partially offset by an expected reduction in the equity return primarily related to true-up proceeds. Houston Electric customer growth remains strong. Through the first half of the year, we have added nearly 23,000 metered customers, which equates to an annualized growth rate of 2%. As we have mentioned in the past, our forecasted 2% customer growth equates to approximately $25 million to $30 million of incremental revenue annually. Houston's 4.5% unemployment rate in June remains below the national average of 5.3% and our housing market remains tight at 3 months supply versus a balance supply of 6 months. 
As the chart on Slide 9 shows, employment growth may slow at times, but over the past 24 years, a residential customer compound annual growth rate has slightly exceeded 2%. Houston Electric continues to manage cost effectively. During the second quarter of 2015, O&M expenses increased approximately 2% over the second quarter of 2014. This growth rate excludes certain expenses that have revenue offsets. We will strive to continue operating the business as efficiently as possible, while maintaining a safe and reliable system to serve our growing customer base. 
As you will see on Slide 10, we've had a busy quarter on the regulatory front, and we are pleased with the results. During the quarter, we filed our first Distribution Costs Recovery Factor filing, or DCRF, which allows for rate adjustments associated with recovery of distribution capital invested since our last general rate case. A settlement was reached and approved for an annual revenue increase of $13 million, which will go into effect on September 1. Additionally, in December -- excuse me, additionally, in June, the DCRF sunset extension legislation was enacted, which extends the mechanisms sunset until September of 2019, allowing us to utilize the mechanism up to 3 additional times before a general rate case is required. We also filed 2 other cost recovery mechanisms, which include our first of 2 planned transmission cost of service or TCOS filings this year and our annual energy efficiency cost recovery factor filing. Our TCOS filing was submitted on June 26 and seeks an annual revenue increase of $13.7 million. We anticipated a decision on this filing during the third quarter of this year. Our energy efficiency cost recovery factor filing seeks to recover next year's estimated expenses associated with our energy efficiency program, as well as a $7 million incentive related to the program's performance in 2014. Finally, in April, we filed an application for a Certificate of Convenience and Necessity for our Brazos Valley connection transmission line. This transmission line is the largest capital project in our 5-year plan. 32 alternative routes were submitted to the PUC and the final route they select will determine the estimated capital cost of the project. We anticipate a commission decision in both the route of and need for the transmission line during the first quarter of 2015 with construction of the project being completed by mid-2018. The critical status granted to this project highlights the low growth in our service territory -- excuse me, highlights the low growth our service territory is experiencing. As an example of that low growth, during the last week in July, Houston Electric hit 4 consecutive July peak loads. I am pleased with Houston Electric second quarter performance. Growth remains strong and we will continue to focus on delivering safe, reliable and efficient service. Joe will now update you on the results for gas operations."
279513,306140657,854761,"CenterPoint Energy, Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Aug 10, 2015",2015-08-10,"Earnings Calls","CenterPoint Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Tracey. Our natural gas operations, which includes both our gas utilities and our nonregulated energy services business, performed in line with our expectations during the second quarter as more normal weather return to all our jurisdictions. A",655,"Thank you, Tracey. Our natural gas operations, which includes both our gas utilities and our nonregulated energy services business, performed in line with our expectations during the second quarter as more normal weather return to all our jurisdictions. As you can see on Slide 12, natural gas utility second quarter 2015 operating income was $19 million compared with $30 million for the same period last year. This decline is attributable to return to more normal weather, in addition to higher depreciation expense. As I mentioned, on the first quarter call, we exceeded our weather-hedged cap in January of 2014 and benefited from the subsequent extreme cold weather and persisted well into April and May that year, particularly in Minnesota. As a result, our natural gas utilities experienced a decline in operating income in the first half of this year, but we expect year-over-year improvements in operating income through the remainder of the year. Economist continue to be strong in our service territories, and we added approximately 36,000 new customers year-over-year. Excluding expenses that have a revenue offset, we are successful in managing O&M expenses to an increase of under 1% compared to the second quarter of last year. 
Moving on to Slide 13, I would like to highlight a number of items that advance our long-term strategy, specifically regulatory developments in capital investments to meet growth needs and ensure system reliability and safety. Recent regulatory filings represent a combination of rate cases and the annual recovery mechanisms, which are intended to help recover the substantial investments we've made to better serve our growing customer base. On August 3, we filed a general rate case in Minnesota to increase overall rates by $54 million annually. Our filing is based on a forward test year and a rate base of $913 million, which reflects the significant capital expenditures we're making across our Minnesota service territory. We have requested an ROE of 10.3% and a 53% equity capital structure. Interim rates are expected to go into effect in October with a final decision around mid-2016. We reached a settlement agreement in our Texas Coast rate case and are awaiting approval by the Texas Railroad Commission. The settlement provides a $4.9 million annual increase and a 10% ROE. With the Texas Coast case finalized, we expect to utilize GRIP, the annual infrastructure recovery mechanism as early as March 2016 to recover incremental capital investment. In Arkansas, we continue to anticipate filing rate case in the fourth quarter of 2015 and our evaluating for the case possible usage of Act 725, Arkansas' recently enacted law related to formally rate plans. 
Slide 14 highlights the portion of our capital spending in Minnesota. Our beltline replacement project began in 2012 and is expected to be completed in 2023. This project is replacing pipe those put in service over 60 years ago and Intel's replacing bare steel pipe, upgrading protection systems and installing remote control valves. Investing capital to improve safety and reliability, while reducing O&M, is a win for all our stakeholders. 
I'll next turn to Slide 15 in our Energy Services business, which primarily provides competitive natural gas supply services to commercial, industrial, institutional and transportation customers. This business in second quarter results reflect another solid performance. Operating income was $7 million for the second quarter of 2015 compared with $5 million for the same period of 2014, excluding mark-to-market gains of $2 million and $6 million, respectively. Volumes were nearly flat as economic growth in certain regions has slowed somewhat, but overall customer account increased 1.8% year-over-year. Additionally, O&M expenses were slightly lower consistent with the company's focus on holding down operating costs. This was a solid quarter for natural gas operations despite the impact of a return to more normal weather. And the regulatory filings I discussed should position us well to continue growing this business. I'll now turn the call over to Bill who will cover financial activities."
279513,306140657,854761,"CenterPoint Energy, Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Aug 10, 2015",2015-08-10,"Earnings Calls","CenterPoint Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Joe, and good morning to everyone. Tracy and Joe have reviewed their respective operating income on a quarter-to-quarter basis. I will now provide a review of our earnings per share on a guidance basis. Following that, I will review Utility Ope",863,"Thank you, Joe, and good morning to everyone. Tracy and Joe have reviewed their respective operating income on a quarter-to-quarter basis. I will now provide a review of our earnings per share on a guidance basis. Following that, I will review Utility Operations for the second quarter of 2015 versus the baseline for second quarter 2014 with the focus on those items that are below the operating income line. Our earnings per share on a guidance basis were $0.19 in the second quarter of 2015 compared with $0.21 for the second quarter of 2014. As a reminder, our EPS on a guidance basis excludes the impacts of items such as mark-to-market adjustments at our Energy Services business and our ZENS securities and related reference shares. At Midstream Investments, as previously mentioned by Scott, lower equity income from Enable Midstream Partners impacted EPS at Centerpoint by $0.05 per diluted share. 
For Utility Operations, we have provided 2 waterfall charts to help illustrate our normalized operational performance quarter-over-quarter. The first of these charts is on Page 17 and shows Utility Operations second quarter 2014 EPS on a guidance basis of $0.10 per diluted share. Houston Electric experienced cooler-than-normal weather in second quarter of 2014 therefore, we normalized up $0.01. We normalized down $0.01 to account for 2014's higher equity return, primarily associated with the timing issues around Houston Electric's equity true-up proceeds. As a result, we landed on a baseline of $0.10 per diluted share for second quarter 2014. This is the baseline from which we feel operational performance should be measured. These adjustments are consistent with the baseline adjustments we highlighted in our year-end 2014 call. We have included a slide from that call in the Appendix, along with the breakdown of adjustments by quarter. 
The second chart on Slide 18 takes you from the second quarter 2014 Utility Operations baseline of $0.10 to Utility Operations EPS on a guidance basis of $0.13 for this quarter. As Tracy and Joe discussed, their combined core operating income on a guidance basis improved from $150 million to $157 million in the quarter. This $7 million improvement, along with an increase of $4 million in other income, resulted in a favorable earnings per share of $0.02 for the quarter. Through that management, interest expense was flat on a period-to-period basis. For all of 2015, we expect interest experience to be lower when compared to all of 2014. We had a lower effective tax rate of 32% in the quarter. This was due to a lower Texas tax rate and to some, permanent differences. For the full year, we expect an effective tax rate of 35%. Altogether, the second quarter was stronger-than-anticipated for Utility Operations. 
Now with respect to earnings and dividends, you will see on Slide 19, we are targeting annual earnings per share growth of 4% to 6% on a guidance basis through 2018, inclusive of our midstream investments. We anticipate dividend growth will follow EPS growth. We do recognize that our overall payout ratio for 2015 will likely be above 90%. We are comfortable with that payout ratio and related earnings retention due to the sources of cash and earnings supporting the dividend. We anticipate the overall payout ratio will result in a retention of 30% to 40% of our Utility Operations earnings. These retained earnings support needed capital investment without having to consider a secondary offering of common equity. In addition to these considerations, our Board of Directors takes into account the current state of the Capital Markets, our financial liquidity, capital strength and our financial forecast when reviewing and declaring our dividends. 
On Slide 20, I'll review our anticipated financing plans for 2015 and 2016. As stated earlier, retaining 30% to 40% of our Utility Operations earnings will allow us to finance our investment and rate base with minimal need for additional equity. We have strong financial liquidity and plan to use our retained earnings and balance sheet strength to source much of our financing needs. This year, we expect to have incremental borrowings of $400 million. These increased borrowings are primarily through our commercial paper program. If appropriate, we will consider fixed rate longer-term maturity debt. 
Looking forward to 2016, we expect to have a similar incremental financing need as 2015. However, the ultimate amount will depend upon our capital investment, our ability to manage working capital and bonus depreciation amongst other factors. We expect to finance 2016 via fixed-rate debt and commercial paper borrowings. If appropriate, we may consider equity financing through limited use of our DRIP and benefit plans. 
Finally, based on our Utility Operations results and forecast and the most recent public outlook provided by Enable, CenterPoint is please to reaffirm our 2015 consolidated earnings estimates of $1 to $1.10 per diluted share.

We also have with us other members of management who may assist in answering questions following the prepared remarks.
In conjunction with the call today, we will be using slides, which can be found under the Investors section on our website, centerpointenergy.com. For a reconciliation of the earnings guidance provided in today's call, please refer to our earnings press release, which along with our Form 10-Q has been posted on our website. Please note that we may announce material information using SEC filings, press releases, public conference calls, webcasts and posts to the Investors section of our website. In the future, we will continue to use these channels to communicate important information and encourage you to review the information on our website. Today, management is going to discuss certain topics that will contain projections and forward-looking information that are based on management's beliefs, assumptions and information currently available to management. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks or uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially based upon factors, including weather variations, regulatory actions, economic conditions, commodity prices, changes in our service territories and other risk factors noted in our SEC filings. We will also discuss our guidance for 2015. The Utility Operations guidance range considers performance to date and certain significant variables that may impact earnings such as weather, regulatory and judicial proceedings, volumes, commodity prices, ancillary services, tax rates, interest rates and financing activities. In providing this guidance, the company does not include other potential impacts such as changes in accounting standards, the value of ZENS securities and the related stocks or the timing effects of mark-to-market and inventory. In providing Midstream Investments guidance, the company takes into account such factors as Enable's most recent public forecast, effective tax rate, the amortization of our basis difference in Enable and other factors. The company does not include other potential impacts such as the impact of any changes in accounting standards or Enable's unusual items. Before Scott begins, I would like to mention that this call is being recorded. Information on how to access that replay can be found on our website.

Thank you for joining us today, and thank you for your interest in CenterPoint Energy. This morning, as noted on Slide 4, we reported second quarter 2015 earnings of $77 million or $0.18 per diluted share compared with $107 million or $0.25 per diluted share in the same quarter of last year. Using the same basis that we used when providing guidance, second quarter 2015 adjusted earnings would've been $0.19 per diluted share compared with $0.21 for 2014. 
On a guidance basis, Utility Operations contributed $0.13 per diluted share versus $0.10 in 2014. Midstream Investments contributed $0.06 per diluted share compared to $0.11 in 2014. Bill will discuss these results in more detail later in the call. Our Utility Operations continue to perform well. We have added over 85,000 metered customers during the last 12 months. Growth, along with system improvements, remain key drivers behind our robust capital spending. We are carefully managing costs as O&M expenses, net of revenue offsets, are up 1% versus the second quarter of 2014. We continue to execute our regulatory strategy, filing rate increases and annual recovery mechanisms as needed in pursuit of earning our allowed returns. Our growing service territories and capital plan, coupled with constructive regulatory environments and disciplined O&M spending, continues support strong performance by our Utility Operations. Next, let me turn to Enable Midstream, which we highlight on Slide 5. 
As many of you know, Enable recently shared its growth outlook of 3% to 7% per unit annual distribution growth in 2016 and 2017. This includes the forecast for high-single-digit growth in natural gas gathering volumes, 25% growth in natural gas processing volumes and a doubling of crude oil gathering volumes. As Enable said on their earnings call, they are well-positioned for growth with assets in some of the best shale plays, including the SCOOP, the STACK, Cana Woodford and Cleveland Sands Plays. Enable has connected more wells year-to-date through July of 2015 than year-to-date through July of 2014. For 2016 and 2017 combined, Enable's expansion capital outlook ranges from $1.6 billion to $2.5 billion. We continue to believe in the value of our Enable Midstream investment and remain focused on providing governance in support of enhancing Enable's performance. 
Overall, I'm pleased with our second quarter results. Utility Operations experienced strong ongoing growth, and Enable performed as anticipated in a challenging commodity market. Today, we are updating our dialogue regarding how we think about returning capital to our investors. After consideration of the current market environment, input from the investment community and discussions with our board, we believe an earnings-based approach to our dividend practice will help provide clarity, simplicity and consistency. Our objective will simply be to grow our dividend in line with our consolidated earnings growth, which Bill will discuss in more detail later in the call. I want to express my appreciation to our employees, who after a series of severe storms in April, May and June, worked countless hours to restore power safely and efficiently. You may have seen some of the images of flooding in Houston on national news. More than 25 inches of rain fell over 2 concentrated periods of time, and our collective utility systems performed well. The gas system was essentially not impacted by the rains, and the customer effects of outages on our electric system were reduced by distribution automation. Proactive communications to those customers enrolled in our new Power Alert Service provided them with timely outage and restoration information. I'm extremely proud of our employees and their commitment to ensuring that every day our customers receive energy from safe, reliable energy delivery systems. I will now ask Tracy and Joe to discuss quarter-over-quarter operating income as well as provide updates on their respective businesses. Bill will follow by bridging operating income to EPS and contrasting our performance with last year's baseline number. Tracy?"

Houston Electric had a solid quarter, consistent with our expectations. As you can see on Slide 8, second quarter 2015 core operating income was $131 million compared with $115 million for the same period last year. The business benefited from higher net transmission-related revenue, continued strong customer growth and a return to more normal weather. These benefits were partially offset by an expected reduction in the equity return, primarily related to true-up proceeds. Houston Electric's customer growth remains strong. Through the first half of the year, we have added nearly 23,000 metered customers, which equates to an annualized growth rate of 2%. As we have mentioned in the past, our forecasted 2% customer growth equates to approximately $25 million to $30 million of incremental revenue annually. Houston's 4.5% unemployment rate in June remains below the national average of 5.3%, and our housing market remains tight at 3-month supply versus a balanced supply of 6 months. 
As the chart on Slide 9 shows, employment growth may slow at times, but over the past 24 years, a residential customer compound annual growth rate has slightly exceeded 2%. Houston Electric continues to manage costs effectively. During the second quarter of 2015, O&M expenses increased approximately 2% over the second quarter of 2014. This growth rate excludes certain expenses that have revenue offsets. We will strive to continue operating the business as efficiently as possible, while maintaining a safe and reliable system to serve our growing customer base. 
As you will see on Slide 10, we've had a busy quarter on the regulatory front, and we are pleased with the results. During the quarter, we filed our first Distribution Cost Recovery Factor filing, or DCRF, which allows for rate adjustments associated with recovery of distribution capital invested since our last general rate case. A settlement was reached and approved for an annual revenue increase of $13 million, which will go into effect on September 1. Additionally, in December -- excuse me, additionally, in June, the DCRF sunset extension legislation was enacted, which extends the mechanism sunset until September of 2019, allowing us to utilize the mechanism up to 3 additional times before a general rate case is required. We also filed 2 other cost recovery mechanisms, which include our first of 2 planned transmission cost of service, or TCOS filings, this year and our annual energy efficiency cost recovery factor filing. Our TCOS filing was submitted on June 26 and seeks an annual revenue increase of $13.7 million. We anticipate a decision on this filing during the third quarter of this year. Our energy efficiency cost recovery factor filing seeks to recover next year's estimated expenses associated with our energy efficiency program as well as a $7 million incentive related to the program's performance in 2014. Finally, in April, we filed an application for a Certificate of Convenience and Necessity for our Brazos Valley Connection transmission line. This transmission line is the largest capital project in our 5-year plan. 32 alternative routes were submitted to the PUC, and the final route they select will determine the estimated capital cost of the project. We anticipate a commission decision on both the route of and need for the transmission line during the fourth quarter of 2015 with construction of the project being completed by mid-2018. The critical status granted to this project highlights the low growth in our service territory -- excuse me, highlights the low growth our service territory is experiencing. As an example of that low growth, during the last week in July, Houston Electric hit 4 consecutive July peak loads. I am pleased with Houston Electric's second quarter performance. Growth remains strong, and we will continue to focus on delivering safe, reliable and efficient service. Joe will now update you on the results for gas operations."
279513,306140657,854999,"CenterPoint Energy, Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Aug 10, 2015",2015-08-10,"Earnings Calls","CenterPoint Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Tracy. Our natural gas operations, which includes both our gas utilities and our nonregulated energy services business, performed in line with our expectations during the second quarter as more normal weather return to all our jurisdictions. As",661,"Thank you, Tracy. Our natural gas operations, which includes both our gas utilities and our nonregulated energy services business, performed in line with our expectations during the second quarter as more normal weather return to all our jurisdictions. As you can see on Slide 12, natural gas utility second quarter 2015 operating income was $19 million compared with $30 million for the same period last year. This decline is attributable to return to more normal weather in addition to higher depreciation expense. As I mentioned, on the first quarter call, we exceeded our weather-hedged cap in January of 2014 and benefited from the subsequent extreme cold weather that persisted well into April and May that year, particularly in Minnesota. As a result, our natural gas utilities experienced a decline in operating income in the first half of this year, but we expect year-over-year improvements in operating income through the remainder of the year. The economies continue to be strong in our service territories, and we added approximately 36,000 new customers year-over-year. Excluding expenses that have a revenue offset, we are successful in managing O&M expenses to an increase of under 1% compared to the second quarter of last year. 
Moving on to Slide 13, I would like to highlight a number of items that advance our long-term strategy, specifically regulatory developments and capital investments to meet growth needs and ensure system reliability and safety. Recent regulatory filings represent a combination of rate cases and the annual recovery mechanisms, which are intended to help recover the substantial investments we made to better serve our growing customer base. On August 3, we filed a general rate case in Minnesota to increase overall rates by $54 million annually. Our filing is based on a forward test year and a rate base of $913 million, which reflects the significant capital expenditures we're making across our Minnesota service territory. We have requested an ROE of 10.3% and a 53% equity capital structure. Interim rates are expected to go into effect in October with a final decision around mid-2016. We reached a settlement agreement in our Texas Coast rate case and are awaiting approval by the Texas Railroad Commission. The settlement provides a $4.9 million annual increase and a 10% ROE. With the Texas Coast case finalized, we expect to utilize GRIP, the annual infrastructure recovery mechanism, as early as March 2016 to recover incremental capital investment. In Arkansas, we continue to anticipate filing a rate case in the fourth quarter of 2015 and are evaluating for the case possible usage of Act 725, Arkansas' recently enacted law related to formula rate plans. 
Slide 14 highlights the portion of our capital spending in Minnesota. Our Belt Line replacement project began in 2012 and is expected to be completed in 2023. This project is replacing pipe that was put in service over 60 years ago. And Intel's replacing bare steel pipe, upgrading cathodic protection systems and installing remote controlled valves. Investing capital to improve safety and reliability while reducing O&M is a win for all our stakeholders. 
I'll next turn to Slide 15 in our Energy Services business, which primarily provides competitive natural gas supply services to commercial, industrial, institutional and transportation customers. This business in the second quarter results reflect another solid performance. Operating income was $7 million for the second quarter of 2015 compared with $5 million for the same period of 2014, excluding mark-to-market gains of $2 million and $6 million, respectively. Volumes were nearly flat as economic growth in certain regions has slowed somewhat, but overall customer account increased 1.8% year-over-year. Additionally, O&M expenses were slightly lower, consistent with the company's focus on holding down operating costs. This was a solid quarter for natural gas operations despite the impact of a return to more normal weather. And the regulatory filings I discussed should position us well to continue growing this business. I'll now turn the call over to Bill, who will cover financial activities."
279513,306140657,854999,"CenterPoint Energy, Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Aug 10, 2015",2015-08-10,"Earnings Calls","CenterPoint Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Joe, and good morning to everyone. Tracy and Joe have reviewed their respective operating income on a quarter-to-quarter basis. I will now provide a review of our earnings per share on a guidance basis. Following that, I will review Utility Ope",866,"Thank you, Joe, and good morning to everyone. Tracy and Joe have reviewed their respective operating income on a quarter-to-quarter basis. I will now provide a review of our earnings per share on a guidance basis. Following that, I will review Utility Operations for the second quarter of 2015 versus the baseline for second quarter 2014 with a focus on those items that are below the operating income line. Our earnings per share on a guidance basis were $0.19 in the second quarter of 2015 compared with $0.21 for the second quarter of 2014. As a reminder, our EPS on a guidance basis excludes the impacts of items such as mark-to-market adjustments at our Energy Services business and our ZENS securities and related reference shares. At Midstream Investments, as previously mentioned by Scott, lower equity income from Enable Midstream Partners impacted EPS at CenterPoint by $0.05 per diluted share. 
For Utility Operations, we have provided 2 waterfall charts to help illustrate our normalized operational performance quarter-over-quarter. The first of these charts is on Page 17 and shows Utility Operations second quarter 2014 EPS on a guidance basis of $0.10 per diluted share. Houston Electric experienced cooler-than-normal weather in the second quarter of 2014. Therefore, we normalized up $0.01. We normalized down $0.01 to account for 2014's higher equity return, primarily associated with the timing issues around Houston Electric's equity true-up proceeds. As a result, we landed on a baseline of $0.10 per diluted share for second quarter 2014. This is the baseline from which we feel operational performance should be measured. These adjustments are consistent with the baseline adjustments we highlighted in our year-end 2014 call. We have included a slide from that call in the appendix along with the breakdown of adjustments by quarter. 
The second chart on Slide 18 takes you from the second quarter 2014 Utility Operations baseline of $0.10 to Utility Operations EPS on a guidance basis of $0.13 for this quarter. As Tracy and Joe discussed, their combined core operating income on a guidance basis improved from $150 million to $157 million in the quarter. This $7 million improvement, along with an increase of $4 million in other income, resulted in a favorable earnings per share of $0.02 for the quarter. Through that management, interest expense was flat on a period-to-period basis. For all of 2015, we expect interest expense to be lower when compared to all of 2014. We had a lower effective tax rate of 32% in the quarter. This was due to a lower Texas tax rate and to some, permanent differences. For the full year, we expect an effective tax rate of 35%. Altogether, the second quarter was stronger than anticipated for Utility Operations. 
Now with respect to earnings and dividends, you will see on Slide 19 we are targeting annual earnings per share growth of 4% to 6% on a guidance basis through 2018, inclusive of our midstream investments. We anticipate dividend growth will follow EPS growth. We do recognize that our overall payout ratio for 2015 will likely be above 90%. We are comfortable with that payout ratio and related earnings retention due to the sources of cash and earnings supporting the dividend. We anticipate the overall payout ratio will result in a retention of 30% to 40% of our Utility Operations earnings. These retained earnings support needed capital investment without having to consider a secondary offering of common equity. In addition to these considerations, our Board of Directors takes into account the current state of the capital markets, our financial liquidity, capital strength and our financial forecast when reviewing and declaring our dividends. 
On Slide 20, I'll review our anticipated financing plans for 2015 and 2016. As stated earlier, retaining 30% to 40% of our Utility Operations earnings will allow us to finance our investment and rate base with minimal need for additional equity. We have strong financial liquidity and plan to use our retained earnings and balance sheet strength to source much of our financing needs. This year, we expect to have incremental borrowings of $400 million. These increased borrowings are primarily through our commercial paper program. If appropriate, we will consider fixed rate longer-term maturity debt. 
Looking forward to 2016, we expect to have a similar incremental financing need as 2015. However, the ultimate amount will depend upon our capital investment, our ability to manage working capital and bonus depreciation amongst other factors. We expect to finance 2016 via fixed-rate debt and commercial paper borrowings. If appropriate, we may consider equity financing through limited use of our DRIP and benefit plans. 
Finally, based on our Utility Operations results and forecast and the most recent public outlook provided by Enable, CenterPoint is pleased to reaffirm our 2015 consolidated earnings estimate of $1 to $1.10 per diluted share. We believe Utility Operations will be on the high side of the $0.71 to $0.75 range, and Midstream Investments will be on the low side of the $0.29 to $0.35 range. As I conclude, I would like to remind you of the $24.75 per share quarterly dividend declared by our board on July 24. With that, I will now turn the call back over to David."

Thank you for joining us today, and thank you for your interest in CenterPoint Energy. This morning, as noted on Slide 4, we reported second quarter 2015 earnings of $77 million, or $0.18 per diluted share compared with $107 million or $0.25 per diluted share in the same quarter of last year. Using the same basis that we used when providing guidance, second quarter 2015 adjusted earnings would've been $0.19 per diluted share compared with $0.21 for 2014. 
On a guidance basis, Utility Operations contributed $0.13 per diluted share versus $0.10 in 2014. Midstream Investments contributed $0.06 per diluted share compared to $0.11 in 2014. Bill will discuss these results in more detail later in the call. Our Utility Operations continue to perform well. We have added over 85,000 metered customers during the last 12 months. Growth, along with system improvements, remain key drivers behind our robust capital spending. We are carefully managing costs as O&M expenses, net of revenue offsets, are up 1% versus the second quarter of 2014. We continue to execute our regulatory strategy, filing rate increases and annual recovery mechanisms as needed in pursuit of earning our allowed returns. Our growing service territories and capital plan, coupled with constructive regulatory environments and disciplined O&M spending, continues support strong performance by our Utility Operations. Next, let me turn to Enable Midstream, which we highlight on Slide 5. 
As many of you know, Enable recently shared its growth outlook of 3% to 7% per unit annual distribution growth in 2016 and 2017. This includes the forecast for high-single-digit growth in natural gas gathering volumes, 25% growth in natural gas processing volumes and a doubling of crude oil gathering volumes. As Enable said on their earnings call, they are well-positioned for growth with assets in some of the best shale plays, including the SCOOP, the STACK, Cana Woodford and Cleveland Sands Plays. Enable has connected more wells year-to-date through July of 2015 than year-to-date through July of 2014. For 2016 and 2017 combined, Enable's expansion capital outlook ranges from $1.6 billion to $2.5 billion. We continue to believe in the value of our Enable Midstream investment and remain focused on providing governance in support of enhancing Enable's performance. 
Overall, I'm pleased with our second quarter results. Utility Operations experienced strong ongoing growth, and Enable performed as anticipated in a challenging commodity market. Today, we are updating our dialogue regarding how we think about returning capital to our investors. After consideration of the current market environment, input from the investment community and discussions with our board, we believe an earnings-based approach to our dividend practice will help provide clarity, simplicity and consistency. Our objective will simply be to grow our dividend in line with our consolidated earnings growth, which Bill will discuss in more detail later in the call. I want to express my appreciation to our employees who, after a series of severe storms in April, May and June, worked countless hours to restore power safely and efficiently. You may have seen some of the images of flooding in Houston on national news. More than 25 inches of rain fell over 2 concentrated periods of time, and our collective utility systems performed well. The gas system was essentially not impacted by the rains, and the customer effects of outages on our electric system were reduced by distribution automation. Proactive communications to those customers enrolled in our new Power Alert Service provided them with timely outage and restoration information. I'm extremely proud of our employees and their commitment to ensuring that every day our customers receive energy from safe, reliable energy delivery systems. I will now ask Tracy and Joe to discuss quarter-over-quarter operating income as well as provide updates on their respective businesses. Bill will follow by bridging operating income to EPS and contrasting our performance with last year's baseline number. Tracy?"

As you can see on Slide 8, second quarter 2015 core operating income was $131 million compared with $115 million for the same period last year. The business benefite",634,"Thank you, Scott. Houston Electric had a solid quarter, consistent with our expectations. As you can see on Slide 8, second quarter 2015 core operating income was $131 million compared with $115 million for the same period last year. The business benefited from higher net transmission-related revenue, continued strong customer growth and a return to more normal weather. These benefits were partially offset by an expected reduction in the equity return, primarily related to true-up proceeds. Houston Electric's customer growth remains strong. Through the first half of the year, we have added nearly 23,000 metered customers, which equates to an annualized growth rate of 2%. As we have mentioned in the past, our forecasted 2% customer growth equates to approximately $25 million to $30 million of incremental revenue annually. Houston's 4.5% unemployment rate in June remains below the national average of 5.3%, and our housing market remains tight at 3-month supply versus a balanced supply of 6 months. 
As the chart on Slide 9 shows, employment growth may slow at times, but over the past 24 years, a residential customer compound annual growth rate has slightly exceeded 2%. Houston Electric continues to manage costs effectively. During the second quarter of 2015, O&M expenses increased approximately 2% over the second quarter of 2014. This growth rate excludes certain expenses that have revenue offsets. We will strive to continue operating the business as efficiently as possible, while maintaining a safe and reliable system to serve our growing customer base. 
As you will see on Slide 10, we've had a busy quarter on the regulatory front, and we are pleased with the results. During the quarter, we filed our first Distribution Cost Recovery Factor filing, or DCRF, which allows for rate adjustments associated with recovery of distribution capital invested since our last general rate case. A settlement was reached and approved for an annual revenue increase of $13 million, which will go into effect on September 1. Additionally, in December -- excuse me, additionally, in June, the DCRF sunset extension legislation was enacted, which extends the mechanism sunset until September of 2019, allowing us to utilize the mechanism up to 3 additional times before a general rate case is required. We also filed 2 other cost recovery mechanisms, which include our first of 2 planned transmission cost of service, or TCOS filings, this year and our annual energy efficiency cost recovery factor filing. Our TCOS filing was submitted on June 26 and seeks an annual revenue increase of $13.7 million. We anticipate a decision on this filing during the third quarter of this year. Our energy efficiency cost recovery factor filing seeks to recover next year's estimated expenses associated with our energy efficiency program as well as a $7 million incentive related to the program's performance in 2014. Finally, in April, we filed an application for a Certificate of Convenience and Necessity for our Brazos Valley Connection transmission line. This transmission line is the largest capital project in our 5-year plan. 32 alternative routes were submitted to the PUC, and the final route they select will determine the estimated capital cost of the project. We anticipate a commission decision on both the route-of and need-for the transmission line during the fourth quarter of 2015 with construction of the project being completed by mid-2018. The critical status granted to this project highlights the low growth in our service territory -- excuse me, highlights the low growth our service territory is experiencing. As an example of that low growth, during the last week in July, Houston Electric hit 4 consecutive July peak loads. I am pleased with Houston Electric's second quarter performance. Growth remains strong, and we will continue to focus on delivering safe, reliable and efficient service. Joe will now update you on the results for gas operations."
279513,306140657,855095,"CenterPoint Energy, Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Aug 10, 2015",2015-08-10,"Earnings Calls","CenterPoint Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Tracy. Our natural gas operations, which includes both our gas utilities and our nonregulated energy services business, performed in line with our expectations during the second quarter, as more normal weather return to all our jurisdictions. A",661,"Thank you, Tracy. Our natural gas operations, which includes both our gas utilities and our nonregulated energy services business, performed in line with our expectations during the second quarter, as more normal weather return to all our jurisdictions. As you can see on Slide 12, natural gas utility second quarter 2015 operating income was $19 million compared with $30 million for the same period last year. This decline is attributable to return to more normal weather in addition to higher depreciation expense. As I mentioned on the first quarter call, we exceeded our weather-hedged cap in January of 2014 and benefited from the subsequent extreme cold weather that persisted well into April and May that year, particularly in Minnesota. As a result, our natural gas utilities experienced a decline in operating income in the first half of this year, but we expect year-over-year improvements in operating income through the remainder of the year. The economies continue to be strong in our service territories, and we added approximately 36,000 new customers year-over-year. Excluding expenses that have a revenue offset, we are successful in managing O&M expenses to an increase of under 1% compared to the second quarter of last year. 
Moving on to Slide 13, I would like to highlight a number of items that advance our long-term strategy, specifically regulatory developments and capital investments to meet growth needs and ensure system reliability and safety. Recent regulatory filings represent a combination of rate cases and the annual recovery mechanisms, which are intended to help recover the substantial investments we made to better serve our growing customer base. On August 3, we filed a general rate case in Minnesota to increase overall rates by $54 million, annually. Our filing is based on a forward test year and a rate base of $913 million, which reflects the significant capital expenditures we're making across our Minnesota service territory. We have requested an ROE of 10.3% and a 53% equity capital structure. Interim rates are expected to go into effect in October with a final decision around mid-2016. We reached a settlement agreement in our Texas Coast rate case and are awaiting approval by the Texas Railroad Commission. The settlement provides a $4.9 million annual increase and a 10% ROE. With the Texas Coast case finalized, we expect to utilize GRIP, the annual infrastructure recovery mechanism, as early as March 2016 to recover incremental capital investment. In Arkansas, we continue to anticipate filing a rate case in the fourth quarter of 2015 and are evaluating for the case possible usage of Act 725, Arkansas' recently enacted law related to formula rate plans. 
Slide 14 highlights the portion of our capital spending in Minnesota. Our Belt Line replacement project began in 2012 and is expected to be completed in 2023. This project is replacing pipe that was put in service over 60 years ago. And Intel's replacing bare steel pipe, upgrading cathodic protection systems and installing remote controlled valves. Investing capital to improve safety and reliability while reducing O&M is a win for all our stakeholders. 
I'll next turn to Slide 15 in our Energy Services business, which primarily provides competitive natural gas supply services to commercial, industrial, institutional and transportation customers. This business in the second quarter results reflect another solid performance. Operating income was $7 million for the second quarter of 2015 compared with $5 million for the same period of 2014, excluding mark-to-market gains of $2 million and $6 million, respectively. Volumes were nearly flat as economic growth in certain regions has slowed somewhat, but overall customer account increased 1.8% year-over-year. Additionally, O&M expenses were slightly lower, consistent with the company's focus on holding down operating costs. This was a solid quarter for natural gas operations despite the impact of a return to more normal weather. And the regulatory filings I discussed should position us well to continue growing this business. I'll now turn the call over to Bill, who will cover financial activities."
279513,306140657,855095,"CenterPoint Energy, Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Aug 10, 2015",2015-08-10,"Earnings Calls","CenterPoint Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Joe, and good morning to everyone. Tracy and Joe have reviewed their respective operating income on a quarter-to-quarter basis. I will now provide a review of our earnings per share on a guidance basis. Following that, I will review Utility Ope",866,"Thank you, Joe, and good morning to everyone. Tracy and Joe have reviewed their respective operating income on a quarter-to-quarter basis. I will now provide a review of our earnings per share on a guidance basis. Following that, I will review Utility Operations for the second quarter of 2015 versus the baseline for second quarter 2014 with a focus on those items that are below the operating income line. Our earnings per share on a guidance basis were $0.19 in the second quarter of 2015 compared with $0.21 for the second quarter of 2014. As a reminder, our EPS on a guidance basis excludes the impacts of items such as mark-to-market adjustments at our Energy Services business and our ZENS securities and related reference shares. At Midstream Investments, as previously mentioned by Scott, lower equity income from Enable Midstream Partners impacted EPS at CenterPoint by $0.05 per diluted share. 
For Utility Operations, we have provided 2 waterfall charts to help illustrate our normalized operational performance quarter-over-quarter. The first of these charts is on Page 17 and shows Utility Operations second quarter 2014 EPS on a guidance basis of $0.10 per diluted share. Houston Electric experienced cooler-than-normal weather in the second quarter of 2014. Therefore, we normalized up $0.01. We normalized down $0.01 to account for 2014's higher equity return, primarily associated with the timing issues around Houston Electric's equity true-up proceeds. As a result, we landed on a baseline of $0.10 per diluted share for second quarter 2014. This is the baseline from which we feel operational performance should be measured. These adjustments are consistent with the baseline adjustments we highlighted in our year-end 2014 call. We have included a slide from that call in the appendix along with the breakdown of adjustments by quarter. 
The second chart on Slide 18 takes you from the second quarter 2014 Utility Operations baseline of $0.10 to Utility Operations EPS on a guidance basis of $0.13 for this quarter. As Tracy and Joe discussed, their combined core operating income on a guidance basis improved from $150 million to $157 million in the quarter. This $7 million improvement, along with an increase of $4 million in other income, resulted in a favorable earnings per share of $0.02 for the quarter. Through that management, interest expense was flat on a period-to-period basis. For all of 2015, we expect interest expense to be lower when compared to all of 2014. We had a lower effective tax rate of 32% in the quarter. This was due to a lower Texas tax rate and to some, permanent differences. For the full year, we expect an effective tax rate of 35%. Altogether, the second quarter was stronger than anticipated for Utility Operations. 
Now with respect to earnings and dividends, you will see on Slide 19 we are targeting annual earnings per share growth of 4% to 6% on a guidance basis through 2018, inclusive of our midstream investments. We anticipate dividend growth will follow EPS growth. We do recognize that our overall payout ratio for 2015 will likely be above 90%. We are comfortable with that payout ratio and related earnings retention due to the sources of cash and earnings supporting the dividend. We anticipate the overall payout ratio will result in a retention of 30% to 40% of our Utility Operations earnings. These retained earnings support needed capital investment without having to consider a secondary offering of common equity. In addition to these considerations, our Board of Directors takes into account the current state of the capital markets, our financial liquidity, capital strength and our financial forecast when reviewing and declaring our dividends. 
On Slide 20, I'll review our anticipated financing plans for 2015 and 2016. As stated earlier, retaining 30% to 40% of our Utility Operations earnings will allow us to finance our investment and rate base with minimal need for additional equity. We have strong financial liquidity and plan to use our retained earnings and balance sheet strength to source much of our financing needs. This year, we expect to have incremental borrowings of $400 million. These increased borrowings are primarily through our commercial paper program. If appropriate, we will consider fixed rate longer-term maturity debt. 
Looking forward to 2016, we expect to have a similar incremental financing need as 2015. However, the ultimate amount will depend upon our capital investment, our ability to manage working capital and bonus depreciation, amongst other factors. We expect to finance 2016 via fixed-rate debt and commercial paper borrowings. If appropriate, we may consider equity financing through limited use of our DRIP and benefit plans. 
Finally, based on our Utility Operations results and forecast and the most recent public outlook provided by Enable, CenterPoint is pleased to reaffirm our 2015 consolidated earnings estimate of $1 to $1.10 per diluted share. We believe Utility Operations will be on the high side of the $0.71 to $0.75 range, and Midstream Investments will be on the low side of the $0.29 to $0.35 range. As I conclude, I would like to remind you of the $24.75 per share quarterly dividend declared by our board on July 24. With that, I will now turn the call back over to David."

We also have with us other members of management who may assist in answering questions following the prepared remarks.
In conjunction with the call today, we will be using slides, which can be found under the Investors section on our website, centerpointenergy.com. For a reconciliation of the earnings guidance provided in today's call, please refer to our earnings press release, which along with our Form 10-Q has been posted on our website. Please note that we may announce material information using SEC filings, press releases, public conference calls, webcasts and posts to the Investors section of our website. In the future, we will continue to use these channels to communicate important information and encourage you to review the information on our website. Today, management is going to discuss certain topics that will contain projections and forward-looking information that are based on management's beliefs, assumptions and information currently available to management. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks or uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially based upon factors, including weather variations, regulatory actions, economic conditions, commodity prices, changes in our service territories and other risk factors noted in our SEC filings. We will also discuss our guidance for 2015. The Utility Operations guidance range considers performance to date, and certain significant variables that may impact earnings such as weather, regulatory and judicial proceedings, volumes, commodity prices, ancillary services, tax rates, interest rates and financing activities. In providing this guidance, the company does not include other potential impacts such as changes in accounting standards, the value of ZENS securities and the related stocks or the timing effects of mark-to-market and inventory. In providing Midstream Investments guidance, the company takes into account such factors as Enable's most recent public forecast, effective tax rate, the amortization of our basis difference in Enable and other factors. The company does not include other potential impacts such as the impact of any changes in accounting standards or Enable's unusual items. Before Scott begins, I would like to mention that this call is being recorded. Information on how to access that replay can be found on our website. And with that, I will now turn the call over to Scott."

Thank you for joining us today, and thank you for your interest in CenterPoint Energy. This morning, as noted on Slide 4, we reported second quarter 2015 earnings of $77 million, or $0.18 per dilut",652,"Thank you, David, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us today, and thank you for your interest in CenterPoint Energy. This morning, as noted on Slide 4, we reported second quarter 2015 earnings of $77 million, or $0.18 per diluted share compared with $107 million or $0.25 per diluted share in the same quarter of last year. Using the same basis that we used when providing guidance, second quarter 2015 adjusted earnings would've been $0.19 per diluted share compared with $0.21 for 2014. 
On a guidance basis, Utility Operations contributed $0.13 per diluted share versus $0.10 in 2014. Midstream Investments contributed $0.06 per diluted share compared to $0.11 in 2014. Bill will discuss these results in more detail later in the call. Our Utility Operations continue to perform well. We have added over 85,000 metered customers during the last 12 months. Growth, along with system improvements, remain key drivers behind our robust capital spending. We are carefully managing costs as O&M expenses, net of revenue offsets, are up 1% versus the second quarter of 2014. We continue to execute our regulatory strategy, filing rate increases and annual recovery mechanisms as needed in pursuit of earning our allowed returns. Our growing service territories and capital plan, coupled with constructive regulatory environments and disciplined O&M spending, continues support strong performance by our Utility Operations. Next, let me turn to Enable Midstream, which we highlight on Slide 5. 
As many of you know, Enable recently shared its growth outlook of 3% to 7% per unit annual distribution growth in 2016 and 2017. This includes the forecast for high-single-digit growth in natural gas gathering volumes, 25% growth in natural gas processing volumes and a doubling of crude oil gathering volumes. As Enable said on their earnings call, they are well-positioned for growth with assets in some of the best shale plays, including the SCOOP, the STACK, Cana Woodford and Cleveland Sands Plays. Enable has connected more wells year-to-date through July of 2015 than year-to-date through July of 2014. For 2016 and 2017 combined, Enable's expansion capital outlook ranges from $1.6 billion to $2.5 billion. We continue to believe in the value of our Enable Midstream investment and remain focused on providing governance in support of enhancing Enable's performance. 
Overall, I'm pleased with our second quarter results. Utility Operations experienced strong ongoing growth, and Enable performed as anticipated in a challenging commodity market. Today, we are updating our dialogue regarding how we think about returning capital to our investors. After consideration of the current market environment, input from the investment community and discussions with our board, we believe an earnings-based approach to our dividend practice will help provide clarity, simplicity and consistency. Our objective will simply be to grow our dividend in line with our consolidated earnings growth, which Bill will discuss in more detail later in the call. I want to express my appreciation to our employees who, after a series of severe storms in April, May and June, worked countless hours to restore power safely and efficiently. You may have seen some of the images of flooding in Houston on national news. More than 25 inches of rain fell over 2 concentrated periods of time, and our collective utility systems performed well. The gas system was essentially not impacted by the rains, and the customer effects of outages on our electric system were reduced by distribution automation. Proactive communications to those customers enrolled in our new Power Alert Service provided them with timely outage and restoration information. I'm extremely proud of our employees and their commitment to ensuring that every day our customers receive energy from safe, reliable energy delivery systems. I will now ask Tracy and Joe to discuss quarter-over-quarter operating income as well as provide updates on their respective businesses. Bill will follow by bridging operating income to EPS and contrasting our performance with last year's baseline number. Tracy?"

As you can see on Slide 8, second quarter 2015 core operating income was $131 million compared with $115 million for the same period last year. The business benefite",634,"Thank you, Scott. Houston Electric had a solid quarter, consistent with our expectations. As you can see on Slide 8, second quarter 2015 core operating income was $131 million compared with $115 million for the same period last year. The business benefited from higher net transmission-related revenue, continued strong customer growth and a return to more normal weather. These benefits were partially offset by an expected reduction in the equity return, primarily related to true-up proceeds. Houston Electric's customer growth remains strong. Through the first half of the year, we have added nearly 23,000 metered customers, which equates to an annualized growth rate of 2%. As we have mentioned in the past, our forecasted 2% customer growth equates to approximately $25 million to $30 million of incremental revenue annually. Houston's 4.5% unemployment rate in June remains below the national average of 5.3%, and our housing market remains tight at 3-month supply versus a balanced supply of 6 months. 
As the chart on Slide 9 shows, employment growth may slow at times, but over the past 24 years, a residential customer compound annual growth rate has slightly exceeded 2%. Houston Electric continues to manage costs effectively. During the second quarter of 2015, O&M expenses increased approximately 2% over the second quarter of 2014. This growth rate excludes certain expenses that have revenue offsets. We will strive to continue operating the business as efficiently as possible, while maintaining a safe and reliable system to serve our growing customer base. 
As you will see on Slide 10, we've had a busy quarter on the regulatory front, and we are pleased with the results. During the quarter, we filed our first Distribution Cost Recovery Factor filing, or DCRF, which allows for rate adjustments associated with recovery of distribution capital invested since our last general rate case. A settlement was reached and approved for an annual revenue increase of $13 million, which will go into effect on September 1. Additionally, in December -- excuse me, additionally, in June, the DCRF sunset extension legislation was enacted, which extends the mechanism sunset until September of 2019, allowing us to utilize the mechanism up to 3 additional times before a general rate case is required. We also filed 2 other cost recovery mechanisms, which include our first of 2 planned transmission cost of service, or TCOS filings, this year and our annual energy efficiency cost recovery factor filing. Our TCOS filing was submitted on June 26 and seeks an annual revenue increase of $13.7 million. We anticipate a decision on this filing during the third quarter of this year. Our energy efficiency cost recovery factor filing seeks to recover next year's estimated expenses associated with our energy efficiency program as well as a $7 million incentive related to the program's performance in 2014. Finally, in April, we filed an application for a Certificate of Convenience and Necessity for our Brazos Valley Connection transmission line. This transmission line is the largest capital project in our 5-year plan. 32 alternative routes were submitted to the PUC, and the final route they select will determine the estimated capital cost of the project. We anticipate a commission decision on both the route-of and need-for the transmission line during the fourth quarter of 2015 with construction of the project being completed by mid-2018. The critical status granted to this project highlights the load growth in our service territory -- excuse me, highlights the load growth our service territory is experiencing. As an example of that load growth, during the last week in July, Houston Electric hit 4 consecutive July peak loads. I am pleased with Houston Electric's second quarter performance. Growth remains strong, and we will continue to focus on delivering safe, reliable and efficient service. Joe will now update you on the results for gas operations."
279513,306140657,863934,"CenterPoint Energy, Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Aug 10, 2015",2015-08-10,"Earnings Calls","CenterPoint Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Tracy. Our natural gas operations, which includes both our gas utilities and our nonregulated energy services business, performed in line with our expectations during the second quarter, as more normal weather return to all our jurisdictions. A",661,"Thank you, Tracy. Our natural gas operations, which includes both our gas utilities and our nonregulated energy services business, performed in line with our expectations during the second quarter, as more normal weather return to all our jurisdictions. As you can see on Slide 12, natural gas utility second quarter 2015 operating income was $19 million compared with $30 million for the same period last year. This decline is attributable to return to more normal weather in addition to higher depreciation expense. As I mentioned on the first quarter call, we exceeded our weather-hedged cap in January of 2014 and benefited from the subsequent extreme cold weather that persisted well into April and May that year, particularly in Minnesota. As a result, our natural gas utilities experienced a decline in operating income in the first half of this year, but we expect year-over-year improvements in operating income through the remainder of the year. The economies continue to be strong in our service territories, and we added approximately 36,000 new customers year-over-year. Excluding expenses that have a revenue offset, we are successful in managing O&M expenses to an increase of under 1% compared to the second quarter of last year. 
Moving on to Slide 13, I would like to highlight a number of items that advance our long-term strategy, specifically regulatory developments and capital investments to meet growth needs and ensure system reliability and safety. Recent regulatory filings represent a combination of rate cases and the annual recovery mechanisms, which are intended to help recover the substantial investments we made to better serve our growing customer base. On August 3, we filed a general rate case in Minnesota to increase overall rates by $54 million, annually. Our filing is based on a forward test year and a rate base of $913 million, which reflects the significant capital expenditures we're making across our Minnesota service territory. We have requested an ROE of 10.3% and a 53% equity capital structure. Interim rates are expected to go into effect in October with a final decision around mid-2016. We reached a settlement agreement in our Texas Coast rate case and are awaiting approval by the Texas Railroad Commission. The settlement provides a $4.9 million annual increase and a 10% ROE. With the Texas Coast case finalized, we expect to utilize GRIP, the annual infrastructure recovery mechanism, as early as March 2016 to recover incremental capital investment. In Arkansas, we continue to anticipate filing a rate case in the fourth quarter of 2015 and are evaluating for the case possible usage of Act 725, Arkansas' recently enacted law related to formula rate plans. 
Slide 14 highlights the portion of our capital spending in Minnesota. Our Belt Line replacement project began in 2012 and is expected to be completed in 2023. This project is replacing pipe that was put in service over 60 years ago and entails replacing bare steel pipe, upgrading cathodic protection systems and installing remote controlled valves. Investing capital to improve safety and reliability while reducing O&M is a win for all our stakeholders. 
I'll next turn to Slide 15 in our Energy Services business, which primarily provides competitive natural gas supply services to commercial, industrial, institutional and transportation customers. This business in the second quarter results reflect another solid performance. Operating income was $7 million for the second quarter of 2015 compared with $5 million for the same period of 2014, excluding mark-to-market gains of $2 million and $6 million, respectively. Volumes were nearly flat as economic growth in certain regions has slowed somewhat, but overall customer count increased 1.8% year-over-year. Additionally, O&M expenses were slightly lower, consistent with the company's focus on holding down operating costs. This was a solid quarter for natural gas operations despite the impact of a return to more normal weather. And the regulatory filings I discussed should position us well to continue growing this business. I'll now turn the call over to Bill, who will cover financial activities."

Tracy and Joe have reviewed their respective operating income on a quarter-to-quarter basis. I will now provide a review of our earnings per share on a guidance basis. Following that, I will review Utility Ope",866,"Thank you, Joe, and good morning to everyone. Tracy and Joe have reviewed their respective operating income on a quarter-to-quarter basis. I will now provide a review of our earnings per share on a guidance basis. Following that, I will review Utility Operations for the second quarter of 2015 versus the baseline for second quarter 2014 with a focus on those items that are below the operating income line. Our earnings per share on a guidance basis were $0.19 in the second quarter of 2015 compared with $0.21 for the second quarter of 2014. As a reminder, our EPS on a guidance basis excludes the impacts of items such as mark-to-market adjustments at our Energy Services business and our ZENS securities and related reference shares. At Midstream Investments, as previously mentioned by Scott, lower equity income from Enable Midstream Partners impacted EPS at CenterPoint by $0.05 per diluted share. 
For Utility Operations, we have provided 2 waterfall charts to help illustrate our normalized operational performance quarter-over-quarter. The first of these charts is on Page 17 and shows Utility Operations second quarter 2014 EPS on a guidance basis of $0.10 per diluted share. Houston Electric experienced cooler-than-normal weather in the second quarter of 2014. Therefore, we normalized up $0.01. We normalized down $0.01 to account for 2014's higher equity return, primarily associated with the timing issues around Houston Electric's equity true-up proceeds. As a result, we landed on a baseline of $0.10 per diluted share for second quarter 2014. This is the baseline from which we feel operational performance should be measured. These adjustments are consistent with the baseline adjustments we highlighted in our year-end 2014 call. We have included a slide from that call in the appendix along with the breakdown of adjustments by quarter. 
The second chart on Slide 18 takes you from the second quarter 2014 Utility Operations baseline of $0.10 to Utility Operations EPS on a guidance basis of $0.13 for this quarter. As Tracy and Joe discussed, their combined core operating income on a guidance basis improved from $150 million to $157 million in the quarter. This $7 million improvement, along with an increase of $4 million in other income, resulted in a favorable earnings per share of $0.02 for the quarter. Through debt management, interest expense was flat on a period-to-period basis. For all of 2015, we expect interest expense to be lower when compared to all of 2014. We had a lower effective tax rate of 32% in the quarter. This was due to a lower Texas tax rate and to some, permanent differences. For the full year, we expect an effective tax rate of 35%. Altogether, the second quarter was stronger than anticipated for Utility Operations. 
Now with respect to earnings and dividends, you will see on Slide 19 we are targeting annual earnings per share growth of 4% to 6% on a guidance basis through 2018, inclusive of our midstream investments. We anticipate dividend growth will follow EPS growth. We do recognize that our overall payout ratio for 2015 will likely be above 90%. We are comfortable with that payout ratio and related earnings retention due to the sources of cash and earnings supporting the dividend. We anticipate the overall payout ratio will result in a retention of 30% to 40% of our Utility Operations earnings. These retained earnings support needed capital investment without having to consider a secondary offering of common equity. In addition to these considerations, our Board of Directors takes into account the current state of the capital markets, our financial liquidity, capital strength and our financial forecast when reviewing and declaring our dividends. 
On Slide 20, I'll review our anticipated financing plans for 2015 and 2016. As stated earlier, retaining 30% to 40% of our Utility Operations earnings will allow us to finance our investment and rate base with minimal need for additional equity. We have strong financial liquidity and plan to use our retained earnings and balance sheet strength to source much of our financing needs. This year, we expect to have incremental borrowings of $400 million. These increased borrowings are primarily through our commercial paper program. If appropriate, we will consider fixed rate longer-term maturity debt. 
Looking forward to 2016, we expect to have a similar incremental financing need as 2015. However, the ultimate amount will depend upon our capital investment, our ability to manage working capital and bonus depreciation, amongst other factors. We expect to finance 2016 via fixed-rate debt and commercial paper borrowings. If appropriate, we may consider equity financing through limited use of our DRIP and benefit plans. 
Finally, based on our Utility Operations results and forecast and the most recent public outlook provided by Enable, CenterPoint is pleased to reaffirm our 2015 consolidated earnings estimate of $1 to $1.10 per diluted share. We believe Utility Operations will be on the high side of the $0.71 to $0.75 range, and Midstream Investments will be on the low side of the $0.29 to $0.35 range. As I conclude, I would like to remind you of the $24.75 per share quarterly dividend declared by our board on July 24. With that, I will now turn the call back over to David."

It's apparent -- becoming more apparent to me that producers in the U.S. are able to compete even at these lower commodity prices, and we're very pleased with many of the plays that we are in. So I'm still very bullish on this space. Now the growth that we've put out from an earnings forecast for the company is, as you pointed out, consistent with what we've said that would be the utility performance. And I would say it's there largely because of the near-term forecast associated with these lower commodities. So I think we all believe we'll turn around and go back up at some point in the future.

We also have with us other members of management who may assist in answering questions following the prepared remarks.
In conjunction with the call today, we will be using slides, which can be found under the Investors section on our website, centerpointenergy.com. For a reconciliation of the earnings guidance provided in today's call, please refer to our earnings press release and our slides, which along with our Form 10-Q, has been posted on our website. Please note that we may announce material information using SEC filings, press releases, public conference calls, webcasts and posts to the Investors section of our website. In the future, we will continue to use these channels to communicate important information and encourage you to review the information on our website.
Today, management is going to discuss certain topics that will contain projections and forward-looking information that are based on management's beliefs, assumptions and information currently available to management. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks or uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially based upon factors, including weather variations, regulatory actions, economic conditions and growth, commodity prices, changes in our service territories and other risk factors noted in our SEC filings.
We will also discuss our guidance for 2015. The guidance range considers utility operations performance to date and certain significant variables that may impact earnings such as weather, regulatory and judicial proceedings, volumes, commodity prices, ancillary services, tax rates, interest rates and financing activities. In providing this guidance, the company does not include other potential impacts such as changes in accounting standards, the value of ZENS securities and the related stocks or the timing effects of mark-to-market in any inventory. For midterm investments, the company takes into account such factors as Enable's most recent public forecast, effective tax rate, the amortization of our basis difference in Enable and other factors. The company does not include other potential impacts such as any changes in accounting standards, impairments or Enable Midstream's unusual items.

On a guidance basis, as noted on Slide 4, Utility Operations contributed $0.24 per diluted share versus $0.19 in 2014. Midterm investments contributed $0.10 per diluted share compared to $0.11 in 2014. On a GAAP basis, we reported a loss of $391 million or a loss of $0.91 per diluted share. The loss includes non-cash impairment charge estimated to Midstream Investments. Bill will discuss these results in more detail later in the call.
Our businesses performed well, with particularly strong contribution from our Utility Operations. Combined, our gas and electric utilities added more than 88,000 meters since the third quarter of 2014. As you will hear from Tracy and Joe, we had a busy year on the regulatory front, and we are pleased with our progress. We anticipate receiving approval this year for over $138 million in annualized utility rate relief, including interim rates. Additionally, we continue to actively manage O&M expenses, which Tracy and Joe will also discuss later.

Rod is a seasoned industry professional, and I am confident that his knowledge of the job and experience in the midstream industry will be invaluable as Enable continues to execute its growth strategy. Enable recently announced the third quarter distribution of $0.318 per unit, representing a year-to-date increase of about 3%. We are pleased to see their fifth consecutive quarterly increase since the IPO, as they continue to navigate through this challenging commodity price environment. 
Slide 5 includes highlights from Enable's recent earnings call. They continue to see volume growth and many parts of their system. In the Anadarko, 24 rigs are currently drilling wells scheduled to be connected to Enable system. Enable's oil gathering system is now flowing close to its stated capacity. Recent purchases of gas fields served by Enable in Haynesville suggests the possibility for increased drilling in that region.
The year-to-date combined performance of our Utility Operations as well as Midstream Investments, along with anticipated fourth quarter performance, allows us to update our earnings guidance for the full year to be $1.05 to $1.10 per share. Further, we are reaffirming our target earnings per share annualized growth rate of 4% to 6% through 2018.
As we've discussed in the past, we're investing in infrastructure and technology to better serve our customers. I'm proud to say that our efforts are being recognized. In most recent JD Power 2015 Gas Utility Residential Customer Satisfaction Study, our gas utilities ranked in the first quartile in their respective. The study measures billing and payment, price, corporate citizenship, communications, customer service and field service.
Before I close, I want to take a moment to congratulate our leader legal team here at CenterPoint. They were recently recognized by Texas Lawyer as the 2015 Legal Department of the Year in the area of pro bono and community leadership work. The legal team's contributions are often on their personal time and illustrate our values as well as our commitment to serve -- to the areas that we serve.
We remain committed to our vision, to lead the nation in delivering energy, service and value. We will continue to invest in our energy delivery systems to better serve our customers and to seek timely recovery of those investments. 
Tracy will now update you on electric operations."

Houston Electric had a strong quarter, in line with our expectations. As you can see on Slide 7, core operating income was $219 million this quarter compared to $202 million for the same period last year. The business benefited from higher usage, primarily due to more favorable weather, higher transmission and distribution-related rate release, continued strong customer growth and lower operating expenses. These benefits were partially offset by the absence of a onetime energy efficiency reman bonus received in the third quarter 2014 and lower equity return related to true-up proceeds.
We continue to actively manage operating costs. O&M expenses were down 0.3% for the first 3 quarters of 2015 versus the first 3 quarters of 2014, excluding certain expenses that have revenue offsets. We remain committed to ongoing O&M expense discipline.
As you will see on Slide 8, we have a successful executing a regulatory strategy to recover invested capital in a timely manner. We have received approval for over $50 million in annualized transmission and distribution-related rate relief so far this year. Transmission-related costs recovery filings approved by the Commission in the first and third quarters this year resulted in $24 million and $14 million, respectively, in annual transmission revenues. Also an annual revenue increase of $13 million from our first distribution cost recovery factor filing went into effect in September. We are seeking an additional $17 million from our most recent transmission costs of service filing and expect to receive approval during the fourth quarter.
The Houston economy remains resilient and strong. Houston Electric added more than 53,000 metered customers since the third quarter of last year. This represents a continued annual growth rate of more than 2%. As we mentioned before, 2% customer growth equates to approximately $25 million to $30 million of incremental revenue annually.
On the employment front, healthcare and hospitality are making up for job losses in the energy sector, with the greater Houston partnership forecasting 20,000 to 30,000 net new jobs in 2015. Houston's housing market remains tight, with inventory at 3.5 months supply compared to a more balanced inventory of 6 months. Year-to-date through August, home and auto sales have maintained the pace set during a strong 2014.
On Slide 9, weed included a few statistics to further illustrate the size, strength and diversity of the Houston economy, which continues to perform well despite challenges associated with the energy sector. We're pleased with Houston's growth prospects. Houston Electric performed well this quarter, and we are positioned to finish the year strong. We will continue to focus on safety, reliability, efficiency and growth. 
Bill will now update you on results for gas operations."

Our natural gas operations, which includes both our gas utilities and our nonregulated energy services business, had a strong quarter both operationally and financially. I mentioned during the second quarter earnings call that we expected to improve our year-over-year operating income for the remainder of 2015. I'm pleased to tell you that improvement is occurring. 
As you'll see on Slide 11, natural gas utilities third quarter operating income was $11 million compared to an operating loss of $8 million for the same period in 2014. Operating income was higher due to several factors. 
The business benefited from increased rate release, customer growth, other revenue and lower O&M expenses. These increases were partially offset by higher tax and depreciation expense. Further, the Minnesota Conservation Improvement Program incentive or CIP, which historically has been received and recognized in the fourth quarter, was approved in the third quarter this year. Customer growth remain strong at our natural gas utilities having added over 35,000 customers since the third quarter of 2014. [indiscernible] nearly 2% customer growth followed by Minnesota, which added more than 1%.
O&M expenses at our natural gas utilities were down 0.5% for the first 3 quarters of 2015 versus the first 3 quarters of last year, excluding certain expenses that have revenue offsets and excluding the Minnesota CIP incentive. 
As with our electric business, we remain committed to ongoing O&M expense discipline.
Turning to Slides 12 to 14. We continued to execute on our multijurisdictional regulatory strategy. Constructive annual rate mechanisms plus rate cases are allowing us to recover capital investments we made to better serve our customer base. The annualized rate relief approved so far this year is over $65 million, which includes $48 million of interim rates in Minnesota. We expect a final decision on Minnesota rates in mid-2016.
Another milestone in our rate strategy was implementation of a new 3-year full decoupling pilot in Minnesota, which is intended to normalize the impact of usage fluctuations, including whether. As a result, we wll employ a weather hedge in Minnesota for the 2015, '16 winter.
Finally, next week, we will file our first rate case in 8 years in Arkansas. This case will be used to ensure recovery of the substantial infrastructure investments we are making that are not eligible for inclusion in current annual recovery mechanisms. As part of the filings, we will also request approval of the formulae rate plan as allowed by new legislation. The formula late rate plan will allow our rates to be prospectively adjusted based on a banded ROE approach and a projected test year. We expect to file order a n new base rates to be implemented in the third quarter of 2016.
On Slide 15, you'll see that operating income for our Energy Services business was $2 million for the third quarter 2015 compared with an operating loss of $7 million for the same period of 2014, excluding mark-to-market gains of $5 million and $13 million, respectively.
Sales volumes were down slightly, but customer count grew nearly 1% year-over-year. The increase in operating income was primarily related to commercial asset optimization in our Gulf Coast and midcon and retail regions. Additionally there's a favorable impact to operations and maintenance expenses relating to onetime expenses incurred in third quarter of 2014. 
Energy services is a profitable business segment that complements our gas distribution business and allows us to provide gas purchase options to Centerpoint customers across multiple states. We work hard to focus on the commercial retail business within energy services while reducing fixed costs associated with long-term supply and transportation commitments. Energy services had another good quarter and is on path to achieve another year of strong financial performance.
Overall, our natural gas operations performed well this quarter. We will continue to operate effectively and efficiently as we focus on growth, safety and the reliability of our system. 
I'll now turn the call over to Bill, who will cover our financial activities."
279513,312658496,893871,"CenterPoint Energy, Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Nov 05, 2015",2015-11-05,"Earnings Calls","CenterPoint Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you Joe, and good morning to everyone. Tracy and Joe had reviewed the respective operating incomes on a quarter-to-quarter basis. I will provide a review of our earnings per share on a guidance basis and review Utility Operations for third quarter 2",642,"Thank you Joe, and good morning to everyone. Tracy and Joe had reviewed the respective operating incomes on a quarter-to-quarter basis. I will provide a review of our earnings per share on a guidance basis and review Utility Operations for third quarter 2015 versus the baseline for the third quarter 2014.
Before I do that, let me comment on the impairment.
CenterPoint's third quarter 2015 earnings filing reflects a pretax impairment charges of $862 million related to our investment in Enable Midstream. These impairments recognized that the client in the estimated fair value versus our balance sheet investment, which was $19.12 per unit as of June 30, 2015. With these noncash charges, we have reduced our balance sheet investment in Enable Midstream from $4.5 billion to $3.6 billion. More information is provided on Page 17 of the slide deck. 
Importantly, this impairments do not affect the company's liquidity, cash flow or compliance with debt covenants. These impairments also do not change CenterPoint's earnings momentum or Enable's ability to participate in the development of North American energy infrastructure.
With that, I would like to discuss our financial performance for the third quarter. On a guidance basis, our EPS was $0.34 in third quarter of 2015 compared with $0.30 per share in 2014. As a reminder, our EPS on a guidance basis excludes the impacts of unusual items such as mark-to-market adjustments at our Energy Services business, our ZENS securities and related reference shares and Midstream Investments' impairment charges.
For Utility Operations, we have provided 2 waterfall charts to help illustrate our normalized operational performance quarter-over-quarter. 
In summary, as detailed on Slide 18 and in the appendix, the adjustments lowered [ph] third quarter 2014 EPS $0.01 from $0.19 to $0.18. These adjustments are consistent with the baseline adjustments we highlighted in our 2014 year-end call.
A second chart on Slide 19 provides the quarter-to-quarter comparison for Utility Operations from third quarter 2014 baseline to third quarter 2015 on a guidance basis. We are pleased with the $0.06 per share increase from $0.18 to $0.24 on a quarter-to-quarter basis. As Tracy and Joe discussed, the combined core operating income on a guidance basis improved $45 million to $232 million in the quarter.
With respect to our cost of capital and financing activity, our interest expense was flat on a period-to-period basis. Borrowings have increased approximately $100 million since year-end. Through the year, we expect interest expense to be slightly lower compared to 2014, despite a projected increase of approximately $300 million in net borrowings.
On Slide 20, we provide more details on our financing plan.
Our last below-the-line item is the provision for income tax expense. Excluding the impact of the impairment, the tax rate for 2015 is expected to be 35%. Further, we expect a 36% rate in 2016.
The $0.24 contribution from Utility Operations and the $0.10 from our Midstream Investments resulted in a strong quarter-to-quarter performance of $0.34 versus $0.30 per share. Given these results, as Scott mentioned earlier, we have revising our earnings guidance from our original range of $1 to $1.10 to the high end of the range, $1.05 to $1.10. We reiterate targeting a 4% to 6% earnings growth per annum through 2018 and anticipate EPS contributions from Utility Operations and Midstream Investments of 70% to 75% and 25% to 30%, respectively.
On our fourth quarter call, as in prior years, we intend to provide EPS guidance for 2016 and an update on our utilities 5-year capital investment plans.
Finally, I would like to remind you of the $0.2475 per share quarterly dividend declared by our Board of Directors on October 21. As we reviewed in great detail on our second quarter call, we intend for dividend growth to be aligned with and to follow earnings growth.
With that, I will now turn the call back over to David."

We also have with us other members of management who may assist in answering questions following the prepared remarks.
In conjunction with the call today, we will be using slides, which can be found under the Investors section of -- on our website, centerpointenergy.com. For a reconciliation of the earnings guidance provided in today's call, please refer to our earnings press release and our slides, which, along with our Form 10-Q, has been posted on our website. Please note that we may announce material information using SEC filings, press releases, public conference calls, webcasts and posts to the Investors section of our website. In the future, we will continue to use these channels to communicate important information and encourage you to review the information on our website.
Today, management is going to discuss certain topics that will contain projections and forward-looking information that are based on management's beliefs, assumptions and information currently available to management. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks or uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially based upon factors including weather variations, regulatory actions, economic conditions and growth, commodity prices, changes in our service territories and other risk factors noted in our SEC filings.
We will also discuss our guidance for 2015. The guidance range considers utility operations performance to date and certain significant variables that may impact earnings such as weather, regulatory and judicial proceedings, volumes, commodity prices, ancillary services, tax rates, interest rates and financing activities. In providing this guidance, the company does not include other potential impacts such as changes in accounting standards, the value of ZENS securities and the related stocks or the timing effects of mark-to-market in any inventory. For Midstream Investments, the company takes into account such factors as Enable's most recent public forecast, effective tax rate, the amortization of our basis difference in Enable and other factors. The company does not include other potential impacts such as any changes in accounting standards, impairments or Enable Midstream's unusual items. Before Scott begins, I would like to mention that this call is being recorded. Information on how to access the replay can be found on our website.
And with that, I will now turn the call over to Scott."

Thank you for joining us today, and thank you for your interest in CenterPoint Energy. Third quarter 2015 adjusted earnings on a guidance basis were $146 million or $0.34 per diluted share compared with $128 million or $0.30 in 2014. On a guidance basis, as noted on Slide 4, Utility Operations contributed $0.24 per diluted share versus $0.19 in 2014. Midstream Investments contributed $0.10 per diluted share compared to $0.11 in 2014. On a GAAP basis, we reported a loss of $391 million or a loss of $0.91 per diluted share. The loss includes noncash impairment charges estimated to Midstream Investments. Bill will discuss these results in more detail later in the call.
Our businesses performed well, with particularly strong contribution from our Utility Operations. Combined, our gas and electric utilities added more than 88,000 meters since the third quarter of 2014. As you will hear from Tracy and Joe, we've had a busy year on the regulatory front, and we are pleased with our progress. We anticipate receiving approval this year for over $138 million in annualized utility rate relief, including interim rates. Additionally, we continue to actively manage O&M expenses, which Tracy and Joe will also discuss later.
Turning to our Midstream Investment. Last week, as you may have seen, the Enable Board of Directors named Rod Sailor as the new CEO effective January 1, 2016. Rod is a seasoned industry professional, and I am confident that his knowledge of and experience in the midstream industry will be invaluable as Enable continues to execute its growth strategy. Enable recently announced a third quarter distribution of $0.318 per unit, representing a year-to-date increase of about 3%. We are pleased to see their fifth consecutive quarterly increase since the IPO as they continue to navigate through this challenging commodity price environment. 
Slide 5 includes highlights from Enable's recent earnings call. They continued to see volume growth around many parts of their system. In the Anadarko, 24 rigs are currently drilling wells scheduled to be connected to Enable's system. Enable's Bear Den oil gathering system is now flowing close to its stated capacity. Recent purchases of gas fields served by Enable in the Haynesville suggest the possibility for increased drilling in that region.
The year-to-date combined performance of our Utility Operations as well as Midstream Investments, along with anticipated fourth quarter performance, allows us to update our earnings guidance for the full year to be $1.05 to $1.10 per share. Further, we are reaffirming our target earnings per share annualized growth rate of 4% to 6% through 2018.
As we discussed in the past, we're investing in infrastructure and technology to better serve our customers. I'm proud to say that our efforts are being recognized. In most recent J.D. Power 2015 Gas Utility Residential Customer Satisfaction Study, our gas utilities ranked in the first quartile in their respective regions. The study measures billing and payment, price, corporate citizenship, communications, customer service and field service.
Before I close, I want to take a moment to congratulate our legal team here at CenterPoint. They were recently recognized by Texas Lawyer as the 2015 Legal Department of the Year in the area of pro bono and community leadership work. The legal team's contributions are often on their personal time and illustrate our values as well as our commitment to serve -- to the areas that we serve.
We remain committed to our vision: to lead the nation in delivering energy, service and value. We will continue to invest in our energy delivery systems to better serve our customers and to seek timely recovery of those investments. 
Tracy will now update you on electric operations."

Houston Electric had a strong quarter, in line with our expectations. As you can see on Slide 7, core operating income was $219 million this quarter compared to $202 million for the same period last year. The business benefited from higher usage, primarily due to more favorable weather, higher transmission and distribution-related rate relief, continued strong customer growth and lower operating expenses. These benefits were partially offset by the absence of a onetime energy efficiency remand bonus received in the third quarter of 2014 and lower equity return related to true-up proceeds.
We continue to actively manage operating costs. O&M expenses were down 0.3% for the first 3 quarters of 2015 versus the first 3 quarters of 2014, excluding certain expenses that have revenue offsets. We remain committed to ongoing O&M expense discipline.
As you will see on Slide 8, we are successfully executing a regulatory strategy to recover invested capital in a timely manner. We have received approval for over $50 million in annualized transmission and distribution-related rate relief so far this year. Transmission-related cost recovery filings approved in the -- by the Commission in the first and third quarters this year resulted in $24 million and $14 million, respectively, in annual transmission revenues. Also, an annual revenue increase of $13 million from our first distribution cost recovery factor filing went into effect in September. We are seeking an additional $17 million from our most recent transmission cost of service filing and expect to receive approval during the fourth quarter.
The Houston economy remains resilient and strong. Houston Electric added more than 53,000 metered customers since the third quarter of last year. This represents a continued annual growth rate of more than 2%. As we mentioned before, 2% customer growth equates to approximately $25 million to $30 million of incremental revenue annually.
On the employment front, health care and hospitality are making up for job losses in the energy sector, with the greater Houston partnership forecasting 20,000 to 30,000 net new jobs in 2015. Houston's housing market remains tight, with inventory at 3.5 months' supply compared to a more balanced inventory of 6 months. Year-to-date through August, home and auto sales have maintained the pace set during a strong 2014.
On Slide 9, we've included a few statistics to further illustrate the size, strength and diversity of the Houston economy, which continues to perform well despite challenges associated with the energy sector. We're pleased with Houston's growth prospects. Houston Electric performed well this quarter, and we are positioned to finish the year strong. We will continue to focus on safety, reliability, efficiency and growth. 
Joe will now update you on results for gas operations."
279513,312658496,894079,"CenterPoint Energy, Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Nov 05, 2015",2015-11-05,"Earnings Calls","CenterPoint Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Tracy. Our natural gas operations, which includes both our gas utilities and our nonregulated energy services business, had a strong quarter, both operationally and financially. I mentioned during the second quarter earnings call that we expect",668,"Thank you, Tracy. Our natural gas operations, which includes both our gas utilities and our nonregulated energy services business, had a strong quarter, both operationally and financially. I mentioned during the second quarter earnings call that we expected to improve our year-over-year operating income for the remainder of 2015. I'm pleased to tell you that improvement is occurring. 
As you'll see on Slide 11, natural gas utilities third quarter operating income was $11 million compared to an operating loss of $8 million for the same period in 2014. Operating income was higher due to several factors. 
The business benefited from increased rate relief, customer growth, other revenue and lower O&M expenses. These increases were partially offset by higher tax and depreciation expense. Further, the Minnesota conservation improvement program incentive, or CIP, which historically has been received and recognized in the fourth quarter, was approved in the third quarter this year. Customer growth remained strong at our natural gas utilities, having added over 35,000 customers since the third quarter of 2014. Texas led nearly 2% customer growth, followed by Minnesota, which added more than 1%.
O&M expenses at our natural gas utilities were down 0.5% for the first 3 quarters of 2015 versus the first 3 quarters of last year, excluding certain expenses that have revenue offsets and excluding the Minnesota CIP incentive. 
As with our electric business, we remain committed to ongoing O&M expense discipline.
Turning to Slides 12 through 14. We continue to execute on our multi-jurisdictional regulatory strategy. Constructive annual rate mechanisms plus rate cases are allowing us to recover capital investments we've made to better serve our customer base. The annualized rate relief approved so far this year is over $65 million, which includes $48 million of interim rates in Minnesota. We expect a final decision on Minnesota rates in mid-2016.
Another milestone in our rate strategy was the implementation of a new 3-year full decoupling pilot in Minnesota, which is intended to normalize the impact of usage fluctuations, including whether. As a result, we will not employ a weather hedge in Minnesota for the 2015, '16 winter.
Finally, next week, we will file our first rate case in 8 years in Arkansas. This case will be used to ensure recovery of the substantial infrastructure investments we are making that are not eligible for inclusion in current annual recovery mechanisms. As part of the filings, we will also request approval of a formula rate plan as allowed by new legislation. The formula rate plan will allow our rates to be prospectively adjusted based on a banded ROE approach in a projected test year. We expect a final order of new base rates to be implemented in the third quarter of 2016.
On Slide 15, you'll see that operating income for our Energy Services business was $2 million for the third quarter of 2015 compared with an operating loss of $7 million for the same period of 2014, excluding mark-to-market gains of $5 million and $13 million, respectively.
Sales volumes were down slightly, but customer count grew nearly 1% year-over-year. The increase in operating income was primarily related to commercial asset optimization in our Gulf Coast and Mid-Con and retail regions. Additionally, there was a favorable impact to operations and maintenance expenses relating to onetime expenses incurred in the third quarter of 2014. 
Energy Services is a profitable business segment that complements our gas distribution business and allows us to provide gas purchase options to CenterPoint customers across multiple states. We worked hard to focus on the commercial retail business within Energy Services, while reducing fixed costs associated with long-term supply and transportation commitments. Energy Services had another good quarter and is on a path to achieve another year of strong financial performance.
Overall, our natural gas operations performed well this quarter. We will continue to operate effectively and efficiently as we focus on growth, safety and the reliability of our system. 
I'll now turn the call over to Bill, who will cover our financial activities."

Tracy and Joe had reviewed the respective operating incomes on a quarter-to-quarter basis. I will provide a review of our earnings per share on a guidance basis and review Utility Operations for third quarter",640,"Thank you, Joe, and good morning to everyone. Tracy and Joe had reviewed the respective operating incomes on a quarter-to-quarter basis. I will provide a review of our earnings per share on a guidance basis and review Utility Operations for third quarter 2015 versus the baseline for the third quarter 2014.
Before I do that, let me comment on the impairment.
CenterPoint's third quarter 2015 earnings filing reflects a pretax impairment charges of $862 million related to our investment in Enable Midstream. These impairments recognized the decline in the estimated fair value versus our balance sheet investment, which was $19.12 per unit as of June 30, 2015. With these noncash charges, we have reduced our balance sheet investment in Enable Midstream from $4.5 billion to $3.6 billion. More information is provided on Page 17 of the slide deck. 
Importantly, these impairments do not affect the company's liquidity, cash flow or compliance with debt covenants. These impairments also do not change CenterPoint's earnings momentum or Enable's ability to participate in the development of North American energy infrastructure.
With that, I would like to discuss our financial performance for the third quarter. On a guidance basis, our EPS was $0.34 in third quarter of 2015 compared with $0.30 per share in 2014. As a reminder, our EPS on a guidance basis excludes the impacts of unusual items such as mark-to-market adjustments at our Energy Services business, our ZENS securities and related reference shares and Midstream Investments' impairment charges.
For Utility Operations, we have provided 2 waterfall charts to help illustrate our normalized operational performance quarter-over-quarter. 
In summary, as detailed on Slide 18 and in the appendix, the adjustments lowered third quarter 2014 EPS $0.01 from $0.19 to $0.18. These adjustments are consistent with the baseline adjustments we highlighted in our 2014 year-end call.
A second chart on Slide 19 provides the quarter-to-quarter comparison for Utility Operations from third quarter 2014 baseline to third quarter 2015 on a guidance basis. We are pleased with the $0.06 per share increase from $0.18 to $0.24 on a quarter-to-quarter basis. As Tracy and Joe discussed, their combined core operating income on a guidance basis improved $45 million to $232 million in the quarter.
With respect to our cost of capital and financing activity, our interest expense was flat on a period-to-period basis. Borrowings have increased approximately $100 million since year-end. For the year, we expect interest expense to be slightly lower compared to 2014, despite a projected increase of approximately $300 million in net borrowings.
On Slide 20, we provide more details on our financing plan.
Our last below-the-line item is the provision for income tax expense. Excluding the impact of the impairment, the tax rate for 2015 is expected to be 35%. Further, we expect a 36% rate in 2016.
The $0.24 contribution from Utility Operations and the $0.10 from our Midstream Investments resulted in a strong quarter-to-quarter performance of $0.34 versus $0.30 per share. Given these results, as Scott mentioned earlier, we are revising our earnings guidance from our original range of $1 to $1.10 to the high end of the range, $1.05 to $1.10. We reiterate targeting a 4% to 6% earnings growth per annum through 2018 and anticipate EPS contributions from Utility Operations and Midstream Investments of 70% to 75% and 25% to 30%, respectively.
On our fourth quarter call, as in prior years, we intend to provide EPS guidance for 2016 and an update on our utilities' 5-year capital investment plans.
Finally, I would like to remind you of the $0.2475 per share quarterly dividend declared by our Board of Directors on October 21. As we reviewed in great detail on our second quarter call, we intend for dividend growth to be aligned with and to follow earnings growth.
With that, I will now turn the call back over to David."

We also have with us other members of management who may assist in answering questions following the prepared remarks.
In conjunction with the call today we will be using slides, which can be found under the Investors section of -- on our website, centerpointenergy.com. For a reconciliation of the earnings guidance provided in today's call, please refer to our earnings press release and our slides which, along with our Form 10-Q, has been posted on our website. Please note that we may announce material information using SEC filings, press releases, public conference calls, webcasts and posts to the Investors section of our website. In the future we will continue to use these channels to communicate important information and encourage you to review the information on our website.
Today management is going to discuss certain topics that will contain projections and forward-looking information that are based on management's beliefs, assumptions and information currently available to management. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks or uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially based upon factors including weather variations, regulatory actions, economic conditions and growth, commodity prices, changes in our service territories and other risk factors noted in our SEC filings.
We will also discuss our guidance for 2015. The guidance range considers utility operations performance to date and certain significant variables that may impact earnings such as weather, regulatory and judicial proceedings, volumes, commodity prices, ancillary services, tax rates, interest rates and financing activities. In providing this guidance, the company does not include other potential impacts such as changes in accounting standards, the value of ZENS securities and their related stocks or the timing effects of mark-to-market in any inventory. 
For Midstream Investments, the company takes into account such factors as Enable's most recent public forecast, effective tax rate, the amortization of our basis difference in Enable and other factors. The company does not include other potential impacts such as any changes in accounting standards, impairments or Enable Midstream's unusual items. Before Scott begins, I would like to mention that this call is being recorded. Information on how to access the replay can be found on our website.

Thank you for joining us today, and thank you for your interest in CenterPoint Energy. Third quarter 2015 adjusted earnings on a guidance basis were $146 million or $0.34 per diluted share compared with $128 million or $0.30 in 2014. On a guidance basis, as noted on Slide 4, Utility Operations contributed $0.24 per diluted share versus $0.19 in 2014. Midstream Investments contributed $0.10 per diluted share compared to $0.11 in 2014. On a GAAP basis, we reported a loss of $391 million or a loss of $0.91 per diluted share. The loss includes noncash impairment charges related to Midstream Investments. Bill will discuss these results in more detail later in the call.
Our businesses performed well, with particularly strong contribution from our Utility Operations. Combined, our gas and electric utilities added more than 88,000 meters since the third quarter of 2014. As you will hear from Tracy and Joe, we've had a busy year on the regulatory front, and we are pleased with our progress. We anticipate receiving approval this year for over $138 million in annualized utility rate relief, including interim rates. Additionally, we continue to actively manage O&M expenses, which Tracy and Joe will also discuss later.
Turning to our Midstream Investment. Last week, as you may have seen, the Enable Board of Directors named Rod Sailor as the new CEO effective January 1 of 2016. Rod is a seasoned industry professional, and I am confident that his knowledge of and experience in the midstream industry will be invaluable as Enable continues to execute its growth strategy. Enable recently announced a third quarter distribution of $0.318 per unit, representing a year-to-date increase of about 3%. We are pleased to see their fifth consecutive quarterly increase since the IPO as they continue to navigate through this challenging commodity price environment. 
Slide 5 includes highlights from Enable's recent earnings call. They continue to see volume growth around many parts of their system. In the Anadarko, 24 rigs are currently drilling wells scheduled to be connected to Enable's system. Enable's Bear Den oil gathering system is now flowing close to its stated capacity. Recent purchases of gas fields served by Enable in the Haynesville suggest the possibility for increased drilling in that region.
The year-to-date combined performance of our Utility Operations as well as Midstream Investments, along with anticipated fourth quarter performance, allows us to update our earnings guidance for the full year to be $1.05 to $1.10 per share. Further, we are reaffirming our target earnings per share annualized growth rate of 4% to 6% through 2018.
As we've discussed in the past, we're investing in infrastructure and technology to better serve our customers. I'm proud to say that our efforts are being recognized. In the most recent J.D. Power 2015 Gas Utility Residential Customer Satisfaction Study, our gas utilities ranked in the first quartile in their respective regions. The study measures billing and payment, price, corporate citizenship, communications, customer service and field service.
Before I close, I want to take a moment to congratulate our legal team here at CenterPoint. They were recently recognized by Texas Lawyer as the 2015 Legal Department of the Year in the area of pro bono and community leadership work. The legal team's contributions are often on their personal time and illustrate our values as well as our commitment to serve -- to the areas that we serve.
We remain committed to our vision: to lead the nation in delivering energy, service and value. We will continue to invest in our energy delivery systems to better serve our customers and to seek timely recovery of those investments. 
Tracy will now update you on electric operations."

Houston Electric had a strong quarter, in line with our expectations. As you can see on Slide 7, core operating income was $219 million this quarter compared to $202 million for the same period last year. The business benefited from higher usage, primarily due to more favorable weather, higher transmission and distribution-related rate relief, continued strong customer growth and lower operating expenses. These benefits were partially offset by the absence of a one-time energy efficiency remand bonus received in the third quarter of 2014 and lower equity return related to true-up proceeds.
We continue to actively manage operating costs. O&M expenses were down 0.3% for the first 3 quarters of 2015 versus the first 3 quarters of 2014, excluding certain expenses that have revenue offsets. We remain committed to ongoing O&M expense discipline.
As you will see on Slide 8, we are successfully executing our regulatory strategy to recover invested capital in a timely manner. We have received approval for over $50 million in annualized transmission and distribution related rate relief so far this year. Transmission related cost recovery filings approved in the -- by the Commission in the first and third quarters this year resulted in $24 million and $14 million, respectively, in annual transmission revenues. Also, an annual revenue increase of $13 million from our first distribution cost recovery factor filing went into effect in September. We are seeking an additional $17 million from our most recent transmission cost of service filing and expect to receive approval during the fourth quarter.
The Houston economy remains resilient and strong. Houston Electric added more than 53,000 metered customers since the third quarter of last year. This represents a continued annual growth rate of more than 2%. As we mentioned before, 2% customer growth equates to approximately $25 million to $30 million of incremental revenue annually.
On the employment front, health care and hospitality are making up for job losses in the energy sector, with the greater Houston partnership forecasting 20,000 to 30,000 net new jobs in 2015. Houston's housing market remains tight, with inventory at 3.5 months' supply compared to a more balanced inventory of 6 months. Year-to-date through August, home and auto sales have maintained the pace set during a strong 2014.
On Slide 9, we've included a few statistics to further illustrate the size, strength and diversity of the Houston economy, which continues to perform well despite challenges associated with the energy sector. We're pleased with Houston's growth prospects. Houston Electric performed well this quarter, and we are positioned to finish the year strong. We will continue to focus on safety, reliability, efficiency and growth. 
Joe will now update you on results for gas operations."
279513,312658496,894183,"CenterPoint Energy, Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Nov 05, 2015",2015-11-05,"Earnings Calls","CenterPoint Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Tracy. Our natural gas operations, which includes both our gas utilities and our nonregulated energy services business, had a strong quarter, both operationally and financially. I mentioned during the second quarter earnings call that we expect",668,"Thank you, Tracy. Our natural gas operations, which includes both our gas utilities and our nonregulated energy services business, had a strong quarter, both operationally and financially. I mentioned during the second quarter earnings call that we expected to improve our year-over-year operating income for the remainder of 2015. I'm pleased to tell you that improvement is occurring. 
As you'll see on Slide 11, natural gas utilities third quarter operating income was $11 million compared to an operating loss of $8 million for the same period in 2014. Operating income was higher due to several factors. 
The business benefited from increased rate relief, customer growth, other revenue and lower O&M expenses. These increases were partially offset by higher tax and depreciation expense. Further, the Minnesota Conservation Improvement program incentive, or CIP, which historically has been received and recognized in the fourth quarter, was approved in the third quarter this year. Customer growth remained strong at our natural gas utilities, having added over 35,000 customers since the third quarter of 2014. Texas led with nearly 2% customer growth, followed by Minnesota, which added more than 1%.
O&M expenses at our natural gas utilities were down 0.5% for the first 3 quarters of 2015 versus the first 3 quarters of last year, excluding certain expenses that have revenue offsets and excluding the Minnesota CIP incentive. 
As with our electric business, we remain committed to ongoing O&M expense discipline.
Turning to Slides 12 through 14. We continue to execute on our multi-jurisdictional regulatory strategy. Constructive annual rate mechanisms plus rate cases are allowing us to recover capital investments we've made to better serve our customer base. The annualized rate relief approved so far this year is over $65 million, which includes $48 million of interim rates in Minnesota. We expect a final decision on Minnesota rates in mid-2016.
Another milestone in our rate strategy was the implementation of a new 3-year full decoupling pilot in Minnesota, which is intended to normalize the impact of usage fluctuations, including weather. As a result, we will not employ a weather hedge in Minnesota for the 2015/'16 winter.
Finally, next week we will file our first rate case in 8 years in Arkansas. This case will be used to ensure recovery of the substantial infrastructure investments we are making that are not eligible for inclusion in current annual recovery mechanisms. As part of the filings, we will also request approval of a formula rate plan as allowed by new legislation. The formula rate plan will allow our rates to be prospectively adjusted based on a banded ROE approach in a projected test year. We expect a final order of new base rates to be implemented in the third quarter of 2016.
On Slide 15, you'll see that operating income for our Energy Services business was $2 million for the third quarter of 2015 compared with an operating loss of $7 million for the same period of 2014, excluding mark-to-market gains of $5 million and $13 million, respectively.
Sales volumes were down slightly, but customer count grew nearly 1% year-over-year. The increase in operating income was primarily related to commercial asset optimization in our Gulf Coast and mid-con and retail regions. Additionally, there was a favorable impact to operations and maintenance expenses relating to one-time expenses incurred in the third quarter of 2014. 
Energy Services is a profitable business segment that complements our gas distribution business and allows us to provide gas purchase options to CenterPoint customers across multiple states. We worked hard to focus on the commercial retail business within Energy Services, while reducing fixed costs associated with long-term supply and transportation commitments. Energy Services had another good quarter and is on a path to achieve another year of strong financial performance.
Overall, our natural gas operations performed well this quarter. We will continue to operate effectively and efficiently as we focus on growth, safety and the reliability of our system. 
I'll now turn the call over to Bill, who will cover our financial activities."

Tracy and Joe had reviewed their respective operating incomes on a quarter-to-quarter basis. I will provide a review of our earnings per share on a guidance basis and review Utility Operations for third quarter 2015 versus the baseline for the third quarter 2014.
Before I do that, let me comment on the impairment.
CenterPoint's third quarter 2015 earnings filing reflects pretax impairment charges of $862 million related to our investment in Enable Midstream. These impairments recognize the decline in the estimated fair value versus our balance sheet investment, which was $19.12 per unit as of June 30, 2015. With these noncash charges, we have reduced our balance sheet investment in Enable Midstream from $4.5 billion to $3.6 billion. More information is provided on Page 17 of the slide deck. 
Importantly, these impairments do not affect the company's liquidity, cash flow or compliance with debt covenants. These impairments also do not change CenterPoint's earnings momentum or Enable's ability to participate in the development of North American energy infrastructure.
With that, I would like to discuss our financial performance for the third quarter. On a guidance basis, our EPS was $0.34 in third quarter of 2015 compared with $0.30 per share in 2014. As a reminder, our EPS on a guidance basis excludes the impacts of unusual items such as mark-to-market adjustments at our Energy Services business, our ZENS securities and related reference shares and Midstream Investments' impairment charges.
For Utility Operations, we have provided 2 waterfall charts to help illustrate our normalized operational performance quarter-over-quarter. 
In summary, as detailed on Slide 18 and in the appendix, the adjustments lowered third quarter 2014 EPS $0.01, from $0.19 to $0.18. These adjustments are consistent with the baseline adjustments we highlighted in our 2014 year-end call.
A second chart on Slide 19 provides the quarter-to-quarter comparison for Utility Operations from third quarter 2014 baseline to third quarter 2015 on a guidance basis. We are pleased with the $0.06 per share increase from $0.18 to $0.24 on a quarter-to-quarter basis. As Tracy and Joe discussed, their combined core operating income on a guidance basis improved $45 million to $232 million in the quarter.
With respect to our cost of capital and financing activity, our interest expense was flat on a period-to-period basis. Borrowings have increased approximately $100 million since year-end. For the year, we expect interest expense to be slightly lower compared to 2014, despite a projected increase of approximately $300 million in net borrowings.
On Slide 20, we provide more details on our financing plan.
Our last below-the-line item is the provision for income tax expense. Excluding the impact of the impairment, the tax rate for 2015 is expected to be 35%. Further, we expect a 36% rate in 2016.
The $0.24 contribution from Utility Operations and the $0.10 from our Midstream Investments resulted in a strong quarter-to-quarter performance of $0.34 versus $0.30 per share. Given these results, as Scott mentioned earlier, we are revising our earnings guidance from our original range of $1 to $1.10 to the high end of the range, $1.05 to $1.10. We reiterate targeting a 4% to 6% earnings growth per annum through 2018 and anticipate EPS contributions from Utility Operations and Midstream Investments of 70% to 75% and 25% to 30%, respectively.
On our fourth quarter call, as in prior years, we intend to provide EPS guidance for 2016 and an update on our utilities' 5-year capital investment plans.
Finally, I would like to remind you of the $0.2475 per share quarterly dividend declared by our Board of Directors on October 21. As we reviewed in great detail on our second quarter call, we intend for dividend growth to be aligned with and to follow earnings growth.
With that, I will now turn the call back over to David."

We -- as you've seen in our data, we obviously track our meter additions. They continue to be very strong. Another kind of leading indicator we look at is something Tracy mentioned and that is the inventory of housing. If the economy were slowing and impacting the rate of construction or residential construction, you may tend to see an increase of inventory or a slowdown in the number of meters that we're connecting. And so far we haven't seen that. So we continue to see a very robust economy overall. And as Tracy mentioned, several sectors are taking up for some of the downturn that we have seen in the energy space."

What we're saying implicitly in that is we expect greater growth at the utilities to make up for the balance in order to achieve that 4% to 6%. We continue in our modeling to see that the utility's actual payout in terms of the cash support to dividend is 60% to 70% of their earnings."
