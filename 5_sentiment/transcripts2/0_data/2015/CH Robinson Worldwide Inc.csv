Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. So as you can see on Page 3 of our results for the fourth quarter, we had a very solid fourth quarter and finished what we believe was a very strong year-end 2014. Looking at some of the key financial metrics",2474,"Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. So as you can see on Page 3 of our results for the fourth quarter, we had a very solid fourth quarter and finished what we believe was a very strong year-end 2014. 
Looking at some of the key financial metrics on that Slide 3. For the fourth quarter, our gross revenues increased 6.5%. Net revenues increased by 12.9%. We'll get into the components of that as we always do, but the most of the net revenue growth was driven by truckload and global forwarding services. 
For the fourth quarter the income from operations increased 21.5% and net income increased to 21%. Later on in the presentation, we'll cover some of the expense management and changes in some of the expense items, but, obviously, we were pleased with the fact that our income from operations was able to grow faster than our net revenues for the quarter. 
As it has been the case throughout 2014, largely because of our share repurchases, our diluted EPS grew faster than our net income or income from operations. EPS growth in the quarter was 24.2%. 
I do want to share some comments about the year-to-date numbers as well too, particularly as a reminder, when you think about C.H. Robinson that because so much of our cost structure is driven by personnel expense and significant part of our personnel expense is based upon annual incentives and annual contracts, the year-to-date numbers and the annual numbers really are, over a longer period of time, probably the best way to understand and study the metrics. 
So looking at some of those 12 months or calendar year 2014 financial metrics, the gross revenues were up 5.6% to $13.4 billion, which was a new record high for us. The record net revenues of $2 billion was another milestone that we were anxious to achieve, and was pleased that we were able to reach that this year. 
If you look at our income from operations growth for the year of 9.6% to $748 million, I guess one of the key metrics that we like to highlight there is that our income from operations was able to grow faster than our net revenues for the calendar year as well too. Again, Chad will cover some of the personnel numbers, but that growth in income from operations was despite the return of some pretty meaningful increases in our variable compensation plans. So when we look at the year-to-date results we feel very positive about our business model and how it continues to share the variable performance with all of the stakeholders, including shareholders and employees.
Earlier this year in several of our calls, we talked about our goal of leveraging our past investments of talent that we had made into the network. On that Slide 3, you can see our average and ending headcounts of our team for the year. One of the things that we're very proud of is that we were able to achieve our results during 2014 with a relatively consistent amount of people on our team. And this is a combination of some market condition changes, how we adapted to them and really leveraging the team and the business platform that we had in place to drive some good results for 2014. So we feel like it was a great quarter and a good year and we're proud of our results for 2014. 
Turning to Slide 4 and starting to break down those overall results. Again, we'd like to start with total transportation, which is the majority of the business. Every time we speak to the total transportation growth and net revenue margin, it's probably appropriate to remind you that there are a lot of factors that impact this. So after this slide, we'll get into the various service lines and try to break it down further. 
A couple of constant themes when we look at the overall net revenue margins is that across virtually all of the services, there is a common theme of capacity constraints. 
Following fuel prices is another theme that we'll touch on in a couple of the different services and the impact of that. And then also our change in the mix of our business. When we get into the different transportation services, we'll talk about our length of haul, we'll talk about truck versus rail and a number of items that impact the mix, that impact these revenue margins. 
While there's a lot going on, on this page, I do think it is useful to look at it in terms of an air price view of our revenue margins, particularly as we continue to move more into integrated services and multimodal solutions that there are more and more trade-offs and interrelated parts to the different transportation offerings. As you can see, the net revenue margin for total transportation for the quarter was 15.8%, which compares favorably to a year ago of 15% and is down from 16.1% in the third quarter of this year.
Moving along then to Page 5 and focusing in on our truckload results. Our truckload net revenue for the fourth quarter increased to 15.3%. As you can see in the upper right-hand side, volume for North America truckload transportation increased about 3% for the quarter. These results are fairly consistent with what we've seen the past couple of quarters and reflect what we've discussed in the past around our emphasis on adapting to the market changes during the year with more focus on pricing and a little less emphasis on going after our long-term goal of gaining market share.
In that upper right-hand corner of Page 5 as well, it highlights how we think about our pricing and our margins that the approximate pricing to our customers during the quarter excluding the price of fuel increased around 12% and the cost paid to the carriers is around 11%, which is what drove the net revenue increase in excess of the volume activity for the quarter. 
As we've talked in previous quarters when we look at that approximate pricing, there are a number of things that are going on within those calculations as well too. There is a mixture of business with both contractual and committed and spot market activity. Similar to what we've shared in the past, a more common price increase on committed or contractual business would be something more in the mid-single digits during the year where some of the contractual pricing could increase meaningfully more than that.
In addition, we continue to experience a shortening in the length of haul from a year-over-year standpoint and the rate per mile on some of that shorter length of haul could have more significant increase as well.
Following fuel prices were a factor again. What we've talked about so far is doing the best that we can to exclude the estimated cost and impact of fuel on the pricing that we experienced during the quarter. The declining price of fuel during the quarter that are coming into the current year, we'll come back and talk to that in the look ahead as well as some in the Q&A. But just from a high level when look at our truckload results, we do not believe that the following fuel prices in the fourth quarter of 2014 had a material impact on our business. It does have a material impact on the gross revenues and the amounts that we are invoicing and both paying, and we still continue to believe that over a longer period of time that fuel functions has a pass-through in our business. 
Similar to what we've shared in the past, whenever fuel is moving significantly in either direction, there can be an impact during the transition, and we'll analyze that as best we can. I'll share some more thoughts later, but we do not believe that it was a material impact in the quarter.
Moving on then to Slide 6 and talking about our LTL results for the fourth quarter. Less-than-truckload net revenues increased 7.8% for the fourth quarter on approximately 4% volume increase. Similar to my comment earlier, what we've seen in the LTL marketplace is that capacity has been relatively tight and that prices have been increasing throughout the year. And similar to my comment on our truckload services, we have been a little bit more focused during 2014 on adjusting to those market changes and making certain that we are adapting to the right pricing model and serving our customers to get that capacity that they need as opposed to aggressively chasing market share during 2014.
As we move into 2015, again, when we look ahead, I will come back with some prepared comments on our Freightquote acquisition, which closed as the first of the year in 2015. If you recall, the common themes or the headlines of the Freightquote acquisitions were that it's a good business. It's very technology-driven and it's very focused in LTL. So we do expect organic growth from our core network in LTL, but we also expect to see some meaningful growth in the LTL net revenue results in 2015 from the Freightquote acquisition.
What you can see is for the year 2014, that $258 million of net revenue in LTL represents about 13% of our net revenue, which has continued to become a slightly greater percentage of the mix over the last decade or so.
Moving on then to Slide 7 in our Intermodal results. Intermodal net revenue increased 3.8% in the fourth quarter and volume was up approximately 1% for the quarter. Again, fairly consistent messages and themes with the past couple of quarters. We continued to feel very comfortable with our service levels and our execution capability. We're doing some operational improvements that are helping our net revenues and feel like managing our capacity and equipment better. Rail capacity and train speeds continue to be a challenge in the comparisons of offering this service versus truck load. The congestion at the West ports also introduced some operational challenge with intermodal. But despite all of that, we continue to feel very good about our operational capability and our service offering in the marketplace. 
Our biggest challenge in intermodal that we think we've been very upfront about is that it has been challenging to find ways to aggressively grow the business while maintaining the high return on invested capital that we like to have. So we will continue to keep looking for better opportunities to aggressively grow intermodal but feel comfortable with it as part of our service offering.
Moving to Slide 8 and talking about our Global Forwarding Air, Ocean and Customs results for the fourth quarter. The combined results for the Global Forwarding services was an 18.4% increase in the fourth quarter over the fourth quarter of 2013. The strong second half of the year helped us finish year-to-date with a 10.7% net revenue increase for these combined services. The growth was led by ocean with a net revenue increase of 22.8% in the quarter and in air, an increase of 7.9%, customs brokerage was up 16.8%.
In our Global Forwarding services, as you recall, a little more than 2 years ago, we made a very significant investment with the acquisition of Phoenix International to drive greater growth and improve service in our Global Forwarding division. At that time, we talked about the fact that we had a lot of integration work to do and that we were going to take a very long term focus to building a strong foundation and retaining our customers and retaining our people in our Global Forwarding business. I feel really good about the first 2 years of integration and our success in growing our Global Forwarding business. We feel very good about the caliber of the team, almost all of the integration work has been completed over the last couple of years. We have a very solid network with a good leadership team in place and some very good processes and procedures that have improved our Global Forwarding offering. 
The primary area where we still have some continued work is in regard to the IT systems, and we think that there is some opportunity to continue to improve some of our business processes in our Global Forwarding activities. But the first 2 years have been very positive, and we feel great about how we've improved our competitive presence in the network around the world.
Moving on then to Slide 9, our Other Logistics Services for the quarter. Again, as a reminder, this includes our transportation management services, warehousing, small parcel and some other miscellaneous non-transportation services that we provide. Net revenues for the quarter increased 4%. Net revenues for the year increased 7.6%. In the 2014, we finished below our longer-term growth target of 10% for these services. However, the pipeline continues to look really good. There was some transition in some of those services and some customer activity, but the pipeline looks great, and we continue to feel that this is going to be a very important part of our business going forward, particularly with regards to integrating services and creating a lot of innovation [indiscernible] core transportation services. As we've said in many past quarters, these -- almost all of these other logistics services are heavily intertwined with a meaningful amount of our transportation revenue, probably somewhere in the neighborhood of 10% of our transportation revenue that is overlapping with these customers.
Moving then to Slide 10 in our Sourcing results for the fourth quarter of 2014. Net revenue decreased 7% for the quarter, and we finished down 9% for the year. We've talked throughout 2014 about the changes in our Sourcing business with the mix of larger customer changes, some of the weather-related issues and the other things that have impact the turnover in our results. We have a good Sourcing team in place and they're working hard to deliver better results in 2015, and we do have a plan to grow our net revenue in 2015 back to our longer-term target of more of a mid-single-digit net revenue growth. So we feel that this is an important part of our business. As I've mentioned many times in the past, the buying and selling of our fresh fruits and vegetables is very integrated into our temperature-controlled transportation services and there are a lot of very effective customer solution offerings that are offered through this team. And we're optimistic with the future that there are opportunities to grow and create value in this service line as well within Robinson. 
So that concludes the overview of the services we offer, our margins and our results for the quarter. And with that, I'll turn it over to Chad for some comments on our income statement"

As John mentioned, I will begin on Slide 11, which is our summarized income statement. As John mentioned earlier in the overview, our total net revenues were up 13% for the fourth quarter and our operating income was up 21%. When you look",727,"Thanks, John. As John mentioned, I will begin on Slide 11, which is our summarized income statement. 
As John mentioned earlier in the overview, our total net revenues were up 13% for the fourth quarter and our operating income was up 21%. When you look at our personnel expenses for the quarter, they increased approximately 15% or $32 million. Of that $32 million increase, approximately $29 million was caused by increased incentive compensation. 
Our equity compensation was up $16 million for the quarter compared to last year's fourth quarter and our cash and other incentive plans were up $13 million.
Our average headcount was slightly down at 0.6% for the fourth quarter. So basically the overall increase in our compensation expense during the quarter was driven by those incentive plans that we've talked about all year that were extremely low last year and are coming back. 
Year-to-date, some similar metrics. Our total personnel increase was $112 million. $79 million of it was from increased incentive compensation made up of $38 million increase in equity expense and $41 million in cash and other incentive programs.
Our incentive compensation philosophy and plans have stayed relatively consistent with previous years. The increase is based on our increased net revenues and earnings growth. Last year our incentives were extremely low due to the lack of earnings growth. 
Moving on to the other SG&A line which decreased about 7.6% for the quarter. This was driven primarily by reductions in our provisions for doubtful accounts. Bad debt expense was $5.3 million in last year's fourth quarter, and we experienced a credit of approximately $800,000 or a negative expense in this year's fourth quarter for an improvement of $6 million. 
We expect this expense to fluctuate from period-to-period. It is influenced by specific customer issues, our aging and the quality of our accounts receivable portfolio and the size of our accounts receivable portfolio. We had a great collection quarter and no significant issues with specific customers.
For the year, our provision for doubtful accounts was $15.1 million this year compared to $15.6 million last year. This level of expense relative to our gross revenues are within historic ranges.
Moving on to Slide 12, looking at our cash flow and some other balance sheet data. We had a strong free cash flow quarter with cash provided by operations of $208 million and CapEx including software of $4.3 million. During 2015, we expect, an increase in our total CapEx. We expect it to be between $50 million and $55 million. Included in this estimate is building a second data center for disaster recovery. We are currently -- we are outgrowing our current disaster recovery site, which is in Chicago and we'll build another center similar to our current primary site. We expect to spend $15 million to $20 million on this site in 2015 and with some carryover CapEx into 2016, and plan to bring the site live in early 2016.
At the end of the quarter, we had $359 million in restricted cash. This was related to our purchase of Freightquote. Because the deal closed on January 1 and banks are closed on January 1, we have the funds held in escrow by an escrow agent. Our debt balance including the borrowings related to the Freightquote purchase price was $1.1 billion. 
Moving on to 13, Slide 13, looking at our capital distribution. As we've talked about, our goal is to distribute 90% of our net income for our shareholders in most environments while maintaining a debt-to-EBITDA ratio in the 1% to 1.5% range. This will vary -- the 90% total return of net income shareholders will vary based on our cash flow generations, needs for working capital and other capital needs. For the right acquisition opportunity, we've mentioned before that we'd be willing to go up to 2.5x or 3x debt-to-EBITDA in the future. 
During the quarter, we paid $57.4 million cash -- in cash dividends and spent $39.7 million repurchasing shares. For the year, we fell slightly short of our 90% goal. We suspended share repurchase activities during November and then buy during December. This was due to the company having knowledge of the acquisition prior to public announcements which precluded us from purchasing shares on the open market.
With that, I will turn it back to John for a closing or prepared comments"
368470,281275094,754187,"CH Robinson Worldwide Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2015",2015-02-04,"Earnings Calls","C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Executives","Okay. Our last slide, Page 14, is the look ahead where we try to share what we're seeing in the marketplace and what we're thinking about 2015. If you look at the bullet points there, I think, as we've talked over the last several years about the change",1864,"Okay. Our last slide, Page 14, is the look ahead where we try to share what we're seeing in the marketplace and what we're thinking about 2015. 
If you look at the bullet points there, I think, as we've talked over the last several years about the changes in both secular issues, the competitive landscape, technology, all of that, and then the cyclical changes in the transportation marketplace, pretty much comes down to looking at those 2 topics. And the first one around truckload performance, it's 59% of our net revenue and I know that in terms of trying to understand what our future performance, especially in a shorter term might look like just to try to get a sense of what's happening in the truckload environment. For the month of January, in our legacy or traditional C.H. Robinson truckload activity, we had net revenue growth approximating 15%, which is very similar to what we experienced during the fourth quarter of 2014. We also had more modest volume growth in that same lower single-digit range for the month of January. Those numbers exclude any impact of Freightquote, which we have some preliminary numbers, but want to do more quality control and understand before we start to talk about what those would do. 
The challenge of this year, even more so than past years, is we are fairly certain that the January results will not be indicative of what the remainder of the year holds. Again, if you recall from a year ago, when we were sitting in the midst of the polar vortex and a very unusual January period of time, our net revenue have declined. And that was really throughout the remainder of the first quarter and into the second quarter when we began to manage differently and react to the environment around adapting to pricing, increasing prices and looking at volume growth differently.
So while the year is off to a great start from a net revenue standpoint, we know that over the next 2 to 3 months, we're going to see a meaningful change in our comparisons in terms of the margins that we've incurred. And we also know that we will see some difference in the comparison of the volume activity that we've had. But at the time until we get to the end of the first quarter and into the early part of the second quarter, if our net revenue margins remain consistent with what they've been the last couple of quarters, our net revenue growth would start to be closer to the volume activity that we have as opposed to benefiting from material year-over-year margin comparison. Now margins can move up or down very quickly, as we've talked much so in the past. So again, it's very difficult to predict and that's why we're not really comfortable giving very specific guidance of what 2015 is going to look like. 
The month of January -- what we do know is that the month of January is very similar to the fourth quarter. There will be probably another 3% to 4% of incremental growth from the truckload portion of the Freightquote net revenues that will roll in for the quarter. And again, that will be incremental from the acquisition as opposed to a comparative year-over-year. 
So that's what we know about our January results at this point. We've talked throughout the presentation before too that volume growth and market share gains are at the foundation of our long-term growth initiatives and what we want to focus on. We do intend to continue to invest in talent during the year, and we know -- we have known for some time now that after we cycle through 2014 and we feel very confident about the approach that we took, that it was right thing to do, but that -- over a longer period of time, we do need to focus more on adding talent to the team and more aggressively going after volume growth and market share in 2015 and beyond. 
So we know that our margin comparisons would change over the next 3 or 4 months, and we also know that, over time, we will continue to go back to more focus on volume growth.
That's what we can share at this point about our truckload net revenues, margins, cyclicality of where we're at. Just turning back a little bit, just on our longer term strategic initiatives and what we're seeing -- just a few more comments on the Freightquote acquisition. As we've mentioned a couple of times, that closed the first of the year. Very similar to what we've done on any other acquisition in the past. We do intend to have a very long term focus on our integration strategies and approach with Freightquote. We feel like were off to a good start. We spent a lot of time getting to learn each other's business and figuring out how the teams will work together. This acquisition and the integration will be very different than the Phoenix acquisition of 2 years ago. The employees are, essentially, in 2 locations, in Kansas City and an office up here in Minneapolis. And while there will be a fair amount of focus on the technology offerings and how we integrate systems and most importantly, maybe how we segment customers and align ourselves to go to the market efficiently around all the different sizes and types of customers that we want, there won't be a lot of the similar challenges that there were with Phoenix and having 150 offices around the world and a lot of overlapping acquisitions and locations and sites where we had to merge teams and create structure together. 
So we feel that it's off to good start. We also feel that we'll be able to complete the integration of Freightquote within 2015 and be pretty efficient about how we get there.
Global trade expansion. We've talked in our Global Forwarding service section about the success that we've had in putting the businesses together and penetrating the market with more market share. If you recall both of the foundation of our legacy forwarding business in Phoenix were heavily focused on Asia to North America in those trade lanes. We do feel that there is great opportunity to grow in that lane, but in addition, focus more on Asia to Europe and North America to Europe, to focus on billing the other trade lanes as well as strengthening and focusing more on the air services within the higher percentage of our activity today being ocean. So we do feel like there's great opportunity for us to continue to expand globally and to really focus on forwarding in some significant trade lanes. 
I touched on the fact that sales execution with all type of customers, as our industry has grown as we have grown, as things have become more competitive, we feel like we need to focus better and better on our segmentation strategies and make sure that we are adapting our approach and our go-to-market strategies for the various types of customers that we enter or face with. We had a lot of different initiatives, including a very important small customer focus that's tied into the Freightquote acquisition that we think will help us grow that segment. We've talked in the past about the larger, more integrated customers and the account management strategies and supporting initiatives that we have with them. We feel very good about different verticals and some things that we're doing to improve our ability to add value to certain types of customers as well too. So those are all really important things that you will hear more about in the future and are important part of how we plan to grow our business.
If you talk about the investments that we'll make, talent, technology and network, we've talked about adding people, hiring. And employees and our talent remains the core of our business. There will continue to be more emphasis on that in 2015 with our ongoing focus of training and making sure that we have the right types of people to serve all those customers. 
On the technology side, Chad mentioned the infrastructure investment, that just continues to be a more and more important component of how we serve our customers and the value that we provide to them. In addition to that data center and the infrastructure, we will be spending record amounts on our programming and our software capabilities to make sure that we're expanding our capabilities and adjusting to our customers needs. 
Integrating Freightquote and the e-commerce and digital presence is an important part of our technology strategy as well too. Network and network optimization, there are a lot of initiatives that we have to improve and continue to drive how our offices work together, about sharing freight and improving margins. There's parts of the world where we think we can expand and open some offices, and we have a lot of different initiatives to really improve the efficiency of our network and strengthen the global presence that we have. 
So those are our core competencies of how we compete and things that we will continue to invest in, in 2015 and beyond. 
The last bullet point, in terms of looking ahead is a little more than a year ago, in the fall of 2013, we had an Investor Day and laid out our long-term expectations of how we thought we could grow and how we could create value in the future. That presentation remains on our website under the Investors section with Presentation. I'd invite anybody to go back there and revisit that if you would like to. We put a lot of effort into that and continue to believe that it reflects a proper assessment of what our growth opportunities and our future can look like. 
Some of the highlights in there are that we did talk about double-digit EPS growth being sustainable. While it's going to fluctuate, we do think that remains a reasonable long-term goal. We're pleased with after a difficult start in 2014 that we were able to achieve 15% EPS growth in the first year that revised long-term expectations. And in addition, just a reminder of what I touched on earlier that really across all of our services, growing market share is an important part of our foundation and how we expect to create value. We talked about our targeted long-term milestone of $25 billion of gross revenue. We reached over $13 billion this year, and we think within the next 5 to 10 years, that $25 billion of revenues and market share in this very large logistics and transportation industry is a very doable goal. So we feel very confident about our long-term strategy and the competitive advantages that we are investing in, in order to sustain our growth and we've shared with you a number of initiatives that we'll be focusing in on more on the short term to achieve those goals.
That concludes our prepared comments and with that, I will turn it back to Tim to facilitate some of the Q&A that we've received"

We have much of our business that's done in an all-in price, there's transactional business and that's quite common, on the customer side and when you look at the carrier procurement or the buy side, approximately 80% to 90% of our capacity on truckload is hired on an all-in price. As John mentioned, we don't think there was a major impact on our profitability from fuel in quarter 4. Prices to customers for fuel adjust automatically in a lot of cases. All of our contractual business has fuel surcharges, that adjust primarily on a weekly basis. However, in times of volatility, we can be helped or hurt as timing differences occur between the buy and the sell. In this type of environment, it is difficult and we could be hurt by the decline in prices as carriers today are looking basically for more money for their linehaul. They're very quick to ask for more money when fuel is increasing and when fuel is decreasing, especially in a relatively tight market like we're in now, they're holding more firm on pricing. So going forward, it will be difficult to predict what that impact will be in the short term, but eventually, like we've always said, we think over a longer period of time, fuel well be enacts as a pass-through in our truckload business."

So in terms of the technology side, we're very excited about the expanded capabilities that we got with Freightquote and we think there's going to be some marketing synergies in terms of how we go-to-market with their small customer offering and blend that in with Freightquote. From a cost standpoint, that business is going to remain fairly stand-alone in terms of its site and its team. So we don't expect a lot of cost savings in the short term. Probably the biggest short-term opportunity is that in the truckload portion of Freightquote, while they've done an effective job of integrating their go-to-market strategy into those small customers for both LTL and truckload services, we do feel that our procurement capability on the truckload side can hopefully add value to the shorter-term and help with some of the truckload margins and truckload capacity procurement stuff. Now hopefully, those improved truckload margins along with improved operating efficiency by sourcing that capacity more effectively would have a positive impact on some of the net revenues as well as the operating expenses. For the most part, we're viewing this as an opportunity to gain share and an opportunity to more effectively go after that small customer segment as well as strengthen our LTL offering. With regards to Tim Barton, for those of you who may not be familiar, he was the founder of Freightquote, he started the business in 1999 and has a very strong technology background. So he's been very much a key part of the business over the last 16 or 17 years. Even prior to our acquisition, Tim had removed himself from a lot of the day-to-day activity and had the desire going forward to have a little bit more personal freedom for some other things. So we've entered into a consulting agreement with Tim. He is going to be available for Matt [indiscernible], the President down there and our leadership team to help whenever or however necessary in terms of the Freightquote business and the integration of that. And we also have some other strategic initiatives that he's going to be assisting us with, primarily in the Managed Services and technology areas to help us sort out what's the best approach is going to be going forward. So he'll be acting as a consultant for a year or 2 to help us integrate and learn about our business and help us figure out some strategic things and then we'll reassess from that in terms of what the role will be."

New equipment costs more and drivers wages need to increase meaningfully in order to attract more drivers to the industry. I think the types of price increases that we saw in 2014 are a healthy start in that movement or in that direction. And it will take more of that in order to continue to attract drivers to the industry. From what we see around data points of new truck offering or new truck purchases and capacity availability in the marketplace, maybe there are some early signs of that starting to happen, but if we do continue to have increases in economic growth and freight demand, we'll need to seem a lot more of that in order to provide capacity that the marketplace needs."

And in many ways, simpler than our Phoenix acquisition. So while we do have a culture that says we're going to finish 1 project before we jump into the next, I do feel like our opportunities to look at further acquisitions will come quicker and that by the later part of this year, it the right opportunity came along, we would be interested in pursuing that. In addition, the Freightquote, whilst very meaningful business, it is concentrated in this more segment of customers and there are other parts of our business in forwarding or Managed Services where we could be acquisitive and not really impact or overlap with any of that acquisition. So there are some consideration for the integration resources and probably more like in the first half of 2015, and we will continue to look for the right types of high-quality acquisitions even during 2015 to continue to grow the business."

In early 2015, January is always a spotty time in terms of a lower -- overall lower freight demand and generally less tightness in the marketplace. So there were some periods even during the current month, where capacity seemed to be more available, but that's probably more a function of January and the early cyclicality rather than indicative of overall more capacity coming to the marketplace. But as I stated earlier, it's pretty much supply and demand and driven by pricing. And with the types of activity that we saw during 2014, it's very intuitive that you would see more people choosing this as a clear profession and that those new orders of trucks will trickle down into the medium and small carriers too and that we will see some continuation of available capacity from them."

Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. So as you can see on Page 3 of our results for the fourth quarter, we had a very solid fourth quarter and finished what we believe was a very strong year-end 2014. Looking at some of the key financial metrics on",2474,"Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. So as you can see on Page 3 of our results for the fourth quarter, we had a very solid fourth quarter and finished what we believe was a very strong year-end 2014. Looking at some of the key financial metrics on that Slide 3. For the fourth quarter, our gross revenues increased 6.5%. Net revenues increased by 12.9%. We'll get into the components of that as we always do, but the -- most of the net revenue growth was driven by truckload and global forwarding services. 
For the fourth quarter, the income from operations increased 21.5% and net income increased 21%. Later on in the presentation, we'll cover some of the expense management and changes in some of the expense items, but obviously, we were pleased with the fact that our income from operations was able to grow faster than our net revenues for the quarter. As it has been the case throughout 2014, largely because of our share repurchases, our diluted EPS grew faster than our net income or income from operations. EPS growth in the quarter was 24.2%. 
I do want to share some comments about the year-to-date numbers as well too, particularly as a reminder, when you think about C.H. Robinson that because so much of our cost structure is driven by personnel expense and a significant part of our personnel expense is based upon annual incentives and annual contracts, the year-to-date numbers and the annual numbers really are over a longer period of time probably the best way to understand and study the metrics. So looking at some of those 12 months or calendar year 2014 financial metrics, the gross revenues were up 5.6% to $13.4 billion, which was a new record high for us. The record net revenues of $2 billion was another milestone that we were anxious to achieve, and was pleased that we were able to reach that this year. 
If you look at our income from operations growth for the year of 9.6% to $748 million, I guess one of the key metrics that we like to highlight there is that our income from operations was able to grow faster than our net revenues for the calendar year as well too. Again, Chad will cover some of the personnel numbers, but that growth in income from operations was despite the return of some pretty meaningful increases in our variable compensation plans. So when we look at the year-to-date results, we feel very positive about our business model and how it continues to share the variable performance with all of the stakeholders, including shareholders and employees.
Earlier this year, in several of our calls, we've talked about our goal of leveraging our past investments of talent that we had made into the network. On that Slide 3, you can see our average and ending headcounts of our team for the year. One of the things that we're very proud of is that we were able to achieve our results during 2014 with a relatively consistent amount of people on our team, and this is a combination of some market condition changes, how we adapted to them and really leveraging the team and the business platform that we had in place to drive some good results for 2014. So we feel like it was a great quarter and a good year and we're proud of our results for 2014. 
Turning to Slide 4, and starting to break down those overall results. Again, we'd like to start with total transportation, which is the majority of the business. Every time we speak to the total transportation growth and net revenue margin, it's probably appropriate to remind you that there are a lot of factors that impact this. So after this slide, we'll get into the various service lines and try to break it down further. A couple of constant themes when we look at the overall net revenue margins is that across virtually all of the services, there is a common theme of capacity constraints falling fuel prices is another theme that we'll touch on and a couple of the different services and the impact on that, and then also our change in the mix of our business. When we get into the different transportation services, we'll talk about our length of haul. We'll talk about truck versus rail and a number of items that impact the mix, that impact these revenue margins. 
While there's a lot going on, on this page, I do think it is useful to look at it in terms of an air price view of our net revenue margins, particularly as we continue to move more into integrated services and multimodal solutions that there are more and more trade-offs and interrelated parts to the different transportation offerings. As you can see, the net revenue margin for total transportation for the quarter was 15.8%, which compares favorably to a year ago of 15%, and is down from 16.1% in the third quarter of this year.
Moving along then to Page 5 and focusing in on our truckload results. Our truckload net revenue for the fourth quarter increased to 15.3%. As you can see in the upper right-hand side, volume for North America truckload transportation increased about 3% for the quarter. These results are fairly consistent with what we've seen the past couple of quarters and reflect what we've discussed in the past around our emphasis on adapting to the market changes during the year with more focus on pricing and a little less emphasis on going after our long-term goal of gaining market share. In that upper right-hand corner of Page 5 as well, it highlights how we think about our pricing and our margins that the approximate pricing to our customers during the quarter, excluding the price of fuel, increased around 12%, and the cost paid to the carrier is around 11%, which is what drove the net revenue increase in excess of the volume activity for the quarter. 
As we've talked in previous quarters when we look at that approximate pricing, there are a number of things that are going on within those calculations as well too. There is a mixture of business with both contractual and committed and spot market activity. Similar to what we've shared in the past, a more common price increase on committed or contractual business would be something more in the mid-single digits during the year where some of the contractual pricing could increase meaningfully more than that. In addition, we continue to experience a shortening in the length of haul from a year-over-year standpoint, and the rate per mile on some of that shorter length of haul can have more significant increase as well.
Following fuel prices were a factor again. What I've talked about so far is doing the best that we can to exclude the estimated cost and impacts of fuel on the pricing that we experienced during the quarter. The declining price of fuel during the quarter are coming into the current year. We'll come back and talk to that in the look ahead as well as some in the Q&A. But just from a high level when look at our truckload results, we do not believe that the falling fuel prices in the fourth quarter of 2014 had a material impact on our business. It does have a material impact on the gross revenues and the amounts that we are invoicing and both paying, and we still continue to believe that over a longer period of time that fuel functions has a pass-through in our business. Similar to what we've shared in the past, whenever fuel is moving significantly in either direction, there can be an impact during the transition, and we'll analyze that as best we can and share some more thoughts later, but we do not believe that it was a material impact in the quarter.
Moving on then to Slide 6 and talking about our LTL results for the fourth quarter. Less-than-truckload net revenues increased 7.8% for the fourth quarter on approximately 4% volume increase. Similar to my comment earlier, what we've seen in the LTL marketplace is that capacity has been relatively tight, and that prices have been increasing throughout the year. And similar to my comment on our truckload services, we have been a little bit more focused during 2014 on adjusting to those market changes and making certain that we are adapting to the right pricing model and serving our customers to get that capacity that they need as opposed to aggressively chasing market share during 2014.
As we move into 2015, again, to look ahead, I will come back with some prepared comments on our Freightquote acquisition, which closed as the first of the year in 2015. If you recall, the common themes or the headlines of the Freightquote acquisitions were that it's a good business. It's very technology-driven, and it's very focused in LTL. So we do expect organic growth from our core network in LTL, but we also expect to see some meaningful growth in the LTL net revenue results in 2015 from the Freightquote acquisition. What you can see is for the year 2014, that $258 million of net revenue in LTL represents about 13% of our net revenue, which has continued to become a slightly greater percentage of the mix over the last decade or so.
Moving on then to Slide 7 in our Intermodal results. Intermodal net revenue increased 3.8% in the fourth quarter, and volume was up approximately 1% for the quarter, again, fairly consistent messages and themes with the past couple of quarters. We continued to feel very comfortable with our service levels and our execution capability. We're doing some operational improvements that are helping our net revenues, and feel like managing our capacity and equipment better. Rail capacity and train speeds continue to be a challenge in the comparisons of offering this service versus truck load. The congestion at the West ports also introduced some operational challenge with intermodal. But despite all of that, we continue to feel very good about our operational capability and our service offering in the marketplace. Our biggest challenge in intermodal that we think we've been very upfront about is that it has been challenging to find ways to aggressively grow the business while maintaining the high return on invested capital that we like to have. So we will continue to keep looking for better opportunities to aggressively grow intermodal, but feel comfortable with it as part of our service offering.
Moving to Slide 8, and talking about our global forwarding air, ocean and customs results for the fourth quarter. The combined results for the global forwarding services was an 18.4% increase in the fourth quarter over the fourth quarter of 2013. The strong second half of the year helped us finish year-to-date with a 10.7% net revenue increase for these combined services. The growth was led by ocean with a net revenue increase of 22.8% in the quarter and in air, an increase of 7.9%. Customs brokerage was up 16.8%. In our global forwarding services, as you recall, a little more than 2 years ago, we made a very significant investment with the acquisition of Phoenix International to drive greater growth and improve service in our global forwarding division. At that time, we talked about the fact that we had a lot of integration work to do, and that we were going to take a very long term focus to building a strong foundation and retaining our customers and retaining our people in our global forwarding business. I feel really good about the first 2 years of integration and our success in growing our Global Forwarding business. We feel very good about the caliber of the team. Almost all of the integration work has been completed over the last couple of years. We have a very solid network with a good leadership team in place and some very good processes and procedures that have improved our global forwarding offering. The primary area where we still have some continued work is in regard to the IT systems, and we think that there is some opportunity to continue to improve some of our business processes in our global forwarding activities, but the first 2 years have been very positive, and we feel great about how we've improved our competitive presence in the network around the world.
Moving on then to Slide 9, our other logistics services for the quarter. Again, as a reminder, this includes our transportation management services, warehousing, small parcel and some other miscellaneous non-transportation services that we provide. Net revenues for the quarter increased 4%. Net revenues for the year increased 7.6%. In 2014, we finished below our longer-term growth target of 10% for these services. However, the pipeline continues to look really good. There was some transition in some of those services and some customer activity, but the pipeline looks great, and we continue to feel that this is going to be a very important part of our business going forward, particularly with regards to integrating services and creating a lot of innovation outside of our core transportation services. As we've said in many past quarters, these -- almost all of these other logistics services are heavily intertwined with a meaningful amount of our transportation revenue, probably somewhere in the neighborhood of 10% of our transportation revenue that is overlapping with these customers.
Moving then to Slide 10 in our sourcing results for the fourth quarter of 2014. Net revenue decreased 7% for the quarter, and we finished down 9% for the year. We've talked throughout 2014 about the changes in our sourcing business with the mix of larger customer changes, some of the weather-related issues, and the other things that have impact, the turnover in our results. We have a good sourcing team in place, and they're working hard to deliver better results in 2015, and we do have a plan to grow our net revenue in 2015 back to our longer-term target of more a mid-single-digit net revenue growth. So we feel that this is an important part of our business. As I've mentioned many times in the past, the buying and selling of our fresh fruits and vegetables is very integrated into our temperature-controlled transportation services, and there are a lot of very effective customer solution offerings that are offered through this team, and we're optimistic about the future that there are opportunities to grow and create value in this service line as well within Robinson. So that concludes the overview of the services we offer, our margins and our results for the quarter. And with that, I'll turn it over to Chad for some comments on our income statement"
368470,281275094,754457,"CH Robinson Worldwide Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2015",2015-02-04,"Earnings Calls","C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, John.

As John mentioned earlier in the overview, our total net revenues were up 13% for the fourth quarter, and our operating income was up 21%. When you look a",726,"Thanks, John. As John mentioned, I will begin on Slide 11, which is our summarized income statement. As John mentioned earlier in the overview, our total net revenues were up 13% for the fourth quarter, and our operating income was up 21%. When you look at our personnel expenses for the quarter, they increased approximately 15% or $32 million. Of that $32 million increase, approximately $29 million was caused by increased incentive compensation. Our equity compensation was up $16 million for the quarter compared to last year's fourth quarter and our cash and other incentive plans were up $13 million. Our average headcount was slightly down at 0.6% for the fourth quarter. So basically, the overall increase in our compensation expense during the quarter was driven by those incentive plans that we've talked about all year that were extremely low last year and are coming back. Year-to-date, some similar metrics. Our total personnel increase was $112 million. $79 million of it was from increased incentive compensation made up of $38 million increase in equity expense and $41 million in cash and other incentive programs.  Our incentive compensation philosophy and plans have stayed relatively consistent with previous years. The increase is based on our increased net revenues and earnings growth. Last year, our incentives were extremely low due to the lack of earnings growth. 
Moving on to the other SG&A line, which decreased about 7.6% for the quarter. This was driven primarily by reductions in our provisions for doubtful accounts. Bad debt expense was $5.3 million in last year's fourth quarter, and we experienced a credit of approximately $800,000 or a negative expense in this year's fourth quarter for an improvement of $6 million. We expect this expense to fluctuate from period-to-period. It is influenced by specific customer issues, our aging and the quality of our accounts receivable portfolio and the size of our accounts receivable portfolio. We had a great collection quarter and no significant issues with specific customers. For the year, our provision for doubtful accounts was $15.1 million this year compared to $15.6 million last year. This level of expense relative to our gross revenues are within historic ranges.
Moving on to Slide 12, looking at our cash flow and some other balance sheet data. We had a strong free cash flow quarter with cash provided by operations of $208 million, and CapEx including software of $4.3 million. During 2015, we expect an increase in our total CapEx. We expect it to be between $50 million and $55 million. Included in this estimate is building a second data center for disaster recovery. We are currently -- we are outgrowing our current disaster recovery site, which is in Chicago and we'll build another center similar to our current primary site. We expect to spend $15 million to $20 million on this site in 2015, and with some carryover CapEx into 2016, and plan to bring the site live in early 2016.
At the end of the quarter, we had $359 million in restricted cash. This was related to our purchase of Freightquote. Because the deal closed on January and banks are closed on January 1, we have the funds held in escrow by an escrow agent. Our debt balance including the borrowings related to the Freightquote purchase price was $1.1 billion. 
Moving on to 13, Slide 13, looking at our capital distribution. As we've talked about, our goal is to distribute 90% of our net income to our shareholders in most environments, while maintaining a debt-to-EBITDA ratio in the 1% to 1.5% range. This will vary -- the 90% total return of net income to shareholders will vary based on our cash flow generations, needs for working capital and other capital needs. For the right acquisition opportunity, we've mentioned before that we'd be willing to go up to 2.5x or 3x debt-to-EBITDA in the future. 
During the quarter, we paid $57.4 million cash -- in cash dividends, and spent $39.7 million repurchasing shares. For the year, we fell slightly short of our 90% goal. We suspended share repurchase activities during November, and didn't buy during December. This was due to the company having knowledge of the acquisition prior to public announcements, which precluded us from purchasing shares on the open market.
With that, I will turn it back to John for a closing prepared comments."

Our last slide, Page 14, is the look ahead where we try to share what we're seeing in the marketplace and what we're thinking about 2015. If you look at the bullet points there, I think, as we've talked over the last several years about the changes",1857,"Okay. Our last slide, Page 14, is the look ahead where we try to share what we're seeing in the marketplace and what we're thinking about 2015. If you look at the bullet points there, I think, as we've talked over the last several years about the changes in both secular issues, the competitive landscape, technology, all of that, and then the cyclical changes in the transportation marketplace, pretty much comes down to looking at those 2 topics. And the first one around truckload performance, it's 59% of our net revenue, and I know that in terms of trying to understand what our future performance, especially in a shorter term might look like, is to try to get a sense of what's happening in the truckload environment. For the month of January, in our legacy or traditional C.H. Robinson truckload activity, we had net revenue growth approximating 15%, which is very similar to what we experienced during the fourth quarter of 2014. We also had more modest volume growth in that same lower single-digit range for the month of January. Those numbers exclude any impact of Freightquote, which we have some preliminary numbers, but want to do more quality control and understand before we start to talk about what those would do. 
The challenge for this year, even more so than past years, is we're fairly certain that the January results will not be indicative of what the remainder of the year holds. Again, if you recall from a year ago, when we were sitting in the midst of the polar vortex and a very unusual January period of time, our net revenue had declined, and it was really throughout the remainder of the first quarter and into the second quarter when we began to manage differently and react to the environment around adapting to pricing, increasing prices and looking at volume growth differently.
So while the year is off to a great start from a net revenue standpoint, we know that over the next 2 to 3 months, we're going to see a meaningful change in our comparisons in terms of the margins that we've incurred, and we also know that we'll see some difference in the comparison of the volume activity that we've had. By the time til we get to the end of the first quarter and into the early part of the second quarter, if our net revenue margins remain consistent with what they've been the last couple of quarters, our net revenue growth would start to be closer to the volume activity that we have as opposed to benefiting from material year-over-year margin comparison. Now margins can move up or down very quickly, as we've talked much so in the past. So again, it's very difficult to predict, and it's why we're not really comfortable giving very specific guidance of what 2015 is going to look like. 
The month of January -- what we do know now is that the month of January was very similar to the fourth quarter. There will be probably another 3% to 4% of incremental growth from the truckload portion of the Freightquote net revenues that will roll in for the quarter. And again, that will be incremental from the acquisition as opposed to a comparative year-over-year. 
So that's what we know about our January results at this point. We've talked throughout the presentation before too that volume growth and market share gains are at the foundation of our long-term growth initiatives and what we want to focus on. We do intend to continue to invest in talent during the year, and we know -- we have known for quite some time now that after we cycle through 2014 and we feel very confident about the approach that we took, that it was the right thing to do, but that -- over a longer period of time, we do need to focus more on adding talent to the team and more aggressively going after volume growth and market share in 2015 and beyond. So we know that our margin comparisons will change over the next 3 or 4 months, and we also know that, over time, we will continue to go back to more focus on volume growth.
That's what we can share at this point about our truckload net revenues, margins, cyclicality of where we're at. Turning back a little bit just to our longer term strategic initiatives and what we're seeing -- just a few more comments on the Freightquote acquisition. As we've mentioned a couple of times, that closed the first of the year, very similar to what we've done on any other acquisition in the past. We do intend to have a very long-term focus on our integration strategies and approach with Freightquote. We feel like we're off to a good start. We've spent a lot of time getting to learn each other's business and figuring out how the teams will work together. This acquisition and the integration will be very different than the Phoenix acquisition of 2 years ago. The employees are, essentially, in 2 locations, in Kansas City and an office up here in Minneapolis. And while there will be a fair amount of focus on the technology offerings and how we integrate systems, and most importantly, maybe how we segment customers and align ourselves to go to the market efficiently around all the different sizes and types of customers that we want, there won't be a lot of the similar challenges that there were with Phoenix, and having 150 offices around the world and a lot of overlapping acquisitions and locations and sites where we had to merge teams and create structure together. So we feel that it's off to good start. We also feel that we'll be able to complete the integration of Freightquote within 2015 and be pretty efficient about how we get there.
Global trade expansion. We've talked in our global forwarding service section about the success that we've had in putting the businesses together and penetrating the market with more market share. If you recall, both the foundation of our legacy forwarding business and Phoenix were heavily focused on Asia to North America in those trade lanes. We do feel that there is great opportunity to grow in that lane, but in addition, focus more on Asia to Europe and North America to Europe, to focus on billing the other trade lanes, as well as strengthening and focusing more on the air services with the higher percentage of our activity today being ocean. So we do feel like there's great opportunity for us to continue to expand globally and to really focus on forwarding in some significant trade lanes. 
I touched on the fact that sales execution with all type of customers, as our industry has grown, as we have grown, as things have become more competitive, we feel like we need to focus better and better on our segmentation strategies and make sure that we are adapting our approach and our go-to-market strategies for the various types of customers that we interface with. We have a lot of different initiatives, including a very important small customer focus that's tied into the Freightquote acquisition that we think will help us grow that segment. We've talked in the past about the larger, more integrated customers and the account management strategies and supporting initiatives that we have with them. We feel very good about different verticals and some things that we're doing to improve our ability to add value to certain types of customers as well too. So those are all really important themes that you'll hear more about in the future and are important part of how we plan to grow our business.
If you talk about the investments that we'll make, talent, technology and network, we've talked about adding people, hiring, and employees and our talent remains the core of our business. There will continue to be more emphasis on that in 2015 with our ongoing focus of training and making sure that we have the right types of people to serve all those customers. 
On the technology side, Chad mentioned the infrastructure investment that just continues to be a more and more important component of how we serve our customers and the value that we provide to them. In addition to that data center and the infrastructure, we will be spending record amounts on our programming and our software capabilities to make sure that we're expanding our capabilities and adjusting to our customers' needs. 
Integrating Freightquote and the e-commerce and digital presence is an important part of our technology strategy as well too. Network and network optimization, there are a lot of initiatives that we have to improve and continue to drive how our offices work together around sharing freight and improving margins. There's parts of the world where we think we can expand and open some offices, and we have a lot of different initiatives to really improve the efficiency of our network and strengthen the global presence that we have. So those are core competencies of how we compete and things that we will continue to invest in, in 2015 and beyond. 
The last bullet point in terms of looking ahead is a little more than a year ago, in the fall of 2013, we had an Investor Day and laid out our long-term expectations of how we thought we could grow and how we could create value in the future. That presentation remains on our website under the Investors section with Presentation. I'd invite anybody to go back there and revisit that if you would like to. We put a lot of effort into that, and continue to believe that it reflects a proper assessment of what our growth opportunities and our future can look like. 
Some of the highlights in there are that we did talk about double-digit EPS growth being sustainable. While it's going to fluctuate, we do think that remains a reasonable long-term goal. We're pleased with after a difficult start in 2014 that we were able to achieve 15% EPS growth in the first year that revised long-term expectations. And in addition, just a reminder of what I touched on earlier that, really, across all of our services, growing market share is an important part of our foundation and how we expect to create value. We talked about our targeted long-term milestone of $25 billion of gross revenue. We reached over $13 billion this year, and we think within the next 5 to 10 years, that $25 billion of revenues and market share in this very large logistics and transportation industry is a very doable goal. So we feel very confident about our long-term strategy and the competitive advantages that we're investing in, in order to sustain our growth and we've shared with you a number of the initiatives that we'll be focusing in on more on the short term to achieve those goals.
That concludes our prepared comments, and with that, I will turn it back to Tim to facilitate some of the Q&A that we've received."

As we've talked about before, it's impossible to measure with precision for our truckload business what the impacts of fuel are. However, we believe over a long period of time, fuel does function as a pass-through. We have much of our business that's done it in an all-in price. The transactional business, that's quite common on the customer side, and when you look at the carrier procurement or the buy side, approximately 80% to 90% of our capacity on truckload is hired on an all-in price. As John mentioned, we don't think there was a major impact on our profitability from fuel in quarter 4. Prices to customers for fuel adjust automatically in a lot of cases. All of our contractual business has fuel surcharges that adjust primarily on a weekly basis. However, in times of volatility, we can be helped or hurt as timing differences occur between the buy and the sell. In this type of environment, it is difficult and we could be hurt by the decline in prices as carriers today are looking basically for more money for their linehaul. They're very quick to ask for more money when fuel is increasing, and when fuel is decreasing, especially in a relatively tight market, like we're in now, they're holding more firm on pricing. So going forward, it will be difficult to predict what that impact will be in the short term, but eventually, like we've always said, we think over a longer period of time, fuel will be in x as a pass-through on our truckload business."

So in terms of the technology side, we're very excited about the expanded capabilities that we got with Freightquote, and we think there's going to be some marketing synergies in terms of how we go-to-market with their small customer offering and blend that in with Freightquote. From a cost standpoint, that business is going to remain fairly stand-alone in terms of its site and its team. So we don't expect a lot of cost savings in the short term. Probably the biggest short-term opportunity is that in the truckload portion of Freightquote, while they've done an effective job of integrating their go-to-market strategy into those small customers for both LTL and truckload services, we do feel that our procurement capability on the truckload side can hopefully add value in the shorter-term and help with some of the truckload margins and truckload capacity procurement stuff. Now hopefully, those improved truckload margins, along with improved operating efficiency by sourcing that capacity more effectively, would have a positive impact on some of the net revenues as well as the operating expenses. For the most part, we're viewing this as an opportunity to gain share and an opportunity to more effectively go after that small customer segment, as well as strengthen our LTL offering. With regards to Tim Barton, for those of you who may not be familiar, he was the Founder of Freightquote, started the business in 1999, and has a very strong technology background. So he's been very much a key part of the business over the last 16 or 17 years. Even prior to our acquisition, Tim had removed himself from a lot of the day-to-day activity, and had the desire going forward to have a little bit more personal freedom for some other things. So we've entered into a consulting agreement with Tim. He is going to be available for Matt Druten, the President down there to -- and our leadership team to help whenever and however necessary in terms of the Freightquote business and the integration of that. And we also have some other strategic initiatives that he's going to be assisting us with, primarily in the Managed Services and technology areas to help us sort out what's the best approach going to be going forward. So he'll be acting as a consultant for a year or 2 to help us integrate and learn about our business and help us figure out some strategic things, and then we'll reassess from there in terms of what the role will be."

Personnel expenses should also grow roughly in line with this volume growth, assuming consistent net revenue margins. Obviously, there'll be fluctuations between -- in our net revenue margins going forward, but our variable incentive compensation makes up for some of that margin fluctuation. So we can't say it will grow perfectly and that personnel expense will grow perfectly in line with net revenues, but we expect it to approximate our net revenue growth over time.

And in that Investor deck and in our past, we've talked about believing that the European continent provides an equal opportunity for growth and platform that we could have a business very similar to our North American truckload services. We have not changed that long-term view in terms of the opportunity. However, the economic growth and the environment in Europe today has impacted our attitude about the pace and how aggressively we'll go after share during this period of time, very similar to what we've talked about in North America over the last year or so. We've been at it in Europe for maybe a little over 20 years, and there are different environments that are better for going after share and different environments for providing service. For those of you who may not be familiar with it, they're -- in addition to the slow growth and decline, there actually have been declining truckload prices in Europe the last couple of years. And when we look at opening offices and aggressively going after share, a slow growth, no growth, declining price environment can be very challenging, can be very expensive. Essentially, they go after market share very aggressively during that period of time. So we're doing that. We're opening offices. We're investing in our foundation, and we have very long-term goals that, that will continue to become a more and more meaningful piece of our business. But we have tried to be realistic and adjust our pace of opening and our investment spending to make sure that we're adapting to the environment in Europe as well as North America."

So year 1 probably had some of that improvement in there. A big part of the net revenue or margin opportunity entails the optimized routing of making sure that each box is getting on the right steamship line and that each customer is being served in the optimal way. We got better at that the last couple of years, but I think there was opportunity to continue to do that more in the future around operational improvement, process improvement, and a lot of that is supported by the technology that we have still some more work to do on. Lastly, there are very meaningful margin opportunities and consolidation activity. And very similarly, I think we have very good competitive linehaul prices today. But in both Air and Ocean, the smarter we can be and the more effective we can be at consolidating freight and routing things properly, there will be more margin opportunity there. So we've already seen significant amount of benefits, but through operational improvements, systems improvements, better data management, we do hope to continue to drive more efficiency and more margin opportunity in the next couple of years."

In some of the other services we have been a little bit more aggressive towards market share, especially forwarding, like I just touched on.

So it's our sense today that if capacity remains tight, that pricing will continue to escalate and that, hopefully, the environment will be conducive for us to invest in our team and continue to go after market share a little bit more aggressively during 2015. Things can change in a hurry as we learned a year ago, and depending upon what might happen in the market, we may have to adapt more because it's a constant assessment of what those market conditions are.

From what we see around data points of new truck offering or new truck purchases and capacity availability in the marketplace, maybe there are some early signs of that starting to happen, but if we do continue to have increases in economic growth and freight demand, we'll need to see a lot more of that in order to provide the capacity that the marketplace needs."

In early 2015, January is always a spotty time in terms of a lower -- overall lower freight demand and generally less tightness in the marketplace. So there were some periods even during the current month, where capacity seemed to be more available, but that's probably more a function of January and yearly cyclicality rather than indicative of overall more capacity coming into the marketplace. But as I stated earlier, it's pretty much supply and demand, and driven by pricing. And with the types of activity that we saw during 2014, it's very intuitive that you would see more people choosing this as a career profession, and that those new orders of trucks will trickle down into the medium and small carriers as well too, and that we will see some continuation of available capacity from them."

So as you can see on Page 3 of our results for the fourth quarter, we had a very solid fourth quarter and finished what we believe was a very strong year in 2014.Looking at some of the key financial metrics on",2470,"Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. So as you can see on Page 3 of our results for the fourth quarter, we had a very solid fourth quarter and finished what we believe was a very strong year in 2014.
Looking at some of the key financial metrics on that Slide 3. For the fourth quarter, our gross revenues increased 6.5%. Net revenues increased by 12.9%. We'll get into the components of that, as we always do, but the -- most of the net revenue growth was driven by truckload and global forwarding services. 
For the fourth quarter, the income from operations increased 21.5% and net income increased 21%. Later on in the presentation, we'll cover some of the expense management and changes in some of the expense items, but obviously, we were pleased with the fact that our income from operations was able to grow faster than our net revenues for the quarter. As it has been the case throughout 2014, largely because of our share repurchases, our diluted EPS grew faster than our net income or income from operations. EPS growth in the quarter was 24.2%. 
I do want to share some comments about the year-to-date numbers as well, too, particularly as a reminder, when you think about C.H. Robinson, that because so much of our cost structure is driven by personnel expense and a significant part of our personnel expense is based upon annual incentives and annual contracts, the year-to-date numbers and the annual numbers really are, over a longer period of time, probably the best way to understand and study the metrics. So looking at some of those 12 months or calendar year 2014 financial metrics, the gross revenues were up 5.6% to $13.4 billion, which was a new record high for us. The record net revenues of $2 billion was another milestone that we were anxious to achieve and was pleased that we were able to reach that this year. 
If you look at our income from operations growth for the year of 9.6% to $748 million, I guess one of the key metrics that we like to highlight there is that our income from operations was able to grow faster than our net revenues for the calendar year as well too. Again, Chad will cover some of the personnel numbers, but that growth in income from operations was despite the return of some pretty meaningful increases in our variable compensation plans. So when we look at the year-to-date results, we feel very positive about our business model and how it continues to share the variable performance with all of the stakeholders, including shareholders and employees.
Earlier this year, in several of our calls, we've talked about our goal of leveraging our past investments of talent that we had made into the network. On that Slide 3, you can see our average and ending headcounts of our team for the year. One of the things that we're very proud of is that we were able to achieve our results during 2014 with a relatively consistent amount of people on our team, and it was a combination of some market condition changes, how we adapted to them and really leveraging the team and the business platform that we had in place to drive some good results for 2014. So we feel like it was a great quarter and a good year, and we're proud of our results for 2014. 
Turning to Slide 4, and starting to break down those overall results. Again, we'd like to start with total transportation, which is the majority of the business. Every time we speak to the total transportation growth and net revenue margin, it's probably appropriate to remind you that there are a lot of factors that impact this. So after this slide, we'll get into the various service lines and try to break it down further. A couple of constant themes when we look at the overall net revenue margins is that, across virtually all of the services, there is a common theme of capacity constraints. Falling fuel prices is another theme that we'll touch on in a couple of the different services and the impact on that, and then also our change in the mix of our business. When we get into the different transportation services, we'll talk about our length of haul. We'll talk about truck versus rail and a number of items that impact the mix, that impact these revenue margins. 
While there's a lot going on, on this page, I do think it is useful to look at it in terms of an enterprise view of our net revenue margins, particularly as we continue to move more into integrated services and multimodal solutions, that there are more and more trade-offs and interrelated parts to the different transportation offerings. As you can see, the net revenue margin for total transportation for the quarter was 15.8%, which compares favorably to a year ago of 15%, and is down from 16.1% in the third quarter of this year.
Moving along then to Page 5 and focusing in on our truckload results. Our truckload net revenue for the fourth quarter increased 15.3%. As you can see in the upper right-hand side, volume for North America truckload transportation increased about 3% for the quarter. These results are fairly consistent with what we've seen the past couple of quarters and reflect what we've discussed in the past around our emphasis on adapting to the market changes during the year with more focus on pricing and a little less emphasis on going after our long-term goal of gaining market share. In that upper right-hand corner of Page 5 as well, it highlights how we think about our pricing and our margins, that the approximate pricing to our customers during the quarter, excluding the price of fuel, increased around 12%; and the cost paid to the carriers, around 11%, which is what drove the net revenue increase in excess of the volume activity for the quarter. 
As we've talked in previous quarters when we look at that approximate pricing, there are a number of things that are going on within those calculations as well too. There is a mixture of business with both contractual and committed and spot market activity. Similar to what we've shared in the past, a more common price increase on committed or contractual business would be something more in the mid-single-digits during the year, where some of the contractual pricing could increase meaningfully more than that. In addition, we continue to experience a shortening in the length of haul from a year-over-year standpoint, and the rate per mile on some of that shorter length of haul can have a more significant increase as well.
Falling fuel prices were a factor. Again, what I've talked about so far is doing the best that we can to exclude the estimated cost and impacts of fuel on the pricing that we experienced during the quarter. The declining price of fuel during the quarter and coming into the current year, we'll come back and talk to that in the look ahead as well as some of the Q&A. But just from a high level, when look at our truckload results, we do not believe that the falling fuel prices in the fourth quarter of 2014 had a material impact on our business. It does have a material impact on the gross revenues and the amounts that we are invoicing and both paying, and we still continue to believe that, over a longer period of time, that fuel functions as a pass-through in our business. Similar to what we've shared in the past, whenever fuel is moving significantly in either direction, there can be an impact during the transition, and we'll analyze that as best we can and share some more thoughts later, but we do not believe that it was a material impact in the quarter.
Moving on then to Slide 6 and talking about our LTL results for the fourth quarter. Less-than-truckload net revenues increased 7.8% for the fourth quarter on approximately 4% volume increase. Similar to my comment earlier, what we've seen in the LTL marketplace is that capacity has been relatively tight and that prices have been increasing throughout the year. And similar to my comment on our truckload services, we have been a little bit more focused during 2014 on adjusting to those market changes and making certain that we are adapting to the right pricing model and serving our customers to get that capacity that they need as opposed to aggressively chasing market share during 2014.
As we move into 2015, again, look ahead. I will come back with some prepared comments on our Freightquote acquisition, which closed as the first of the year in 2015. If you recall, the common themes or the headlines of the Freightquote acquisitions were that it's a good business. It's very technology-driven, and it's very focused in LTL. So we do expect organic growth from our core network in LTL, but we also expect to see some meaningful growth in the LTL net revenue results in 2015 from the Freightquote acquisition. What you can see is for the year 2014, that $258 million of net revenue in LTL represents about 13% of our net revenue, which has continued to become a slightly greater percentage of the mix over the last decade or so.
Moving on then to Slide 7 and our intermodal results. Intermodal net revenue increased 3.8% in the fourth quarter, and volume was up approximately 1% for the quarter, again, fairly consistent messages and themes with the past couple of quarters. We continue to feel very comfortable with our service levels and our execution capability. We're doing some operational improvements that are helping our net revenues and feel like managing our capacity and equipment better. Rail capacity and train speeds continue to be a challenge in the comparisons of offering this service versus truck load. The congestion at the west ports also introduced some operational challenge with intermodal. But despite all of that, we continue to feel very good about our operational capability and our service offering in the marketplace. Our biggest challenge in intermodal that we think we've been very upfront about is that it has been challenging to find ways to aggressively grow the business while maintaining the high return on invested capital that we like to have. So we will continue to keep looking for better opportunities to aggressively grow intermodal but feel comfortable with it as part of our service offering.
Moving to Slide 8 and talking about our global forwarding air, ocean and customs results for the fourth quarter. The combined results for the global forwarding services was an 18.4% increase in the fourth quarter over the fourth quarter of 2013. The strong second half of the year helped us finish year-to-date with a 10.7% net revenue increase for these combined services. The growth was led by ocean, with a net revenue increase of 22.8% in the quarter; and in air, an increase of 7.9%. Customs brokerage was up 16.8%. In our global forwarding services, as you recall, a little more than 2 years ago, we made a very significant investment with the acquisition of Phoenix International to drive greater growth and improve service in our global forwarding division. At that time, we talked about the fact that we had a lot of integration work to do and that we were going to take a very long term focus to building a strong foundation and retaining our customers and retaining our people in our global forwarding business. I feel really good about the first 2 years of integration and our success in growing our Global Forwarding business. We feel very good about the caliber of the team. Almost all of the integration work has been completed over the last couple of years. We have a very solid network with a good leadership team in place and some very good processes and procedures that have improved our global forwarding offering. The primary area where we still have some continued work is in regard to the IT systems, and we think that there is some opportunity to continue to improve some of our business processes in our global forwarding activities, but the first 2 years have been very positive, and we feel great about how we've improved our competitive presence in the network around the world.
Moving on then to Slide 9, our other logistics services for the quarter. Again, as a reminder, this includes our transportation management services, warehousing, small parcel and some other miscellaneous non-transportation services that we provide. Net revenues for the quarter increased 4%. Net revenues for the year increased 7.6%. In 2014, we finished below our longer-term growth target of 10% for these services. However, the pipeline continues to look really good. There was some transition in some of those services and some customer activity, but the pipeline looks great, and we continue to feel that this is going to be a very important part of our business going forward, particularly with regards to integrating services and creating a lot of innovation outside of our core transportation services. As we've said in many past quarters, these -- almost all of these other logistics services are heavily intertwined with a meaningful amount of our transportation revenue, probably somewhere in the neighborhood of 10% of our transportation revenue that is overlapping with these customers.
Moving then to Slide 10 and our sourcing results for the fourth quarter of 2014. Net revenue decreased 7% for the quarter, and we finished down 9% for the year. We've talked throughout 2014 about the changes in our sourcing business with the mix of larger customer changes, some of the weather-related issues and the other things that have impacted turnover in our results. We have a good sourcing team in place, and they're working hard to deliver better results in 2015, and we do have a plan to grow our net revenue in 2015 back to our longer-term target of more a mid-single-digit net revenue growth. So we feel that this is an important part of our business. As I've mentioned many times in the past, the buying and selling of our fresh fruits and vegetables is very integrated into our temperature-controlled transportation services, and there are a lot of very effective customer solution offerings that are offered through this team, and we're optimistic about the future that there are opportunities to grow and create value in this service line as well within Robinson. So that concludes the overview of the services we offer, our margins and our results for the quarter. And with that, I'll turn it over to Chad for some comments on our income statement"
368470,281275094,754553,"CH Robinson Worldwide Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2015",2015-02-04,"Earnings Calls","C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, John. As John mentioned, I will begin on Slide 11, which is our summarized income statement. As John mentioned earlier in the overview, our total net revenues were up 13% for the fourth quarter, and our operating income was up 21%. When you look a",729,"Thanks, John. As John mentioned, I will begin on Slide 11, which is our summarized income statement. As John mentioned earlier in the overview, our total net revenues were up 13% for the fourth quarter, and our operating income was up 21%. When you look at our personnel expenses for the quarter, they increased approximately 15% or $32 million. Of that $32 million increase, approximately $29 million was caused by increased incentive compensation. Our equity compensation was up $16 million for the quarter compared to last year's fourth quarter, and our cash and other incentive plans were up $13 million. Our average headcount was slightly down at 0.6% for the fourth quarter. So basically, the overall increase in our compensation expense during the quarter was driven by those incentive plans that we've talked about all year that were extremely low last year and are coming back. Year-to-date, some similar metrics. Our total personnel increase was $112 million. $79 million of it was from increased incentive compensation made up of $38 million increase in equity expense and $41 million in cash and other incentive programs.  Our incentive compensation philosophy and plans have stayed relatively consistent with previous years. The increase is based on our increased net revenues and earnings growth. Last year, our incentives were extremely low due to the lack of earnings growth. 
Moving on to the other SG&A line, which decreased about 7.6% for the quarter. This was driven primarily by reductions in our provisions for doubtful accounts. Bad debt expense was $5.3 million in last year's fourth quarter, and we experienced a credit of approximately $800,000 or a negative expense in this year's fourth quarter for an improvement of $6 million. We expect this expense to fluctuate from period to period. It is influenced by specific customer issues, our aging and the quality of our accounts receivable portfolio and the size of our accounts receivable portfolio. We had a great collection quarter and no significant issues with specific customers. For the year, our provision for doubtful accounts was $15.1 million this year compared to $15.6 million last year. This level of expense relative to our gross revenues are within historic ranges.
Moving on to Slide 12, looking at our cash flow and some other balance sheet data. We had a strong free cash flow quarter with cash provided by operations of $208 million, and CapEx including software of $4.3 million. During 2015, we expect an increase in our total CapEx. We expect it to be between $50 million and $55 million. Included in this estimate is building a second data center for disaster recovery. We are currently -- we are outgrowing our current disaster recovery site, which is in Chicago, and we'll build another center similar to our current primary site. We expect to spend $15 million to $20 million on this site in 2015, and with some carryover CapEx into 2016, and plan to bring the site live in early 2016.
At the end of the quarter, we had $359 million in restricted cash. This was related to our purchase of Freightquote. Because the deal closed on January 1 and banks are closed on January 1, we had the funds held in escrow by an escrow agent. Our debt balance, including the borrowings related to the Freightquote purchase price, was $1.1 billion. 
Moving on to 13, Slide 13, looking at our capital distribution. As we've talked about, our goal is to distribute 90% of our net income to our shareholders in most environments while maintaining a debt-to-EBITDA ratio in the 1% to 1.5% range. This will vary -- the 90% total return of net income to shareholders will vary based on our cash flow generation, needs for working capital and other capital needs. For the right acquisition opportunity, we've mentioned before that we'd be willing to go up to 2.5 or 3x debt-to-EBITDA in the future. 
During the quarter, we paid $57.4 million cash -- in cash dividends and spent $39.7 million repurchasing shares. For the year, we fell slightly short of our 90% goal. We suspended share repurchase activities during November and didn't buy during December. This was due to the company having knowledge of the acquisition prior to public announcements, which precluded us from purchasing shares on the open market.
With that, I will turn it back to John for our closing prepared comments."

Our last slide, Page 14, is the look ahead, where we try to share what we're seeing in the marketplace and what we're thinking about 2015. If you look at the bullet points there, I think, as we've talked over the last several years about the changes",1856,"Okay. Our last slide, Page 14, is the look ahead, where we try to share what we're seeing in the marketplace and what we're thinking about 2015. If you look at the bullet points there, I think, as we've talked over the last several years about the changes in both secular issues, the competitive landscape, technology, all of that, and then the cyclical changes in the transportation marketplace, pretty much comes down to looking at those 2 topics and the first one around truckload performance. It's 59% of our net revenue, and I know that in terms of trying to understand what our future performance, especially in a shorter term might look like, is to try to get a sense of what's happening in the truckload environment. For the month of January, in our legacy or traditional C.H. Robinson truckload activity, we had net revenue growth approximating 15%, which is very similar to what we experienced during the fourth quarter of 2014. We also had more modest volume growth in that same lower single-digit range for the month of January. Those numbers exclude any impact of Freightquote, which we have some preliminary numbers but want to do more quality control and understand before we start to talk about what those would do. 
The challenge this year, even more so than past years, is we're fairly certain that the January results will not be indicative of what the remainder of the year holds. Again, if you recall from a year ago, when we were sitting in the midst of the polar vortex and a very unusual January period of time, our net revenue had declined, and it was really throughout the remainder of the first quarter and into the second quarter when we began to manage differently and react to the environment around adapting to pricing, increasing prices and looking at volume growth differently.
So while the year is off to a great start from a net revenue standpoint, we know that over the next 2 to 3 months, we're going to see a meaningful change in our comparisons in terms of the margins that we've incurred, and we also know that we'll see some difference in the comparison of the volume activity that we've had. By the time till we get to the end of the first quarter and into the early part of the second quarter, if our net revenue margins remain consistent with what they've been the last couple of quarters, our net revenue growth would start to be closer to the volume activity that we have as opposed to benefiting from material year-over-year margin comparison. Now margins can move up or down very quickly, as we've talked much so in the past. So again, it's very difficult to predict, and it's why we're not really comfortable giving very specific guidance of what 2015 is going to look like. 
The month of January -- what we do know now is that the month of January was very similar to the fourth quarter. There will be probably another 3% to 4% of incremental growth from the truckload portion of the Freightquote net revenues that will roll in for the quarter. And again, that will be incremental from the acquisition as opposed to a comparative year-over-year.
So that's what we know about our January results at this point. We've talked throughout the presentation and before too that volume growth and market share gains are at the foundation of our long-term growth initiatives and what we want to focus on. We do intend to continue to invest in talent during the year, and we know -- we have known for quite some time now that after we cycle through 2014 and we feel very confident about the approach that we took, that it was the right thing to do, but that, over a longer period of time, we do need to focus more on adding talent to the team and more aggressively going after volume growth and market share in 2015 and beyond. So we know that our margin comparisons will change over the next 3 to 4 months, and we also know that over time we will continue to go back to more focus on volume growth.
That's what we can share at this point about our truckload net revenues, margins, cyclicality of where we're at. Turning back a little bit just to our longer term strategic initiatives and what we're seeing, just a few more comments on the Freightquote acquisition. As we've mentioned a couple of times, that closed the first of the year, very similar to what we've done on any other acquisition in the past. We do intend to have a very long-term focus on our integration strategies and approach with Freightquote. We feel like we're off to a good start. We've spent a lot of time getting to learn each other's business and figuring out how the teams will work together. This acquisition and the integration will be very different than the Phoenix acquisition of 2 years ago. The employees are essentially in 2 locations, in Kansas City and an office up here in Minneapolis. And while there will be a fair amount of focus on the technology offerings and how we integrate systems and most importantly, maybe how we segment customers and align ourselves to go to the market efficiently around all the different sizes and types of customers that we want, there won't be a lot of the similar challenges that there were with Phoenix and having 150 offices around the world and a lot of overlapping acquisitions -- or locations and sites where we had to merge teams and create structure together. So we feel that it's off to good start. We also feel that we'll be able to complete the integration of Freightquote within 2015 and be pretty efficient about how we get there.
Global trade expansion. We've talked in our global forwarding service section about the success that we've had in putting the businesses together and penetrating the market with more market share. If you recall, both the foundation of our legacy forwarding business and Phoenix were heavily focused on Asia to North America in those trade lanes. We do feel that there is great opportunity to grow in that lane, but in addition, focus more on Asia to Europe and North America to Europe, to focus on building the other trade lanes, as well as strengthening and focusing more on the air services with the higher percentage of our activity today being ocean. So we do feel like there's great opportunity for us to continue to expand globally and to really focus on forwarding in some significant trade lanes. 
I touched on the fact that sales execution with all type of customers, as our industry has grown, as we have grown, as things have become more competitive, we feel like we need to focus better and better on our segmentation strategies and make sure that we are adapting our approach and our go-to-market strategies for the various types of customers that we interface with. We have a lot of different initiatives, including a very important small customer focus that's tied into the Freightquote acquisition that we think will help us grow that segment. We've talked in the past about the larger, more integrated customers and the account management strategies and supporting initiatives that we have with them. We feel very good about different verticals and some things that we're doing to improve our ability to add value to certain types of customers as well too. Those are all really important themes that you'll hear more about in the future and are an important part of how we plan to grow our business.
If you talk about the investments that we'll make, talent, technology and network. We've talked about adding people, hiring, and employees and our talent remains the core of our business. There will continue to be more emphasis on that in 2015 with our ongoing focus of training and making sure that we have the right types of people to serve all those customers. 
On the technology side, Chad mentioned the infrastructure investments. That just continues to be a more and more important component of how we serve our customers and the value that we provide to them. In addition to that data center and the infrastructure, we will be spending record amounts on our programming and our software capabilities to make sure that we're expanding our capabilities and adjusting to our customers' needs.
Integrating Freightquote and the e-commerce and digital presence is an important part of our technology strategy as well too. Network and network optimization, there are a lot of initiatives that we have to improve and continue to drive how our offices work together around sharing freight and improving margins. There's parts of the world where we think we can expand and open some offices, and we have a lot of different initiatives to really improve the efficiency of our network and strengthen the global presence that we have. So those are core competencies of how we compete and things that we will continue to invest in, in 2015 and beyond. 
The last bullet point in terms of looking ahead is a little more than a year ago, in the fall of 2013, we had an Investor Day and laid out our long-term expectations of how we thought we could grow and how we could create value in the future. That presentation remains on our website under the Investor section with Presentation. I'd invite anybody to go back there and revisit that if you would like to. We put a lot of effort into that and continue to believe that it reflects a proper assessment of what our growth opportunities and our future can look like. 
Some of the highlights in there are that we did talk about double-digit EPS growth being sustainable. While it's going to fluctuate, we do think that remains a reasonable long-term goal. We're pleased that after a difficult start in 2014, that we were able to achieve 15% EPS growth in the first year that revised long-term expectations. And in addition, just a reminder of what I touched on earlier that, really, across all of our services, growing market share is an important part of our foundation and how we expect to create value. We talked about our targeted long-term milestone of $25 billion of gross revenue. We've reached over $13 billion this year, and we think within the next 5 to 10 years, that $25 billion of revenues and market share in this very large logistics and transportation industry is a very doable goal. So we feel very confident about our long-term strategy and the competitive advantages that we're investing in, in order to sustain our growth, and we've shared with you a number of the initiatives that we'll be focusing in on more in the short term to achieve those goals.
That concludes our prepared comments, and with that, I will turn it back to Tim to facilitate some of the Q&A that we've received."

As we've talked about before, it's impossible to measure with precision for our truckload business what the impacts of fuel are. However, we believe over a long period of time, fuel does function as a pass-through. We have much of our business that's done on an all-in price. The transactional business, that's quite common on the customer side, and when you look at the carrier procurement or the buy side, approximately 80% to 90% of our capacity on truckload is hired on an all-in price. As John mentioned, we don't think there was a major impact on our profitability from fuel in quarter 4. Prices to customers for fuel adjust automatically in a lot of cases. All of our contractual business has fuel surcharges that adjust primarily on a weekly basis. However, in times of volatility, we can be helped or hurt as timing differences occur between the buy and the sell. In this type of environment, it is difficult and we could be hurt by the decline in prices as carriers today are looking basically for more money for their linehaul. They're very quick to ask for more money when fuel is increasing, and when fuel is decreasing, especially in a relatively tight market like we're in now, they're holding more firm on pricing. So going forward, it will be difficult to predict what that impact will be in the short term, but eventually, like we've always said, we think over a longer period of time, fuel will be and acts as a pass-through on our truckload business."

So in terms of the technology side of it, we're very excited about the expanded capabilities that we got with Freightquote, and we think there's going to be some marketing synergies in terms of how we go to market with their small customer offering and blend that in with Freightquote. From a cost standpoint, that business is going to remain fairly stand-alone in terms of its site and its team. So we don't expect a lot of cost savings in the short term. Probably the biggest short-term opportunity is that in the truckload portion of Freightquote, while they've done an effective job of integrating their go-to-market strategy into those small customers for both LTL and truckload services, we do feel that our procurement capability on the truckload side can hopefully add value in the shorter-term and help with some of the truckload margins and truckload capacity procurement stuff. Now hopefully, those improved truckload margins, along with improved operating efficiency by sourcing that capacity more effectively would have a positive impact on some of the net revenues as well as the operating expenses. For the most part, we're viewing this as an opportunity to gain share and an opportunity to more effectively go after that small customer segment, as well as strengthen our LTL offering. With regards to Tim Barton, for those of you who may not be familiar, he was the Founder of Freightquote, started the business in 1999 and has a very strong technology background. So he's been very much a key part of the business over the last 16 or 17 years. Even prior to our acquisition, Tim had removed himself from a lot of the day-to-day activity and had the desire going forward to have a little bit more personal freedom for some other things. So we've entered into a consulting agreement with Tim. He is going to be available for Matt Druten, the President down there to -- and our leadership team to help whenever and however necessary in terms of the Freightquote business and the integration of that. And we also have some other strategic initiatives that he's going to be assisting us with, primarily in the Managed Services and technology areas to help us sort out what's the best approach going to be going forward. So he'll be acting as a consultant for a year or 2 to help us integrate and learn about our business and help us figure out some strategic things, and then we'll reassess from there in terms of what the role will be."

Personnel expenses should also grow roughly in line with this volume growth, assuming consistent net revenue margins. Obviously, there'll be fluctuations between -- in our net revenue margins going forward, but our variable incentive compensation makes up for some of that margin fluctuation. So we can't say it will grow perfectly in -- that personnel expense will grow perfectly in line with net revenues, but we expect it to approximate our net revenue growth over time.

The depreciation and amortization declines compared to last year were due primarily to some acquisition amortization running out this year from previous deals. Beginning -- it's important to remember, though, that beginning in quarter 1, we will have additional amortization expense for Freightquote. We are in the process of our purchase price allocation and our work to get an appraisal done. But based on previous deals, we would expect that amortization from the Freightquote acquisition to be somewhere in the $11 million to $13 million per year range. Moving on to bad debt expense, that fluctuates, as I mentioned, based on our aging and the size of our accounts receivable portfolio and any customer-specific issues. The aging improved during the quarter and the amount of our accounts receivable decreased during the quarter compared to the end of the third quarter. As I mentioned, there were no significant account-specific issues during the quarter, which led to a low expense for the quarter, actually a credit for the quarter. It does vary from quarter to quarter, and the fourth quarter was a very good collection quarter. We collected some money, some old money that had been previously reserved. As I mentioned earlier, we -- moving on to the question about the Freightquote cost, I think I've already answered that, that we had about $500,000 of outside spend.

And in that investor deck and in our past, we've talked about believing that the European continent provides an equal opportunity for growth and platform that we could have a business very similar to our North American truckload services. We have not changed that long-term view in terms of the opportunity. However, the economic growth and the environment in Europe today has impacted our attitude about the pace and how aggressively we'll go after share during this period of time, very similar to what we've talked about in North America over the last year or so. We've been at it in Europe for maybe a little over 20 years, and there are different environments that are better for going after share and different environments for providing service. For those of you who may not be familiar with it, there -- in addition to the slow growth and decline, there actually have been declining truckload prices in Europe the last couple of years. And when we look at opening offices and aggressively going after share, a slow growth, no growth, declining price environment can be very challenging. It can be very expensive, essentially, to go after market share very aggressively during that period of time. So we're doing that. We're opening offices. We're investing in our foundation, and we have very long-term goals that, that will continue to become a more and more meaningful piece of our business. But we have tried to be realistic and adjust our pace of opening and our investment spending to make sure that we're adapting to the environment in Europe as well as North America."

So year 1 probably had some of that improvement in there. A big part of the net revenue or margin opportunity entails the optimized routing of making sure that each box is getting on the right steamship line and that each customer is being served in the optimal way. We got better at that the last couple of years, but I think there is opportunity to continue to do that more in the future around operational improvement, process improvement, and a lot of that is supported by the technology that we still have some more work to do on. Lastly, there are very meaningful margin opportunities and consolidation activity. And very similarly, I think we have very good competitive linehaul prices today. But in both Air and Ocean, the smarter we can be and the more effective we can be at consolidating freight and routing things properly, there will be more margin opportunity there. So we've already seen significant amounts of benefits, but through operational improvements, systems improvements, better data management, we do hope to continue to drive more efficiency and more margin opportunity in the next couple of years."

The solution, in our view, has always been a fairly straightforward formula, that it just takes compensation adjustments to -- or pricing changes to attract capacity to the marketplace. New equipment costs more, and drivers wages need to increase meaningfully in order to attract more drivers to the industry. I think the types of price increases that we saw in 2014 are a healthy start in that movement or in that direction. And it will take more of that in order to continue to attract drivers to the industry. From what we see around data points of new truck offering -- or new truck purchases and capacity availability in the marketplace, maybe there are some early signs of that starting to happen, but if we do continue to have increases in economic growth and freight demand, we'll need to see a lot more of that in order to provide the capacity that the marketplace needs."

Income from operation",2325,"Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. Looking at that Slide 3, our results for the first quarter 2015, our total revenues for the quarter were $3.3 billion or 5% increase over 2014. Net revenues increased 14.8% to $525 million. Income from operations, $181.9 million or a 15.9% increase and our earnings per share were up 16% at $0.73 per share for the quarter compared to $0.63 for a year ago.  Those are our key financial metrics and our overall results for the quarter that we were happy with. 
If you look at sort of the trends and beams that you will hear as we add our commentaries to the quarter, I think one of our the highlights is the impact of fuel during the quarter. If you look at the difference between the growth rate in our total revenues and our net revenues, the change and decline in fuel prices is the primary driver of that gap. 
We've talked in the past about how we believe that fuel is a pass-through in our business over time. When fuel is changing rapidly like it was during the first quarter, there can be timing differences and when surcharges adjust or can impact people's decisions on other pricing decisions, so we don't know that it's a perfect pass-through for every month every quarter. But every time, we are confident that it is. So you will hear comments about fuel when we go through each of the service lines. 
Similarly, you will hear about Freightquote. As a reminder, on the first of the year, we closed the acquisition of Freightquote, so it's a clean comparison and that the business began to cycle in on the first business day of 2015. So we've tried to do the best we could to highlight the impact by service area of the impact of Freightquote during the quarter. 
Lastly, I think it's important to understand that trained throughout the quarter as well too. If you remember a year ago, there was significant change going on in the industry and in our business and things change fairly aggressively throughout the first quarter a year ago. We talked last year about aggressive price changes in a very robust spot market in the March and April time frame versus a year ago. You will hear several comments by me and Chad around how our business is trending and how it's changing throughout the quarter. Our business this year is actually fairly stable sequentially from month-to-month as we grow, but our comparisons have changed quite a bit versus a year ago particularly around the net profit per shipment and truckload and some of the pricing metrics that I'll be sharing with you. 
So overall, a good quarter, and those are the things that you'll hear more as we progress through the comments. 
Moving them to Page 4, talking about our total transportation results for the first quarter of 2015. Similar to the enterprise, total revenues were up 5%. Total net revenues were up 15% for the quarter. 
We always like to highlight in the table below that there are a lot of factors that impact the transportation net revenue margin percentage. They are both cyclical and secular impacts that will impact these margins over time. 
As I mentioned earlier, the fuel impact in the first quarter of 2015 was pretty significant as that fuel price reduces and changes in the pass through of our customer and carrier impacts, it does have the impact of improving our net revenue margin percentage. 
There are also mixed issues with some additional LTL freight through the Freightquote acquisition coming in that can have a positive impact and then there are the supply and demand cycles of truckload that will fluctuate our margins as well.  So you can see 16.8% net revenue margins for the first quarter of 2015 in our overall transportation results. 
Moving on to Slide 5 in truckload, which is the largest portion of our transportation services. As you can see, the net revenues for the quarter increased 9.6%. Freightquote acquisition added approximately 3 percentage points to our truckload net revenue growth. 
So you see in the upper right-hand corner, our North American truckload volume grew 6% in the first quarter and Freightquote added about half of that volume growth. 
The approximate 3% volume growth without Freightquote is consistent with our growth pace from the past several quarters. It appears that the overall growth was slowing a bit at the end of the quarter, but that our volume growth was relatively consistent. I'll comment more on this later, but we have seen some acceleration in our volume growth in April. And again, as I talked in my opening comments a year ago, there was a lot of transition in the marketplace. We talked about making the price adjustments that we needed to, to adapt to those market conditions. The significance of increased in the amount of transactions that we were losing money on and how we were adjusting to the market conditions a year ago. We expected that at the beginning of this year that we would be running into more difficult comparisons from a profit per shipment and a net revenue margin standpoint as we got into the March and April time frame. 
We also expected that we would be continuing to add to our team and be more aggressively going after market share during this period, which is exactly what we're doing. 
If you look at the upper right-hand corner of Slide 5, again, around the North American truckload activity, the metrics that we shared, I try to help you understand the margin activity as our customer and cost pricing, which for the quarter was both approximately 6%. 
If you look at the trends throughout the first quarter, they were quite a bit different than that 6% average. 
In January, our average customer price increase was double-digit increase over the previous year. And by the end of the quarter, in March, it was low single digit increases and average prices through our customers. So what that reflects is a year ago, those price increases were being implemented throughout the quarter. And this year, as more stable pricing compared to it, the year-over-year increase flattened as the quarter progressed. 
We also talked a year ago about the very robust spot market that was accompanying the tension in the marketplace in March and April of a year ago. We believe this year that the spot market and demand activity has been much less versus a year ago. There have been some capacity additions and all in all, we believe the spot market has presented fewer opportunities to us, this March and April, that have an impact on our comparisons as well. 
Moving on them to Slide 6 in our LTL results for the first quarter. Net revenues increased 42% in the first quarter, and that includes our Freightquote net revenues. Freightquote was about 2/3 of its net revenue, it was derived from LTL, so that added approximately 34 percentage points to our net revenue growth. 
From a volume standpoint, LTL volumes grew 28% in the quarter and 19 percentage points of growth came as a result of the acquisition of Freightquote. 
From an integration standpoint, like we shared when we announced the deal that we do plan to integrate Freightquote. It is our expectation that through the majority of 2015, we will have reasonably meaningful quantified results of Freightquote to help you understand the impact as the year progresses. We are already deep into integration activities that have a sharing leads and sharing freight opportunities to cover truckload freight. So those numbers will get a little less meaningful as the year wears on, but it is our intent to integrate the businesses and share the freight around the appropriate segments with the North America Surface Transportation network. 
I think the overall message that we want to convey with Freightquote is that several months into it, we feel very good about our integration plans, we're on track. We're excited about our LTL position in the marketplace. We've had meetings with virtually all of our carrier partners in the marketplace and that one of our acquisition goals with Freightquote was to leverage our existing account management infrastructure that's in place with both our shippers and carriers and make sure that we can be a cost-efficient go-to-market strategy for our partners and to handle our customers activity more effectively in the marketplace. 
We also believe that we can help by making sure that the right freight is routed and tender to the appropriate carrier based on what they want and how their network is situated. And with the combined volume of C.H. Robinson and Freightquote, we're feeling very good about our position in the marketplace with regards to LTL services. 
Moving on to Slide 7 in our intermodal results for the quarter. Net revenue increased 17.6% in the first quarter, and volume was up 14% for the quarter. Once, again, Freightquote added approximately 10 percentage points to intermodal net revenue growth and approximately 10% percentage points to volume growth. 
So while Freightquote added to our growth for intermodal for the quarter, we do believe that the West Coast port delays negatively impacted our intermodal volumes given some of the congestion in the and inability of us to meet some of the service requirements with our rail activity. So a decent intermodal growth quarter, helped by Freightquote and hampered a little bit by West Coast port delays. 
Moving on then to our global forwarding ocean air and custom results for the first quarter of 2015. Freightquote does not have any international activities that is a growth opportunity and something that we do intend to pursue in the future. But in terms of the results for the first quarter of 2015, this represent all organic activities and no impact from Freightquote. 
It was another strong quarter for our global forwarding team. Net revenue for the global forwarding services increased overall 15.2% with ocean increasing 15.1%, air increased 18.2% and customs brokerage services were up 10% in net revenues for the quarter. 
As we've talked over the past couple of quarters, we continue to feel very confident about our integration activities from the Phoenix acquisition more than 2 years ago. We have good momentum and continue to make operational improvements. We're focused on cross-selling the legacy Robinson and Phoenix customers together to make sure that we're penetrating our customer base most effectively. And we continue to invest in our technology platform to improve our service offerings, our consolidation capabilities and our customer experience. 
Virtually all of the integration activity with the Phoenix acquisition is complete other than some ongoing technology investments that we will be making this year to continue to integrate the last parts of the global forwarding network.  We continue to feel very good about our service capability and our market position in global forwarding. 
Unlike intermodal, we do believe that the port delays on the West Coast probably helped our global forwarding business a little bit. We do know that several of our customers had difficult opportunities that we were able to help them with and in some cases, where customers were unable to get direct access to ocean capacity, we were able to help them with our capacity. So we do know of examples, and believe that our global forwarding results probably were helped somewhat by the West Coast port delays. It's difficult to quantify exactly what that would have done to our business because we would like to believe that would be able to help them in other ways if not for the delays, but we do believe that, while it negatively impacted our intermodal business, there probably was a positive impact in our global forwarding business for the first quarter of 2015. 
Moving on to Slide 9 in our other logistics services. Net revenues for the first quarter increased 6.6% compared to the first quarter of 2014. Freightquote did add approximately 2 percentage points to our other logistic services in the first quarter. 
As a reminder, again, these other logistics services include transportation management services, warehousing and small parcel. 
As we said in the previous couple quarters that we have had a slower growth of net revenue in other logistics services, primarily due to some project revenue in the miscellaneous categories that has gone away and it's not in the current periods. Our primary source of revenue in this category of managed services and transportation managed services continues to grow at a double-digit rate and continues to have a strong pipeline of new customers that we feel very confident about. This is a core growth initiative for us, and we do expect the net revenue growth to remain at double digits in the future as we transition through some of the project comparisons in our other logistics services. 
Moving on to Slide 10 in our sourcing net revenues for the quarter. Net revenues were up 11.6% in the first quarter of 2015. We talked last year about some of the customer transitions and difficulties that we had in the sourcing business in 2014.  In the first quarter of 2015, that 8.5% net revenue margin represents a return to a more normalized margins in terms of what we expect going forward. 
We also had 9% case volume during the first quarter of 2015, which we were happy with and represents some growth in some of the key commodities that we've been emphasizing in our area. 
So overall, it was more normalized activity in our sourcing business compared to weaker comparisons of a year ago. And back to activity that we would expect more normalized growth in the future. 
Those conclude my comments on our growth by service line. And at this point, I'll turn it over to Chad to make some comments on our income statement on Page 11."

I will focus on the variances and personnel expense and other SG&A expenses. 
Our personnel expense as a percentage of net revenue increased slightly compared to last year's first quarter. This increase was caused primarily by an increased incentive compensation and by the acquisition of Freightquote. 
Our incentive compensation philosophy and plans have stayed relatively consistent with previous years. The increase is based on the growth in net revenues and earnings we experienced during the first quarter. 
Last year's first quarter have low incentive compensation due to our lack of earnings growth. This comparison issue is primarily for the first quarter. During the second through fourth quarters of 2014, our earnings growth accelerated, and we have greater incentive compensation. The impact from the Freightquote acquisition will continue for the rest of the year. They do have a higher personnel to net revenue compared to the core C.H. Robinson business. 
Our SG&A expenses increased 10.1% in the first quarter, driven primarily by the Freightquote expenses, including the amortization expense of approximately $1.9 million for the quarter. 
We also had an increase in claims expense, partially offset by a reduction in our provision for doubtful accounts. 
I'm going to move on to Slide 12. We've had a strong free cash flow with cash flow from operations of approximately $100 million. 
In most first quarters, we have seasonally weaker cash flows compared to quarter 2 through quarter 4 as working capital tends to grow sequentially from increasing receivables and the bonus payments made in January. However, with the decrease in the price of fuel, our working capital did not grow as much as it usually does in the first quarter. 
Moving on to CapEx. We had CapEx of $6.7 million for the quarter, including our investments in software. We still expect total CapEx, including software to be about $40 million to $50 million for 2015. 
Included in this estimate is building a second data center for disaster recovery. Construction of that data center has not yet begun.  We expect to spend $15 million to $20 million on the data center in 2015, and we expect to put the data center in service sometime during 2016. 
Our total debt balance remain relatively consistent with the end of the year at $1.1 billion. 
Moving on to Slide 13. You can see that we have a long track record of significant cash distributions to our shareholders. We talked for the last year or so about our goal of distributing 90% of our net income to shareholders in most environments. We think we can do this while maintaining our debt-to-EBITDA ratio in the 1 to 1.5x range. The amount of share repurchase activity will vary based on our cash flow generation, needs for working capital and other capital needs.  We would be comfortable going to as high as 3x debt-to-EBITDA for the right investment opportunity. 
For; the quarter, we distributed approximately 98% of our net income to shareholders. We paid $57.3 million in cash dividends and spent $47.3 million repurchasing shares. 
With that, I will turn it back to John for our closing prepared comments."

I know maybe the most impactful statement that probably everybody has focused on is in our 2015 outlook. April, today, total company net revenue has increased approximately 6% per business day when compared to April of last year. I made a few comments relative to this earlier around our margin comparisons and how they are changing. The most impactful change when we look at our slowing net revenue growth in April compared to the overall growth rate for the first quarter. 
As I mentioned earlier, we have a decline in our net revenue per shipment of North American truckload given the change in margin comparison that I referenced earlier. 
I also commented that we are seeing some acceleration in our volume growth during the month of April, but again, it's very early, it's very difficult to forecast and predict what the market will be like. But to a large degree, we see 2015 playing out much as we had anticipated that as we got into the March and April time frame, that our comparisons will get more difficult. We do not necessarily anticipate a decline in our net revenue per shipment, but the fact that the margins were fairly healthy a year ago, it's not surprising to us that we would be where we're at from a pricing standpoint today with a much more modest increase year-over-year in April on contracted or committed business. 
I also commented that we have seen a fairly soft spot market for the last couple of weeks that can change quickly at any point in time. But based upon what we have seen thus far in April, we have gotten off to a soft start for the first part of April. 
Beyond sharing that data point with you, I guess, the other thing that we would like to emphasize is some of the areas of focus for us in 2015. I already commented, I want to reiterate that Freightquote performance did achieve our objectives in the first quarter, and we feel very good about the cultural fit and the integration initiatives that we have going on throughout 2015. 
We talked a lot over the last couple of years about our integration of Phoenix International and the significant effort that was involved with merging more than 25 offices, the systems conversion work around the world and a lot of personnel decisions that needed to be made around blending teams of 3,500 people across the world. 
The Freightquote acquisition does have some meaningful integration projects around segmentation and sharing leads and making sure that we capitalize on the efficiency of small customer activity that Freightquote brings the us, as well as leveraging some of the really good technology that the Freightquote business has. However, with all that business being located in -- primarily one location in Kansas City, there is not the same SG&A impact or risk for complexity around merging things that will take several years for us to do. So while we'll be working on the technology plant and some of the account management strategies over the next several years, the integration effort is quite a bit different than what we've discussed in our global forwarding business. 
In terms of sales and account management initiatives, this is something that we believe is a competitive strength for Robinson. I already mentioned our go-to-market initiatives as we've grown and diversified our business. It's important that we segment our offerings as efficient as we can be and how we approach our large and complex customers, as well as our smaller and transactional customers. 
We have a lot of initiatives under way that intertwined with the Freightquote acquisition around our go-to-market activities and focus on how we believe that we can better penetrate our customers across each segment. 
Cross-selling initiatives, like the example of global forwarding and domestic freight, cross-selling initiatives with our managed services and evolving a lot of our transportation relationships into more integrated supply chain solution type relationships are at the core part of that account management and sales initiatives that we're working on. 
So we do feel good about our investments in those initiatives. We talked about people process and technology being the core investments, the process part of account management and how we go to market, it is a very important part of what we think will help us maintain our competitive advantage in our market leadership position. 
Technology development, process efficiency and network optimization, I touched on this in a few different ways before, but we have a meaningful increase to our investment this year in our technology platform. The Navisphere platform that encompasses all our services and allows us to share information and share freight across our network, as well as integrating activities with our more complex customers to work on the supply chain solutions. 
All of our different service areas have a number of efficiency goals in our industry. There's a challenge that you need to add talent, that you need to add people in order to grow and service your customers, but at the same time, there's a balance of efficiency and leveraging productivity across your systems and across your teams that we're very committed to as well too. 
We have a team of balanced growth internally and our people process and technology where we're very focused on trying to balance the talent commitments and the hiring with leveraging the technology and the efficiency investments that we're making. 
Lastly, I talked about people already but acquiring and developing the best industry talent that we can find. We believe that has been and remains a competitive advantage for us. We are growing our workforce.  If you look sequentially, we have added people above and beyond that Freightquote team, and we do expect to continue that throughout the remainder of 2015. 
Chad talked about our variable personnel expenses driven by the growth of our business. We do feel that despite being able to add to our team throughout the remainder of 2015 that our operating expense comparisons will actually be more favorable as the year wears on given the changes in variable expenses. 
So it's important that we're investing in acquiring top talent. We're spending more on training than ever and making sure that we maintain the best team in the industry. 
That's the end of our prepared comments. So I will stop there and turn it over to Tim to facilitate our Q&A session."

So our primary revenue synergy is about segmentation and making sure that we're using the right account management practices to most effectively approach the market.

So as a company -- total net revenues that are up approximately 6%, and that does include Freightquote, which means that the balance of legacy activity is approximately flat. As I stated earlier, the primary reason for that decline in net revenue growth is a reduction in our net revenue per shipment in our North American truckload result. Offsetting that, we have actually had some increase in our truckload volume activity, and we have had growth in our other services of net revenue, but not for the first several weeks of April, not to the extent that we had in our first quarter. From a comparison standpoint, the net revenue per shipment in truckload a year ago remain fairly consistent through the second quarter, tapered off a little bit at the end. Some from a comparison standpoint, in that core net revenue category, the comparisons or the prior year activity will remain fairly constant and then tapered down a little bit in June. I mentioned earlier that, while we did anticipate it would be more difficult to grow our net revenue as the year progressed throughout 2015, we also believe that our comparisons from an operating expense standpoint, largely due to the increases in the previous year around variable compensation will make those comparisons slightly more favorable as we go forward. So we have not given up on our goal this year of double-digit earnings per share growth. We know that we have to continue to invest in that volume and grow our business aggressively throughout the remainder of the year. I also touched earlier on the spot market activity, the part that's most difficult to predict is just what short-term demand and spot market activity will be like really for all our services.

As the decrease in the price of fuel accelerated in the fourth quarter and into the first quarter. However, we also talked about earlier that our net revenues margins or profit per load increased as this year's last quarter went on. So it is difficult really to measure the impact of the 2 separately. Quarter one is typically a stronger net revenue margin quarter than quarter 4 as capacity is typically more available and demand is not as strong. It's hard to really be specific with what the balance was of fuel versus market sequentially. The addition of the Freightquote business also increased our net revenue margin as their business as a higher net revenue margin since it has a stronger focus on LTL net revenues."

Everything from the hours of service to the safety regulations, and there is more regulation pending around onboard computers and other things that have continued to increase. The cost of capacity as a trade off for some of the safety features or initiatives and regulation that will hopefully make the roads safer. That has been a challenge for our entire industry and for us to understand and pass through those causes and help our customers understand why those cost increases may be disproportionate to average prices in the marketplace. There has been discussion about whether or not those costs will disproportionately impact the medium and small carriers. It is possible that there is some incremental impact to those smaller carriers who were maybe the larger carriers have voluntarily made some of those investments in the past, but we do believe that the regulations are being somewhat sympathetic to the cost part of it and the capital requirements of those capabilities will continue to get invested in and become more efficient in the marketplace. So while we see it as an overall challenge for us in our industry, we're not overly concerned about a disproportionate impact on medium and small carriers. With regards to the competitive landscape and people investing in their owner logistics division, that is part of the secular changes that we've talked about for the last 4 or 5 years or more. The competitive landscape is changing with a number of carriers investing in brokerage or logistics divisions. We don't necessarily view that as a significant negative. In the longer run, we have believe that our third-party model of separating the capacity ownership and the capital investment from the customer service and go-to-market strategies can be a very effective way and the most effective way to serve a large part of the marketplace. As others continue to invest in that business model and more of the marketplace gets served by third-party or logistics type business model, we think that, that just reflect some of the secular changes and how we're all competing. So the market is more competitive. We're adopting to how things are changing and with regards to the business model that each of our competitors pursues around a blend of capital and logistics type stuff, we'll just have to factor that in to how we sell and how we grow in the marketplace."

I don't know that I can answer them all specifically. But if you look at the overall trend, over a longer period of time, several decades ago, we were almost 100% transactional with just all of our business being very spot market and realtime in the marketplace. The longer-term trend is that we've become more engaged with committed or contracted customers and a greater and greater percentage of our volume is pre-priced or pre-committed as we've become, not only a transactional broker, but also a 3PL core carrier that is dealing with dedicated capacity and committed shippers in a more committed and pre-priced way. If you look at the volatility in the truckload market over the last several years, it is true that many of those large shippers are as desirous as ever to pre-pricing or committing as much of the freight as possible from a pricing standpoint because of situations like a year ago where the market volatility demanded a significant premium to create, to get access to that spot market capacity and shippers rightly don't want to have exposure to those types of cost variances or cost increases. So while we have this period of sustained shortage and market tightness on the truckload side, it probably is the case that most shippers will continue to want to contract for more and more of their capacity, and we're working hard to provide those solutions in the marketplace by working on those committed bids and our business will probably continue to increase as a percentage of that activity. The spot market business comes and goes depending upon how the market behaves. When the market has a lot of demand and a lot of road guide failure like it did a year ago, you'll see significant extreme increases in that spot market activity. When it calms down and stabilizes more like it is now, we'll see a meaningful decline in that spot market. So our business mix and portfolio of mix changes as a result of the market activity more so than anything specifically that we're targeting."

Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. Looking at that Slide 3, our results for the first quarter 2015, our total revenues for the quarter were $3.3 billion or a 5% increase over 2014. Net revenues increased 14.8% to $525 million. Income from operati",2337,"Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. Looking at that Slide 3, our results for the first quarter 2015, our total revenues for the quarter were $3.3 billion or a 5% increase over 2014. Net revenues increased 14.8% to $525 million. Income from operations, $181.9 million or a 15.9% increase. And our earnings per share were up 16% at $0.73 per share for the quarter compared to $0.63 for a year ago.  Those are our key financial metrics and our overall results for the quarter that we were happy with. 
If you look at sort of the trends and themes that you will hear as we add our commentaries to the quarter, I think sort of one of the highlights is the impact of fuel during the quarter. If you look at the difference between the growth rate in our total revenues and our net revenues, the change and decline in fuel prices is the primary driver of that gap. 
We've talked in the past about how we believe that fuel is a pass-through in our business over time. When fuel is changing rapidly like it was during the first quarter, there can be timing differences and when surcharges adjust or can impact people's decisions on other pricing decisions, so we don't know that it's a perfect pass-through for every month every quarter, but over time, we're confident that it is. So you will hear comments about fuel when we go through each of the service lines. 
Similarly, you will hear about Freightquote. As a reminder, on the 1st of the year, we closed the acquisition of Freightquote, so it's a clean comparison in that the business began to cycle in on the first business day of 2015. So we've tried to do the best we could to highlight the impact by service area of the impact of Freightquote during the quarter. 
Lastly, I think it's important to understand that trends throughout the quarter as well, too. If you remember a year ago, there was significant change going on in the industry and in our business, and things change fairly aggressively throughout the first quarter a year ago. We talked last year about aggressive price changes in a very robust spot market in the March and April time frame versus a year ago. You will hear several comments by me and Chad around how our business is trending and how it was changing throughout the quarter. Our business this year is actually fairly stable, sequentially, from month-to-month, as we grow, but our comparisons have changed quite a bit versus a year ago, particularly around the net profit per shipment in truckload and some of the pricing metrics that I'll be sharing with you. 
So overall, a good quarter, and those are the themes that you'll hear more of as we progress through the comments. 
Moving then to Page 4, talking about our total transportation results for the first quarter of 2015. Similar to the enterprise, total revenues were up 5%. Total net revenues were up 15% for the quarter. 
We always like to highlight in the table below that there are a lot of factors that impact the transportation net revenue margin percentage. There are both cyclical and secular impacts that will impact these margins over time. 
As I mentioned earlier, the fuel impact in the first quarter of 2015 was pretty significant. As that fuel price reduces and changes in the pass-through of our customer and carrier impacts, it does have the impact of improving our net revenue margin percentage. 
There are also mix issues with some additional LTL freight through the Freightquote acquisition coming in that can have a positive impact, and then there are the supply and demand cycles of truckload that will fluctuate our margins as well.  So you can see 16.8% net revenue margins for the first quarter of 2015 in our overall transportation results. 
Moving on to Slide 5, and truckload, which is the largest portion of our transportation services. As you can see, the net revenues for the quarter increased 9.6%. Freightquote acquisition added approximately 3 percentage points to our truckload net revenue growth.  If you see in the upper right-hand corner, our North American truckload volume grew 6% in the first quarter, and Freightquote added about half of that volume growth. 
Approximate 3% volume growth without Freightquote is consistent with our growth pace from the past several quarters. It appears that the overall growth was slowing a bit at the end of the quarter but that our volume growth was relatively consistent. I'll comment more on this later, but we have seen some acceleration in our volume growth in April. And again, as we -- as I talked in my opening comments, a year ago, there was a lot of transition in the marketplace. We talked about making the price adjustments that we needed to, to adapt to those market conditions, the significance of increased in the amount of transactions that we were losing money on and how we were adjusting to the market conditions a year ago. 
We expected at the beginning of this year that we would be running in to more difficult comparisons from a profit per shipment and a net revenue margin standpoint as we got into the March and April time frame.  We also expected that we would be continuing to add to our team and be more aggressively going after market share during this period, which is exactly what we're doing. 
If you look at the upper right-hand corner of Slide 5, again, around the North American truckload activity, the metrics that we shared to try to help you understand the margin activity as our customer and cost pricing, which for the quarter was both approximately 6%.  If you look at the trends throughout the first quarter, they were quite a bit different than that 6% average.  In January, our average customer price increase was double-digit increase over the previous year; and by the end of the quarter, in March, it was low single-digit increases in average prices through our customers. So what that reflects is, a year ago, those price increases were being implemented throughout the quarter, and this year, as more stable pricing compared to it, the year-over-year increase flattened as the quarter progressed. 
We also talked a year ago about the very robust spot market that was accompanying the tension in the marketplace in March and April of a year ago. We believe this year that the spot market and demand activity has been much less versus a year ago. There have been some capacity additions, and, all in all, we believe the spot market has presented fewer opportunities to us, this March and April, that have had an impact on our comparisons as well. 
Moving on then to Slide 6 and our LTL results for the first quarter. Net revenues increased 42% in the first quarter, and that includes our Freightquote net revenues. Freightquote was -- about 2/3 of its net revenue was derived from LTL, so that added approximately 34% to our net -- 34 percentage points to our net revenue growth.  From a volume standpoint, LTL volumes grew 28% in the quarter, and 19 percentage points of growth came as a result of the acquisition of Freightquote. 
From an integration standpoint, I think we shared when we announced the deal that we do plan to integrate Freightquote. It is our expectation that through the majority of 2015, we will have reasonably meaningful quantified results of Freightquote to help you understand the impact as the year progresses. We are already deep into integration activities that have a sharing leads and sharing freight opportunities to cover truckload freight. So those numbers will get a little less meaningful as the year wears on, but it is our intent to integrate the businesses and share the freight around the appropriate segments with the North America Surface Transportation network. 
I think, the overall message that we want to convey with Freightquote is that several months into it, we feel very good about our integration plans. We're on track. We're excited about our LTL position in the marketplace. We've had meetings with, virtually, all of our carrier partners in the marketplace, and that one of our acquisition goals with Freightquote was to leverage our existing account management infrastructure that's in place with both our shippers and carriers and make sure that we can be a cost-efficient go-to-market strategy for our partners, and to handle our customers activity more effectively in the marketplace. 
We also believe that we can help by making sure that the right freight is routed and tendered through the appropriate carrier, based on what they want and how their network is situated. And with the combined volume of C.H. Robinson and Freightquote, we're feeling very good about our position in the marketplace with regards to LTL services. 
Moving on to Slide 7 and our intermodal results for the quarter. Net revenue increased 17.6% in the first quarter, and volume was up 14% for the quarter. Once again, Freightquote added approximately 10 percentage points to intermodal net revenue growth and approximately 10 percentage points to volume growth. 
So while Freightquote added to our growth in intermodal for the quarter, we do believe that the West Coast port delays negatively impacted our intermodal volumes, given some of the congestion in the and the inability of us to meet some of the service requirements with our rail activity. So a decent intermodal growth quarter, helped by Freightquote and hampered a little bit by West Coast port delays. 
Moving on then to our global forwarding ocean, air and custom results for the first quarter of 2015. Freightquote does not have any international activities that is a growth opportunity and something that we do intend to pursue in the future. But in terms of the results for the first quarter of 2015, this represent all organic activities and no impact from Freightquote. 
It was another strong quarter for our global forwarding team. Net revenue for the global forwarding services increased overall 15.2%, with ocean increasing 15.1%, air increased 18.2% and customs brokerage services were up 10% in net revenues for the quarter. 
As we've talked over the past couple of quarters, we continue to feel very confident about our integration activities from the Phoenix acquisition more than 2 years ago. We have good momentum and continue to make operational improvements. We're focused on cross-selling the legacy Robinson and Phoenix customers together to make sure that we're penetrating our customer base most effectively. And we continue to invest in our technology platform to improve our service offerings, our consolidation capabilities and our customer experience. 
Virtually all of the integration activity with the Phoenix acquisition is complete, other than some ongoing technology investments that we will be making this year to continue to integrate the last parts of the global forwarding network.  We continue to feel very good about our service capability and our market position in global forwarding. 
Unlike intermodal, we do believe that the port delays on the West Coast probably helped our global forwarding business a little bit. We do know that several of our customers had difficult opportunities that we were able to help them with. And in some cases where customers were unable to get direct access to ocean capacity, we were able to help them with our capacity. So we do know of examples and believe that our global forwarding results probably were helped somewhat by the West Coast port delays. It's difficult to quantify exactly what that would have done to our business, because we would like to believe that would have been able to help them in other ways, if not for the delays. But we do believe that, while it negatively impacted our intermodal business, there probably was a positive impact on  our global forwarding business for the first quarter of 2015. 
Moving on to Slide 9 and our other logistics services. Net revenues for the first quarter increased 6.6% compared to the first quarter of 2014. Freightquote did add approximately 2 percentage points to our other logistics services in the first quarter.  
As a reminder, again, these other logistics services include transportation management services, warehousing and small parcel.  As we said in the previous couple of quarters that we have had a slower growth of net revenue in other logistics services primarily due to some project revenue in the miscellaneous categories that has gone away, and it's not in the current periods, our primary source of revenue in this category of managed services and transportation-managed services continues to grow at a double-digit rate and continues to have a strong pipeline of new customers that we feel very confident about. This is a core growth initiative for us, and we do expect the net revenue growth to remain at double digits in the future, as we transition through some of the project comparisons in our other logistics services. 
Moving on to Slide 10 and our sourcing net revenues for the quarter. Net revenues were up 11.6% in the first quarter of 2015. We talked last year about some of the customer transitions and difficulties that we had in the sourcing business in 2014.  In the first quarter of 2015, that 8.5% net revenue margin represents a return to a more normalized margins in terms of what we expect going forward. 
We also had 9% case volume during the first quarter of 2015, which we were happy with, and represents some growth in some of the key commodities that we've been emphasizing in our area.  So overall, it was more normalized activity in our sourcing business compared to weaker comparisons of a year ago and back to activity that we would expect more normalized growth in the future. 
Those conclude my comments on our growth by service line. And at this point, I'll turn it over to Chad to make some comments on our income statement on Page 11."

I will focus on the variances and personnel expense and other SG&A expenses. 
Our personnel expense as a percentage of net revenue increased slightly compared to last year's first quarter. This increase was caused primarily by  increased incentive compensation and by the acquisition of Freightquote. 
Our incentive compensation philosophy and plans have stayed relatively consistent with previous years. The increase is based on the growth in net revenues and earnings we experienced during the first quarter. 
Last year's first quarter have low incentive compensation due to our lack of earnings growth. This comparison issue was primarily for the first quarter. During the second through fourth quarters of 2014, our earnings growth accelerated, and we had greater incentive compensation. The impact from the Freightquote acquisition will continue for the rest of the year. They do have a higher personnel to net revenue compared to the core C.H. Robinson business. 
Our SG&A expenses increased 10.1% in the first quarter, driven primarily by the Freightquote expenses, including the amortization expense of approximately $1.9 million for the quarter. 
We also had an increase in claims expense, partially offset by a reduction in our provision for doubtful accounts. 
I'm going to move on to Slide 12. We've had a strong free cash flow quarter with cash flow from operations of approximately $100 million. 
In most first quarters, we have seasonally weaker cash flows compared to quarter 2 through quarter 4, as working capital tends to grow sequentially from increasing receivables and the bonus payments made in January. However, with the decrease in the price of fuel, our working capital did not grow as much as that usually does in the first quarter. 
Moving on to CapEx. We had CapEx of $6.7 million for the quarter, including our investments in software. We still expect total CapEx, including software, to be about $40 million to $50 million for 2015.  Included in this estimate is building a second data center for disaster recovery. Construction of that data center has not yet begun.  We expect to spend $15 million to $20 million on the data center in 2015, and we expect to put the data center in service some time during 2016. 
Our total debt balance remained relatively consistent with the end of the year at $1.1 billion. 
Moving on to Slide 13. You can see that we have a long track record of significant cash distributions to our shareholders. We talked for the last year or so about our goal of distributing 90% of our net income to shareholders in most environments, we think we can do this while maintaining our debt-to-EBITDA ratio in the 1 to 1.5x range. The amount of share repurchase activity will vary based on our cash flow generation, needs for working capital and other capital needs.  We would be comfortable going to as high as 3x debt-to-EBITDA for the right investment opportunity. 
For the quarter, we distributed approximately 98% of our net income to shareholders. We paid $57.3 million in cash dividends and spent $47.3 million repurchasing shares. 
With that, I will turn it back to John for our closing prepared comments."
368470,290649653,795637,"CH Robinson Worldwide Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2015",2015-04-28,"Earnings Calls","C.H.

I made a few comments relative to this earlier around our margin comparisons and how they are changing, the most impactful change when we look at our slowing net revenue growth in April compared to the overall growth rate for the first quarter. As I mentioned earlier, we have a decline in our net revenue per shipment of North American truckload given the change in margin comparison that I referenced earlier. 
I also commented that we are seeing some acceleration in our volume growth during the month of April. But again, it's very early. It's very difficult to forecast and predict what the market will be like. But to a large degree, we see 2015 playing out much as we had anticipated that, as we got into the March and April time frame, that our comparisons would get more difficult. We do not necessarily anticipate a decline in our net revenue per shipment, but the fact that the margins were fairly healthy a year ago, it's not surprising to us that we would be where we're at from a pricing standpoint today with a much more modest increase year-over-year in April on contracted or committed business. 
I also commented that we have seen a fairly soft spot market for the last couple of weeks that can change quickly at any point in time, but based upon what we have seen thus far in April, we have gotten off to a soft start for the first part of April. 
Beyond sharing that data point with you, I guess, the other thing that we would like to emphasize is some of the areas of focus for us in 2015. I already commented and want to reiterate that Freightquote performance did achieve our objectives in the first quarter, and we feel very good about the cultural fit and the integration initiatives that we have going on throughout 2015. 
We talked a lot over the last couple of years about our integration of Phoenix International and the significant effort that was involved with merging more than 25 offices, the systems conversion work around the world and a lot of personnel decisions that needed to be made around blending teams of 3,500 people across the world. 
The Freightquote acquisition does have some meaningful integration projects around segmentation and sharing leads and making sure that we capitalize on the efficiency of small customer activity that Freightquote brings the us as well as leveraging some of the really good technology that the Freightquote business has. However, with all of that business being located in primarily one location in Kansas City, there is not the same SG&A impact or risk for complexity around merging things that will take several years for us to do. So while we'll be working on the technology plan and some of the account management strategies over the next several years, the integration effort is quite a bit different than what we discussed in our global forwarding business. 
In terms of sales and account management initiatives, this is something that we believe is a competitive strength for Robinson. I already mentioned our go-to-market initiatives. As we've grown and diversified our business, it's important that we segment our offerings and are -- as efficient as we can be in how we approach our large and complex customers as well as our smaller and transactional customers. 
We have a lot of initiatives under way that intertwine with the Freightquote acquisition around our go-to-market activities and focused on how we believe that we can better penetrate our customers across each segment. 
Cross-selling initiatives. Like the example of global forwarding and domestic freight, cross-selling initiatives with our managed services and evolving a lot of our transportation relationships into more integrated supply chain solution-type relationships are at a core part of that account management and sales initiatives that we're working on. 
So we do feel good about our investments in those initiatives. We talk about people, process and technology being the core investments. The process part of account management and how we go to market, it is a very important part of what we think will help us maintain our competitive advantage and our market leadership position. 
Technology development, process efficiency and network optimization, touched on this in a few different ways before, but we have a meaningful increase to our investment this year in our technology platform, the Navisphere platform that encompasses all of our services and allows us to share information and share freight across our network as well as integrating activities with our more complex customers to work on the supply chain solutions. 
All of our different service areas have a number of efficiency goals in our industry. There is a challenge that you need to add talent and you need to add people in order to grow and service your customers. But at the same time, there is a balance of efficiency and leveraging productivity across your systems and across your teams that we're very committed to as well, too.
We have a team of balanced growth internally and our people, process and technology, where we're very focused on trying to balance the talent commitments and the hiring with leveraging the technology and the efficiency investments that we're making. 
Lastly, I talked about people already. But acquiring and developing the best industry talent that we can find, we believe that has been and remains a competitive advantage for us. We are growing our workforce.  If you look sequentially, we have added people above and beyond that Freightquote team, and we do expect to continue that throughout the remainder of 2015. 
Chad talked about our variable personnel expenses driven by the growth of our business. We do feel that, despite being able to add to our team throughout the remainder of 2015, that our operating expense comparisons will actually be more favorable as the year wears on, given the changes in variable expenses.  So it's important that we're investing in acquiring top talent. We're spending more on training than ever and making sure that we maintain the best team in the industry. 
That's the end of our prepared comments. So I will stop there and turn it over to Tim to facilitate our Q&A session."

I mentioned earlier that we have seen some acceleration in April of our North American truckload volume, and we do have confidence that we can achieve those longer-term targets primarily through organic growth. Freightquote is a good example of where we did find an opportunity to acquire and create a lot more volume in our system. We try to be very fair about highlighting that activity as separate and, above and beyond, what our organic growth targets are. So we will continue to look for acquisitions, but our core 7% to 12% EPS growth, we believe will be primarily driven by organic growth."

We talked about Freightquote having systems and processes that were geared to be very efficient with small customers, everything from the data entry and the pricing and quoting technique, so that a customer can get information very quickly and in a very automated way through their e-commerce solutions. So our primary revenue synergy is about segmentation and making sure that we're using the right account management practices to most effectively approach the market. If you look at it from a net revenue margin standpoint, we think the primary synergy opportunity is in the truckload sector around utilizing the C.H. Robinson network to more effectively and efficiently provide truckload services to those small customers that Freightquote has as well as additional small customers and penetrating that segment in the marketplace. From an operating expense standpoint, there are some opportunities to leverage a broader infrastructure and some of the costs, but the principal investment around people and operating expenses has limited synergy opportunity. So the real upside for us is to penetrate the market more effectively and improve our margins over time by being more effective in our account management practices."

So the company -- total net revenues, that are up approximately 6%, and that does include Freightquote, which means that the balance of legacy activity is approximately flat. As I stated earlier, the primary reason for that decline in net revenue growth is a reduction in our net revenue per shipment in our North American truckload results. Offsetting that, we have actually had some increase in our truckload volume activity, and we have had growth in our other services of net revenue, but not -- for the first several weeks of April, not to the extent that we had in our first quarter. From a comparison standpoint, the net revenue per shipment in truckload a year ago remained fairly consistent through the second quarter, tapered off a little bit at the end. Some from a comparison standpoint, in that core net revenue category, the comparisons or the prior year activity will remain fairly constant and then taper down a little bit in June. I mentioned earlier that while we did anticipate it would be more difficult to grow our net revenue as the year progress throughout 2015, we also believe that our comparisons from an operating expense standpoint, largely due to the increases in the previous year around variable compensation, will make those comparisons slightly more favorable as we go forward. So we have not given up on our goal this year of double-digit earnings per share growth. We know that we have to continue to invest in that volume and grow our business aggressively throughout the remainder of the year. I also touched earlier on the spot market activity, the part that's most difficult to predict is just what short-term demand and spot market activity will be like really for all our services, but again, North America truckload is the largest. We don't know where that will go, but we are hopeful that we will see some strengthening in those opportunities as the year progresses as well."

That has been a challenge for our entire industry and for us to understand and pass-through those causes and help our customers understand why those cost increases may be disproportionate to average prices in the marketplace. There has been discussion about whether or not those costs will disproportionately impact the medium and small carriers. It is possible that there is some incremental impact to those smaller carriers, who were maybe the larger carriers have voluntarily made some of those investments in the past. But we do believe that the regulations are being somewhat sympathetic to the cost part of it and the capital requirements of those capabilities will continue to get invested in and become more efficient in the marketplace. So while we see it as a overall challenge for us and our industry, we're not overly concerned about a disproportionate impact on medium and small carriers. With regards to the competitive landscape and people investing in their owner logistics division, that is part of the secular changes that we've talked about for the last 4 or 5 years or more. The competitive landscape is changing with a number of carriers investing in brokerage or logistics divisions. We don't necessarily view that as a significant negative. In the longer run, we have believed that our third-party model of separating the capacity ownership and the capital investment from the customer service and go-to-market strategies can be a very effective way and the most effective way to serve a large part of the marketplace. As others continue to invest in that business model and more of the marketplace gets served by a third-party or logistics-type business model, we think that, that just reflects some of the secular changes in how we're all competing. So the market is more competitive. We are adapting to how things are changing. And with regards to the business model that each of our competitors pursues around a blend of capital and logistics type stuff, we'll just have to factor that in to how we sell and how we grow in the marketplace."

I don't know that I can answer them all specifically. But if you look at the overall trend over a longer period of time, several decades ago, we were almost 100% transactional, with just all of our business being very spot market and real-time in the marketplace. The longer-term trend is that we've become more engaged with committed or contracted customers and a greater and greater percentage of our volume is pre-priced or pre-committed as we've become, not only a transactional broker, but also a 3PL core carrier that is dealing with dedicated capacity and committed shippers in a more committed and pre-priced way. If you look at the volatility in the truckload market over the last several years, it is true that many of those large shippers are as desirous as ever to pre-pricing or committing as much of the freight as possible from a pricing standpoint because of situations like a year ago, where the market volatility demanded a significant premium to get access to that spot market capacity and shippers rightly don't want to have exposure to those types of cost variances or cost increases. So while we have this period of sustained shortage and market tightness on the truckload side, it probably is the case that most shippers will continue to want to contract for more and more of their capacity. And we are working hard to provide those solutions in the marketplace by working on those committed bids, and our business will probably continue to increase as a percentage of that activity. The spot market business comes and goes, depending upon how the market behaves. When the market has a lot of demand and a lot of route guide failure like it did a year ago, you'll see significant extreme increases in that spot market activity. When it calms down and stabilizes more like it is now, we'll see a meaningful decline in that spot market. So our business mix and portfolio of mix changes as a result of the market activity more so than anything specifically that we're targeting."

Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. Looking at that Slide 3, our results for the first quarter 2015, our total revenues for the quarter were $3.3 billion or a 5% increase over 2014. Net revenues increased 14.8% to $525 million. Income from operati",2337,"Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. Looking at that Slide 3, our results for the first quarter 2015, our total revenues for the quarter were $3.3 billion or a 5% increase over 2014. Net revenues increased 14.8% to $525 million. Income from operations, $181.9 million or a 15.9% increase. And our earnings per share were up 16% at $0.73 per share for the quarter compared to $0.63 for a year ago.  Those are our key financial metrics and our overall results for the quarter that we were happy with. 
If you look at sort of the trends and themes that you will hear as we add our commentaries to the quarter, I think sort of one of the highlights is the impact of fuel during the quarter. If you look at the difference between the growth rate in our total revenues and our net revenues, the change and decline in fuel prices is the primary driver of that gap. We've talked in the past about how we believe that fuel is a pass-through in our business over time. When fuel is changing rapidly like it was during the first quarter, there can be timing differences in when surcharges adjust or it can impact people's decisions on other pricing decisions. So we don't know that it's a perfect pass-through for every month or every quarter, but over time, we're confident that it is. So you will hear comments about fuel when we go through each of the service lines. 
Similarly, you will hear about Freightquote. As a reminder, on the 1st of the year, we closed the acquisition of Freightquote, so it's a clean comparison in that the business began to cycle in on the first business day of 2015. So we've tried to do the best we could to highlight the impact by service area of the impact of Freightquote during the quarter. 
Lastly, I think it's important to understand the trends throughout the quarter as well, too. If you remember a year ago, there was significant change going on in the industry and in our business, and things changed fairly aggressively throughout the first quarter a year ago. We talked last year about aggressive price changes in a very robust spot market in the March and April time frame versus a year ago. You will hear several comments by me and Chad around how our business is trending and how it was changing throughout the quarter. Our business this year is actually fairly stable, sequentially, from month-to-month, as we grow, but our comparisons have changed quite a bit versus a year ago, particularly around the net profit per shipment in truckload and some of the pricing metrics that I'll be sharing with you.  So overall, a good quarter, and those are the themes that you'll hear more of as we progress through the comments. 
Moving then to Page 4, talking about our total transportation results for the first quarter of 2015. Similar to the enterprise, total revenues were up 5%. Total net revenues were up 15% for the quarter. We always like to highlight in the table below that there are a lot of factors that impact the transportation net revenue margin percentage. There are both cyclical and secular impacts that will impact these margins over time.  As I mentioned earlier, the fuel impact in the first quarter of 2015 was pretty significant. As that fuel price reduces and changes in the pass-through of our customer and carrier impacts, it does have the impact of improving our net revenue margin percentage.  There are also mix issues with some additional LTL freight through the Freightquote acquisition coming in that can have a positive impact, and then there are the supply and demand cycles of truckload that will fluctuate our margins as well.  So you can see 16.8% net revenue margins for the first quarter of 2015 in our overall transportation results. 
Moving on to Slide 5, and truckload, which is the largest portion of our transportation services. As you can see, the net revenues for the quarter increased 9.6%. Freightquote acquisition added approximately 3 percentage points to our truckload net revenue growth.  If you see in the upper right-hand corner, our North American truckload volume grew 6% in the first quarter, and Freightquote added about half of that volume growth. 
Approximate 3% volume growth without Freightquote is consistent with our growth pace from the past several quarters. It appears that the overall growth was slowing a bit at the end of the quarter but that our volume growth was relatively consistent. I'll comment more on this later, but we have seen some acceleration in our volume growth in April. And again, as we -- as I talked in my opening comments, a year ago, there was a lot of transition in the marketplace. We talked about making the price adjustments that we needed to, to adapt to those market conditions, the significance of increased in the amount of transactions that we were losing money on and how we were adjusting to the market conditions a year ago. We expected at the beginning of this year that we would be running in to more difficult comparisons from a profit per shipment and a net revenue margin standpoint as we got into the March and April time frame.  We also expected that we would be continuing to add to our team and be more aggressively going after market share during this period, which is exactly what we're doing. 
If you look at the upper right-hand corner of Slide 5, again, around the North American truckload activity, the metrics that we shared to try to help you understand the margin activity is our customer and cost pricing, which for the quarter was both approximately 6%.  If you look at the trends throughout the first quarter, they were quite a bit different than that 6% average.  In January, our average customer price increase was double-digit increase over the previous year; and by the end of the quarter, in March, it was low single-digit increases in average prices to our customers. So what that reflects is, a year ago, those price increases were being implemented throughout the quarter, and this year, as more stable pricing compared to it, the year-over-year increase flattened as the quarter progressed. 
We also talked a year ago about the very robust spot market that was accompanying the tension in the marketplace in March and April of a year ago. We believe this year that the spot market and demand activity has been much less versus a year ago. There have been some capacity additions, and, all in all, we believe the spot market has presented fewer opportunities to us, this March and April, that have had an impact on our comparisons as well. 
Moving on then to Slide 6 and our LTL results for the first quarter. Net revenues increased 42% in the first quarter, and that includes our Freightquote net revenues. Freightquote was -- about 2/3 of its net revenue was derived from LTL, so that added approximately 34% to our net -- 34 percentage points to our net revenue growth.  From a volume standpoint, LTL volumes grew 28% in the quarter, and 19 percentage points of growth came as a result of the acquisition of Freightquote. 
From an integration standpoint, I think we shared when we announced the deal that we do plan to integrate Freightquote. It is our expectation that through the majority of 2015, we will have reasonably meaningful quantified results of Freightquote to help you understand the impact as the year progresses. We are already deep into integration activities that have us sharing leads and sharing freight opportunities to cover truckload freight. So those numbers will get a little less meaningful as the year wears on, but it is our intent to integrate the businesses and share the freight around the appropriate segments with the North America Surface Transportation network. 
I think the overall message that we want to convey with Freightquote is that several months into it, we feel very good about our integration plans. We're on track. We're excited about our LTL position in the marketplace. We've had meetings with virtually all of our carrier partners in the marketplace, and that one of our acquisition goals with Freightquote was to leverage our existing account management infrastructure that's in place with both our shippers and carriers and make sure that we can be a cost-efficient go-to-market strategy for our partners, and to handle our customers activity more effectively in the marketplace. We also believe that we can help by making sure that the right freight is routed and tendered to the appropriate carrier, based on what they want and how their network is situated. And with the combined volume of C.H. Robinson and Freightquote, we're feeling very good about our position in the marketplace with regards to LTL services. 
Moving on to Slide 7 and our intermodal results for the quarter. Net revenue increased 17.6% in the first quarter, and volume was up 14% for the quarter. Once again, Freightquote added approximately 10 percentage points to intermodal net revenue growth and approximately 10 percentage points to volume growth.  So while Freightquote added to our growth in intermodal for the quarter, we do believe that the West Coast port delays negatively impacted our intermodal volumes, given some of the congestion and the inability of us to meet some of the service requirements with our rail activity. So a decent intermodal growth quarter, helped by Freightquote and hampered a little bit by West Coast port delays. 
Moving on then to our global forwarding ocean, air and custom results for the first quarter of 2015. Freightquote does not have any international activities. That is a growth opportunity and something that we do intend to pursue in the future. But in terms of the results for the first quarter of 2015, these represent all organic activities and no impact from Freightquote.  It was another strong quarter for our global forwarding team. Net revenue for the global forwarding services increased overall 15.2%, with ocean increasing 15.1%, air increased 18.2% and customs brokerage services were up 10% in net revenues for the quarter. 
As we've talked over the past couple of quarters, we continue to feel very confident about our integration activities from the Phoenix acquisition more than 2 years ago. We have good momentum and continue to make operational improvements. We're focused on cross-selling the legacy Robinson and Phoenix customers together to make sure that we're penetrating our customer base most effectively. And we continue to invest in our technology platform to improve our service offerings, our consolidation capabilities and our customer experience.  Virtually all of the integration activity with the Phoenix acquisition is complete, other than some ongoing technology investments that we will be making this year to continue to integrate the last parts of the global forwarding network.  We continue to feel very good about our service capability and our market position in global forwarding. 
Unlike intermodal, we do believe that the port delays on the West Coast probably helped our global forwarding business a little bit. We do know that several of our customers had difficult opportunities that we were able to help them with. And in some cases where customers were unable to get direct access to ocean capacity, we were able to help them with our capacity. So we do know of examples and believe that our global forwarding results probably were helped somewhat by the West Coast port delays. It's difficult to quantify exactly what that would have done to our business, because we would like to believe that would have been able to help them in other ways, if not for the delays. But we do believe that, while it negatively impacted our intermodal business, there probably was a positive impact on our global forwarding business for the first quarter of 2015. 
Moving on to Slide 9 and our other logistics services. Net revenues for the first quarter increased 6.6% compared to the first quarter of 2014. Freightquote did add approximately 2 percentage points to our other logistics services in the first quarter.  As a reminder, again, these other logistics services include transportation management services, warehousing and small parcel.  As we said in the previous couple quarters that we have had a slower growth of net revenue in other logistics services primarily due to some project revenue in the miscellaneous categories that has gone away and is not in the current periods. Our primary source of revenue in this category of managed services and transportation managed services continues to grow at a double-digit rate and continues to have a strong pipeline of new customers that we feel very confident about. This is a core growth initiative for us, and we do expect the net revenue growth to remain at double digits in the future, as we transition through some of the project comparisons in our other logistics services. 
Moving on to Slide 10 and our sourcing net revenues for the quarter. Net revenues were up 11.6% in the first quarter of 2015. We talked last year about some of the customer transitions and difficulties that we had in the sourcing business in 2014.  In the first quarter of 2015, that 8.5% net revenue margin represents a return to a more normalized margins in terms of what we expect going forward. We also had 9% case volume during the first quarter of 2015, which we were happy with, and represents some growth in some of the key commodities that we've been emphasizing in our area.  So overall, it was more normalized activity in our sourcing business compared to weaker comparisons of a year ago and back to activity that we would expect more normalized growth in the future. 
Those conclude my comments on our growth by service line. And at this point, I'll turn it over to Chad to make some comments on our income statement on Page 11."

I will focus on the variances in personnel expense and other SG&A expenses. 
Our personnel expenses as a percentage of net revenue increased slightly compared to last year's first quarter. This increase was caused primarily by increased incentive compensation and by the acquisition of Freightquote.  Our incentive compensation philosophy and plans have stayed relatively consistent with previous years. The increase is based on the growth in net revenues and earnings we experienced during the first quarter. Last year's first quarter have low incentive compensation due to our lack of earnings growth. This comparison issue was primarily for the first quarter. During the second through fourth quarters of 2014, our earnings growth accelerated, and we had greater incentive compensation. The impact from the Freightquote acquisition will continue for the rest of the year. They do have a higher personnel to net revenue compared to the core C.H. Robinson business. 
Our SG&A expenses increased 10.1% in the first quarter, driven primarily by the Freightquote expenses, including the amortization expense of approximately $1.9 million for the quarter. We also had an increase in claims expense, partially offset by a reduction in our provision for doubtful accounts. 
I'm going to move on to Slide 12. We had a strong free cash flow quarter with cash flow from operations of approximately $100 million. In most first quarters, we have seasonally weaker cash flows compared to quarter 2 through quarter 4, as working capital tends to grow sequentially from increasing receivables and the bonus payments made in January. However, with the decrease in the price of fuel, our working capital did not grow as much as it usually does in the first quarter. 
Moving on to CapEx. We had CapEx of $6.7 million for the quarter, including our investments in software. We still expect total CapEx, including software, to be about $40 million to $50 million for 2015.  Included in this estimate is building a second data center for disaster recovery. Construction of that data center has not yet begun.  We expect to spend $15 million to $20 million on the data center in 2015, and we expect to put the data center in service some time during 2016. Our total debt balance remained relatively consistent with the end of the year at $1.1 billion. 
Moving on to Slide 13. You can see that we have a long track record of significant cash distributions to our shareholders. We talked for the last year or so about our goal of distributing 90% of our net income to shareholders in most environments. We think we can do this while maintaining our debt-to-EBITDA ratio in the 1 to 1.5x range. The amount of share repurchase activity will vary based on our cash flow generation, needs for working capital and other capital needs.  We would be comfortable going to as high as 3x debt-to-EBITDA for the right investment opportunity.  For the quarter, we distributed approximately 98% of our net income to shareholders. We paid $57.3 million in cash dividends and spent $47.3 million repurchasing shares. 
With that, I will turn it back to John for our closing prepared comments."

I made a few comments relative to this earlier around our margin comparisons and how they are changing. The most impactful change when we look at our slowing net revenue growth in April compared to the overall growth rate for the first quarter. As I mentioned earlier, we have a decline in our net revenue per shipment of North American truckload given the change in margin comparison that I referenced earlier. 
I also commented that we are seeing some acceleration in our volume growth during the month of April. But again, it's very early. It's very difficult to forecast and predict what the market will be like. But to a large degree, we see 2015 playing out much as we had anticipated, that as we got into the March and April time frame, that our comparisons would get more difficult. We do not necessarily anticipate a decline in our net revenue per shipment, but the fact that the margins were fairly healthy a year ago, it's not surprising to us that we would be where we're at from a pricing standpoint today with a much more modest increase year-over-year in April on contracted or committed business.  I also commented that we have seen a fairly soft spot market for the last couple of weeks that can change quickly at any point in time, but based upon what we have seen thus far in April, we have gotten off to a soft start for the first part of April. 
Beyond sharing that data point with you, I guess, the other thing that we would like to emphasize is some of the areas of focus for us in 2015. I already commented and want to reiterate that Freightquote performance did achieve our objectives in the first quarter, and we feel very good about the cultural fit and the integration initiatives that we have going on throughout 2015.  We talked a lot over the last couple of years about our integration of Phoenix International and the significant effort that was involved with merging more than 25 offices, the systems conversion work around the world and a lot of personnel decisions that needed to be made around blending teams of 3,500 people across the world. 
The Freightquote acquisition does have some meaningful integration projects around segmentation and sharing leads and making sure that we capitalize on the efficiency of small customer activity that Freightquote brings the us as well as leveraging some of the really good technology that the Freightquote business has. However, with all of that business being located in primarily one location in Kansas City, there is not the same SG&A impact or risk for complexity around merging things that will take several years for us to do. So while we'll be working on the technology plan and some of the account management strategies over the next several years, the integration effort is quite a bit different than what we discussed in our global forwarding business. 
In terms of sales and account management initiatives, this is something that we believe is a competitive strength for Robinson. I already mentioned our go-to-market initiatives. As we've grown and diversified our business, it's important that we segment our offerings and are as efficient as we can be in how we approach our large and complex customers as well as our smaller and transactional customers. We have a lot of initiatives underway that intertwine with the Freightquote acquisition around our go-to-market activities and focused on how we believe that we can better penetrate our customers across each segment. 
Cross-selling initiatives. Like the example of global forwarding and domestic freight, cross-selling initiatives with our managed services and evolving a lot of our transportation relationships into more integrated supply chain solution-type relationships are at a core part of that account management and sales initiatives that we're working on.  So we do feel good about our investment in those initiatives. We talk about people, process and technology being the core investments. The process part of account management and how we go to market, it is a very important part of what we think will help us maintain our competitive advantage and our market leadership position. 
Technology development, process efficiency and network optimization, touched on this in a few different ways before, but we have a meaningful increase to our investment this year in our technology platform, the Navisphere platform that encompasses all of our services and allows us to share information and share freight across our network as well as integrating activities with our more complex customers to work on the supply chain solutions. All of our different service areas have a number of efficiency goals. In our industry, there's a challenge that you need to add talent and you need to add people in order to grow and service your customers. But at the same time, there's a balance of efficiency and leveraging productivity across your systems and across your teams that we're very committed to as well, too. We have a theme of balanced growth internally in our people, process and technology, where we're very focused on trying to balance the talent commitments and the hiring with leveraging the technology and the efficiency investments that we're making. 
Lastly, I talked about people already. But acquiring and developing the best industry talent that we can find, we believe that has been and remains a competitive advantage for us. We are growing our workforce.  If you look sequentially, we have added people above and beyond that Freightquote team, and we do expect to continue that throughout the remainder of 2015. Chad talked about our variable personnel expenses driven by the growth of our business. We do feel that, despite being able to add to our team throughout the remainder of 2015, that our operating expense comparisons will actually be more favorable as the year wears on, given the changes in variable expenses.  So it's important that we're investing in acquiring top talent. We're spending more on training than ever and making sure that we maintain the best team in the industry. 
That's the end of our prepared comments. So I will stop there and turn it over to Tim to facilitate our Q&A session."

Freightquote is a good example of where we did find an opportunity to acquire and create a lot more volume in our system. We try to be very fair about highlighting that activity as separate and above and beyond what our organic growth targets are. So we will continue to look for acquisitions, but our core 7% to 12% EPS growth, we believe will be primarily driven by organic growth."

We talked about Freightquote having systems and processes that were geared to be very efficient with small customers, everything from the data entry and the pricing and quoting technique so that a customer can get information very quickly and in a very automated way through their e-commerce solutions. So our primary revenue synergy is about segmentation and making sure that we're using the right account management practices to most effectively approach the market. If you look at it from a net revenue margin standpoint, we think the primary synergy opportunity is in the truckload sector around utilizing the C.H. Robinson network to more effectively and efficiently provide truckload services to those small customers that Freightquote has as well as additional small customers and penetrating that segment in the marketplace. From an operating expense standpoint, there are some opportunities to leverage a broader infrastructure and some of the costs, but the principal investment around people and operating expenses has limited synergy opportunity. So the real upside for us is to penetrate the market more effectively and improve our margins over time by being more effective in our account management practices."

If Freightquote added 7 points to total net revenue growth in first quarter, and we assume the contribution was fairly steady in April, this would imply that you've seen a slight decline in organic net revenue growth so far in the second quarter.

So it's company -- total net revenues that are up approximately 6%, and that does include Freightquote, which means that the balance of legacy activity is approximately flat. As I stated earlier, the primary reason for that decline in net revenue growth is a reduction in our net revenue per shipment in our North American truckload results. Offsetting that, we have actually had some increase in our truckload volume activity, and we have had growth in our other services of net revenue, but not -- for the first several weeks of April, not to the extent that we had in our first quarter. From a comparison standpoint, the net revenue per shipment in truckload a year ago remained fairly consistent through the second quarter, tapered off a little bit at the end. So from a comparison standpoint, in that core net revenue category, the comparisons or the prior year activity will remain fairly constant and then taper down a little bit in June. I mentioned earlier that while we did anticipate it would be more difficult to grow our net revenue as the year progressed throughout 2015, we also believe that our comparisons from an operating expense standpoint, largely due to the increases in the previous year around variable compensation, will make those comparisons slightly more favorable as we go forward. So we have not given up on our goal this year of double-digit earnings per share growth. We know that we have to continue to invest in that volume and grow our business aggressively throughout the remainder of the year. I also touched earlier on the spot market activity, the part that's most difficult to predict is just what short-term demand and spot market activity will be like really for all our services, but again, North America truckload is the largest. We don't know where that will go, but we are hopeful that we will see some strengthening in those opportunities as the year progresses as well."

That has been a challenge for our entire industry and for us to understand and pass-through those costs and help our customers understand why those cost increases may be disproportionate to average prices in the marketplace. There has been discussion about whether or not those costs will disproportionately impact the medium and small carriers. It is possible that there is some incremental impact to those smaller carriers who -- where maybe the larger carriers have voluntarily made some of those investments in the past. But we do believe that the regulations are being somewhat sympathetic to the cost part of it and the capital requirements of those capabilities will continue to get invested in and become more efficient in the marketplace. So while we see it as a overall challenge for us and our industry, we're not overly concerned about a disproportionate impact on medium and small carriers. With regards to the competitive landscape and people investing in their owner logistics division, that is part of the secular changes that we've talked about for the last 4 or 5 years or more. The competitive landscape is changing with a number of carriers investing in brokerage or logistics divisions. We don't necessarily view that as a significant negative. In the longer run, we have believed that our third-party model of separating the capacity ownership and the capital investment from the customer service and go-to-market strategies can be a very effective way and the most effective way to serve a large part of the marketplace. As others continue to invest in that business model and more of the marketplace gets served by a third-party or logistics-type business model, we think that, that just reflects some of the secular changes in how we're all competing. So the market is more competitive. We're adapting to how things are changing. And with regards to the business model that each of our competitors pursues around a blend of capital and logistics type stuff, we'll just have to factor that in to how we sell and how we grow in the marketplace."

I don't know that I can answer them all specifically. But if you look at the overall trend over a longer period of time, several decades ago, we were almost 100% transactional, with just all of our business being very spot market and real-time in the marketplace. The longer-term trend is that we've become more engaged with committed or contracted customers and a greater and greater percentage of our volume is pre-priced or pre-committed as we've become, not only a transactional broker, but also a 3PL core carrier that is dealing with dedicated capacity and committed shippers in a more committed and pre-priced way. If you look at the volatility in the truckload market over the last several years, it is true that many of those large shippers are as desirous as ever to pre-pricing or committing as much of the freight as possible from a pricing standpoint because of situations like a year ago, where the market volatility demanded a significant premium to get access to that spot market capacity and shippers rightly don't want to have exposure to those types of cost variances or cost increases. So while we have this period of sustained shortage and market tightness on the truckload side, it probably is the case that most shippers will continue to want to contract for more and more of their capacity. And we are working hard to provide those solutions in the marketplace by working on those committed bids, and our business will probably continue to increase as a percentage of that activity. The spot market business comes and goes, depending upon how the market behaves. When the market has a lot of demand and a lot of route guide failure like it did a year ago, you'll see significant increases in that spot market activity. When it calms down and stabilizes more like it is now, we'll see a meaningful decline in that spot market. So our business mix and portfolio of mix changes as a result of the market activity more so than anything specifically that we're targeting."

I think, in the acquisitions we've made and when we look at our competitors, it takes a period of years to really get traction around cross-selling initiatives and more effectively going in the market together and sharing capacity. So from the standpoint of how is the competitive landscape today versus a year ago, our principal data points around that are the overall demand of freight and the overall change in the supply and demand and route guide compliance that we're adjusting to. There have been a lot of people aggressively investing in market share and there has been an increase in acquisitions, which certainly over time will change how competitors are leveraging scale and how people are going to market with different pricing strategies, but nothing that we can really observe in the short term around this year versus last year or today versus a couple of months ago."

Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. I'll start by highlighting some of our key long-term financial metrics that we focus in every quarter. So on Slide 3 our total revenues of $3.5 billion for the quarter represent a 1.2% increase over the previous",3120,"Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. I'll start by highlighting some of our key long-term financial metrics that we focus in every quarter. So on Slide 3 our total revenues of $3.5 billion for the quarter represent a 1.2% increase over the previous year. Net revenues of $584 million represent a 12.1% increase over last year's second quarter.
Our operating income, or income from operations, increased 14.3% for the quarter. One of the things that we often referenced is our growth in income from operations relative to our net revenues and our hopes to mirror that overtime or exceed it if possible. And so we like the fact that our income from operations grew an excess of the net revenue growth rate.
Earnings per share of $0.94 compared to $0.80 last year represents a 17.5% increase.
We're proud of the results. We think it's a good quarter. If you look at the couple of the other metrics that we share there, our average headcount is up 10%. That's including Freightquote. If you eliminate the impact of Freightquote, it's about 1.5% increase for the quarter. But we like our performance for the quarter. We're investing in our business. And obviously, as we'll get into, there were some things in the marketplace, some marketplace trends that went in our favor throughout the quarter. And we talked often in the past about those market cycles and how a lot of the value that we tried to add is to protect our customers from exposure, either pricewise or service-wise to those market cycles. So sometimes they go against us and sometimes they go in our favor. And we're acknowledging some market conditions went into our favor, particularly in the truckload sector. But in addition, I hope from an overall perspective, one of the other things that you take away from the call is the fact that we are making a lot of longer-term investments that we feel positive about. Some of the headline items have been the larger acquisitions with Phoenix and Freightquote that we feel very positive about. We've been making investments in our sales force and going after both market share volume, but also trying to have balanced growth around how we grow our profitability and our margins as well, so organic and inorganic growth. 
I mentioned that we're investing in our team. It's important in our definition of balanced growth that we invest in both the human capital to grow our business, but also the technology and the productivity gains to make them more efficient and to add value to our customers in better and better ways. So that's been our formula for sustainable growth, that when the market moves in our direction, we'll take advantage of it. And when it goes against us, we'll do the best that we can. And overtime, I think our average results are going to be very good and create a lot of shareholder value and that's what I think you saw in this quarter.
So moving on those overall enterprise results in Slide 4, talking about transportation that makes up the majority of the business on Slide 4. I would like to remind everybody that there are a lot of factors that impact our transportation net revenue margin percentage. But nonetheless, I think it is helpful by looking at it on an overall basis, because there is a lot of relationship between the various modes of transportation and integrated services and how we interact with the marketplace. 
From a total transportation standpoint, total revenues were up 2.9% to $3.1 billion. Net revenues of $548 million were a 12.8% increase in transportation.
The chart on Slide 4 that shows our overall net revenue margin percentage shows 17.5% for the quarter compared to 16% a year ago, or 150 basis point improvement. Throughout the individual transportation services and upcoming slides, we'll highlight a number of the items that are impacting that. But if you look at it from an overall C.H. Robinson perspective and summarize the various factors that are impacting it, the most material in the quarter would be fuel. We've given examples and talked in the past about fuel behaving as a surcharge pass-through in the majority of our business, particularly on the truckload side. If you do the math of reducing the price of fuel on both what we charge our customers and pay our carriers and reducing both amounts by an equal amount, it creates margin percentage expansion. And with the meaningful reduction in fuel year-over-year, that is the most material impact driving that net revenue margin percentage change in the second quarter.
The second most material item in that would be the mix. If you factor in, this does include the results of Freightquote and higher growth in LTL, higher growth in Ocean services and higher growth in shorter length of haul truckload services, all of which have a higher net revenue margin percentage on a comparable basis. So mix issues are #2 on the materiality scale of that margin comparison.
And the third factor that again I'll get into by each individual item does relate to pricing, and the fact that particularly in our contractual are committed pricing arrangements that there can be timing differences in terms of how we adjust to the market and when prices move. And as you'll see on some of the services, the pricing to the customers increased at a slightly greater percentage than what our cost of hire was during the quarter. But that would be the third most material thing in terms of explaining that variance. 
So those are the comments we'll share on an overall basis on transportation. And moving from that the slide 5 on our truckload results would represent half of our revenues. For the quarter, you see that truckload net revenues grew at 8.6%. As was indicated on the first slide, a year -- a quarter ago, I guess, when we were talking about our first quarter results, we did indicate that April started slower than our first quarter had been trending. And as you see in our second quarter results here throughout the quarter, the months of May and June improved during to finish at 8.6% net revenue growth for the quarter. Freightquote did add about 3.5% net revenue growth to the truckload category. So some of that was from the acquisition. But also the larger growth came from the improvement in the net revenue margin and the trends throughout the quarter. Andy will touch a little bit more and give you some quantification of that. But as I mentioned in my opening comments, we did see market conditions improvement throughout the quarter.
Our North American truckload volume grew 7%. So on the upper right-hand corner of Slide 5, we give some of the key metrics that support that truckload activity with volume being a key one. Similar to the first quarter, volumes ended up 7%, with about 3% of that being acquired volume from Freightquote and 4% being our legacy organic growth from our network.
We do see a lot of activity in the marketplace with regards to bid activity, and we do believe that our volume growth increases this year have come from success in those bid opportunities and doing a good job of responding to the request of our more committed or contractual customers.
We did see less spot market activity in the second quarter of this year compared to a year ago. It becomes very difficult. As we've talked in the past, there is no real clean definition of committed or contractual freight versus spot market freight in our book of business. There is a continuum of pricing commitments and relationships on the extremes. There's very transactional activity where you price it on the day of and then there's no commitment either way. And similarly on large bids, there can be very high expectations of committed performance. But there are a lot of different variations in the middle.
Overall though it's pretty clear that compared to a year ago where market conditions were much more volatile and route guide compliance was a lot over a year ago, that in this year's second quarter there was less spot market activity and more freight that was tendered and executed in accordance with contracts and committed pricing.
Another important metric when you look up at that upper right-hand corner, again it's difficult because our network is so diverse and we have pricing that is very diverse across tens of thousands of lanes. What we try to do to share those pricing dynamics is do the best we can to scrub out fuel surcharges and get down to consistent pricing comparisons to the best we can. Those estimates are in the upper right-hand corner. I mentioned early talking about total transportation that we did have some pricing improvement throughout the quarter. Our best estimates of that above or that our average pricing to shippers increased to 3% year-over-year. And our average cost of hire went up 2.5%. 
A couple of additional comments that we can share with you about that. Again, that pricing represented a blend of all those different types of customer relationships that I described earlier. In the contractual or committed category of pricing in this quarter, in many cases, the increases were slightly higher than that. I think we would estimate 3% to 5% as being a market range of the types of price increases. And because of the spot market changes that I described earlier in many cases, certain prices were lower than a year ago based on year-over-year comparisons of market conditions.
Another comment that I would share with you, because I know that it's important to all of us understand a trend and what's sustainable, is that one of the things we often talk about and feel that we have unique exposure to in the marketplace is the variables created by produce season because of our market-leading presence there. And when products starts to shift and are those produce commodities come to market it can have a meaningful impact on when and how the cost of capacity starts to change. Typically, we see a cost of increase throughout the second quarter where the normal trend would be that the cost of hire would increase throughout the quarter. And one of the observations that we would make is we did see a slower rate of increase throughout the quarter than we typically would have. In some cases, that could be attributed to a lower -- later start of the produce shipping and the produce season. It could be related to softer economic demand overall, just creating a softer market. And those are the sorts of things that become important to us in adapting to the market every day and every week and making sure that we're servicing our customers and fulfilling the commitments that we have. 
But nonetheless, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, our customer-shipper pricing did exceed the average cost of hire for the quarter and that was positive for our net revenue margin expansion.
One other comment on this page that is important for those of you who follow our business is the last bullet point that we did add over 3,000 new carriers in the second quarter of 2015. That is a record high for us. An important part of our value-add in the truckload services is the fact that it's a very fragmented market and that we can work with our shippers to get the most efficient and effective access to the right carrier for the right shipment at the right time. 
As we've talked in the past, we have more than 50,000 carriers under contract and we're constantly adding to that. There is a lot of churn. So in the short-term, we don't know exactly what type of relationship and amount of freight that would be moved by those 3,000 carriers. But it is an important vitality index to know that there is capacity coming in to the marketplace and that we are growing our access and relationships to those at a record pace. 
Moving then to Slide 6, in our LTL results. You see our net revenues in LTL increased 35.8% for the quarter. That does include the significant LTL net revenue that was acquired in the Freightquote acquisition. Overall, the net revenue margin for the LTL services did increase in the second quarter. That also was impacted by the mix issues that I talked about. Andy will share some comments about the Freightquote business and the higher nature margin of that transactional business in LTL.
Our volumes, as you can see, were up 33%, with approximately 20% of that growth coming from Freightquote. We did have with volume growth in our legacy LTL business. We've talked in the past about our market-leading capabilities and the capabilities that we have around executing with larger, more dedicated customers. We feel very good about our market presence and the share that we're gaining in that. 
During the second quarter, it did not translate into similar net revenue growth in the legacy business. That's a combination of reasons. I think fuel has an impact in the LTL area that's little bit different in our truckload space as well as just some price compression in the more higher volume dedicated business that we bid on. But nonetheless, we think this is an area similar to truckload where we have a market-leading presence and we feel good about our capabilities.
Moving to Slide 7 in our intermodal results. Intermodal net revenue increased 6.2% in the quarter. And as you can see in the comments, similar to the first quarter, the majority of that growth came from the acquisition of Freightquote. As we said in the past, we're proud of our capabilities and our service in our area. We know that we add a lot of value to the customers that we work with in the intermodal space. But we do not have a market-leading presence. Scale is very important and we have found it tougher to grow this service line. But nonetheless we remain committed to it and we'll continue to invest and grow that service to our customers.
Moving to Slide 8 in our global forwarding services of air, ocean and customs. Fairly similar message to past quarters around this. We have overall net revenue growth of 8.6% for the quarter in global forwarding, led by the ocean revenue of 17%, air net revenues decreasing 9.9% and customs net revenues increasing 6.4%.
Same story here that we've invested significantly the last 3 years and strengthening our network and our operational capabilities and our global forwarding business. And we feel very good about our current capabilities and where we're at. Our core strength is in the transpacific corridor and specifically being #1 in the NVOCC rankings between China and North America. So we're trying to build market share and leverage that core strength of ocean services, and also investing in our air and services and other corridors around the world.
Our airfreight net revenues for the quarter is being down. We did have some pricing changes in the marketplace and some variances in volumes with larger customers that drove that. Growth in airfreight is an important key initiative for us. And our total customer count did grow and we feel like we are expanding our presence in the airfreight. But given the relevance of size and density to your margins and net revenue and the fluctuations in the marketplace, we do expect to see the net revenue on the airfreight line item to fluctuate a little bit more aggressively.
Moving then to Slide 9 in our other logistic services. Again, the largest item in this category is our transportation management services. Net revenues increased 22.6% for the quarter. As we've talked in the past, this is a very important growth area for us, one because it reflects the current marketplace and where the opportunity is to engage with a lot of our customers. It represents the scale capabilities that we have to really work with larger customers on a more integrated way. And as I again have commented often in the past, there's a little bit different business model in a lot of our transportation management services where it is much more common to have a 5-year contract, or a 3 to 5-year contract. We do spend or invest a fair amount of implementation dollars in those newer relationships. So we continue to grow with new customers. And we're investing significantly in the implementation cost to grow that business and we feel very positive about the long-term value creation that could come from that.
The last service line, on Slide 10, our sourcing results or Robinson Fresh as we are branded in the marketplace. You see the net revenue increase of 2.2% for the second quarter, and that was driven by some of the growth in our strategic commodities. Again, for those of you -- to remind you or to inform those who are not familiar of the strategic commodities, produce and produce sourcing for us works very similar to some of the transportation markets where we can add more value in the commodities that are fragmented or nomadic and follow the sun around the planet, and we see growth around those categories. The total revenues declining by 10%, that is representative of the fact that this is the sourcing revenues where we take title to the product. And really across the industry, there were some meaningful price declines in a number of the categories that we do business in. So that is reflective, really, of just the reduced price activity in the marketplace where a year ago, I think there were some freezes and weather conditions that drove prices up. And this year, we saw declines in general across most of the categories that we deal with. That net revenue margin improvement represents a return to something that we feel is in the normal range of where we can conduct our sourcing activities going forward.
So that concludes my comments by service area. With that, I will turn it over to Andy Clarke. As Tim mentioned, he is making his C.H. Robinson public forum debut with us. I know that a number of you know Andy from the industry and the past, as do I and a number of the rest of us here in C.H. Robinson. He's been with us for 60 days and we're very proud to have him be part of the team at Robinson. 
So with that, I will turn it over to Andy."

For nearly 20 years, I've had about the good fortune to interact with a number of Robinson people and I've always been impressed. Now bei",649,"Thank you, John. I appreciate the kind words. Robinson is a great company and I'm really excited to be on the team. For nearly 20 years, I've had about the good fortune to interact with a number of Robinson people and I've always been impressed. 
Now being on the inside, I can tell you that the reputation, the accolades and the awards, like the inbound logistics #1 3PL for the fifth year in a row are well-deserved. 
And now to the numbers. I'm starting on Slide 11 with our summarized income statement. As John mentioned earlier, our net revenue accelerated during the quarter. Net revenue per day in April ended up 7.5% as we saw performance improving going into the last week of the month. 
That trend continued in May and June as net revenue per day increased 15% and 14%, respectively. Month-to-date in July, our total company net revenue per day is up just over 12% from the same period last year. 
I'd like to now spend a little time on our operating ratios and some of the expense categories contributing to the excellent bottom line results our people delivered. We improved operating income, as a percent of net revenue, by 70 basis points during the quarter to 39.2%. We focused quite a bit on this metric and these results represent our best performance in the past 10 quarters.
Personnel expenses, our largest expense item, were up 10.5% in the quarter. Almost the entire amount of the dollar increase is attributable to the additional headcount related to Freightquote.
Both historical Robinson as well as Freightquote operated more efficiently this quarter than in the same quarter the last year. A majority of the recipe increase in expenses is related to our variable incentive plans. Congratulations to the Robinson team for its ability to serve our customers, grow the business and manage expenses.
Other SG&A expenses increased 11.3%. Again the Freightquote acquisition, including amortization expense of $1.9 million, was the primary driver of the increase.
As John mentioned, we are very pleased with the acquisition of Freightquote and the integration is proceeding very well. Our philosophy has been and will continue to be to acquire high-quality companies and successfully integrate them. 
Total operating expenses increased 10.7% in the quarter, which is well below our net revenue growth. As a percent of net revenue, total operating expenses decreased to 60.8% in this year's second quarter from 61.5% in the second quarter of last year. 
Moving on to Slide 12 and other financial information. We had a very strong cash flow quarter, generating just over $150 million in cash flow from operations. Capital expenditures were $12.9 million through the second quarter. As we discussed during our first quarter call, we expect full year 2015 capital expenditures to be between $40 million and $50 million. The additional expenses in the back half of the year related to the building of the second data center. 
We finished the quarter with total debt of $1.13 billion. The balance on our revolver is $630 million, with a 1.3% rate. And our long term debt remains unchanged at $500 million with an average coupon of 4.28%. 
And finally, before turning it back to John, I'd like to cover our capital distribution to shareholders on Slide 13.
During the quarter, we returned approximately $106 million to shareholders, and that broke wit h just over $57 million in dividend and $49 million in ongoing share repurchases. In the last 5.5 years, we have returned $2.8 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. 
During the most recent quarter, we returned approximately 78% of net income to shareholders. Our target continues to be to return approximately 90% of net revenue to shareholders annually. 
Thank you very much for your time today. We appreciate your interest in our company. I will now turn it back to John for his closing comments."

Just a few high-level statements addressing Slide 14 and a look ahead before we transfer into the Q&A. Just reiterating what Andy stated earlier that our enterprise net revenue per day is up 12% in July. That's 1 data point that we share with you. As a reminder, I think this quarter is a good example of how market conditions can move quickly and things can change fairly fast, which makes it difficult to forecast target or longer-term guidance in our business. But improvement that we saw in May and June has carried on to a large extent in early July.
Freightquote, talked about it a number of times. I think the summary comment there, half the year end to it, is we believe we bought a great business. Tim Barton and the team down there are doing a lot of very positive things that we put together a very thoughtful integration plan that we're well into and the results are working. 
The Freightquote integration has a lot to do with our segmentation strategies. The business that Freightquote has a lot of success with is predominantly small customer LTL activity. And as we've looked at how we want to continue to compete in the marketplace, that's a segment that we're very interested in, but have not always invested in our network with the same commitment of resources that we have to the larger, more strategic customers. So Freightquote is a great business. It's helped reinvigorate one of the segments that we do have capabilities in. And I think that's at the core of why the acquisition will work and continue to provide lots of crude growth and opportunity for their employees as well as some shareholder value for the C.H. Robinson never. 
The last comment, we used the term balance growth and I started to touch on this and commenting why we felt positive about our results for the quarter. But I just want to touch on it a little bit more because I do think it is how we try to differentiate ourselves and create the right culture for our employees and the right atmosphere and service our customers in a way that we think is unique. And it really does focus on sustainable, long-term balance growth. We talk a lot about pursuing market share gains and obviously that's a very important metric for us in the long run. It's how we create value and it's how we grow the network. But we don't just pursue market share at the expense of the other metrics that matter to us, as well around margin improvement and customer service and some of the other things that we balance with that to try to create the right mix of those metrics, to create stakeholder value for everybody involved and to provide the right accrual past for our employees. 
As we talked about in the people metrics, we are adding to the network after some volatile years of market swings up and down. We do feel like we're in a little bit more consistent environment and we're confident that it's the right thing to do to be investing in our team and growing our network. So we expect to continue to do that throughout the remainder of the year. 
We feel very good about the technology investment. Chad has transitioned fully into that role and we're spending more money than ever, to make sure that we are properly positioned, to be competitive in our technology platform of Navisphere and making certain that we're balancing productivity gains with all the human capital talent that we're putting into the network. 
And maybe most importantly, we do continue to feel proud about the culture that we have at Robinson and the long-term focus that enables us to do the right thing for our customers regardless of those market conditions as I mentioned earlier and that's what we'll continue to pursue. 
On the challenges side, the thing that I think is worth sharing because when we've talked about our long-term double-digit EPS growth goal over the last 5 or 6 quarters, we've been able to exceed that. But one of the things that we've shared pretty consistently over the last 3 or 4 years is that when we do meet with our larger customers, there does continue to be a fair amount of, what I would label as broader economic uncertainty that correlates to overall freight activity in those large customers. A number of the large retailers, manufacturers and food and beverage customers that we've dealt with for a long period of time, continue in this time period over the last 3 or 4 years, to be much more focused on supply-chain efficiency and cost takeout as opposed to the tailwind of market share growth and volume gains that were a problem for a long period of time before that. So when you ask us sort of what on the negative side or the challenged side, what do we continue to think about? It does feel like some of the tailwind in our industry that was there for a long time, of underlying organic freight growth is maybe a little bit more challenged in some of those big your customers over the more recent period that has been in the past. 
And secondly, I know we always get a lot of questions and talk about the fact that technology is changing very quickly and our industry is changing very quickly. And while we feel very good about where we're at today, with Navisphere from a competitive standpoint, we do have to constantly stay alert to how quickly things are changing in any technological disruption that is out there. We factor all those variables into that balanced growth concept and feel like we're doing the right thing to mix them together and add value. 
So with that, that ends our prepared comments on the quarter as well as high-level thoughts to look ahead. And with that, I will turn it back to Tim to facilitate some of the Q&A that was submitted."

I referenced the segmentation initiatives on the customer side of the business. And as we've grown to be a larger global enterprise, one of the things we have become more sensitive to is making certain that we have the right specialization of sales and salespeople with the right competency matching up with the customers, with the right capabilities and where they want to buy in the marketplace. So when we look at productivity, it different today than it's been in the past around the various segments and the various activities that we have. More and more operational activities is being isolated and automated for efficiency. On a high-level basis, we feel very good. As I've mentioned in opening comments that our volume growth, really in most every service this quarter, has exceeded our headcount both in terms of the headcount growth, in terms of the talent that we're adding. And that is our long-term objective is to continue to provide the right types of career paths, the right types of training, and really focus those people exactly where they can be most effective in the marketplace. And we do think that's translating into salespeople and operational but activities that are helping us create value. Now those gains come with a lot of investment and a lot of effort. And at the same time, making certain we have the right people and the right team put together in the right culture is probably the most important thing that's driving the success of our business. So that balanced growth initiative is all about balancing the 2 of those. Tying in the Freightquote question, one of the things we're much more aware of and focused on today is the uniqueness that's required to serve those very small transactional customers that might literally only ship with you once  a quarter or a couple of times per year, and how do you create the right information management and customer service for an experience like that relative to somebody who you might be doing hundreds of shipments per day with. So we do have an evolving set of metrics and different capabilities. And again, the branding and focus that Freightquote investment has brought to our network, we think will also be an enhancement to our productivity."

So that is definitely something that we see. I do believe that our engagement in those contractual relationships was a positive for us in the quarter that went as I described earlier, the market settles down from a spot market activity that those commitments and that dedicated volume, particularly with more available capacity in the marketplace, was a very positive thing for us in the quarter. The question asks around the quantification of it. And as we said in the past, we've wish we could. It's a very difficult thing because of the wide variety of types of commitments and the continuum of the relationships that we have. But we do believe that more than half of our truckload shipments that we moved in the quarter were on committed or contracted pricing. And that is very different than 20 years ago. Exactly how it moves from week to week and this quarter over last quarter it's difficult to be more precise about that. But definitely, a trend in the marketplace that's relevant and had an impact on our results for the quarter."

And when market conditions move aggressively, sometimes it will provoke earlier rebidding of activity than might have otherwise been anticipated. Obviously, when the market prices change aggressively, like they did a year ago, you see a lot of people in the marketplace going after more lucrative opportunities or changing things. So there's this template of relationships and expectations and contracts. We've always been very proud and believe that we fulfill our commitments as well as anybody in the marketplace, hopefully better and that we understand those. But whenever the marketplace moves, there's always the potential for reaction, either on the provider side or the shipper side, and that is exactly what we do every day and our account managers to continue to add value. So I won't say that there's concern because that's what we've been doing for 110 years. But the reality of it is even though the market is becoming more and more committed, you always have to be prepared for how the market is going to continue to evolve and how anybody may react to that and how we may need to adjust."

And just to repeat it quickly is that we are primarily focused on high-quality M&A opportunities with more focus on the service offerings or regions where we lack the scale and the market leadership that we have in many of our services. So, things like intermodal, things like Managed Services. I referenced airfreight in other regions other world in terms of global forwarding where we believe we can have a disproportionately positive impact to our network by adding scale and adding high-quality businesses to that. So we are looking. We are focused on that, with a very similar philosophy to what we've had in the past. Our view with regards to consolidation, I think the relevant point about all that is maybe what I talked earlier from a segmentation standpoint, that your size and scale in the marketplace does impact the sorts of things that you can hopefully be more effective at doing. There are tens of thousands of brokers in the United States and that or more in Europe and other parts of the world. And that broad brokerage network can compete transctionally in a lot of our local markets. We talked in the past about one of the bigger competitive landscape changes that we've seen over the last 5 or 6 years is more people aggressively going after scale, maybe scale in one service line or scale in their global footprint, so that they can combine services and aspire to provide more integrated things.
So the consolidation, if you will in our industry, is relevant from a standpoint of it changes who you might see in certain bids and what capabilities might be. But the balance of all of that as we continue to talk about too, is part of the reason why people are investing and trying to gain scale is because we do believe that the longer-term trends are favorable that more of the marketplace is going through a 3PL or the type of the provider. so In there terms of ultimate competitiveness and pricing and margins, it's a balance of broader industry growth and opportunity with how the globe is changing with the level of investment and the capability and competitiveness of the companies that are coming in and investing that. So certainly, a relevant topic that we're paying attention to, and mentioned a couple of times that we have in the last 3 years completed the 2 largest acquisitions in our 110-year history. So while we are being more focused and looking for high-quality companies, we are participating to a slight degree in terms of being able to align ourselves with some high-quality companies that we've known for a long time and feel are having a good impact on our network."

So we have the sales force that we're investing in, dedicated account managers that we're investing in. And we are responding to the changes in the marketplaces that I've discussed earlier around a greater prevalence of desire for commitments and pricing and committed freight. So we're pursuing all of that in what we think is a balanced way, and it did lead to good volume growth in the quarter. Similarly, the second part of the question around the employee efficiency and headcount. You do need to add to your team in order to successfully grow this business. I think everybody in our industry has eventually acknowledged that, that there still is a lot about the relationships and the talent and the human element that grows our business.

I would probably temper those comments less specifically to the second half of 2015 and maybe more just towards our long-term investor guidance and why we're talking about our business a little bit differently today than may be 5 years ago, is that it does feel like, particularly with our larger customers, that economic conditions here in North America, just they're not as focused on growth gains and market share as they were maybe 10 years ago and more focused on supply-chain efficiency and savings. Which is why we see opportunity and growth in our managed services, which is why our technology spending and account management spending and investment is as high as it's ever been because we're responding to those opportunities in the marketplace and continue to feel really good about what those will provide for us. The situation in Asia continues to be something that we monitor as well to, around the health of those economies and the production activity and how our growth will occur. And again, for a number of years with that core lane that were involved in, from China to North America, that double-digit growth was almost assured.

So I think that's the list the long-term message that we're sticking with. And the comments and shared earlier are about the GDP, the marketplace and customer outlook probably weighs into that a little bit. When you put it altogether, we will continue to look for opportunities to exceed our long-term guidance and hopefully, create more value.

Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. I'll start by highlighting some of our key long-term financial metrics that we focus in on every quarter.

I'll start by highlighting some of our key long-term financial metrics that we focus in on every quarter. So on that Slide 3, our total revenues of $3.5 billion for the quarter represent a 1.2% increase over the previous year. Net revenues of $584 million represent a 12.1% increase over last year's second quarter.
Our operating income, or income from operations, increased 14.3% for the quarter. One of the things that we often referenced is our growth in income from operations relative to our net revenues and our hopes to mirror that over time or exceed it, if possible. And so we like the fact that our income from operations grew an excess of the net revenue growth rate. Earnings per share of $0.94 compared to $0.80 last year represents a 17.5% increase.
We're proud of the results. We think it's a good quarter. If you look at a couple of the other metrics that we share there, our average headcount is up 10%, that's including Freightquote. If you eliminate the impact of Freightquote, it's about 1.5% increase for the quarter. But we like our performance for the quarter. We're investing in our business. And obviously, as we'll get into, there were some things in the marketplace, some marketplace trends that went in our favor throughout the quarter. And we talked often in the past about those market cycles, and how a lot of the value that we tried to add is to protect our customers from exposure, either pricewise or service-wise to those market cycles. So sometimes they go against us, and sometimes they go in our favor. And we're acknowledging that this quarter, some market conditions went in our favor, particularly in the truckload sector. But in addition, I hope, from an overall perspective, one of the other things that you take away from the call is the fact that we are making a lot of longer-term investments that we feel positive about. Some of the headline items have been the larger acquisitions with Phoenix and Freightquote that we feel very positive about. We've been making investments in our sales force and going after both market share volume, but also trying to have balanced growth around how we grow our profitability and our margins as well, so organic and inorganic growth. 
I mentioned that we're investing in our team. It's important in our definition of balanced growth that we invest in both the human capital to grow our business, but also the technology and the productivity gains to make them more efficient and to add value to our customers in better and better ways. 
So that's been our formula for sustainable growth, that when the market moves in our direction, we'll take advantage of it. And when it goes against us, we'll do the best that we can. And over time, we think our average results are going to be very good and create a lot of shareholder value. And that's what I think you saw in this quarter.
So moving on to those overall enterprise results to Slide 4, talking about transportation that makes up the majority of the business on Slide 4. I would like to remind everybody that there are a lot of factors that impact our transportation net revenue margin percentage. But nonetheless, I think it is helpful to start by looking at it on an overall basis, because there is a lot of relationship between the various modes of transportation and integrated services and how we interact with the marketplace. 
From a total transportation standpoint, total revenues were up 2.9% to $3.1 billion. Net revenues of $548 million were a 12.8% increase in transportation.
The chart on Slide 4 that shows our overall net revenue margin percentage shows 17.5% for the quarter compared to 16% a year ago, or 150 basis point improvement. Throughout the individual transportation services and upcoming slides, we'll highlight a number of the items that are impacting that. But if you look at it from an overall C.H. Robinson perspective and summarize the various factors that are impacting it, the most material in the quarter would be fuel. We've given examples and talked in the past about fuel behaving as a surcharge pass-through in the majority of our business, particularly on the truckload side. If you do the math of reducing the price of fuel on both what we charge our customers and pay our carriers and reducing both amounts by an equal amount, it creates margin percentage expansion. And with the meaningful reduction in fuel year-over-year, that is the most material impact driving that net revenue margin percentage change in the second quarter.
The second most material item in that would be the mix. If you factor in, this does include the results of Freightquote and higher growth in LTL, higher growth in ocean services and higher growth in shorter length of haul truckload services, all of which have a higher net revenue margin percentage on a comparable basis. So mix issues are #2 on the materiality scale of that margin comparison.
And the third factor that again I'll get into by each individual item does relate to pricing, and the fact that particularly in our contractual or committed pricing arrangements that there can be timing differences in terms of how we adjust to the market and when prices move. And as you'll see on some of the services, the pricing to the customers increased at a slightly greater percentage than what our cost of hire was during the quarter. But that would be the third most material thing in terms of explaining that variance. 
So those are comments that we'll share on an overall basis about our transportation. And then moving from that to slide 5 on our truckload results, which represent over half of our revenues. For the quarter, you see that truckload net revenues grew at 8.6%. As I -- it was indicated on the first slide, a year -- a quarter ago, I guess, when we were talking about our first quarter results, we did indicate that April started slower than our first quarter had been trending. And as you see in our second quarter results here throughout the quarter, the months of May and June improved during it, to finish at 8.6% net revenue growth for the quarter. Freightquote did add about 3.5% net revenue growth to the truckload category. So some of that was from the acquisition, but also the larger growth came from the improvement in the net revenue margin and the trends throughout the quarter. Andy will touch a little bit more and give you some quantification of that. But as I mentioned in my opening comments, we did see market condition's improvement throughout the quarter.
Our North American truckload volume grew 7%. So on the upper right-hand corner of Slide 5, we give some of the key metrics that support that truckload activity, with volume being a key one. Similar to the first quarter, volume ended up 7%, with about 3% of that being acquired volume from Freightquote and 4% being our legacy organic growth from our network.
We do see a lot of activity in the marketplace with regards to bid activity, and we do believe that our volume growth increases this year have come from success in those bid opportunities and doing a good job of responding to the request of our more committed or contractual customers.
We did see less spot market activity in the second quarter of this year compared to a year ago. It becomes very difficult. As we've talked in the past, there is no real clean definition of committed or contractual freight versus spot market freight. In our book of business, there is a continuum of pricing commitments and relationships on the extremes. There's very transactional activity where you price it on the day of, and there's no commitment either way. And similarly on large bids, there can be very high expectations of committed performance. But there are a lot of different variations in the middle.
Overall though, it's pretty clear that compared to a year ago, where market conditions were much more volatile and route guide compliance was a lot lower a year ago, that in this year's second quarter there was less spot market activity and more freight that was tendered and executed in accordance with contracts and committed pricing.
Another important metric when you look up in that upper right-hand corner, again, it's difficult because our network is so diverse and we have pricing that is very diverse across tens of thousands of lanes. What we try to do to share those pricing dynamics is do the best we can to scrub out fuel surcharges and get down to consistent pricing comparisons to the best we can. Those estimates are in the upper right-hand corner. I mentioned early in talking about total transportation that we did have some pricing improvement throughout the quarter. Our best estimates of that above or that are up average pricing to shippers increased to 3% year-over-year, and our average cost of hire went up 2.5%. 
A couple of additional comments that we can share with you about that. Again, that pricing represents a blend of all those different types of customer relationships that I described earlier. In the contractual or committed category of pricing in this quarter, in many cases, the increases were slightly higher than that. I think we would estimate 3% to 5% as being a market range of the types of price increases. And because of the spot market changes that I described earlier in many cases, certain prices were lower than a year ago based on year-over-year comparisons of market conditions.
Another comment that I would share with you, because I know that it's important to all of us to understand the trends and what's sustainable is that one of the things we often talk about and feel that we have unique exposure to in the marketplace is the variables created by produce season because of our market-leading presence there. And when products starts to shift and when those produce commodities come to market, it can have a meaningful impact on when and how the cost of capacity starts to change. Typically, we see a cost of increase throughout the second quarter where the normal trend would be, that the cost of hire would increase throughout the quarter. And one of the observations that we would make is we did see a slower rate of increase throughout the quarter than we typically would have. In some cases, that could be attributed to a lower -- later start of the produce shipping and the produce season. It could be related to softer economic demand overall, just creating a softer market. And those are the sorts of things that become important to us in adapting to the market every day and every week and making sure that we're servicing our customers and fulfilling the commitments that we have. 
But nonetheless, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, our customer-shipper pricing did exceed the average cost of hire for the quarter, and that was positive for our net revenue margin expansion.
One other comment on this page that is important for those of you who follow our business is the last bullet point that we did add over 3,000 new carriers in the second quarter of 2015. That is a record high for us. An important part of our value-add in the truckload services is the fact that it's a very fragmented market and that we can work with our shippers to get the most efficient and effective access to the right carrier for the right shipment at the right time. 
As we've talked in the past, we have more than 50,000 carriers under contract, and we're constantly adding to that. There is a lot of churns. So in the short-term, we don't know exactly what type of relationship and the amount of freight that would be moved by those 3,000 carriers. But it is an important vitality index to know that there is capacity coming into the marketplace, and that we are growing our access and relationships to those at a record pace. 
Moving then to Slide 6 in our LTL results. You see our net revenues in LTL increased 35.8% for the quarter. That does include the significant LTL net revenue that was acquired in the Freightquote acquisition. Overall, the net revenue margin for the LTL services did increase in the second quarter. That also was impacted by the mix issues that I talked about. Andy will share some comments about the Freightquote business and the higher-nature margin of that transactional business in LTL.
Our volumes, as you can see, were up 33%, with approximately 20% of that growth coming from Freightquote. We did have good volume growth in our legacy LTL business. We've talked in the past about our market-leading capabilities and the capabilities that we have around executing with larger, more dedicated customers. We feel very good about our market presence and the share that we're gaining in that. 
During the second quarter, it did not translate into similar net revenue growth in the legacy business. That's a combination of reasons. I think fuel has an impact in the LTL area that's a little bit different than in our truckload space as well as just some price compression in the more higher volume dedicated business that we bid on. But nonetheless, we think this is an area similar to truckload where we have a market-leading presence and we feel good about our capabilities.
Moving to Slide 7 in our intermodal results. Intermodal net revenue increased 6.2% in the quarter. And as you can see in the comments, similar to the first quarter, the majority of that growth came from the acquisition of Freightquote. As we've said in the past, we're proud of our capabilities and our service in this area. We know that we add a lot of value to the customers that we work with in the intermodal space, but we do not have a market-leading presence. Scale is very important, and we have found it tougher to grow this service line. But nonetheless, we remain committed to it, and we'll continue to invest and grow that service for our customers.
Moving to Slide 8 in our global forwarding services of air, ocean and customs. Fairly similar messages to past quarters around this. We have overall net revenue growth of 8.6% for the quarter in global forwarding, led by the ocean revenue of 17%, air net revenues decreasing 9.9% and customs net revenues increasing 6.4%.
Same story here that we've invested significantly the last 3 years and strengthening our network and our operational capabilities and our global forwarding business. And we feel very good about our current capabilities and where we're at. Our core strength is in the transpacific corridor and specifically, being #1 in the NVOCC rankings between China and North America. So we're trying to build market share and leverage that core strength of ocean services, and also investing in our air and services and other corridors around the world.
Our airfreight net revenues for the quarter is being down. We did have some pricing changes in the marketplace and some variances in volumes with larger customers that drove that. Growth in airfreight is an important key initiative for us. And our total customer count did grow, and we feel like we are expanding our presence in the airfreight. But given the relevance of size and density to your margins and net revenue and the fluctuations in the marketplace, we do expect to see the net revenue on the airfreight line item to fluctuate a little bit more aggressively.
Moving then to Slide 9 in our other logistic services. Again, the largest item in this category is our transportation management services. Net revenues increased 22.6% for the quarter. As we've talked in the past, this is a very important growth area for us, one, because it reflects the current marketplace and where the opportunity is to engage with a lot of our customers. It represents the scale of capabilities that we have to really work with larger customers on a more integrated way. And as I, again, have commented often in the past, there's a little bit different business model in a lot of our transportation management services, where it is much more common to have a 5-year contract or a 3- to 5-year contract. We do spend or invest a fair amount of implementation dollars in those newer relationships. So we continue to grow with new customers. And we're investing significantly in the implementation cost to grow that business, and we feel very positive about the long-term value creation that could come from that.
The last service line, on Slide 10, our sourcing results or Robinson Fresh, as we are branded in the marketplace. You see a net revenue increase of 2.2% for the second quarter, and that was driven by some of the growth in our strategic commodities. Again, for those of you -- to remind you or to inform those who are not familiar of the strategic commodities, produce and produce sourcing for us works very similar to some of the transportation markets, where we can add more value in the commodities that are fragmented or nomadic and follow the sun around the planet, and we did see growth in those categories. The total revenues declining by 10%, that is representative of the fact that this is the sourcing revenues where we take title to the product. And really, across the industry, there were some meaningful price declines in a number of the categories that we do business in. So that is reflective, really, of just the reduced price activity in the marketplace where a year ago, I think there were some freezes and some weather conditions that drove prices up. And this year, we saw declines in general across most of the categories that we deal with. That net revenue margin improvement represents a return to something that we feel is in the normal range of where we can conduct our sourcing activities going forward.
So that concludes my comments by service area. With that, I will turn it over to Andy Clarke. As Tim mentioned, he is making his C.H. Robinson public forum debut with us. I know that a number of you know Andy from the industry and the past, as do I and a number of the rest of us here at Robinson. He's been with us for 60 days, and we're very proud to have him be a part of the team at Robinson. 
So with that, I will turn it over to him."

Robinson is a great company, and I'm really excited to be on the team. For nearly 20 years, I've had the good fortune to interact with a number of Robinson people, and I've always been impressed. 
Now being on the inside, I can tell you that the reputation, the accolades and the awards, like the Inbound Logistics #1 3PL for the fifth year in a row are well-deserved. 
And now to the numbers. I'm starting on Slide 11 with our summarized income statement. As John mentioned earlier, our net revenue accelerated during the quarter. Net revenue per day for April ended up 7.5% as we saw performance improving going into the last week of the month. That trend continued in May and June as net revenue per day increased 15% and 14%, respectively. Month-to-date in July, our total company net revenue per day is up just over 12% from the same period last year. 
I'd like to now spend a little time on our operating ratios and some of the expense categories contributing to the excellent bottom line results our people delivered. We improved operating income as a percent of net revenue by 70 basis points during the quarter to 39.2%. We focused quite a bit on this metric, and these results represent our best performance in the past 10 quarters.
Personnel expenses, our largest expense item, were up 10.5% in the quarter. Almost the entire amount of the dollar increase is attributable to the additional headcount related to Freightquote.
Both historical Robinson as well as Freightquote operated more efficiently this quarter than in the same quarter last year. A majority of the rest of the increase in expenses is related to our variable incentive plans. Congratulations to the Robinson team for its ability to serve our customers, grow the business and manage expenses.
Other SG&A expenses increased 11.3%. Again, the Freightquote acquisition, including amortization expense of $1.9 million, was the primary driver of the increase.
As John mentioned, we are very pleased with the acquisition of Freightquote, and the integration is proceeding very well. Our philosophy has been and will continue to be to acquire high-quality companies and successfully integrate them. 
Total operating expenses increased 10.7% in the quarter, which is well below our net revenue growth. As a percent of net revenue, total operating expenses decreased to 60.8% in this year's second quarter from 61.5% in the second quarter of last year. 
Moving on to Slide 12 and other financial information. We had a very strong cash flow quarter, generating just over $150 million in cash flow from operations. Capital expenditures were $12.9 million through the second quarter. As we discussed during our first quarter call, we expect full year 2015 capital expenditures to be between $40 million and $50 million. The additional expenses in the back half of the year relate to the building of the second data center. 
We finished the quarter with total debt of $1.13 billion. The balance on our revolver is $630 million with a 1.3% rate. And our long-term debt remains unchanged to $500 million with an average coupon of 4.28%. 
And finally, before turning it back to John, I'd like to cover our capital distribution to shareholders on Slide 13.
During the quarter, we returned approximately $106 million to shareholders, and that broke out with just over $57 million in dividend and $49 million in ongoing share repurchases. In the last 5.5 years, we have returned $2.8 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. 
During the most recent quarter, we returned approximately 78% of net income to shareholders. Our target continues to be to return approximately 90% of net revenue to shareholders annually. 
Thank you very much for your time today. We appreciate your interest in our company. I will now turn it back to John for his closing comments."

Just a few high-level statements addressing Slide 14 and a look ahead before we transfer into the Q&A. Just reiterating what Andy stated earlier that our enterprise net revenue per day is up 12% in July. That's 1 data point that we share with you. As a reminder, I think this quarter is a good example of how market conditions can move quickly and things can change fairly fast, which makes it difficult to forecast or give longer-term guidance in our business. But the improvement that we saw in May and June has carried on to a large extent in early July.
Freightquote, talked about it a number of times. I think the summary comment there, half a year into it, is that we believe we bought a great business. Tim Barton and the team down there were doing a lot of very positive things, and we've put together a very thoughtful integration plan that we're well into and the results are working. 
The Freightquote integration has a lot to do with our segmentation strategies. The business that Freightquote has a lot of success with is predominantly small customer LTL activity. And as we've looked at how we want to continue to compete in the marketplace, that's a segment that we're very interested in, but have not always invested in our network with the same commitment of resources that we have to the larger, more strategic customers. So Freightquote is a great business. It's helped reinvigorate one of the segments that we do have capabilities in. And I think that's at the core of why the acquisition will work and continue to provide lots of career growth and opportunity for their employees as well as create some shareholder value for the C.H. Robinson network. 
The last comment, we used the term balance growth, and I started to touch on this and commenting about why we felt positive about our results for the quarter. But I just want to touch on it a little bit more, because I do think it is how we try to differentiate ourselves, and create the right culture for our employees and the right atmosphere to service our customers in a way that we think is unique. And it really does focus on sustainable, long-term balance growth. We talk a lot about pursuing market share gains and that's obviously a very important metric for us in the long run. It's how we create value, and it's how we grow the network. But we don't just pursue market share at the expense of the other metrics that matter to us, as well around margin improvement and customer service and some of the other things that we balance with that to try to create the right mix of those metrics, to create stakeholder value for everybody involved and provide the right career paths for our employees. 
As we talked about in the people metrics, we are adding to the network after some volatile years of market swings up and down. We do feel like we're in a little bit more consistent environment, and we're confident that it's the right thing to do to be investing in our team and growing our network. So we expect to continue to do that throughout the remainder of the year. 
We feel very good about the technology investment. Chad has transitioned fully into that role, and we're spending more money than ever to make sure that we are properly positioned, to be competitive in our technology platform of Navisphere and making certain that we're balancing productivity gains with all the human capital talent that we're putting into the network. 
And maybe most importantly, we do continue to feel very proud about the culture that we have at Robinson and the long-term focus that enables us to do the right thing for our customers regardless of those market conditions as I mentioned earlier. And that's what we'll continue to pursue. 
On the challenges side, the thing that I think is worth sharing because when we've talked about our long-term double-digit EPS growth goal over the last 5 or 6 quarters, we've been able to exceed that. But one of the things that we've shared pretty consistently over the last 3 or 4 years is that when we do meet with our larger customers, there does continue to be a fair amount of, what I would label as broader economic uncertainty that correlates to overall freight activity in those large customers. A number of the large retailers, manufacturers and food and beverage customers that we've dealt with for a long period of time continue in this time period over the last 3 or 4 years to be much more focused on supply-chain efficiency and cost takeout as opposed to the tailwind of market share growth and volume gains that were prevalent for a long period of time before that. So when you ask us sort of what on the negative side or on the challenge side, what do we continue to think about? It does feel like some of the tailwind in our industry that was there for a long time, of underlying organic freight growth is maybe a little bit more challenged in some of those bigger customers over the more recent period than it has been in the past. 
And then secondly, I know we've always get a lot of questions and talk about the fact that technology is changing very quickly and our industry is changing very quickly. And while we feel very good about where we're at today, with Navisphere from a competitive standpoint, we do have to constantly stay alert to how quickly things are changing in any technological disruption that is out there. We factor all those variables into that balanced growth concept and feel like we're doing the right thing to mix them together and add value. 
So with that, that ends our prepared comments on the quarter as well as high-level thoughts to look ahead. And with that, I will turn it back to Tim to facilitate some of the Q&A that was submitted."

I r",420,"So drilling into those productivity gains that I referenced a couple of times, one of the common themes across our network is that we have evolved a lot of our roles and job families to conform more to how the marketplace and our business is changing. I referenced the segmentation initiatives on the customer side of the business. And as we've grown to be a larger global enterprise, one of the things we've become more sensitive to is making certain that we have the right specialization of sales and salespeople with the right competency matching up with the customers, with the right capabilities and where they want to buy in the marketplace. So when we look at productivity, it's different today than it's been in the past around the various segments and the various activities that we have. More and more, the operational activity is being isolated and automated for efficiency. On a high-level basis, we feel very good. As I've mentioned in the opening comments that our volume growth, really, in most every service this quarter, exceeded our headcount growth, in terms of the talent that we're adding. And that is our long-term objective is to continue to provide the right types of career paths, the right types of training, and really focus those people exactly where they can be most effective in the marketplace. And we do think that's translating into salespeople and operational productivities that are helping us create value. Now those gains come with a lot of investment and a lot of effort. And at the same time, making certain that we have the right people and the right team put together in the right culture is probably the most important thing that's driving the success of our business. So that balanced growth initiative is all about balancing the 2 of those. 
Tying in the Freightquote question, one of the things we're much more aware of and focused on today is the uniqueness that's required to serve those very small transactional customers that might literally only ship with you once a quarter or a couple of times per year, and how do you create the right information management and customer service for an experience like that, relative to somebody who you might be doing hundreds of shipments per day with. So we do have an evolving set of metrics and different capabilities. And again, the branding and focus that Freightquote investment has brought to our network, we think will also be an enhancement to our productivity."

I think it's been fairly well established. And we would agree with the notion that transportation, particularly full truckload transportation, is right for higher than inflation price increases in the future due to driver shortages and the increasing cost of equipment and emissions control and all the rest of those things. So it is a pervasive practice and something that we agree with, that more and more of the larger customers are trying to contract out or get committed pricing on more of their freight to make certain that they can protect themselves and plan their own supply chain against the marketplace that has more and more uncertainty. So that is definitely something that we see. I do believe that our engagement in those contractual relationships was a positive for us in the quarter that went, as I described earlier, the market settles down from a spot market activity that those commitments and that dedicated volume, particularly with more available capacity in the marketplace, was a very positive thing for us in the quarter. The question asks around the quantification of it. And as we said in the past, we wish we could. That's a very difficult thing because of the wide variety of types of commitments and the continuum of the relationships that we have. But we do believe that more than half of our truckload shipments that we moved in the quarter were on committed or contracted pricing. And that's very different than 20 years ago. Exactly how it moves from week to week and this quarter over last quarter, it's difficult to be more precise about that. But definitely, a trend in the marketplace that's relevant and had an impact on our results for the quarter."

And when market conditions move aggressively, sometimes it will provoke earlier rebidding of activity than might have otherwise been anticipated. Obviously, when the market prices change aggressively, like they did a year ago, you see a lot of people in the marketplace going after more lucrative opportunities or changing things. So there's this template of relationships and expectations and contracts. We've always been very proud and believe that we fulfill our commitments as well as anybody in the marketplace, hopefully better, and that we understand those. But whenever the marketplace moves, there's always the potential for reaction, either on the provider side or the shipper side. And that is exactly what we do every day, and our account managers to continue to add value. So I wouldn't say there's concern, because that's what we've been doing for 110 years. But the reality of it is even though the market is becoming more and more committed, you always have to be prepared for how the market is going to continue to evolve, and how anybody may react to that and how we may need to adjust."

And just to repeat it quickly is that we are primarily focused on high-quality M&A opportunities, with more focus on the service offerings or regions where we lack the scale and the market leadership that we have in many of our services. So things like intermodal, things like managed services. I referenced airfreight in other regions of the world in terms of global forwarding, where we believe we could have a disproportionately positive impact to our network by adding scale and adding high-quality businesses to that. So we are looking. We are focused on that, with a very similar philosophy to what we've had in the past. 
Our view with regards to consolidation, I think the relevant point about all that is maybe what I talked earlier from a segmentation standpoint, that your size and scale in the marketplace does impact the sorts of things that you can hopefully be more effective at doing. There are tens of thousands of brokers in the United States and that or more in Europe and other parts of the world. And that broad brokerage network can compete transactionally in a lot of the local markets, and we see that everyday. I think we've talked in the past about one of the bigger competitive landscape changes that we've seen over the last 5 or 6 years is more people aggressively going after scale, maybe scale in one service line or scale in their global footprint, so that they can combine services and aspire to provide more integrated things.
So the consolidation, if you will, on our industry is relevant from the standpoint of it changes who you might see in certain bids and what their capabilities would be. But the balance of all of that as we continue to talk about, too, is that part of the reason why people are investing and trying to gain scale is because we do believe that the longer-term trends are favorable, that more of the marketplace is going through a 3PL or the type of the provider. So from the terms of ultimate competitiveness and pricing and margins, it's a balance of broader industry growth and opportunity with how the globe is changing with the level of investment and the capability and competitiveness of the companies that are coming in and investing that. So certainly, a relevant topic that we're paying attention to and mentioned it a couple of times that we have, in the last 3 years, completed the 2 largest acquisitions in our 110-year history. So while we are being more focused in looking for high-quality companies, we are participating to a slight degree in terms of being able to align ourselves with some high-quality companies that we've known for a long time and feel are having a good impact on our network."

So we're pursuing all of that in what we think is a balanced way, and it did lead to good volume growth in the quarter. Similarly, the second part of the question around employee efficiency and headcount. You do need to add to your team in order to successfully grow this business. I think everybody in our industry has eventually acknowledged that, that there still is a lot about the relationships and the talent and the human element that grows our business.

I would probably temper those comments less specifically to the second half of 2015 and maybe more just towards our long-term investor guidance and why we're talking about our business a little bit differently today than may be 5 years ago is that it does feel like, particularly with our larger customers, that economic conditions here in North America, just they're not as focused on growth gains and market share as they were maybe 10 years ago and more focused on supply-chain efficiency and savings. Which is why we see opportunity and growth in our managed services, which is why our technology spending and account management spending and investment is as high as it's ever been, because we're responding to those opportunities in the marketplace and continue to feel really good about what those will provide for us.

I talked about our investment in the last 3 years and how we like our operational capabilities and our go-to-market strategies today in that global forwarding business. We are very confident that we're going to continue to be able to create value and grow that business in the long term. If you recap some of the events over the last year or so, the port strike on the West Coast was a big deal in terms of some of the disruption. We've recently published some white paper thoughts around the Panama Canal and all the investment that's happening to change the flow of freight. Talked earlier about our air freight investments and the dynamics between air and ocean. When we kind of put that all together, we've had a great run the last 3 years with growing our net revenues pretty meaningfully every quarter since the acquisition of Phoenix 3 years ago. And while we still feel great about the long term, we did comment last year that our comparisons in the third and fourth quarter for global forwarding business will probably be a little bit more challenging, because we're comparing to periods of pretty meaningful disruption a year ago. I commented about airfreight and how that becomes very reactive to the current marketplace and supply chains. So we're investing, in the long term, capabilities and market share gains there, but those amounts -- those results could be a little bit more volatile going forward as well, too."

A lot of the opportunity for us to add value in that space is really in a more effective route guide, to make sure that the right types of freight is going to the right people in the right quantities. And we're very proud of the fact that we think the LTL partners that we work with in the marketplace that not only can we add value on the shipper side, but that we can do a better job with those carrier partners by giving them the freight that they really want and makes their network more optimal as well, too. I think it's just a great example of why the 3PL industry exists and is growing is that in the evolution of supply chains in a more competitive market, the better intelligence that you can inject into the decision-making and the order management of those LTL cycles, there's opportunity to create value on a number of fronts."

Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. I'll start by highlighting some of our key long-term financial metrics that we focus in on every quarter. So on that Slide 3, our total revenues of $3.5 billion for the quarter represent a 1.2% increase over the",3142,"Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. I'll start by highlighting some of our key long-term financial metrics that we focus in on every quarter. So on that Slide 3, our total revenues of $3.5 billion for the quarter represent a 1.2% increase over the previous year. Net revenues of $584 million represent a 12.1% increase over last year's second quarter.
Our operating income, or income from operations, increased 14.3% for the quarter. One of the things that we often reference is our growth in income from operations relative to our net revenues and our hopes to mirror that over time or exceed it, if possible. And so we like the fact that our income from operations grew in excess of the net revenue growth rate. Earnings per share of $0.94 compared to $0.80 last year represents a 17.5% increase.
We're proud of the results. We think it's a good quarter. If you look at a couple of the other metrics that we share there, our average headcount is up 10%. That's including Freightquote. If you eliminate the impact of Freightquote, it's about 1.5% increase for the quarter. But we like our performance for the quarter. We're investing in our business. And obviously, as we'll get into, there were some things in the marketplace and some marketplace trends that went in our favor throughout the quarter. And we talked often in the past about those market cycles, and how a lot of the value that we tried to add is to protect our customers from exposure, either pricewise or service-wise to those market cycles. So sometimes they go against us, and sometimes they go in our favor. And we're acknowledging that this quarter some market conditions went in our favor, particularly in the truckload sector. But in addition, I hope, from an overall perspective, one of the other things that you take away from the call is the fact that we are making a lot of longer-term investments that we feel positive about. Some of the headline items have been the larger acquisitions with Phoenix and Freightquote that we feel very positive about. We've been making investments in our sales force and going after both market share volume, but also trying to have balanced growth around how we grow our profitability and our margins as well, so organic and inorganic growth. 
I mentioned that we're investing in our team. It's important in our definition of balanced growth that we invest in both the human capital to grow our business, but also the technology and the productivity gains to make them more efficient and to add value to our customers in better and better ways. 
So that's been our formula for sustainable growth, that when the market moves in our direction, we'll take advantage of it. And when it goes against us, we'll do the best that we can. And over time, we think our average results are going to be very good and create a lot of shareholder value. And that's what I think you saw in this quarter.
So moving on to those overall enterprise results to Slide 4, talking about transportation that makes up the majority of the business on Slide 4. I always like to remind everybody that there are a lot of factors that impact our transportation net revenue margin percentage. But nonetheless, I think it is helpful to start by looking at it on an overall basis, because there is a lot of relationship between the various modes of transportation and integrated services and how we interact with the marketplace. 
From a total transportation standpoint, total revenues are up 2.9% to $3.1 billion. Net revenues of $548 million were a 12.8% increase in transportation.
The chart on Slide 4 that shows our overall net revenue margin percentage shows 17.5% for the quarter compared to 16% a year ago, or a 150-basis-point improvement. Throughout the individual transportation services and upcoming slides, we'll highlight a number of the items that are impacting that. But if you look at it from an overall C.H. Robinson perspective and summarize the various factors that are impacting it, the most material in the quarter would be fuel. We've given examples and talked in the past about fuel behaving as a surcharge pass-through in the majority of our business, particularly on the truckload side. If you do the math of reducing the price of fuel on both what we charge our customers and pay our carriers and reducing both amounts by an equal amount, it creates margin percentage expansion. And with the meaningful reduction in fuel year-over-year, that is the most material impact driving that net revenue margin percentage change in the second quarter.
The second most material item in that would be the mix, if you factor in this does include the results of Freightquote and higher growth in LTL, higher growth in ocean services and higher growth in shorter length of haul truckload services, all of which have a higher net revenue margin percentage on a comparable basis. So mix issues are #2 on the materiality scale of that margin comparison.
And the third factor that again I'll get into by each individual item does relate to pricing, and the fact that particularly in our contractual or committed pricing arrangements that there can be timing differences in terms of how we adjust to the market and when prices move. And as you'll see on some of the services, the pricing to the customers increased at a slightly greater percentage than what our cost of hire was during the quarter. But that would be the third most material thing in terms of explaining that variance. 
So those are comments that we'll share on an overall basis about our transportation. And then moving from that to Slide 5 and our truckload results, which represent over half of our revenues. For the quarter, you see that truckload net revenues grew at 8.6%. As I -- it was indicated on the first slide, a year -- a quarter ago, I guess, when we were talking about our first quarter results, we did indicate that April started slower than our first quarter had been trending. And as you see in our second quarter results here throughout the quarter, the months of May and June improved during it, to finish at 8.6% net revenue growth for the quarter. Freightquote did add about 3.5% net revenue growth to the truckload category. So some of that was from the acquisition, but also the larger growth came from the improvement in the net revenue margin and the trends throughout the quarter. Andy will touch a little bit more and give you some quantification of that. But as I mentioned in my opening comments, we did see market condition's improvement throughout the quarter.
Our North American truckload volume grew 7%. So on the upper right-hand corner of Slide 5, we give some of the key metrics that support that truckload activity, with volume being a key one. Similar to the first quarter, volume ended up 7%, with about 3% of that being acquired volume from Freightquote and 4% being our legacy organic growth from our network.
We do see a lot of activity in the marketplace with regards to bid activity, and we do believe that our volume growth increases this year have come from success in those bid opportunities and doing a good job of responding to the request of our more committed or contractual customers.
We did see less spot market activity in the second quarter of this year compared to a year ago. It becomes very difficult. As we've talked in the past, there is no real clean definition of committed or contractual freight versus spot market freight. In our book of business, there is a continuum of pricing commitments and relationships on the extremes. There's very transactional activity where you price it on the day of, and there's no commitment either way. And similarly on large bids, there can be very high expectations of committed performance. But there are a lot of different variations in the middle.
Overall though, it's pretty clear that compared to a year ago, where market conditions were much more volatile and route guide compliance was a lot lower a year ago, that in this year's second quarter there was less spot market activity and more freight that was tendered and executed in accordance with contracts and committed pricing.
Another important metric when you look up in that upper right-hand corner, again, it's difficult because our network is so diverse and we have pricing that is very diverse across tens of thousands of lanes. What we try to do to share those pricing dynamics is do the best we can to scrub out fuel surcharges and get down to consistent pricing comparisons to the best we can. Those estimates are in the upper right-hand corner. I mentioned early in talking about total transportation that we did have some pricing improvement throughout the quarter. Our best estimates of that above are that are up average pricing to shippers increased to 3% year-over-year, and our average cost of hire went up 2.5%. 
A couple of additional comments that we can share with you about that. Again, that pricing represents a blend of all of those different types of customer relationships that I described earlier. In the contractual or committed category of pricing in this quarter, in many cases, the increases were slightly higher than that. I think we would estimate 3% to 5% as being a market range of the types of price increases. And because of the spot market changes that I described earlier in many cases, certain prices were lower than a year ago based on year-over-year comparisons of market conditions.
Another comment that I would share with you, because I know that it's important to all of us to understand the trends and what's sustainable is that one of the things we often talk about and feel that we have unique exposure to in the marketplace is the variables created by produce season because of our market-leading presence there. And when product starts to shift and when those produce commodities come to market, it can have a meaningful impact on when and how the cost of capacity starts to change. Typically, we see a cost of increase throughout the second quarter where the normal trend would be, that the cost of hire would increase throughout the quarter. And one of the observations that we would make is we did see a slower rate of increase throughout the quarter than we typically would have. In some cases, that could be attributed to a lower -- later start of the produce shipping and the produce season. It could be related to softer economic demand overall, just creating a softer market. And those are the sorts of things that become important to us in adapting to the market every day and every week and making sure that we're servicing our customers and fulfilling the commitments that we have. 
But nonetheless, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, our customer-shipper pricing did exceed the average cost of hire for the quarter, and that was positive for our net revenue margin expansion.
One other comment on this page that is important for those of you who follow our business is the last bullet point, that we did add over 3,000 new carriers in the second quarter of 2015. That is a record high for us. An important part of our value-add in the truckload services is the fact that it's a very fragmented market and that we can work with our shippers to get the most efficient and effective access to the right carrier for the right shipment at the right time. 
As we've talked in the past, we have more than 50,000 carriers under contract, and we're constantly adding to that. There is a lot of churns. So in the short-term, we don't know exactly what type of relationship and the amount of freight that will be moved by those 3,000 carriers. But it is an important vitality index to know that there is capacity coming into the marketplace, and that we are growing our access and relationships to those at a record pace. 
Moving then to Slide 6 in our LTL results. You see our net revenues in LTL increased 35.8% for the quarter. That does include the significant LTL net revenue that was acquired in the Freightquote acquisition. Overall, the net revenue margin for the LTL services did increase in the second quarter. That also was impacted by the mix issues that I talked about. Andy will share some comments about the Freightquote business and the higher-nature margin of that transactional business in LTL.
Our volumes, as you can see, were up 33%, with approximately 20% of that growth coming from Freightquote. We did have good volume growth in our legacy LTL business. We've talked in the past about our market-leading capabilities and the capabilities that we have around executing with larger, more dedicated customers. We feel very good about our market presence and the share that we're gaining in that. 
During the second quarter, it did not translate into similar net revenue growth in the legacy business. That's a combination of reasons. I think fuel has an impact in the LTL area that's a little bit different than in our truckload space, as well as just some price compression in the more higher volume dedicated business that we bid on. But nonetheless, we think this is an area similar to truckload where we have a market-leading presence and we feel good about our capabilities.
Moving to Slide 7 and our intermodal results. Intermodal net revenue increased 6.2% in the quarter. And as you can see in the comments, similar to the first quarter, the majority of that growth came from the acquisition of Freightquote. As we've said in the past, we're proud of our capabilities and our service in this area. We know that we add a lot of value to the customers that we work with in the intermodal space, but we do not have a market-leading presence. Scale is very important, and we have found it tougher to grow this service line. But nonetheless, we remain committed to it, and we'll continue to invest and grow that service for our customers.
Moving to Slide 8 in our global forwarding services of air, ocean and customs. Fairly similar messages to past quarters around this. We have overall net revenue growth of 8.6% for the quarter in global forwarding, led by the ocean revenue of 17%, air net revenues decreasing 9.9% and customs net revenues increasing 6.4%.
Same story here that we've invested significantly the last 3 years in strengthening our network and our operational capabilities and our global forwarding business. And we feel very good about our current capabilities and where we're at. Our core strength is in the transpacific corridor and specifically, being #1 in the NVOCC rankings between China and North America. So we're trying to build market share and leverage that core strength of ocean services, and also investing in our air and services and other corridors around the world.
Our airfreight net revenues for the quarter has been down. We did have some pricing changes in the marketplace and some variances in volumes with larger customers that drove that. Growth in airfreight is an important key initiative for us. And our total customer count did grow, and we feel like we are expanding our presence in the airfreight. But given the relevance of size and density to your margins and net revenue and the fluctuations in the marketplace, we do expect to see the net revenue on the airfreight line item to fluctuate a little bit more aggressively.
Moving then to Slide 9 in our other logistic services. Again, the largest item in this category is our transportation management services. Net revenues increased 22.6% for the quarter. As we've talked in the past, this is a very important growth area for us, one, because it reflects the current marketplace and where the opportunity is to engage with a lot of our customers. It represents the scale of capabilities that we have to really work with larger customers on a more integrated way. And as I, again, have commented often in the past, there's a little bit different business model in a lot of our transportation management services, where it is much more common to have a 5-year contract or a 3-to-5-year contract. We do spend or invest a fair amount of implementation dollars in those newer relationships. So we continue to grow with new customers. And we're investing significantly in the implementation cost to grow that business, and we feel very positive about the long-term value creation that could come from that.
The last service line, on Slide 10, our sourcing results or Robinson Fresh, as we are branded in the marketplace. You see a net revenue increase of 2.2% for the second quarter, and that was driven by some of the growth in our strategic commodities. Again, for those of you -- to remind you or to inform those who are not familiar of the strategic commodities, produce and produce sourcing for us works very similar to some of the transportation markets, where we can add more value in the commodities that are fragmented or nomadic and follow the sun around the planet, and we did see growth in those categories. The total revenues declining by 10%, that is representative of the fact that this is the sourcing revenues where we take title to the product. And really, across the industry, there were some meaningful price declines in a number of the categories that we do business in. So that is reflective, really, of just the reduced price activity in the marketplace, where a year ago, I think there were some freezes and some weather conditions that drove prices up. And this year, we saw declines in general across most of the categories that we deal with. That net revenue margin improvement represents a return to something that we feel is in the normal range of where we can conduct our sourcing activities going forward.
So that concludes my comments by service area. With that, I will turn it over to Andy Clarke. As Tim mentioned, he is making his C.H. Robinson public forum debut with us. I know that a number of you know Andy from the industry and the past, as do I and a number of the rest of us here at Robinson. He's been with us for 60 days, and we're very proud to have him be a part of the team at Robinson. 
So with that, I will turn it over to him."

For nearly 20 years, I've had the good fortune to interact with a number of Robinson people, and I've always been impressed. Now being o",648,"Thank you, John. I appreciate the kind words. Robinson is a great company, and I'm really excited to be on the team. For nearly 20 years, I've had the good fortune to interact with a number of Robinson people, and I've always been impressed. 
Now being on the inside, I can tell you that the reputation, the accolades and the awards, like the Inbound Logistics #1 3PL for the fifth year in a row are well-deserved. 
And now to the numbers. I'm starting on Slide 11 with our summarized income statement. As John mentioned earlier, our net revenue accelerated during the quarter. Net revenue per day for April ended up 7.5% as we saw performance improving going into the last week of the month. That trend continued in May and June as net revenue per day increased 15% and 14%, respectively. Month-to-date in July, our total company net revenue per day is up just over 12% from the same period last year. 
I'd like to now spend a little time on our operating ratios and some of the expense categories contributing to the excellent bottom line results our people delivered. We improved operating income as a percent of net revenue by 70 basis points during the quarter to 39.2%. We focus quite a bit on this metric, and these results represent our best performance in the past 10 quarters.
Personnel expenses, our largest expense item, were up 10.5% in the quarter. Almost the entire amount of the dollar increase is attributable to the additional headcount related to Freightquote.
Both historical Robinson as well as Freightquote operated more efficiently this quarter than in the same quarter last year. A majority of the rest of the increase in expenses is related to our variable incentive plans. Congratulations to the Robinson team for its ability to serve our customers, grow the business and manage expenses.
Other SG&A expenses increased 11.3%. Again, the Freightquote acquisition, including amortization expense of $1.9 million, was the primary driver of the increase.
As John mentioned, we are very pleased with the acquisition of Freightquote, and the integration is proceeding very well. Our philosophy has been and will continue to be to acquire high-quality companies and successfully integrate them. 
Total operating expenses increased 10.7% in the quarter, which is well below our net revenue growth. As a percent of net revenue, total operating expenses decreased to 60.8% in this year's second quarter from 61.5% in the second quarter of last year. 
Moving on to Slide 12 and other financial information. We had a very strong cash flow quarter, generating just over $150 million in cash flow from operations. Capital expenditures were $12.9 million through the second quarter. As we discussed during our first quarter call, we expect full year 2015 capital expenditures to be between $40 million and $50 million. The additional expenses in the back half of the year relate to the building of the second data center. 
We finished the quarter with total debt of $1.13 billion. The balance on our revolver is $630 million, with a 1.3% rate. And our long-term debt remains unchanged at $500 million, with an average coupon of 4.28%. 
And finally, before turning it back to John, I'd like to cover our capital distribution to shareholders on Slide 13.
During the quarter, we returned approximately $106 million to shareholders, and that broke out with just over $57 million in dividend and $49 million in ongoing share repurchases. In the last 5.5 years, we have returned $2.8 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. 
During the most recent quarter, we returned approximately 78% of net income to shareholders. Our target continues to be to return approximately 90% of net revenue to shareholders annually. 
Thank you very much for your time today. We appreciate your interest in our company. I will now turn it back to John for his closing comments."

Just a few high-level statements addressing Slide 14 and a look ahead before we transfer into the Q&A. Just reiterating what Andy stated earlier that our enterprise net revenue per day is up 12% in July. That's 1 data point that we share with you. As a reminder, I think this quarter is a good example of how market conditions can move quickly and things can change fairly fast, which makes it difficult to forecast or give longer-term guidance in our business. But the improvement that we saw in May and June has carried on to a large extent in early July.
Freightquote, talked about it a number of times. I think the summary comment there, half a year into it, is that we believe we bought a great business. Tim Barton and the team down there were doing a lot of very positive things, and we've put together a very thoughtful integration plan that we're well into and the results are working. 
The Freightquote integration has a lot to do with our segmentation strategies. The business that Freightquote has a lot of success with is predominantly small customer LTL activity. And as we've looked at how we want to continue to compete in the marketplace, that's a segment that we're very interested in, but have not always invested in our network with the same commitment of resources that we have to the larger, more strategic customers. So Freightquote is a great business. It's helped reinvigorate one of the segments that we do have capabilities in. And I think that's at the core of why the acquisition will work and continue to provide lots of career growth and opportunity for their employees as well as create some shareholder value for the C.H. Robinson network. 
The last comment, we used the term balance growth, and I started to touch on this and commenting about why we felt positive about our results for the quarter. But I just want to touch on it a little bit more, because I do think it is how we try to differentiate ourselves and create the right culture for our employees and the right atmosphere to service our customers in a way that we think is unique. And it really does focus on sustainable, long-term balanced growth. We talk a lot about pursuing market share gains and that's obviously a very important metric for us in the long run. It's how we create value, and it's how we grow the network. But we don't just pursue market share at the expense of the other metrics that matter to us, as well around margin improvement and customer service and some of the other things that we balance with that to try to create the right mix of those metrics, to create stakeholder value for everybody involved and provide the right career paths for our employees. 
As we talked about in the people metrics, we are adding to the network. After some volatile years of market swings up and down, we do feel like we're in a little bit more consistent environment, and we're confident that it's the right thing to do, to be investing in our team and growing our network. So we expect to continue to do that throughout the remainder of the year. 
We feel very good about the technology investment. Chad has transitioned fully into that role, and we're spending more money than ever to make sure that we are properly positioned, to be competitive in our technology platform of Navisphere and making certain that we're balancing productivity gains with all the human capital talent that we're putting into the network. 
And maybe most importantly, we do continue to feel very proud about the culture that we have at Robinson and the long-term focus that enables us to do the right thing for our customers regardless of those market conditions, as I mentioned earlier. And that's what we'll continue to pursue. 
On the challenges side, the thing that I think is worth sharing because when we've talked about our long-term double-digit EPS growth goal, over the last 5 or 6 quarters, we've been able to exceed that. But one of the things that we've shared pretty consistently over the last 3 or 4 years is that when we do meet with our larger customers, there does continue to be a fair amount of what I would label as broader economic uncertainty that correlates to overall freight activity in those large customers. A number of the large retailers, manufacturers and food and beverage customers that we've dealt with for a long period of time continue in this time period of the last 3 or 4 years to be much more focused on supply-chain efficiency and cost takeout as opposed to the tailwind of market share growth and volume gains that were prevalent for a long period of time before that. So when you ask us sort of what on the negative side or on the challenge side, what do we continue to think about? It does feel like some of the tailwind in our industry that was there for a long time, of underlying organic freight growth is maybe a little bit more challenged in some of those bigger customers over the more recent period than it has been in the past. 
And then secondly, I know we always get a lot of questions and talk about the fact that technology is changing very quickly and our industry is changing very quickly. And while we feel very good about where we're at today with Navisphere, from a competitive standpoint, we do have to constantly stay alert to how quickly things are changing in any technological disruption that is out there. We factor all those variables into that balanced growth concept and feel like we're doing the right thing to mix them together and add value. 
So with that, that ends our prepared comments on the quarter as well as high-level thoughts to look ahead. And with that, I will turn it back to Tim to facilitate some of the Q&A that was submitted."

I referenced the segmentation initiatives on the customer side of the business. And as we've grown to be a larger global enterprise, one of the things we've become more sensitive to is making certain that we have the right specialization of sales and salespeople with the right competency matching up with the customers with the right capabilities and where they want to buy in the marketplace. So when we look at productivity, it's different today than it's been in the past around the various segments and the various activities that we have. More and more, the operational activity is being isolated and automated for efficiency. On a high-level basis, we feel very good. As I mentioned in the opening comments that our volume growth, really, in most every service this quarter, exceeded our headcount growth, in terms of the talent that we're adding. And that is our long-term objective, is to continue to provide the right types of career paths, the right types of training, and really focus those people exactly where they can be most effective in the marketplace. And we do think that's translating into salespeople and operational productivities that are helping us create value. Now those gains come with a lot of investment and a lot of effort. And at the same time, making certain that we have the right people and the right team put together in the right culture is probably the most important thing that's driving the success of our business. So that balanced growth initiative is all about balancing the 2 of those. 
Tying in the Freightquote question, one of the things we're much more aware of and focused on today is the uniqueness that's required to serve those very small transactional customers that might literally only ship with you once a quarter or a couple of times per year, and how do you create the right information management and customer service for an experience like that, relative to somebody who you might be doing hundreds of shipments per day with. So we do have an evolving set of metrics and different capabilities. And again, the branding and focus that a Freightquote investment has brought to our network we think will also be an enhancement to our productivity."

I think it's been fairly well established. And we would agree with the notion that transportation, particularly full truckload transportation, is ripe for higher than inflation price increases in the future due to driver shortages and the increasing cost of equipment and emissions control and all the rest of those things. So it is a pervasive practice and something that we agree with, that more and more of the larger customers are trying to contract out or get committed pricing on more of their freight to make certain that they can protect themselves and plan their own supply chain against the marketplace that has more and more uncertainty. So that is definitely something that we see. I do believe that our engagement in those contractual relationships was a positive for us in the quarter that when, as I described earlier, the market settles down from a spot market activity, that those commitments and that dedicated volume, particularly with more available capacity in the marketplace, was a very positive thing for us in the quarter. The question asks around the quantification of it. And as we've said in the past, we wish we could. That's a very difficult thing because of the wide variety of types of commitments and the continuum of the relationships that we have. But we do believe that more than half of our truckload shipments that we moved in the quarter were on committed or contracted pricing. And that's very different than 20 years ago. Exactly how it moves from week to week and this quarter over last quarter, it's difficult to be more precise about that. But definitely, a trend in the marketplace that's relevant and had an impact on our results for the quarter."

And when market conditions move aggressively, sometimes it will provoke earlier rebidding of activity than might have otherwise been anticipated. Obviously, when the market prices change aggressively, like they did a year ago, you see a lot of people in the marketplace going after more lucrative opportunities or changing things. So there's this template of relationships and expectations and contracts. We've always been very proud and believe that we fulfill our commitments as well as anybody in the marketplace, hopefully better, and that we understand those. But whenever the marketplace moves, there's always the potential for reaction, either on the provider side or the shipper side. And that is exactly what we do every day in our account managers to continue to add value. So I wouldn't say there's concern, because that's what we've been doing for 110 years. But the reality of it is even though the market is becoming more and more committed, you always have to be prepared for how the market is going to continue to evolve, and how anybody may react to that and how we may need to adjust."

And just to repeat it quickly is that we are primarily focused on high-quality M&A opportunities, with more focus on the service offerings or regions where we lack the scale and the market leadership that we have in many of our services. So things like intermodal, things like managed services. I referenced airfreight in other regions of the world in terms of global forwarding, where we believe we could have a disproportionately positive impact to our network by adding scale and adding high-quality businesses to that. So we are looking. We are focused on that, with a very similar philosophy to what we've had in the past. 
Our view with regards to consolidation, I think the relevant point about all that is maybe what I talked earlier from a segmentation standpoint. Your size and scale in the marketplace does impact the sorts of things that you can hopefully be more effective at doing. There are tens of thousands of brokers in the United States and that or more in Europe and other parts of the world. And that broad brokerage network can compete transactionally in a lot of the local markets, and we see that every day. I think we've talked in the past about one of the bigger competitive landscape changes that we've seen over the last 5 or 6 years is more people aggressively going after scale, maybe scale in one service line or scale in their global footprint, so that they can combine services and aspire to provide more integrated things.
So the consolidation, if you will, in our industry is relevant from the standpoint of it changes who you might see in certain bids and what their capabilities would be. But the balance of all of that as we've continued to talk about, too, is that part of the reason why people are investing and trying to gain scale is because we do believe that the longer-term trends are favorable, that more of the marketplace is going through a 3PL or the type of the provider. So from the terms of ultimate competitiveness and pricing and margins, it's a balance of broader industry growth and opportunity with how the globe is changing with the level of investment and the capability and competitiveness of the companies that are coming in and investing that. So certainly, a relevant topic that we're paying attention to and mentioned it a couple of times, but we have, in the last 3 years, completed the 2 largest acquisitions in our 110-year history. So while we are being more focused in looking for high-quality companies, we are participating to a slight degree in terms of being able to align ourselves with some high-quality companies that we've known for a long time and feel are having a good impact on our network."

So we have the sales force that we're investing in, dedicated account managers that we're investing in. And we are responding to the changes in the marketplaces that I've discussed earlier around a greater prevalence of desire for commitments and pricing and committed freight. So we're pursuing all of that in what we think is a balanced way, and it did lead to good volume growth in the quarter. Similarly, the second part of the question around employee efficiency and headcount. You do need to add to your team in order to successfully grow this business. I think everybody in our industry has eventually acknowledged that, that there still is a lot about the relationships and the talent and the human element that grows our business. But there's also no doubt that the technology is changing and the productivity opportunities are training, and you have to do both. So the statement in the question around it's a combination of many factors is dead on. And I think we've hit on most of them today in terms of describing how we're approaching the marketplace and what we believe drove the success in the quarter."

I would probably temper those comments less specifically to the second half of 2015 and maybe more just towards our long-term investor guidance and why we're talking about our business a little bit differently today than maybe 5 years ago is that it does feel like, particularly with our larger customers, that economic conditions here in North America, just they're not as focused on growth gains and market share as they were maybe 10 years ago and more focused on supply-chain efficiency and savings. Which is why we see opportunity and growth in our managed services, which is why our technology spending and account management spending and investment is as high as it's ever been, because we're responding to those opportunities in the marketplace and continue to feel really good about what those will provide for us. The situation in Asia continues to be something that we monitor as well, too, around the health of those economies and the production activity and how our growth will occur. And again, for a number of years with that core lane that were involved in, from China to the North America, the double-digit growth was almost assured. And while we still see a lot of future opportunity in that, it's maybe a little bit less and a little bit uncertain exactly what it's going to be based on how things are moving. I do think that's one of the relevant backdrops that has impacted our thought process of where we're investing and how we're going to the marketplace and how we think we'll be able to add value over the next decade as opposed to the past 100 years."

We've recently published some white paper thoughts around the Panama Canal and all the investment that's happening to change the flow of freight. Talked earlier about our air freight investments and the dynamics between air and ocean. When we kind of put that all together, we've had a great run the last 3 years with growing our net revenues pretty meaningfully every quarter since the acquisition of Phoenix 3 years ago. And while we still feel great about the long term, we did comment last year that our comparisons in the third and fourth quarter for the global forwarding business will probably be a little bit more challenging, because we're comparing to periods of pretty meaningful disruption a year ago.

I happen to have the good fortune of sitting in on a customer presentation yesterday. It's a multibillion-dollar global manufacturer with 26 facilities located across the globe. And they had their entire senior leadership team in on the logistics side for some strategic planning.

We do believe that we can continue to take market share. Those larger integrated customers do have a little bit different business model or relationship with us in terms of the effort and expectation that it takes to understand their business and to make sure that we flow the data and make the best decisions. A lot of the -- as supply chains change and get more complex and move faster, a lot of the opportunity for us to add value in that space is really in a more effective route guide, to make sure that the right types of freight is going to the right people in the right quantities. And we're very proud of the fact that we think the LTL partners that we work with in the marketplace that not only can we add value on the shipper side, but that we can do a better job with those carrier partners by giving them the freight that they really want and makes their network more optimal as well, too. I think it's just a great example of why the 3PL industry exists and is growing is that in the evolution of supply chains in a more competitive market, the better intelligence that you can inject into the decision-making and the order management of those LTL cycles, there's opportunity to create value on a number of fronts."

The things that probably aren't as visible to everybody else relate heavily to how those different capabilities and services tie together in that Navisphere platform, because the power of that is it allows us to give customer visibility across their types of services or businesses. It also gives the foundation for optimization and mode selection around the different things that we're doing. Collecting all of the information regardless of region or mode in the same data warehouse feeds the analytics that are really important part. So we've got initiatives in the analytical area to help our customers and capacity providers understand their business and our relationship with them better.

We had a very good third quarter, led by total net revenues of $588 million, which represented an 11.6% increase over last year's third quarter. Our organic net revenues grew at 5%, while the Freightquote acquisition contributed another 6.5 percentage points to our net revenue growth in the quarter. Our organic business growth was driven largely by North American truckload services, with truckload net revenue growing as a result of both volume growth and improved margins. As has been the case throughout the year, net revenues grew more than total revenues, due primarily to the impact of lower fuel prices of this year. 
A couple of our other key financial metrics, income from operations increased 14.4% in the quarter and net income increased 11.6%. Our network did a great job in the quarter and we again accomplished good productivity and results in most of our core services. We had earnings per share of $0.96 in the quarter and that compares to $0.85 last year or a 12.9% increase.
One of the other key metrics, our average headcount or employee total increased 13% in the quarter, again it was about a 4% increase in our organic base of business and the remainder of the increase coming from the Freightquote acquisition. 
Before I turn it over to Andy to walk through the specific revenue lines and service items, I thought maybe I would just highlight what we sort of view as some of the key highlights for the quarter that you'll hear come throughout the comments. First, net revenue margin increases, you'll see in most of the services that we did have improving net revenue margins. In a business model like ours, where the market is softer from a demand standpoint than was anticipated at the beginning of the year, it's not surprising and I think it's consistent with what you see elsewhere in the industry that our net revenue margins would be improving across our service offerings. Second, a lot of references to Freightquote. We've tried to be as transparent as we can by showing what impact Freightquote had on the key line items across our results. From an overall standpoint, I would say that we're very happy with the Freightquote acquisition. We continue to believe that it's been a great fit for our company and that it has really helped us penetrate certain segments of the market in a much more effective way so we continue to feel very positive about that acquisition and you'll hear a lot of references to the impact that it's had on us. 
The last item that I'd like to highlight from a productivity efficiency standpoint, we've referenced many times in the past that probably the key enterprise metric around that is our operating income as a percent of net revenue and you'll see that improve in the quarter versus last year and gives us a lot of changes and a lot of different impacts that Andy and I will talk about, that impact from an overall standpoint, the fact that improved year-over-year has improved year-to-date is reflective of what we feel is good productivity and efficiency in the business. So those are some of the highlights that I would point out to you before we jump in with that. I'll turn it over to Andy to walk through our financial results for the quarter."

Before moving on to Slide 4, I would also like to thank all of our people for their hard work in delivering best-in-class performance during the quarter and throughout the year. I think it's fair to say our team put the puck in the back of the net this quarter. Total net revenue grew by 12.5%, with truckload growing 10.8%, LTL growing 38.6% and intermodal contracting slightly by 4%. Net revenue margin improved by 220 basis points to 18.4% versus last year's third quarter. The 2 primary drivers of this margin expansion were fuel and the overall market conditions. I will speak to the specifics in my comments in the various services. 
Turning to our truckload results on Slide 5, we had another strong quarter in our truckload business, growing volume at 7%. The organic volume growth was approximately 4% in the quarter and Freightquote added approximately 3%. We are proud of the fact that this is the 24th consecutive quarter where we have grown our year-over-year North America truckload volume. We also believe we were able to take share in the quarter as most of the benchmarks we look at show slight year-over-year declines in volume. Net revenues grew nearly 11%. Organic net revenues increased approximately 8%, with Freightquote adding approximately 3% in the third quarter. 
We have continued to emphasize our focus on balance growth and clearly, we are executing well to that end. In North America, the linehaul price per model to our customers, excluding the impact of fuel, was flat on a year-over-year basis while the cost paid to carriers decreased approximately 1%. The overall market was less volatile in this third quarter when compared to last year in the third quarter. There are 2 interesting points to highlight. The first comes from the routeing guide depth associated with our Managed Services business, where we saw routeing guide compliance at the high end of our historical benchmarks. The second point is our negative loads were down significantly in the quarter on a year-over-year basis. Both of these facts are an indication that capacity is available and there are minimal disruptions to the procurement plans of shippers. 
We had another strong quarter signing on new contracted carriers. In the third quarter, we again added over 3,000 carriers and these carriers moved over 20,000 shipments for us. Year-to-date, we have added approximately 9,000 new contracted carriers. 
Let's move to Slide 6 and the less-than-truckload results. Our LTL net revenues increased 38.6%. Organic net revenues increased approximately 6%, while Freightquote contributed approximately 33% to our LTL net revenue in the third quarter of 2015. LTL volumes increased 32%. Freightquote contributed approximately 19% and organic growth was 13%. Net revenue margin increased on a year-over-year basis in the third quarter, primarily as a result of the higher margin Freightquote business with small customers and growth in our consolidation business. Both Freightquote and our organic business continue to do well, with the significant activity happening in the industry during the quarter. We continue to feel very good about our value proposition and our approach to the marketplace with our LTL services. Further, we're confident we provide a unique and sought-after service to both our shippers and carriers within our asset base strategy. 
Transitioning to our intermodal results on Slide 7. Intermodal net revenue decreased 4% in the third quarter, with volume down 4% as well. Without Freightquote, organic net revenues decreased approximately 13% in the third quarter. The intermodal volume continues to be impacted by lower fuel prices and a looser capacity in the truckload environment, with some shippers converting freight back over the road. Year-to-date, our net revenue is up 6% versus last year, with volume up 5%. 
And now to Slide 8 and a review of our global forwarding business. Net revenue for the global forwarding services increased 1.8% over the third quarter of 2014. While the 1.8% represents a lower growth rate than our year-to-date trend, it is important to remember the very strong quarter in 2014 we had as a result of the additional services provided during the disruption at the ports. The macro environment this quarter was challenging, with rates dropping and capacity readily available. However, we were able to grow our volumes and took market share in the quarter. 
Our ocean net revenues increased 1.6% in the third quarter, while air decreased 1.3% and custom services were up 1.8% -- 8.1%. Our cross-selling initiatives are producing new opportunities for us and did drive net revenue growth in the quarter. We are proud of the fact that we were able to retain the #1 rank as the NVOCC with the largest number of TEUs shipped from China to the U.S. again in the third quarter. In airfreight, though our net revenues decreased, we added new customers in the quarter and grew our airfreight tonnage. Customs net revenues increased 8.1% due to an increase in transaction volume. 
Moving to other logistic services on Slide 9. The services in this group include transportation management services, warehousing and small parcel. Net revenues increased 7.3% in the third quarter of 2015 compared to the same period in 2014. Managed Services represent over 1/2 of the net revenue in this area and that business is performing well, with good net revenue growth. We added new customers in the quarter and the pipeline of signed customers in the queue is increasing nicely. These customers require a supply chain technology, great transportation processes and execution on a global basis, and we've built the platform to handle this growth and we'll continue to innovate with this service going forward. 
Transitioning to our sourcing business on Slide 10. Our sourcing net revenues decreased 4.4% in the quarter, while case volume grew 2.5%. As with most quarters, we had some ups and downs across the many categories we serve in the sourcing business. In a couple of our strategic vegetable categories, we had some very tough markets that had an impact on our net revenue in the quarter. We believe those impacts should be isolated to the third quarter and the sourcing team is working hard to serve their customers and finish up the year strong. Year-to-date, we are up nearly 3% net revenue and case volume is up 5%. 
Slide 11 covers our summarized income statement for the third quarter. The operating income as a percent of net revenue was 39.5% in the third quarter and this represents the fifth consecutive quarter with a year-over-year increase in this key metric. This also represents a 100 basis point improvement versus last year. We have and will continue to invest in our people and our organization, but we will also do so in a balanced way. Personnel expenses were up 8% in the quarter. This was primarily due to the additional headcount related to our acquisition of Freightquote. As a percent of net revenue, personnel expenses improved 150 basis points to 44.9%. Other SG&A expenses increased 15.3%. This increase was again primarily due to the Freightquote acquisition, including amortization expense of $1.9 million. We also had an increase in claims and travel expenses in the quarter. We expect the rate of increases and expenses relating to the Freightquote acquisition to decrease as we are pleased with the progress we are making on the integration. 
Moving on to Slide 11 and other financial information. We had a very good cash flow quarter, generating just over $213 million. Year-to-date, cash flow generated is $465 million. Capital expenditures in the quarter were $13.2 million and year-to-date CapEx is $33 million. We continue to expect the 2015 capital expenditures to be between $40 million and $50 million. We recently began the development of our new offsite data recovery facility and that will consume the bulk of the remaining CapEx for the year. We finished the quarter with just over $1 billion in debt, which is broken down between $500 million with an average coupon off 4.28%, and $530 million drawn on our revolver, with a current rate of 1.32% as of September 30, 2015. 
And finally, before turning it back to John, let's go to Slide 13 and our capital distribution to shareholders. We returned approximately $130 million to shareholders in the quarter, with approximately $57 million in dividends and $73 million in share repurchases. We finished the quarter returning approximately 93% of net income to shareholders. For the year, we have returned 88%, which is in line with our target to return approximately 90% of net income for our shareholders annually. Again, thank you to the entire Robinson team for your great work to produce these results. And thank you as well to those listening today. We appreciate your interest in our company. With that, I'll turn it back to John to make some closing comments."

Consistent with previous periods, we want to share the headlines of what we know about October with you. And from that standpoint, the total company net revenue growth in October is tracking at a consistent growth rate, consistent with the third quarter. The trucking market in North America continues to be a little bit soft from a demand standpoint and that continues to be reflected in our results. In our Q&A session with the submitted questions that we have, there's a lot of things that are asking about pricing and the market dynamics that will come back to around that net revenue growth and what we're seeing in the marketplace. I think from an overall standpoint, one of the things that we wanted to highlight though is that the trucking industry continues to be a cyclical industry and one of the things that we've experienced over the last 4 or 5 years, and we continue to expect to see, is how we adapt to the cyclicality of that marketplace. And again, some of the Q&A comments will come back to that, but a lot of our net revenue growth this year has been enabled by responding to a market that has a little bit softer demand and taking advantage of the marketplace from the standpoint of serving our customers in a more effective way. 
Before we move to the Q&A session, I want to touch on just a few of the strategic priorities that we have bulletpointed on our look ahead slide. While we adapt to those shorter-term cycles in the market, we believe that kind of the primary foundation of how we create value over a longer period of time is by focusing in on some of these important competitive advantages that really are the foundation of how we go to market and how we serve our customers over a long period time. 
It really starts with our sales and account management initiatives, and we are as focused on them as we've ever been. We are delivering record amounts of training, and we continue to be very focused on the effectiveness of our sales and account management initiatives across our network. The fourth quarter and first quarters of the years are always a little bit more active around bid periods so those groups today, both on the customer side with our account managers as well as our capacity account managers are all very engaged with the marketplace on a localized way to make sure that we understand the varying needs and perspectives of the tens of thousands of people that we interact with and making sure that all of our customers and capacity providers have good and efficient access to our network. 
So we are very proud of our sales and account management capabilities, and we will continue to invest in those people and those processes to make sure that we're maintaining our competitive advantage in the marketplace. 
Talent acquisition and development. We've hired throughout the year. We highlighted kind of the increases in our employee base and headcount. We are continuing to hire. Our hiring tapers off near the end of the year and increases in the spring because we're hiring primarily new college graduates that we will continue to focus on, but from an annual basis, we do expect to continue to add to our workforce and add to our team of sales and account management people in accordance with our primary metric around volume growth. So while we do expect to hire during 2016, we remain pretty fluid with regards to understanding the marketplace and understanding the rate at which we're taking market share and making sure that we add proportionately to how we're growing our business, but we do expect to continue to hire. We think talent acquisition and identifying the right types of cultural fits and people that we're looking for are again are really important competitive advantage. That's part of the foundation of the company that we're not going to lose focus on regardless of what part of the cycles we might be in, in any of our services. 
The next point, technology. I mean people process and technology is the tagline that we've been using for decades and is really an important part of how we think about building value over time and maintaining all of these advantages. As we look into 2016, we're going to continue to increase our investment in technology, spending well over $100 million a year with our IT team to make sure that we're investing in capabilities to achieve a number of things. We focus on connectivity around both that customer and carrier experience to make sure that the people who are accessing our network have visibility to what they want as well as efficient ways to a exchange information with us. We've got some enhancements to our mobile applications that we think will be very impactful next year and that we think will have some good value for our customers and particularly our capacity providers on our mobile strategies. 
Security and stability. As we work with large customers and more collaborative outsourced solutions, it's very important that we secure the data and that we have the right sort of stability in our systems to facilitate the realtime programs that we do, so that's an area that we'll continue to invest heavily in. Purchase order, order management, inventory management capabilities. As we get more will integrated into our customers' supply chains, it becomes more and more important part that we can consolidate, deconsolidate, that we can provide information at the order level and help our customers drive efficiencies and manage inventory in their supply chain and that will continue to be an important investment area for us. 
Analytics and data science, we have a very significant data warehouse and a lot of capabilities around analytics that we extend to both our capacity providers and our customers, and we will continue to invest in that to make sure that we have market-leading information and that we can help our customers adapt to the changing market conditions just as we do with our own business model. So those are a couple of the areas that I wanted to highlight that we're going to continue to invest as technology continues to change in our industry. We believe we're one of the leaders and we've got some good things in the works that we think will continue to keep us in a good competitive spotlight. 
The last bulletpoint that we highlighted on there from a strategic priority standpoint is mergers and acquisitions. As we've said many times, we've been around for 110 years and our 2 largest acquisitions in our 110-year history have both occurred in the last 3 years with Phoenix and Freightquote acquisitions. We have not changed our approach or messaging around acquisitions. We continue to have what we believe is a very meaningful filter around finding the right sorts of deals for Robinson and that starts with cultural fit, but also encompasses all the right sort of financial metrics and business model parameters that we think are important to providing integrated services and managing our business as one global network. 
So we'll continue to have those high standards of what we think is the right sort of addition to Robinson. However, given the current capital environment and the activity in the marketplace and our ability to use our balance sheet more appropriate, we are going to continue to look and to try to identify opportunities where we can create value by expanding our M&A activity as well, to increasing our global footprint and increasing our service capabilities are probably the 2 broad bullet points that we would focus in in terms of priorities and the types of acquisitions that we think would have the most ability to add value. So those are some of the strategic priorities. Again, it's important to highlight those because I think those are the long-term foundation of creating value while we do our best to adapt and help our customers and capacity providers, adapt to the cycles in the marketplace. With that, that concludes our prepared comments for this morning and I will turn it over to Tim to facilitate our Q&A session of the call."

For the last 5 years, we've been sharing our quarterly activity in terms of what we've experienced on average rate per mile and average price increases through our shippers as well as our average cost of hire and change for the capacity providers tha",718,"Yes. For the last 5 years, we've been sharing our quarterly activity in terms of what we've experienced on average rate per mile and average price increases through our shippers as well as our average cost of hire and change for the capacity providers that we have. Andy mentioned earlier in reviewing the slides that for the current quarter, the pricing was relatively flat and the cost of hire was down 1%. If you look back over the last 5 years, I think the 5-year average of those numbers that we've disclosed is somewhere around 4.5% and I think very consistent with what we and maybe many others in the industry have been saying that there is some underlying cost pressure increases around driver shortages and increased equipment and increased regulation as limiting productivity. So you put that all together and over the last 5 years, I think the industry, and we have seen some above inflation cost increases due to a lot of the factors that have been talked about in the industry. However, when you look at the last 5 years, from a quarter-to-quarter standpoint and a year-to-year standpoint, those increases have at times been double digits and at times have been flat to small declines. So when you -- my earlier comments kind of setting up around the cyclicality of what's going on is very difficult to predict the cycles and to really time them perfectly in terms of understanding what's going on in the marketplace. But there's no question, as you look at our results and look at the industry that the price increases and the rate of growth have tapered off during the year as the market has softened, and we see that continuing into the fourth quarter as we shared with our October results to date so far in terms of what we're seeing. What talked about fourth quarter and for the first quarter being an active bid season and again, I think one of the things that's important to remember about C.H. Robinson is we do not have centralized pricing decision-making. We do not have GRIs. We do not give targeted price increases across the network. It's the decentralized account management strategy that is working with all of our shippers and all of our capacity providers to work literally on thousands of in each of these bids that we participate in and it becomes very fragmented and very spread out in terms of how we think about making adjustments and properly repositioning ourselves and the route guide based on what our customers want from us in all of those relationships. So no question, there's a more muted pricing outlook and we're down on the lower end of that range of change that we've seen over the last 5 years. But in terms of exactly what it means in terms of price increases, that really probably remains to be seen based upon the next couple of quarters and how the marketplace continues to evolve. In terms of predicting our net revenue margins, that gets even a little bit more challenging because really, whether our net revenue margins expand or contract, over the last 5 years, they've as I've mentioned earlier, both the pricing to the customers and our cost of hire have averaged a comparable amount, but sometimes the change gets ahead of each other on one side, where customer pricing or capacity costs might be moving at a little bit different rate and most of that is centered around whether or not we've anticipated or we and our shippers have anticipated the market impacts correctly. So everybody's expecting a softer market and everybody's moving down towards the lower and of price changes in the range and really whether net revenue margins on that committed business expand or contract, probably has more to do with how next year compares to what everybody's expecting during these bids versus the absolute tightness of the market year-over-year. So that's why it's difficult for us and we don't try to guide or except exactly what's going to happen with our net revenue margin, but we believe our track record of adapting to market conditions and adjusting both our customer pricing and our capacity pricing consistently over time and that track record sort of speaks for itself."

Again, the primary metric that we're looking at in terms of people and talent is around volume activity. We know that the margins are going to fluctuate. If you look back at our commentary over the last several years, when we're aggressively taking more market share, we do need to add people into those sales and account management roles to facilitate that high volume growth. There have been other periods of time when we've been adapting to aggressive market changes and not experiencing the same significant volume growth but really focusing in on price changes and adapting to more volatile market conditions where we've talked about leveraging the experienced team that we have more as opposed to adding. So like many years, we're going into next year with a balance growth approach, hoping to add to our team and continue to strengthen it, but we will adapt to market conditions largely based upon our view of opportunity for the volume and market share opportunities."

In addition, because we have completed those two large acquisitions of Phoenix and Freightquote, the purchase accounting and some of those amortization costs in those business services also put some downward pressure on that. We have been able to improve that this year. I would say it's a combination of thanks. If you go back 3 years ago, we talked a lot about not only including the purchase accounting from Phoenix, but there was a significant amount of integration spending that we went through in 2013, specially where today, I feel like we're harvesting some of those efficiencies and that service offering has continued to get much more efficient and contribute in a great way to that improved operating income. Where can we go from here? There are other services and other areas that we've been  investing in but have not reached scale that we would like to in terms of achieving operating income margins that we think are sustainable. I would throw out Europe as an area where we've invested heavily in the last 20 years and feel like there's opportunity to improve that. Our Managed Services, as we continue to aggressively implement new relationships, there's a lot of implementation spending that happens early on in those relationships that as we mature that business, it should provide some opportunity for improvement. We've talked about our lack of scale in intermodal and a few other start-up or emerging services where we think we could improve that. That, combined with using technology just to continue to improve our core business processes and what we're doing, we do have a pretty healthy list of ways that we hope to be able to continue to improve that operating margin. We've also acknowledged that since it is industry-leading in terms of where it's at right now, that in the balance of growth and profitability or efficiency, that we want to stay focused on the growth side of the continuum. So we are going to continue to look for ways to grow our business and expand our services even if they don't always instantly improve that metric for us."

The last thing that I would share is, we do believe that from a 3PL standpoint, a comment, a significant trend in the marketplace has been that more and more of the activity out there is probably running through a 3PL today versus 10 years ago so that some of the market share gains are coming from the evolution of the marketplace itself where models like ours are more accepted and maybe not coming directly from a competitor as well."

Probably no doubt, when you're in a part of a cycle like we are now where demand is softening that it would be very logical that people would be a little bit less concerned about locking down committed debt capacity for next year because the sentiment going in is that capacity is going to be more available. We have talked about one of the ongoing tensions in this bid process and trying to anticipate the cycles of truckload is that you can go after very aggressive rates and committed pricing, and if the market moves and tightens up and price increases become more significant than everybody was anticipating, that can be very challenging to your route guide and cost. The need for a lot of meaningful adjustments and changes or exposure to the spot market as you go forward. So probably less concerned about locking down capacity for 2016 today versus a year ago, however there remains that sort of ongoing tension around really trying to anticipate the cyclicality of the market and make sure that you optimize your approach the marketplace to get a good outcome for next year."

However, when you look at our Robinson Fresh business, very were similar to what I talked about in the look ahead comments, the long approach towards adding value is to really improve or increase our participation or market share around our volume and the types of products and commodities that we're interacting with and integrate those into our transportation services to provide better answers for the customers. We did increase our volume, but similar to truckload, the produce industry is very cyclical as well too, so we are going to continue -- we always have, and we will continue to see fluctuations in crop availability and the types of supply and demand relationships that will impact our margins. With a lot of the weather situations and some of the volatility of the various crops that we do buy and sell and distribute for our customers, we do expect to continue to see some volatile results. Our year-to-date net revenue growth for our Sourcing business is probably fairly consistent with what our longer-term expectations are and remember that for this Robinson Fresh business internally, there's also some temperature-controlled transportation that is aligned with those perishable commodities, and our temperature controlled transportation results have been consistent with our overall transportation results providing good growth for the year. So that division with inside of Robinson has done a nice job of servicing their customers and growing their presence in the marketplace and just due to the nature of the business where we're buying and selling the fresh commodities, we do expect to continue to see some volatility in the net revenue growth from a quarter-to-quarter standpoint."

There's more of a continuum of relationships around where we are in the route guide and what exactly those commitments represent. If you go back 15, 20 years, Robinson was almost 100% transactional. We're pretty much reacting every day to what opportunities were available. Over the last couple of decades, as we've integrated in with larger shippers and have participated in a lot of annual bid processes to sign up for committed volumes and activities, that business has become somewhere around 1/2 or maybe a little bit more of our business today. So our most common answer to that is it's roughly 1/2 contracted and 1/2 spot market business. But in reality on a day-to-day basis, the amount of freight that's moving under  pre-priced contracts versus the amount of freight that's moving in the spot market can change based upon the supply and demand conditions in the marketplace and how the market is reacting. So that's the answer on the first part of the question, but from the second part in terms of will we experience net revenue margin improvement? Again I go back to the answer that I gave earlier. The challenging part there is that as we renew these bids in the next couple of quarters and reset the pricing levels in a lot of the committed or contracted freight, we're working with our capacity providers in looking at our historical analytics and anticipating the market to try to come up with what we think is the right approach in 2016. Our net revenue margins will expand or contract largely based on how the market varies from what we were expecting going into these contracts and the expectations with these contracts are very localized, very decentralized on a customer-specific basis. So that's as I said earlier, it gets difficult to predict what we think will happen to our net revenue margins. As we shared through October, as 2015 comes to an end, we know that we will probably have some continuation of the net revenue margin expansion in the fourth quarter just because of where we're at in the marketplace. 2016 gets a lot more challenging to predict."

We acquired Phoenix global forwarding business, where best-in-class, has lower operating margins, and then we had some purchase accounting from that acquisition that all combined had a pretty significant impact in that operating income to net revenue metric. While that didn't feel good in 2012, we thought it was the right thing to do for the long term and that we would be able to integrate and improve the operating margins of our legacy forwarding business and really kind of used the combined scale to continue to improve that service offering, which in fact, has happened. T-Chek has a cycled out of the comparisons and we've been able to leverage some of our technology investments just to continue to improve the efficiency of the service offering that we acquired there. So as I kind of laid out earlier, there's a few other subscale areas where we think we have more opportunity to grow but we also, as I mentioned, feel that we're best-in-class and that we want to remain sensitive to making sure that we balance growth initiatives and investment with the productivity and profitability initiatives that we have."

We had a very good third quarter, led by total net revenues of $588 million, which represented an 11.6% increase over last year's third quarter. Our organic net revenues grew at 5%, while the Freightquote acquisition contributed another 6.5 percentage points to our net revenue growth in the quarter. Our organic business growth was driven largely by North American truckload services, with truckload net revenue growing as a result of both volume growth and improved margins. As has been the case throughout the year, net revenues grew more than total revenues, due primarily to the impact of lower fuel prices this year. 
A couple of our other key financial metrics, income from operations increased 14.4% in the quarter and net income increased 11.6%. Our network did a great job in the quarter and we again accomplished good productivity and results in most of our core services. We had earnings per share of $0.96 in the quarter and that compares to $0.85 last year or a 12.9% increase.
One of the other key metrics, our average headcount or employee total increased 13% in the quarter, again it was about a 4% increase in our organic base of business and the remainder of the increase coming from the Freightquote acquisition. 
Before I turn it over to Andy to walk through the specific revenue lines and service items, I thought maybe I would just highlight what we sort of view as some of the key highlights for the quarter that you'll hear come throughout the comments. First, net revenue margin increases, you'll see in most of the services that we did have improving net revenue margins. In a business model like ours, where the market is softer from a demand standpoint than was anticipated at the beginning of the year, it's not surprising and I think it's consistent with what you see elsewhere in the industry that our net revenue margins would be improving across our service offerings. Second, a lot of references to Freightquote. We've tried to be as transparent as we can by showing what impact Freightquote had on the key line items across our results. From an overall standpoint, I would say that we're very happy with the Freightquote acquisition. We continue to believe that it's been a great fit for our company and that it has really helped us penetrate certain segments of the market in a much more effective way so we continue to feel very positive about that acquisition and you'll hear a lot of references to the impact that it's had on us. 
The last item that I'd like to highlight from a productivity efficiency standpoint, we've referenced many times in the past that probably the key enterprise metric around that is our operating income as a percent of net revenue and you'll see that improved in the quarter versus last year and gives us a lot of changes and a lot of different impacts that Andy and I will talk about, that impact from an overall standpoint, the fact that improved year-over-year has improved year-to-date is reflective of what we feel is good productivity and efficiency in the business. So those are some of the highlights that I would point out to you before we jump in with that. I'll turn it over to Andy, to walk through our financial results for the quarter."

Before moving on to Slide 4, I would also like to thank all of our people for their hard work in delivering best-in-class performance during the quarter and throughout the year. I think it's fair to say our team put the puck in the back of the net this quarter. Total net revenue grew by 12.5%, with truckload growing 10.8%, LTL growing 38.6% and intermodal contracting slightly by 4%. Net revenue margin improved by 220 basis points to 18.4% versus last year's third quarter. The 2 primary drivers of this margin expansion were fuel and the overall market conditions. I will speak to the specifics in my comments in the various services. 
Turning to our truckload results on Slide 5, we had another strong quarter in our truckload business, growing volume at 7%. The organic volume growth was approximately 4% in the quarter and Freightquote added approximately 3%. We are proud of the fact that this is the 24th consecutive quarter where we have grown our year-over-year North America truckload volume. We also believe we were able to take share in the quarter as most of the benchmarks we look at show slight year-over-year declines in volume. Net revenues grew nearly 11%. Organic net revenues increased approximately 8%, with Freightquote adding approximately 3% in the third quarter. 
We have continued to emphasize our focus on balance growth and clearly, we are executing well to that end. In North America, the linehaul price per mile to our customers, excluding the impact of fuel, was flat on a year-over-year basis while the cost paid to carriers decreased approximately 1%. The overall market was less volatile in this third quarter when compared to last year in the third quarter. There are 2 interesting points to highlight. The first comes from the routeing guide depth associated with our Managed Services business, where we saw routeing guide compliance at the high-end of our historical benchmarks. The second point is our negative loads were down significantly in the quarter on a year-over-year basis. Both these facts are an indication that capacity is available and there are minimal disruptions to the procurement plans of shippers. 
We had another strong quarter signing on new contracted carriers. In the third quarter, we again added over 3,000 carriers and these carriers moved over 20,000 shipments for us. Year-to-date, we have added approximately 9,000 new contracted carriers. 
Let's move to Slide 6 and the less-than-truckload results. Our LTL net revenues increased 38.6%. Organic net revenues increased approximately 6%, while Freightquote contributed approximately 33% to our LTL net revenue in the third quarter of 2015. LTL volumes increased 32%. Freightquote contributed approximately 19% and organic growth was 13%. Net revenue margin increased on a year-over-year basis in the third quarter, primarily as a result of the higher margin Freightquote business with small customers and growth in our consolidation business. Both Freightquote and our organic business continue to do well, with the significant activity happening in the industry during the quarter. We continue to feel very good about our value proposition and our approach to the marketplace with our LTL services. Further, we're confident we provide a unique and sought-after service to both our shippers and carriers within our asset base strategy. 
Transitioning to our intermodal results on Slide 7. Intermodal net revenue decreased 4% in the third quarter, with volume down 4% as well. Without Freightquote, organic net revenues decreased approximately 13% in the third quarter. The intermodal volume continues to be impacted by lower fuel prices and a looser capacity in the truckload environment, with some shippers converting freight back over the road. Year-to-date, our net revenue is up 6% versus last year, with volume up 5%. 
And now to Slide 8 and a review of our global forwarding business. Net revenue for the global forwarding services increased 1.8% over the third quarter of 2014. While the 1.8% represents a lower growth rate than our year-to-date trend, it is important to remember the very strong quarter in 2014 we had as a result of the additional services provided during the disruption at the ports. The macro environment in this quarter was challenging, with rates dropping and capacity readily available. However, we were able to grow our volumes and took market share in the quarter. 
Our ocean net revenues increased 1.6% in the third quarter, while air decreased 1.3% and custom services were up 1.8% -- 8.1%. Our cross-selling initiatives are producing new opportunities for us and did drive net revenue growth in the quarter. We are proud of the fact that we were able to retain the #1 rank as the NVOCC with the largest number of TEUs shipped from China to the U.S. again in the third quarter. In airfreight, though our net revenues decreased, we added new customers in the quarter and grew our airfreight tonnage. Customs net revenues increased 8.1% due to an increase in transaction volume. 
Moving to other logistic services on Slide 9. The services in this group include transportation management services, warehousing and small parcel. Net revenues increased 7.3% in the third quarter of 2015 compared to the same period in 2014. Managed Services represent over 1/2 of the net revenue in this area and that business is performing well, with good net revenue growth. We added new customers in the quarter and the pipeline of signed customers in the queue is increasing nicely. These customers require supply chain technology, great transportation processes and execution on a global basis, and we've built the platform to handle this growth and we'll continue to innovate with this service going forward. 
Transitioning to our sourcing business on Slide 10. Our sourcing net revenues decreased 4.4% in the quarter, while case volume grew 2.5%. As with most quarters, we had some ups and downs across the many categories we serve in the sourcing business. In a couple of our strategic vegetable categories, we had some very tough markets that had an impact on our net revenue in the quarter. We believe those impacts should be isolated to the third quarter and the sourcing team is working hard to serve their customers and finish up the year strong. Year-to-date, we are up nearly 3% net revenue and case volume is up 5%. 
Slide 11 covers our summarized income statement for the third quarter. The operating income as a percent of net revenue was 39.5% in the third quarter and this represents the fifth consecutive quarter with a year-over-year increase in this key metric. This also represents a 100 basis point improvement versus last year. We have and will continue to invest in our people and our organization, but we will also do so in a balanced way. Personnel expenses were up 8% in the quarter. This was primarily due to the additional headcount related to our acquisition of Freightquote. As a percent of net revenue, personnel expenses improved 150 basis points to 44.9%. Other SG&A expenses increased 15.3%. This increase was again primarily due to the Freightquote acquisition, including amortization expense of $1.9 million. We also had an increase in claims and travel expenses in the quarter. We expect the rate of increases and expenses relating to the Freightquote acquisition to decrease as we are pleased with the progress we are making on the integration. 
Moving on to Slide 11 and other financial information. We had a very good cash flow quarter, generating just over $213 million. Year-to-date, cash flow generated is $465 million. Capital expenditures in the quarter were $13.2 million and year-to-date CapEx is $33 million. We continue to expect the 2015 capital expenditures to be between $40 million and $50 million. We recently began the development of our new offsite data recovery facility and that will consume the bulk of the remaining CapEx for the year. We finished the quarter with just over $1 billion in debt, which is broken down between $500 million with an average coupon of 4.28%, and $530 million drawn on a revolver, with a current rate of 1.32% as of September 30, 2015. 
And finally, before turning it back to John, let's go to Slide 13 and our capital distribution to shareholders. We returned approximately $130 million to shareholders in the quarter, with approximately $57 million in dividends and $73 million in share repurchases. We finished the quarter returning approximately 93% of net income to shareholders. For the year, we have returned 88%, which is in line with our target to return approximately 90% of net income to our shareholders annually. Again, thank you to the entire Robinson team for your great work to produce these results. And thank you as well to those listening today. We appreciate your interest in our company. With that, I'll turn it back to John, to make some closing comments."

Consistent with previous periods, we want to share the headlines of what we know about October with you. And from that standpoint, the total company net revenue growth in October is tracking at a consistent growth rate, consistent with the third quarter. The trucking market in North America continues to be a little bit soft from a demand standpoint and that continues to be reflected in our results. In our Q&A session with the submitted questions that we have, there's a lot of things that are asking about pricing and the market dynamics that will come back to around that net revenue growth and what we're seeing in the marketplace. I think from an overall standpoint, one of the things that we wanted to highlight though is that the trucking industry continues to be a cyclical industry and one of the things that we've experienced over the last 4 or 5 years, and we continue to expect to see, is how we adapt to the cyclicality of that marketplace. And again, some of the Q&A comments will come back to that, but a lot of our net revenue growth this year has been enabled by responding to a market that has a little bit softer demand and taking advantage of the marketplace from the standpoint of serving our customers in a more effective way. 
Before we move to the Q&A session, I want to touch on just a few of the strategic priorities that we have bullet-pointed on our look ahead slide. While we adapt to those shorter-term cycles in the market, we believe that kind of the primary foundation of how we create value over a longer period of time is by focusing in on some of these important competitive advantages that really are the foundation of how we go to market and how we serve our customers over a long period of time. 
It really starts with our sales and account management initiatives, and we are as focused on them as we've ever been. We are delivering record amounts of training, and we continue to be very focused on the effectiveness of our sales and account management initiatives across our network. The fourth quarter and first quarters of the years are always a little bit more active around bid periods so those groups today, both on the customer side with our account managers as well as our capacity account managers are all very engaged with the marketplace on a localized way to make sure that we understand the varying needs and perspectives of the tens of thousands of people that we interact with and making sure that all of our customers and capacity providers have good and efficient access to our network. 
So we are very proud of our sales and account management capabilities, and we will continue to invest in those people and those processes to make sure that we're maintaining our competitive advantage in the marketplace. 
Talent acquisition and development. We've hired throughout the year. We highlighted kind of the increases in our employee base and headcount. We are continuing to hire. Our hiring tapers off near the end of the year and increases in the spring because we're hiring primarily new college graduates that we will continue to focus on, but from an annual basis, we do expect to continue to add to our workforce and add to our team of sales and account management people in accordance with our primary metric around volume growth. So while we do expect to hire during 2016, we remain pretty fluid with regards to understanding the marketplace and understanding the rate at which we're taking market share and making sure that we add proportionately to how we're growing our business, but we do expect to continue to hire. We think talent acquisition and identifying the right types of cultural fits and people that we're looking for are again are really important competitive advantage. That's part of the foundation of the company that we're not going to lose focus on regardless of what part of the cycles we might be in, in any of our services. 
The next point, technology. I mean people process and technology is the tagline that we've been using for decades and is really an important part of how we think about building value over time and maintaining all of these advantages. As we look into 2016, we're going to continue to increase our investment in technology, spending well over $100 million a year with our IT team to make sure that we're investing in capabilities to achieve a number of things. We focus on connectivity around both the customer and carrier experience to make sure that the people who are accessing our network have visibility to what they want as well as efficient ways to exchange information with us. We've got some enhancements to our mobile applications that we think will be very impactful next year and that we think will have some good value for our customers and particularly our capacity providers on the mobile strategies. 
Security and stability. As we work with large customers and more collaborative outsourced solutions, it's very important that we secure the data and that we have the right sort of stability in our systems to facilitate the realtime programs that we do, so that's an area that we'll continue to invest heavily in. Purchase order, order management, inventory management capabilities. As we get more integrated into our customers' supply chains, it becomes more and more important that we can consolidate, deconsolidate, that we can provide information at the order level and help our customers drive efficiencies and manage inventory in their supply chain and that will continue to be an important investment area for us. 
Analytics and data science, we have a very significant data warehouse and a lot of capabilities around analytics that we extend to both our capacity providers and our customers, and we will continue to invest in that to make sure that we have market-leading information and that we can help our customers adapt to the changing market conditions just as we do with our own business model. So those are couple of the areas that I wanted to highlight that we're going to continue to invest as technology continues to change in our industry. We believe we're one of the leaders and we've got some good things in works that we think will continue to keep us in a good competitive spotlight. 
The last bullet-point that we highlighted on there from a strategic priority standpoint is mergers and acquisitions. As we've said many times, we've been around for 110 years and our 2 largest acquisitions in our 110-year history have both occurred in the last 3 years with Phoenix and Freightquote acquisitions. We have not changed our approach or messaging around acquisitions. We continue to have what we believe is a very meaningful filter around finding the right sorts of deals for Robinson and that starts with cultural fit, but also encompasses all the right sort of financial metrics and business model parameters that we think are important to providing integrated services and managing our business as one global network. 
So we'll continue to have those high standards of what we think is the right sort of addition to Robinson. However, given the current capital environment and the activity in the marketplace and our ability to use our balance sheet more if appropriate, we are going to continue to look and to try to identify opportunities where we can create value by expanding our M&A activity as well, to increasing our global footprint and increasing our service capabilities are probably the 2 broad bullet-points that we would focus in in terms of priorities and the types of acquisitions that we think would have the most ability to add value. So those are some of the strategic priorities. Again, it's important to highlight those because I think those are the long-term foundation of creating value while we do our best to adapt and help our customers and capacity providers, adapt to the cycles in the marketplace. With that, that concludes our prepared comments for this morning and I will turn it over to Tim, to facilitate our Q&A session of the call."

Prioritizing and determining what we're going to work on and focus in on the technology area has become increasingly challenging just because of the universe of opportunities that exist. But for several decades now, we have tried to adapt or adopt a balanced approach towards focusing in on productivity initiatives as well as some of the connectivity initiatives that I talked about before with making sure that the exchange of data and the transparency of data is there. And an important focus too is that market-facing customer insights, customer analytics, making sure that we've got everything that we need to create better solutions and help our customers and capacity providers get smarter in the marketplace. So it's both. Balancing the prioritization of those 2 types of initiatives is something that we go through very aggressively every quarter and try to make sure that we're balancing all of those different motivations in the best we can."

For the last 5 years, we've been sharing our quarterly activity in terms of what we've experienced on average rate per mile and average price increases through our shippers as well as our average cost of hire and change to the capacity providers that",717,"Yes. For the last 5 years, we've been sharing our quarterly activity in terms of what we've experienced on average rate per mile and average price increases through our shippers as well as our average cost of hire and change to the capacity providers that we have. Andy, mentioned earlier in review of the slides that for the current quarter, the pricing was relatively flat and the cost of hire was down 1%. If you look back over the last 5 years, I think the 5-year average of those numbers that we've disclosed is somewhere around 4.5% and I think very consistent with what we and maybe many others in the industry have been saying that there is some underlying cost pressure increases around driver shortages and increased equipment and increased regulation as limiting productivity. So you put that all together and over the last 5 years, I think the industry, and we have seen some above inflation cost increases due to a lot of the factors that have been talked about in the industry. However, when you look at the last 5 years, from quarter-to-quarter standpoint and year-to-year standpoint, those increases have at times been double digits and at times have been flat to small declines. So when you -- my earlier comments kind of setting up around the cyclicality of what's going on is very difficult to predict the cycles and to really time them perfectly in terms of understanding what's going on in the marketplace. But there's no question, as you look at our results and look at the industry that the price increases and the rate of growth have tapered off during the year as the market has softened, and we see that continuing into the fourth quarter as we shared with our October results to date so far in terms of what we're seeing. We also talked about fourth quarter and first quarter being an active bid season and again, I think one of the things that's important to remember about C.H. Robinson is we do not have centralized pricing decision-making. We do not have GRIs. We do not give targeted price increases across the network. It's the decentralized account management strategy that is working with all of our shippers and all of our capacity providers to work literally on thousands of lanes in each of these bids that we participate in and it becomes very fragmented and very spread out in terms of how we think about making adjustments and properly repositioning ourselves and the route guide based on what our customers want from us in all of those relationships. So no question, there's a more muted pricing outlook and we're down on the lower end of that range of change that we've seen over the last 5 years. But in terms of exactly what it means in terms of price increases, that really probably remains to be seen based upon the next couple of quarters and how the marketplace continues to evolve. In terms of predicting our net revenue margins, that gets even a little bit more challenging because really, whether our net revenue margins expand or contract, over the last 5 years, they've as I've mentioned earlier, both the pricing to the customers and our cost of hire have averaged a comparable amount, but sometimes the change gets ahead of each other on one side, where customer pricing or capacity costs might be moving at a little bit different rate and most of that is centered around whether or not we've anticipated or we and our shippers have anticipated the market impacts correctly. So everybody's expecting a softer market and everybody's moving down towards the lower end of price changes in the range and really whether net revenue margins on that committed business expand or contract, probably has more to do with how next year compares to what everybody's expecting during these bids versus the absolute tightness of the market year-over-year. So that's why it's difficult for us and we don't try to guide or except exactly what's going to happen with our net revenue margin, but we believe our track record of adapting to market conditions and adjusting both our customer pricing and our capacity pricing consistently over time and that track record sort of speaks for itself."

Under our balanced growth initiatives across the network, it would probably be low-to-mid-single digit employee headcounts is what we would target as our baseline of activity, priding ourselves in kind of remaining flexible to adapt to what's going on in the marketplace. Again, the primary metric that we're looking at in terms of people and talent is around volume activity. We know that the margins are going to fluctuate. If you look back at our commentary over the last several years, when we're aggressively taking more market share, we do need to add people into those sales and account management roles to facilitate that high volume growth. There have been other periods of time when we've been adapting to aggressive market changes and not experiencing the same significant volume growth but really focusing in on price changes and adapting to more volatile market conditions where we've talked about leveraging the experienced team that we have more as opposed to adding. So like many years, we're going into next year with a balanced growth approach, hoping to add to our team and continue to strengthen it, but we will adapt to market conditions largely based upon our view of opportunity for volume and market share opportunities."

In addition, because we have completed those two large acquisitions of Phoenix and Freightquote, the purchase accounting and some of those amortization costs in those business services also put some downward pressure on that. We have been able to improve that this year. I would say it's a combination of things. If you go back 3 years ago, we talked a lot about not only including the purchase accounting from Phoenix, but there was a significant amount of integration spending that we went through in 2013, specially where today, I feel like we're harvesting some of those efficiencies and that service offering has continued to get much more efficient and contribute in a great way to that improved operating income. Where can we go from here? There are other services and other areas that we've been  investing in but have not reached scale that we would like to in terms of achieving operating income margins that we think are sustainable. I would throw out Europe as an area where we've invested heavily in the last 20 years and feel like there's opportunity to improve that. Our Managed Services, as we continue to aggressively implement new relationships, there's a lot of implementation spending that happens early on in those relationships that as we mature that business, it should provide some opportunity for improvement. We've talked about our lack of scale in intermodal and a few other start-up or emerging services where we think we could improve that. That, combined with using technology just to continue to improve our core business processes and what we're doing, we do have a pretty healthy list of ways that we hope to be able to continue to improve that operating margin. We've also acknowledged that since it is industry-leading in terms of where it's at right now, that in the balance of growth and profitability or efficiency, that we want to stay focused on the growth side of the continuum. So we are going to continue to look for ways to grow our business and expand our services even if they don't always instantly improve that metric for us."

The last thing that I would share is, we do believe that from a 3PL standpoint, a comment, a significant trend in the marketplace has been that more and more of the activity out there is probably running through a 3PL today versus 10 years ago so that some of the market share gains are coming from the evolution of the marketplace itself where models like us are more accepted and maybe not coming directly from a competitor as well."

Probably no doubt, when you're in a part of the cycle like we are now where demand is softening that it would be very logical that people would be a little bit less concerned about locking down committed debt capacity for next year because the sentiment going in is that capacity is going to be more available. We have talked about one of the ongoing tensions in this bid process and trying to anticipate the cycles of truckload is that you can go after very aggressive rates and committed pricing, and if the market moves and tightens up and price increases become more significant than everybody was anticipating, that can be very challenging to your route guide and cost. The need for a lot of meaningful adjustments and changes or exposure to the spot market as you go forward.

However, when you look at our Robinson Fresh business, very were similar to what I talked about in the lookahead comments, the long approach towards adding value is to really improve or increase our participation or market share around our volume and the types of products and commodities that we're interacting with and integrate those into our transportation services to provide better answers for the customers. We did increase our volume, but similar to truckload, the produce industry is very cyclical as well too, so we are going to continue -- we always have, and we will continue to see fluctuations in crop availability and the types of supply and demand relationships that will impact our margins. With a lot of the weather situations and some of the volatility of the various crops that we do buy and sell and distribute for our customers, we do expect to continue to see some volatile results. Our year-to-date net revenue growth for our Sourcing business is probably fairly consistent with what our longer-term expectations are and remember that for this Robinson Fresh business internally, there's also some temperature-controlled transportation that is aligned with those perishable commodities, and our temperature-controlled transportation results have been consistent with our overall transportation results providing good growth for the year. So that division with insight of Robinson has done a nice job of servicing their customers and growing their presence in the marketplace and just due to the nature of the business where we're buying and selling the fresh commodities, we do expect to continue to see some volatility in the net revenue growth from a quarter-to-quarter standpoint."

There's more of a continuum of relationships around where we are in the route guide and what",388,"So the definition of committed or contractual business and the definition of spot market, as we've said many times in the past, is it's tough to be very specific. There's more of a continuum of relationships around where we are in the route guide and what exactly those commitments represent. If you go back 15, 20 years, Robinson was almost 100% transactional. We're pretty much reacting every day to what opportunities were available. Over the last couple of decades, as we've integrated in with larger shippers and have participated in a lot of annual bid processes to sign up for committed volumes and activities, that business has become somewhere around 1/2 or maybe a little bit more of our business today. So our most common answer to that is it's roughly 1/2 contracted and 1/2 spot market business. But in reality on a day-to-day basis, the amount of freight that's moving under  pre-priced contracts versus the amount of freight that's moving in the spot market can change based upon the supply and demand conditions in the marketplace and how the market is reacting. So that's the answer on the first part of the question, from the second part, in terms of, will we experience net revenue margin improvement? Again, I go back to the answer that I gave earlier. The challenging part there is that as we renew these bids in the next couple of quarters and reset the pricing levels in a lot of the committed or contracted freight, we're working with our capacity providers in looking at our historical analytics and anticipating the market to try to come up with what we think is the right approach in 2016. Our net revenue margins will expand or contract largely based on how the market varies from what we were expecting going into these contracts and the expectations with these contracts are very localized, very decentralized on a customer-specific basis. So that's as I said earlier, it gets difficult to predict what we think will happen to our net revenue margins. As we shared through October, as 2015 comes to an end, we know that we will probably have some continuation of the net revenue margin expansion in the fourth quarter just because of where we're at in the marketplace. 2016 gets a lot more challenging to predict."

We acquired Phoenix global forwarding business, where best-in-class, has lower operating margins, and then we had some purchase accounting from that acquisition that all combined had a pretty significant impact in that operating income to net revenue metric. While that didn't feel good in 2012, we thought it was the right thing to do for the long-term and that we would be able to integrate and improve the operating margins of our legacy forwarding business and really kind of use the combined scale to continue to improve that service offering, which in fact, has happened. T-Chek has cycled out of the comparisons and we've been able to leverage some of our technology investments just to continue to improve the efficiency of the service offering that we acquired there. So as I kind of laid out earlier, there's a few other subscale areas where we think we have more opportunity to grow but we also, as I mentioned, feel that we're best-in-class and that we want to remain sensitive to making sure that we balance growth initiatives and investment with the productivity and profitability initiatives that we have."

We had a very good third quarter, led by total net revenues of $588 million, which represented an 11.6% increase over last year's third quarter. Our organic net revenues grew at 5%, while the Freightquote acquisition contributed another 6.5 percentage points to our net revenue growth in the quarter. Our organic business growth was driven largely by North American truckload services, with truckload net revenue growing as a result of both volume growth and improved margins. As has been the case throughout the year, net revenues grew more than total revenues, due primarily to the impact of lower fuel prices this year. 
A couple of our other key financial metrics, income from operations increased 14.4% in the quarter and net income increased 11.6%. Our network did a great job in the quarter and we again accomplished good productivity and results in most of our core services. We had earnings per share of $0.96 in the quarter and that compares to $0.85 last year or a 12.9% increase.
One of the other key metrics, our average headcount or employee total increased 13% in the quarter, again, it was about a 4% increase in our organic base of business and the remainder of the increase coming from the Freightquote acquisition. 
Before I turn it over to Andy to walk through the specific revenue lines and service items, I thought maybe I would just highlight what we sort of view as some of the key highlights for the quarter that you'll hear come throughout the comments. First, net revenue margin increases, you'll see in most of the services that we did have improving net revenue margins. In a business model like ours, where the market is softer from a demand standpoint than was anticipated at the beginning of the year, it's not surprising and I think it's consistent with what you see elsewhere in the industry that our net revenue margins would be improving across our service offerings. Second, a lot of references to Freightquote. We've tried to be as transparent as we can by showing what impact Freightquote had on the key line items across our results. From an overall standpoint, I would say that we're very happy with the Freightquote acquisition. We continue to believe that it's been a great fit for our company and that it has really helped us penetrate certain segments of the market in a much more effective way. So we continue to feel very positive about that acquisition and you'll hear a lot of references to the impact that has had on us. 
The last item that I'd like to highlight from a productivity efficiency standpoint, we've referenced many times in the past that probably the key enterprise metric around that is our operating income as a percent of net revenue and you'll see that improved in the quarter versus last year and gives us a lot of changes and a lot of different impacts that Andy and I will talk about that impact, but from an overall standpoint, the fact that improved year-over-year and has improved year-to-date is reflective of what we feel is good productivity and efficiency in the business. So those are some of the highlights that I would point out to you before we jump in with that. I'll turn it over to Andy, to walk through our financial results for the quarter."

Before moving on to Slide 4, I would also like to thank all of our people for their hard work in delivering best-in-class performance during the quarter and throughout the year.

Before moving on to Slide 4, I would also like to thank all of our people for their hard work in delivering best-in-class performance during the quarter and throughout the year. I think it's fair to say our team put the puck in the back of the net this quarter. Total net revenue grew by 12.5%, with truckload growing 10.8%, LTL growing 38.6% and intermodal contracting slightly by 4%. Net revenue margin improved by 220 basis points to 18.4% versus last year's third quarter. The 2 primary drivers of this margin expansion were fuel and the overall market conditions. I will speak to the specifics in my comments in the various services. 
Turning to our truckload results on Slide 5, we had another strong quarter in our truckload business, growing volume at 7%. The organic volume growth was approximately 4% in the quarter and Freightquote added approximately 3%. We are proud of the fact that this is the 24th consecutive quarter where we have grown our year-over-year North America truckload volume. We also believe we were able to take share in the quarter as most of the benchmarks we look at show slight year-over-year declines in volume. Net revenues grew nearly 11%. Organic net revenues increased approximately 8%, with Freightquote adding approximately 3% in the third quarter. 
We have continued to emphasize our focus on balance growth and clearly, we are executing well to that end. In North America, the linehaul price per mile to our customers, excluding the impact of fuel, was flat on a year-over-year basis while the cost paid to carriers decreased approximately 1%. The overall market was less volatile in this third quarter when compared to last year in the third quarter. There are 2 interesting points to highlight. The first comes from the routing guide depth associated with our Managed Services business, where we saw routing guide compliance at the high-end of our historical benchmarks. The second point is our negative loads were down significantly in the quarter on a year-over-year basis. Both these facts are an indication that capacity is available and there are minimal disruptions to the procurement plans of shippers. 
We had another strong quarter signing on new contracted carriers. In the third quarter, we again added over 3,000 carriers and these carriers moved over 20,000 shipments for us. Year-to-date, we have added approximately 9,000 new contracted carriers. 
Let's move to Slide 6 and the less-than-truckload results. Our LTL net revenues increased 38.6%. Organic net revenues increased approximately 6%, while Freightquote contributed approximately 33% to our LTL net revenue in the third quarter of 2015. LTL volumes increased 32%. Freightquote contributed approximately 19% and organic growth was 13%. Net revenue margin increased on a year-over-year basis in the third quarter, primarily as a result of the higher margin Freightquote business with small customers and growth in our consolidation business. Both Freightquote and our organic business continue to do well, with the significant activity happening in the industry during the quarter. We continue to feel very good about our value proposition and our approach to the marketplace with our LTL services. Further, we're confident we provide a unique and sought-after service to both our shippers and carriers with our non-asset based strategy. 
Transitioning to our intermodal results on Slide 7. Intermodal net revenue decreased 4% in the third quarter, with volume down 4% as well. Without Freightquote, organic net revenues decreased approximately 13% in the third quarter. The intermodal volume continues to be impacted by lower fuel prices and a looser capacity in the truckload environment, with some shippers converting freight back over the road. Year-to-date, our net revenue is up 6% versus last year, with volume up 5%. 
And now to Slide 8 and a review of our global forwarding business. Net revenue for the global forwarding services increased 1.8% over the third quarter of 2014. While the 1.8% represents a lower growth rate than our year-to-date trend, it is important to remember the very strong quarter in 2014 we had as a result of the additional services provided during the disruption at the ports. The macro environment in this quarter was challenging, with rates dropping and capacity readily available. However, we were able to grow our volumes and took market share in the quarter. 
Our ocean net revenues increased 1.6% in the third quarter, while air decreased 1.3% and custom services were up 1.8% -- 8.1%. Our cross-selling initiatives are producing new opportunities for us and did drive net revenue growth in the quarter. We are proud of the fact that we were able to retain the #1 rank as the NVOCC with the largest number of TEUs shipped from China to the U.S. again in the third quarter. In airfreight, though our net revenues decreased, we added new customers in the quarter and grew our airfreight tonnage. Customs net revenues increased 8.1% due to an increase in transaction volume. 
Moving to other logistic services on Slide 9. The services in this group include transportation management services, warehousing and small parcel. Net revenues increased 7.3% in the third quarter of 2015 compared to the same period in 2014. Managed Services represent over half of the net revenue in this area and that business is performing well, with good net revenue growth. We added new customers in the quarter and the pipeline of signed customers in the queue is increasing nicely. These customers require supply chain technology, great transportation processes and execution on a global basis, and we've built the platform to handle this growth and we'll continue to innovate with this service going forward. 
Transitioning to our sourcing business on Slide 10. Our sourcing net revenues decreased 4.4% in the quarter, while case volume grew 2.5%. As with most quarters, we had some ups and downs across the many categories we serve in the sourcing business. In a couple of our strategic vegetable categories, we had some very tough markets that had an impact on our net revenue in the quarter. We believe those impacts should be isolated to the third quarter and the sourcing team is working hard to serve their customers and finish up the year strong. Year-to-date, we are up nearly 3% net revenue and case volume is up 5%. 
Slide 11 covers our summarized income statement for the third quarter. The operating income as a percent of net revenue was 39.5% in the third quarter and this represents the fifth consecutive quarter with a year-over-year increase in this key metric. This also represents a 100 basis point improvement versus last year. We have and will continue to invest in our people and our organization, but we will also do so in a balanced way. 
Personnel expenses were up 8% in the quarter. This was primarily due to the additional headcount related to our acquisition of Freightquote. As a percent of net revenue, personnel expenses improved 150 basis points to 44.9%. Other SG&A expenses increased 15.3%. This increase was again primarily due to the Freightquote acquisition, including amortization expense of $1.9 million. We also had an increase in claims and travel expenses in the quarter. We expect the rate of increases and expenses relating to the Freightquote acquisition to decrease as we are pleased with the progress we are making on the integration. 
Moving on to Slide 11 and other financial information. We had a very good cash flow quarter, generating just over $213 million. Year-to-date, cash flow generated is $465 million. Capital expenditures in the quarter were $13.2 million and year-to-date CapEx is $33 million. We continue to expect the 2015 capital expenditures to be between $40 million and $50 million. We recently began the development of our new offsite data recovery facility and that will consume the bulk of the remaining CapEx for the year. We finished the quarter with just over $1 billion in debt, which is broken down between $500 million with an average coupon of 4.28%, and $530 million drawn on a revolver, with a current rate of 1.32% as of September 30, 2015. 
And finally, before turning it back to John, let's go to Slide 13 and our capital distribution to shareholders. We returned approximately $130 million to shareholders in the quarter, with approximately $57 million in dividends and $73 million in share repurchases. We finished the quarter returning approximately 93% of net income to shareholders. For the year, we have returned 88%, which is in line with our target to return approximately 90% of net income to our shareholders annually. Again, thank you to the entire Robinson team for your great work to produce these results. And thank you as well to those listening today. We appreciate your interest in our company. With that, I'll turn it back to John, to make some closing comments."

And my closing comments will be focused on the look-ahead slide. Consistent with previous periods, we want to share the headlines of what we know about October with you. And from that standpoint, the total company net revenue growth",1394,"Okay. Thank you, Andy. And my closing comments will be focused on the look-ahead slide. Consistent with previous periods, we want to share the headlines of what we know about October with you. And from that standpoint, the total company net revenue growth in October is tracking at a consistent growth rate, consistent with the third quarter. The trucking market in North America continues to be a little bit soft from a demand standpoint and that continues to be reflected in our results. In our Q&A session with the submitted questions that we have, there's a lot of things that are asking about pricing and the market dynamics that will come back to around that net revenue growth and what we're seeing in the marketplace. 
I think from an overall standpoint, one of the things that we wanted to highlight though is that the trucking industry continues to be a cyclical industry and one of the things that we've experienced over the last 4 or 5 years, and we continue to expect to see, is how we adapt to the cyclicality of that marketplace. And again, some of the Q&A comments will come back to that, but a lot of our net revenue growth this year has been enabled by responding to a market that has a little bit softer demand and taking advantage of the marketplace from the standpoint of serving our customers in a more effective way. 
Before we move to the Q&A session, I want to touch on just a few of the strategic priorities that we have bullet-pointed on our look ahead slide. While we adapt to those shorter-term cycles in the market, we believe that kind of the primary foundation of how we create value over a longer period of time is by focusing in on some of these important competitive advantages that really are the foundation of how we go to market and how we serve our customers over a long period of time. 
It really starts with our sales and account management initiatives, and we are as focused on them as we've ever been. We are delivering record amounts of training, and we continue to be very focused on the effectiveness of our sales and account management initiatives across our network. The fourth quarter and first quarters of the years are always a little bit more active around bid periods so those groups today, both on the customer side with our account managers as well as our capacity account managers are all very engaged with the marketplace on a localized way to make sure that we understand the varying needs and perspectives of the tens of thousands of people that we interact with and making sure that all of our customers and capacity providers have good and efficient access to our network. 
So we are very proud of our sales and account management capabilities, and we will continue to invest in those people and those processes to make sure that we're maintaining our competitive advantage in the marketplace. 
Talent acquisition and development. We've hired throughout the year. We highlighted kind of the increases in our employee base and headcount. We are continuing to hire. Our hiring tapers off near the end of the year and increases in the spring because we're hiring primarily new college graduates that we will continue to focus on, but from an annual basis, we do expect to continue to add to our workforce and add to our team of sales and account management people in accordance with our primary metric around volume growth. So while we do expect to hire during 2016, we remain pretty fluid with regards to understanding the marketplace and understanding the rate at which we're taking market share and making sure that we add proportionately to how we're growing our business, but we do expect to continue to hire. We think talent acquisition and identifying the right types of cultural fits and people that we're looking for are, again, a really important competitive advantage. That's part of the foundation of the company that we're not going to lose focus on regardless of what part of the cycles we might be in, in any of our services. 
The next point, technology. I mean, people process and technology is the tagline that we've been using for decades and is really an important part of how we think about building value over time and maintaining all of these advantages. As we look into 2016, we're going to continue to increase our investment in technology, spending well over $100 million a year with our IT team to make sure that we're investing in capabilities to achieve a number of things. We focus on connectivity around both the customer and carrier experience to make sure that the people who are accessing our network have visibility to what they want as well as efficient ways to exchange information with us. We've got some enhancements to our mobile applications that we think will be very impactful next year and that we think will have some good value for our customers and particularly our capacity providers on the mobile strategies. 
Security and stability. As we work with large customers and more collaborative outsourced solutions, it's very important that we secure the data and that we have the right sort of stability in our systems to facilitate the realtime programs that we do, so that's an area that we'll continue to invest heavily in. Purchase order, order management, inventory management capabilities. As we get more integrated into our customers' supply chains, it becomes more and more important that we can consolidate, deconsolidate, that we can provide information at the order level and help our customers drive efficiencies and manage inventory in their supply chain and that will continue to be an important investment area for us. 
Analytics and data science, we have a very significant data warehouse and a lot of capabilities around analytics that we extend to both our capacity providers and our customers, and we will continue to invest in that to make sure that we have market-leading information and that we can help our customers adapt to the changing market conditions just as we do with our own business model. So those are couple of the areas that I wanted to highlight that we're going to continue to invest as technology continues to change in our industry. We believe we're one of the leaders and we've got some good things in works that we think will continue to keep us in a good competitive spotlight. 
The last bullet-point that we highlighted on there from a strategic priority standpoint is mergers and acquisitions. As we've said many times, we've been around for 110 years and our 2 largest acquisitions in our 110-year history have both occurred in the last 3 years with Phoenix and Freightquote acquisitions. We have not changed our approach or messaging around acquisitions. We continue to have what we believe is a very meaningful filter around finding the right sorts of deals for Robinson and that starts with cultural fit, but also encompasses all the right sort of financial metrics and business model parameters that we think are important to providing integrated services and managing our business as one global network. 
So we'll continue to have those high standards of what we think is the right sort of addition to Robinson. However, given the current capital environment and the activity in the marketplace and our ability to use our balance sheet more if appropriate, we are going to continue to look and to try to identify opportunities where we can create value by expanding our M&A activity as well too. Increasing our global footprint and increasing our service capabilities are probably the 2 broad bullet-points that we would focus in in terms of priorities and the types of acquisitions that we think would have the most ability to add value. 
So those are some of the strategic priorities. Again, it's important to highlight those because I think those are the long-term foundation of creating value while we do our best to adapt and help our customers and capacity providers, adapt to the cycles in the marketplace. With that, that concludes our prepared comments for this morning and I will turn it over to Tim, to facilitate our Q&A session of the call."

Prioritizing and determining what we're going to work on and focus in on the technology area has become increasingly challenging just because of the universe of opportunities that exist. But for several decades now, we have tried to adapt or adopt a balanced approach towards focusing in on productivity initiatives as well as some of the connectivity initiatives that I talked about before with making sure that the exchange of data and the transparency of data is there. And an important focus too is that market-facing customer insights, customer analytics, making sure that we've got everything that we need to create better solutions and help our customers and capacity providers get smarter in the marketplace.

For the last 5 years, we've been sharing our quarterly activity in terms of what we've experienced on average rate per mile and average price increases through our shippers as well as our average cost of hire and change to the capacity providers that",716,"Yes. For the last 5 years, we've been sharing our quarterly activity in terms of what we've experienced on average rate per mile and average price increases through our shippers as well as our average cost of hire and change to the capacity providers that we have. Andy, mentioned earlier in review of the slides that for the current quarter, the pricing was relatively flat and the cost of hire was down 1%. If you look back over the last 5 years, I think the 5-year average of those numbers that we've disclosed is somewhere around 4.5% and I think very consistent with what we and maybe many others in the industry have been saying that there is some underlying cost pressure increases around driver shortages and increased equipment and increased regulation that's limiting productivity. So you put that all together and over the last 5 years, I think the industry, and we have seen some above inflation cost increases due to a lot of the factors that have been talked about in the industry. However, when you look at the last 5 years, from quarter-to-quarter standpoint and year-to-year standpoint, those increases have at times been double digits and at times have been flat to small declines. So when you -- my earlier comments kind of setting up around the cyclicality of what's going on is very difficult to predict the cycles and to really time them perfectly in terms of understanding what's going on in the marketplace. But there's no question, as you look at our results and look at the industry that the price increases and the rate of growth have tapered off during the year as the market has softened, and we see that continuing into the fourth quarter as we shared with our October results to date so far in terms of what we're seeing. We also talked about fourth quarter and first quarter being an active bid season and again, I think one of the things that's important to remember about C.H. Robinson is we do not have centralized pricing decision-making. We do not have GRIs. We do not give targeted price increases across the network. It's that decentralized account management strategy that is working with all of our shippers and all of our capacity providers to work literally on thousands of lanes in each of these bids that we participate in and it becomes very fragmented and very spread out in terms of how we think about making adjustments and properly repositioning ourselves and the route guide based on what our customers want from us in all of those relationships. So no question, there's a more muted pricing outlook and we're down on the lower end of that range of change that we've seen over the last 5 years. But in terms of exactly what it means in terms of price increases, that really probably remains to be seen based upon the next couple of quarters and how the marketplace continues to evolve. In terms of predicting our net revenue margins, that gets even a little bit more challenging because really, whether our net revenue margins expand or contract, over the last 5 years, they've as I've mentioned earlier, both the pricing to the customers and our cost of hire have averaged a comparable amount, but sometimes the change gets ahead of each other on one side, where customer pricing or capacity costs might be moving at a little bit different rate and most of that is centered around whether or not we've anticipated or we and our shippers have anticipated the market impacts correctly. So everybody's expecting a softer market and everybody's moving down towards the lower end of price changes in the range and really whether net revenue margins on that committed business expand or contract, probably has more to do with how next year compares to what everybody's expecting during these bids versus the absolute tightness of the market year-over-year. So that's why it's difficult for us and we don't try to guide or except exactly what's going to happen with our net revenue margin, but we believe our track record of adapting to market conditions and adjusting both our customer pricing and our capacity pricing consistently over time, that track record sort of speaks for itself."

Again, the primary metric that we're looking at in terms of people and talent is around volume activity. We know that the margins are going to fluctuate. If you look back at our commentary over the last several years, when we're aggressively taking more market share, we do need to add people into those sales and account management roles to facilitate that high volume growth. There have been other periods of time when we've been adapting to aggressive market changes and not experiencing the same significant volume growth but really focusing in on price changes and adapting to more volatile market conditions where we've talked about leveraging the experienced team that we have more as opposed to adding. So like many years, we're going into next year with a balanced growth approach, hoping to add to our team and continue to strengthen it, but we will adapt to market conditions largely based upon our view of opportunity for volume and market share opportunities."

In addition, because we have completed those two large acquisitions of Phoenix and Freightquote, the purchase accounting and some of those amortization costs in those business services also put some downward pressure on that. We have been able to improve that this year. I would say it's a combination of things. If you go back 3 years ago, we talked a lot about not only including the purchase accounting from Phoenix, but there was a significant amount of integration spending that we went through in 2013, especially where today, I feel like we're harvesting some of those efficiencies and that service offering has continued to get much more efficient and contribute in a great way to that improved operating income. Where can we go from here? There are other services and other areas that we've been investing in but have not reached scale that we would like to in terms of achieving operating income margins that we think are sustainable. I would throw out Europe as an area where we've invested heavily in the last 20 years and feel like there's opportunity to improve that. Our Managed Services, as we continue to aggressively implement new relationships, there's a lot of implementation spending that happens early on in those relationships that as we mature that business, it should provide some opportunity for improvement. We've talked about our lack of scale in intermodal and a few other start-up or emerging services where we think we could improve that. That, combined with using technology just to continue to improve our core business processes and what we're doing, we do have a pretty healthy list of ways that we hope to be able to continue to improve that operating margin. We've also acknowledged that since it is industry-leading in terms of where it's at right now, that in the balance of growth and profitability or efficiency, that we want to stay focused on the growth side of the continuum. So we are going to continue to look for ways to grow our business and expand our services even if they don't always instantly improve that metric for us."

Really, if you look across all the different service offerings that we have, even though we acknowledge there's a lot of new worthy competitors, there still are thousands of them in every -- almost every service offering that we have. So while there's a lot of change in the competitive landscape and it remains a very competitive industry, most of these bids that we're participating in literally have hundreds of providers in each bid scenario that we're working on with our larger customers. With a mix shift and changes and shippers evolving their roles, we're constantly trying to improve our market share and our relationship in terms of the activity, but it's very difficult to understand who you might be taking it from or in the aggregate, why you're winning or losing against specific people. The last thing that I would share is, we do believe that from a 3PL standpoint, a common -- a significant trend in the marketplace has been that more and more of the activity out there is probably running through a 3PL today versus 10 years ago so that some of the market share gains are coming from the evolution of the marketplace itself where models like us are more accepted and maybe not coming directly from a competitor as well."

Probably no doubt, when you're in a part of the cycle like we are now where demand is softening that it would be very logical that people would be a little bit less concerned about locking down committed debt capacity for next year because the sentiment going in is that capacity is going to be more available. We have talked about one of the ongoing tensions in this bid process and trying to anticipate the cycles of truckload is that you can go after very aggressive rates and committed pricing, and if the market moves and tightens up and price increases become more significant than everybody was anticipating, that can be very challenging to your route guide and cause the need for a lot of meaningful adjustments and changes or exposure to the spot market as you go forward. So probably less concerned about locking down capacity for 2016 today versus a year ago, however there remains that sort of ongoing tension around really trying to anticipate the cyclicality of the market and make sure that you optimize your approach the marketplace to get a good outcome for next year."

However, when you look at our Robinson Fresh business, very were similar to what I talked about in the look-ahead comments, the long approach towards adding value is to really improve or increase our participation or market share around our volume and the types of products and commodities that we're interacting with and integrate those into our transportation services to provide better answers for the customers. We did increase our volume, but similar to truckload, the produce industry is very cyclical as well too, so we are going to continue -- we always have, and we will continue to see fluctuations in crop availability and the types of supply and demand relationships that will impact our margins. With a lot of the weather situations and some of the volatility of the various crops that we do buy and sell and distribute for our customers, we do expect to continue to see some volatile results. Our year-to-date net revenue growth for our Sourcing business is probably fairly consistent with what our longer-term expectations are and remember that for this Robinson Fresh business internally, there's also some temperature-controlled transportation that is aligned with those perishable commodities, and our temperature-controlled transportation results have been consistent with our overall transportation results providing good growth for the year. So that division with insight of Robinson has done a nice job of servicing their customers and growing their presence in the marketplace and just due to the nature of the business where we're buying and selling the fresh commodities, we do expect to continue to see some volatility in the net revenue growth from a quarter-to-quarter standpoint."

There's more of a continuum of relationships around where we are in the route guide and what exactly those commitments represent. If you go back 15, 20 years, Robinson was almost 100% transactional. We were pretty much reacting every day to what opportunities were available. Over the last couple of decades, as we've integrated in with larger shippers and have participated in a lot of annual bid processes to sign up for committed volumes and activities, that business has become somewhere around 1/2 or maybe a little bit more of our business today. So our most common answer to that is it's roughly half contracted and half spot market business. But in reality on a day-to-day basis, the amount of freight that's moving under pre-priced contracts versus the amount of freight that's moving in the spot market can change based upon the supply and demand conditions in the marketplace and how the market is reacting. So that's the answer on the first part of the question, from the second part, in terms of, will we experience net revenue margin improvement, again, I go back to the answer that I gave earlier. The challenging part there is that as we renew these bids in the next couple of quarters and reset the pricing levels in a lot of the committed or contracted freight, we're working with our capacity providers in looking at our historical analytics and anticipating the market to try to come up with what we think is the right approach in 2016. Our net revenue margins will expand or contract largely based on how the market varies from what we were expecting going into these contracts and the expectations with these contracts are very localized, very decentralized on a customer-specific basis. So that's as I said earlier, it gets difficult to predict what we think will happen to our net revenue margins. As we shared through October, as 2015 comes to an end, we know that we will probably have some continuation of the net revenue margin expansion in the fourth quarter just because of where we're at in the marketplace. 2016 gets a lot more challenging to predict."

We acquired Phoenix global forwarding business, where best-in-class, has lower operating margins, and then we had some purchase accounting from that acquisition that all combined had a pretty significant impact in that operating income to net revenue metric. While that didn't feel good in 2012, we thought it was the right thing to do for the long-term and that we would be able to integrate and improve the operating margins of our legacy forwarding business and really kind of use the combined scale to continue to improve that service offering, which in fact, has happened. T-Chek has cycled out of the comparisons and we've been able to leverage some of our technology investments just to continue to improve the efficiency of the service offering that we acquired there.
