With me today are Tyco's Chief Executive Officer, George Oliver; and our Chief Financial Officer, Arun Nayar.
I would like to remind you that during the course of today's call, we will be providing certain forward-looking information. We ask that you look at today's press release and read through the forward-looking cautionary informational statements that we've included there.
In addition, we will use certain non-GAAP measures in our discussions, and we ask that you read through the sections of our press release that address the use of these items. The press release issued this morning and all related tables, as well as the conference call slides, which George and Arun will refer to, can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at tyco.com. Please also note that we will be filing our quarterly SEC form 10-Q later today.
In discussing our segment operations, when we refer to changes in backlog and order activity, these figures exclude the impact of foreign currency. Additionally, references to operating margins during the call exclude special items, and this metric is a non-GAAP measure and is reconciled in the schedules attached to our press release.
Now let me quickly recap this quarter's results. Revenue in the quarter of $2.48 billion declined 1% year-over-year on a reported basis. Organic revenue growth of 2% and a 1% benefit from acquisitions was more than offset by a 4% negative impact related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Tyco ordinary shareholders was $0.38 and included net charges of $0.11 related to special items. These special items related primarily to restructuring and repositioning charges. Earnings per share from continuing operations before special items was $0.49.
Now let me turn the call over to George."

We were off to a solid start as we entered the final year of our initial Three-Year Plan as a new Tyco. Although the economic environment in certain regions is shaping up to be a bit more challenging than we had initially expected, the execution of our growth strategy and our disciplined capital allocation position us to accelerate top line growth, expand operating margins and deliver a strong earnings growth in 2015. Our growth strategy is supported by internal initiatives within our control driven by our transformation into an integrated Fire & Security operating company. We have a proven track record of delivering productivity and are beginning to change how we do business by leveraging technology within our direct channel to deliver sustained growth over the long-term.
Over the last 2 years, we have taken the holding company structure of multiple segments with multiple businesses, operating independently with a lot of variation across work streams and processes and have streamlined into an operating company structure. This has allowed us to leverage our depth and expertise across Fire & Security so that we could simplify our structure, create speed in how we support our customers, free up resource to reinvest in the businesses and deliver a strong margin improvement. We have made significant progress and the Tyco business system has enabled this transformation.
As a result, we have a coordinated and aligned strategy that is deployed by business and by region. As we enter 2015, we now have all of our leaders across the company accountable for the total Tyco performance, not just their individual business units, embracing a one Tyco mindset driven by top line growth, supported by a continuous operational improvement.
We've had a very productive start to 2016 with lots of progress on a number of fronts, including innovation, innovative solutions and M&A, which is summarized on Slide 3. As discussed during our recent Investor Day, we have made significant progress in our ability to enhance our service and productivity with the launch of Tyco On, our integrated data and smart services platform. Tyco On provides a set of software-enabled Internet of things capabilities that enhance safety and security systems using open standards to connect a wide range of intelligent devices, systems and services, enabling customers from small businesses to large multinationals to improve their operations. I am pleased to share some examples of how we are delivering differentiated solutions to help address customer needs.
First, our ExacTech solution improves efficiency through a service application already in use in our Installation & Services business. ExacTech allows a single technician to perform fire alarm testing, eliminating the need of a second technician to complete the procedure. By using a mobile app, the technician can test detectors throughout the building and connect remotely to the system's fire panel. In the future, this application will offer cloud-enabled storage and access to testing documentation, providing a more cost-effective solution that will appeal to a broad base of customers.
Second, we are enabling more complex, smart solutions that leverage data from various devices and systems and apply advanced analytics to reveal insights that lead to better decisions, faster execution and transformational business outcomes for customers. For example, in over 4,000 retail locations, we are helping retailer's tied together data from our RFID tags, video, electronic article surveillance and traffic centers, transforming it into actionable intelligence through our latest release of TrueVUE software. With these insights, retailers can optimize their inventory management, deliver a more pleasant shopper experience and maximize revenue.
Lastly, we continue to build our global library of system and device integrations. Our integrated solutions platform is now incorporated into our fire detection system, certified for European markets, and enables real-time visual verification of fire alarms, allowing immediate and appropriate response and action, providing compelling customer value.
In addition to the great progress the team has made, I am very pleased to have Daryll Fogal join our management team as our Chief Technology Officer. Daryll has global responsibility for executing our technology strategy, including the capabilities in operations needed to support the development of products, services and solutions. Daryll recently joined us after a long career at Honeywell and most recently, Eaton, where he was Chief Technology Officer and Vice President of engineering for their electrical sector. I am very excited to have Daryll join us in this critical role as we evolve into a growth and innovation company.
Turning to M&A. We continue to be very active on the M&A front. During the first quarter, we signed or completed 5 acquisitions focused on key areas of growth, including building on our services platform, expanding our presence in growth markets and growing our product portfolio, with all of them strengthening our technology platform.
Let me give you a brief summary. Within the U.K, we acquired First Choice Facilities or FCF, which designs, installs, commissions and maintains a wide range of integrated Fire & Security solutions. FCF has a strong installed base with a very robust service delivery model, which strengthens our regional footprint and increases our recurring revenue. This acquisition will be reported within our Rest of World Install and Services segment.
The remaining 4 acquisitions are within our Global Product segment and span across the 3 platforms of Fire Protection, Security Products and Life Safety. 
Within Fire Protection Products, we acquired Shanghai Jindun, a fire suppression products business in China, which complements our organic investments and quickly accelerates our position in a large and expanding Tier 2 market.
In Security Products, we made a majority investment in Qolsys, an IoT developer of the industry's most advanced interactive intrusion platform, supporting Life Safety, energy management and other functions. 
In Life Safety, we acquired ISG Infrasys, a world leader in the design of thermal imaging technology with a reputation for top image quality. Coupled with our Scott brand and customer base, we can significantly leverage ISG's technology.
Additionally, within Life Safety, we signed a definitive agreement to acquire Industrial Safety Technologies, or IST, a leading player in the gas and flame detection industry. This is the largest transaction to date post separation, and it is expected to generate annualized revenues of approximately $140 million. The addition of IST to our Life Safety product portfolio will bring our customers a full range of safety solutions across both fixed and portable detection. This acquisition is not only a natural extension of our product portfolio, but significantly expands our product offerings within Life Safety, which can now provide a full breadth of products in flame, gas and open path detection. IST is a high growth, high profit business with leading technology. We expect to leverage our global sales force in distribution channels to pull through additional IST products.  Over time, we intend to expand IST's service footprint, which accounts for approximately 25% of its annual revenue. We expect to close the IST transaction towards the end of our second quarter. 
Altogether, these 5 acquisitions total approximately $470 million in purchase price, with annualized revenues of $240 million.
Subsequent to quarter end, we signed 3 additional small bolt-ons for a total purchase price of $45 million, including a service business in North America, a leader in wireless fire detection technology and a provider of integrated RFID solutions. Together, these 3 acquisitions are expected to generate annualized revenue of approximately $25 million.
For fiscal 2015, we expect these 8 acquisitions to add an incremental $175 million to revenue and $0.03 to EPS, excluding the onetime impact of inventory step-ups, primarily related to the IST acquisition, which will be reported as a special item. We still have several nice opportunities in our M&A pipeline, which we will continue to work on during the year. These acquisitions, along with the internal investments we continue to make in technology, accelerate our strategic priorities with a focus on technology platforms that form the foundation of new innovative solutions, which our direct channel can utilize to solve the problems of our customers. 
Before we get into the details of the first quarter, I thought I would provide an update on what we are seeing in the significant geographies that impact our performance around the world.
Starting with North America. We are continuing to see acceleration in order activity in our earlier cycle Fire business. We are also seeing a nice pickup in orders in Security, with the first quarter of fiscal 2015 marking the highest install order quarter since separation. It is important to recognize that since separation, our North America Security business has undergone a significant transformation in strategy and execution. Given the recent order activity in both Fire & Security, we expect our North America install and service business to be a larger contributor to growth in the second half of this year.
Turning to Europe. We continue to expect a sluggish environment, which continues to bounce along the bottom. Additionally, the added headwind related to the strengthening U.S. dollar is and will continue to put pressure on our businesses. Given our significant restructuring actions over the years, as well as our sourcing and productivity initiatives, we feel well-positioned to continue to expand margins in a relatively low growth environment.
In Australia, we started to see some larger orders come through at the end of our fiscal year, which made us feel somewhat optimistic that we had hit the bottom and would start to see a bit of stabilization. However, the last few months have proven to be more challenging, and we are now expecting a mid-single-digit decline in organic revenue for the year, with significant pressure on service revenue. Our team continues to stay close to the market and take actions required to maintain the fundamentals of the business despite the downturn. But in the meantime, this will have an impact on our Rest of World install and services results.
Turning to our growth markets. We continue to expect double-digit growth in 2015. What is critical in driving this performance is taking the success that we've had in our mature markets, including our depth and expertise, and localizing it so that we can deploy our products and services successfully within these markets. Our organic investments are enhanced by our M&A activity, which helps accelerate our ability to develop a local footprint. A perfect example of this is the acquisition we completed this quarter in China, which I spoke to earlier.
Now let me give you a quick overview of our results for the quarter, and Arun will focus on our results for each of our segments. Overall, I am pleased with our start to fiscal 2015. As I mentioned on our Fourth Quarter Earnings Call, the first quarter of fiscal 2014 was a very strong quarter for us driven by a stronger-than-normal retail season with a favorable mix. Organic growth of 2% was led by phenomenal growth quarter in our product businesses, which grew 10% organically. Segment operating margin expansion of 30 basis points was slightly ahead of our expectations for the quarter even after offsetting a 20 basis point headwind related to a labor matter. Earnings per share before special items of $0.49 was at the high-end of our guidance and represents a 17% increase year-over-year. Overall, a solid start to the year.
Now let me turn it over to Arun to go through the details of our performance."
107534,280894848,752211,"Tyco International Ltd., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 30, 2015",2015-01-30,"Earnings Calls","Tyco International plc","Executives","Thank you, George, and good morning, everyone. You can follow my comments on our financial performance starting with Slide 5.Let me start with an overview of our results for the first quarter. Revenue of $2.48 billion declined 1% year-over-year. As Geor",1097,"Thank you, George, and good morning, everyone. You can follow my comments on our financial performance starting with Slide 5.
Let me start with an overview of our results for the first quarter. Revenue of $2.48 billion declined 1% year-over-year. As George mentioned, organic revenue grew 2%, led by 10% growth in Global Products. Within our installation and service businesses, service revenue resumed growth in both North America and Rest of World, for total organic service growth of 1%. Installation revenue was relatively flat year-over-year. Acquisition growth of 1% was more than offset by a 4% headwind related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
Before special items, segment operating income was $326 million, including an $11 million headwind related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and the operating margin was 13.2%. Higher product revenues and the benefits from sourcing, productivity and restructuring initiatives were partially offset by a legal charge resulting in net operating margin expansion of 30 basis points. 
Earnings per share before special items increased $0.07 or 17% year-over-year. Operationally, we delivered an incremental $0.04 of earnings, driven by strong revenue growth in products, along with continued productivity initiatives. The remaining $0.03 of incremental earnings was primarily driven by the benefit of share repurchases during the quarter, offset by $0.02 related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and the $0.01 legal charge.
Turning to orders on Slide 6. As I've often mentioned in previous quarterly calls, it is important to keep in mind that order growth, particularly in our installation business, is lumpy, and can be impacted by the timing of large projects. Orders in the quarter grew 2% year-over-year, with 6% growth in North America and 7% growth in products. Rest of World declined 5% due to pressure in Australia, as well as a tough compare with the prior year.
Backlog of $4.8 billion increased 3% year-over-year and 2% on a quarter sequential basis.
Now let's get into the details of each of the segments. Starting first with North America Installation & Services on Slide 7. Revenue in the quarter of $951 million decreased 1% on a reported basis, driven by the weakening of the Canadian dollar. Organic growth was relatively muted in the first quarter as 1% growth in service was offset by a 1% decline in installation revenue. We expect organic growth to increase in the second quarter and accelerate from there in the second half of the year. Before special items, operating income in the quarter was $131 million and the operating margin was 13.8%. Operating income included an incremental charge related to a labor wage claim, which impacted the operating margin by 60 basis points. Despite unfavorable mix and the incremental legal charge, the operating margin improved 30 basis points year-over-year as the impact of these items was more than offset by productivity and restructuring benefits. Overall, orders grew 6% year-over-year in North America Installation & Services, with installation growth of 13%, driven by a few large orders in security and service growth of 1%. Total backlog of $2.5 billion grew 5% compared with the prior year and increased 1% on a quarter sequential basis.
Turning to Slide 8. Rest of World Installation & Services revenue of $917 million decreased 6% year-over-year, driven by a 7% unfavorable impact related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Organic growth was relatively flat, with modest growth in both service and installation revenue. Acquisitions contributed 2% revenue growth, which was partially offset by the impact of divestitures. Before special items, operating income was $90 million and the operating margin decreased 80 basis points to 9.8%. The benefits of productivity and restructuring initiatives were more than offset by the mix of businesses contributing to growth, a lower percentage of high margin service revenue as well as the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates.
Turning to order activity in Rest of World. Total orders declined 5% year-over-year. Service orders increased 3% and installation orders declined 12% compared to 16% install order growth in the prior year. Backlog of $2.1 billion increased 2% both on a year-over-year and quarter sequential basis.
Turning to Global Products on Slide 9. Revenue grew 8% in the quarter to $611 million. Organic revenue growth of 10% was driven by strong growth across all 3 platforms, led by Security Products and Life Safety. A 1% benefit to revenue from acquisitions was more than offset by a 3% decrease to revenue related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Before special items, operating income was $105 million and the operating margin was 17.2%. The 130 basis point expansion in operating margin was driven by increased revenues, favorable mix as well as the benefit of productivity and restructuring initiatives. Product orders increased 7% year-over-year.
Now let me touch on a few other items on Slide 10. First, corporate expense before special items was $55 million for the quarter. We expect corporate expense in the second quarter to be on a similar level.
Next, our effective tax rate before the impact of special items was 17.5% for the quarter. We expect the effective tax rate for the second quarter to be in the range of 17% to 18%.
As it relates to share count, we repurchased 10 million shares for $417 million during the first quarter, resulting in a weighted average and quarter end diluted share count of 427 million shares.
Turning to foreign exchange on Slide 11. The U.S. dollar has continued to appreciate over the last several months, putting additional pressure on both the top and bottom line. From our November earnings call to now, changes in foreign currency exchange rates have put an additional $0.09 of pressure on earnings per share on top of the $0.07 of pressure we previously forecasted. Our 2015 guidance now includes a $585 million headwind to revenue, which equates to a $0.16 headwind to EPS related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
Lastly, I would like to touch on the progress we have made on our restructuring and repositioning plans for this year. To date, we have taken restructuring and repositioning actions resulting in $75 million charges and we now expect to be closer to the $150 million estimate we have provided for the year. As these actions are largely related to workforce reductions, the benefits of these actions will be reflected in our results in the second half of this year. We continue to have a strong pipeline of projects that are being executed to simplify our structure and improve operations.
Now let me turn things back over to George."

Let's turn now to Slide 12 for our earnings guidance for the second quarter, starting with the top line. As we move into the second quarter, we expect organic growth to accelerate from the 2% we saw this quarter to approximately 3%. Addition",566,"Thanks, Arun. Let's turn now to Slide 12 for our earnings guidance for the second quarter, starting with the top line. As we move into the second quarter, we expect organic growth to accelerate from the 2% we saw this quarter to approximately 3%. Additionally, recent acquisition activity is expected to add an additional point of revenue growth. Given current exchange rates, we expect growth in revenue to be offset by a 6 percentage point or $150 million year-over-year headwind related to changes in foreign currency. Taking these factors into account, we expect revenue in the second quarter to decline approximately 2% year-over-year on a reported basis.
I also want to remind you that in the second quarter of last year included a $21 million insurance recovery, which was reported within our Rest of World Install & Services segment.
If you refer to Slide 13, you can see that the insurance recovery benefited the Rest of World operating margin by 220 basis points and benefited total segment margin by 90 basis points. Additionally, this recovery contributed $0.04 of earnings per share.
Looking at the second quarter of fiscal 2015, on a normalized basis, we expect the segment operating margin before special items to expand 50 basis points to approximately 13.5%.
Turning to Slide 14, we expect operations in the second quarter to contribute approximately $0.05 of incremental earnings year-over-year. Additionally, our expected weighted average share count of 428 million shares in the second quarter is also expected to contribute an additional $0.05 of incremental earnings. This earnings growth is expected to be partially offset by the $0.04 benefit in the prior year related to the insurance recovery and a $0.03 headwind related to foreign currency exchange rates.
Taking all of these assumptions into account, we expect earnings per share before special items in the second quarter to be in the range of $0.48 to $0.50, a 4% to 9% increase over the prior year. Compared to a normalized earnings per share of $0.42 in the prior year, this represents a 14% to 19% increase in earnings per share before special items.
Moving to our expectations for the full year on Slide 15. We continue to expect organic revenue growth of approximately 4%. However, adjusting for current exchange rates and including recent acquisitions, we now expect revenue for the full year to be similar to last year on a reported basis. Additionally, we continue to expect segment operating margin before special items to expand 80 to 110 basis points excluding the impact of recent acquisitions. While we continue to deliver strong operating performance, the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar is putting additional pressure on our results. Our initial earnings per share before special items guidance for the full year of $2.35 to $2.45 had fully absorbed the expected $0.07 headwind related to changes in foreign currency, with accelerated productivity and restructuring actions. Current exchange rates have resulted in an incremental $0.09 of foreign currency headwinds, which we are able to partially offset with an expected $0.04 benefit from recent acquisitions and additional productivity. As a result, we are updating our full year earnings per share before special items guidance to be in the range of $2.30 to $2.40, which represents a 16% to 21% increase year-over-year.

Arun talked about it in his prepared remarks that we accelerated some of the planned restructuring in the first quarter, and we're going to see some benefits from that. We also have been executing very well on our growth strategy, continuing to execute not only organic growth but also working on the acquisitions, and the benefits now from the acquisitions that we've been able to complete, we now see $0.03 of benefit in the second half of the year. And so we're going to continue to work, as we laid out our plan, we get about $150 million of productivity on an annualized basis that supports the significant reinvestment and growth while we're continuing to expand our margins 80 to 100 basis points.

So there is a natural hedge in place there. The",401,"Deane, let me just start by saying that 75% of our business is install and service, where our cost structure and the currency of our cost structure is the same as the currency in which we drive our revenues. So there is a natural hedge in place there. There is no exposure from a currency perspective. The Global Products, as you rightly pointed out, is where we manufacture in a few locations and ship our products around the world in different currencies, and that's where we have the transactional exposure, and we do hedge that transactional exposure pretty close to 100% across the world in all the currencies. So we have no de minimis P&L impact from that transactional exposure our products businesses. Now there is -- the headwinds that you're seeing relate to translational exposure, as we translate the earnings that we have in different currencies into the U.S. dollar for reporting purposes. That translation exposure we do not hedge, as if you were to do that, it would actually create an economic risk to the enterprise. Now one benefit that we have, keep in mind, is our Irish domicile. As an Irish domicile company, we have complete access to our cash across the world on a daily basis. Unlike a U.S. domicile company, we would have dividend the cash back. So we do not have to worry about the repatriation of cash, which the U.S. domicile company is after. Now also just to kind of keep on the subject of FX hedging and the exposure, there are obviously other operational things that we take into account as we look at the exposure, the translational exposure. Basically, I look at 3 things. One is pricing and particularly in the high-inflation countries, we make sure that our pricing stays ahead of the inflation rate, so that the fundamentals of the business remain intact. The second is our supply chain network. We have a very sophisticated supply chain network led by a big leader in Andrea Greco and he is constantly optimizing that supply chain to make sure that they're getting the benefits of the currency movements. And the third that George had referred to earlier is the cost rationalization. Clearly, that's another lever. You saw us pull that lever pretty strongly in the first quarter ahead of the $0.07 headwind that we had initially expected, and that lever stays in place."

So if you look at it, the $90 million that we reported for Q1, that adds up to $98 million, and that's pretty comparable in dollar terms to what we had last year. As we think about our Rest of World business, basically, Europe, which is about 50% of Rest of World, is, like George mentioned in his prepared remarks, pretty stable. And the fundamentals of the business, the margins are expanding in a very low growth environment. Australia is where we are seeing deterioration, and a large part of what you see here is really driven by Australia. And the second piece is our growth markets, which is where the growth is coming from. So growth markets are delivering the growth that we expected. But as you know, our growth markets, the service component in our growth markets is lower than the install component. And therefore, the margins in the growth markets tend to be lower. And as they're growing, we expect the service platforms to build over a period of time. But in the meanwhile, it is creating a headwind in terms of the overall results we are seeing for Rest of World."

Now I thought in the latter part of last year we started to see some green shoots with some new products -- projects coming to market that we've been successful in being able to win. But the continued downturn in the overall service segment has hit us here early this year. Now what I would say is that when you get into the situation, we do have some undisciplined competitors. And what we do is make sure that we stay focused on how we create value in getting the return for the value that we create. And as we've gone through these cycles in the past, whether it be in Europe and other distressed markets, we come out the other end better and positioned to be able to accelerate the growth with the investments we continue to make.

So it's not a standalone product that you would see revenue on, but it's supporting our ability to be able to accelerate the deployment of our technology and then build new services on that technology that will accelerate our growth. And that is why when you look at our growth -- when we project growth in service, we're in the early stages of deploying this technology, but the capability that it creates for us to be able to build new services is pretty significant longer-term."

I would like to remind you that during the course of today's call, we will be providing certain forward-looking information. We ask that you look at today's press release and read through the forward-looking cautionary informational statements that we've included there.
In addition, we will use certain non-GAAP measures in our discussions, and we ask that you read through the sections of our press release that address the use of these items. The press release issued this morning and all related tables as well as the conference call slides, which George and Arun will refer to, can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at tyco.com. Please also note that we will be filing our quarterly SEC Form 10-Q later today.
In discussing our segment operations, when we refer to changes in backlog and order activity, these figures exclude the impact of foreign currency. Additionally, references to operating margins during the call exclude special items, and this metric is a non-GAAP measure and is reconciled in the schedules attached to our press release.
Now let me quickly recap this quarter's results. Revenue in the quarter of $2.48 billion declined 1% year-over-year on a reported basis. Organic revenue growth of 2% and a 1% benefit from acquisitions was more than offset by a 4% negative impact related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Tyco ordinary shareholders was $0.38 and included net charges of $0.11 related to special items. These special items related primarily to restructuring and repositioning charges. Earnings per share from continuing operations before special items was $0.49.

We were off to a solid start as we entered the final year of our initial 3-year plan as a new Tyco. Although the economic environment in certain regions is shaping up to be a bit more challenging than we had initially expected, the execution of our growth strategy and our disciplined capital allocation position us to accelerate top line growth, expand operating margins and deliver a strong earnings growth in 2015. Our growth strategy is supported by internal initiatives within our control, driven by our transformation into an integrated fire and security operating company. We have a proven track record of delivering productivity and are beginning to change how we do business by leveraging technology within our direct channel to deliver sustained growth over the long term.
Over the last 2 years, we have taken a holding company structure of multiple segments with multiple businesses, operating independently with a lot of variation across work streams and processes and have streamlined into an operating company structure. This has allowed us to leverage our depth and expertise across fire and security so that we could simplify our structure, create speed in how we support our customers, free up resources to reinvest in the businesses and deliver a strong margin improvement. We have made significant progress, and the Tyco business system has enabled this transformation.
As a result, we have a coordinated and aligned strategy that is deployed by business and by region. As we enter 2015, we now have all of our leaders across the company accountable for the total Tyco performance, not just their individual business units, embracing a one Tyco mindset, driven by top line growth, supported by a continuous operational improvement.
We've had a very productive start to 2016 with lots of progress on a number of fronts, including innovation, innovative solutions and M&A, which is summarized on Slide 3. As discussed during our recent Investor Day, we have made significant progress in our ability to enhance our service and productivity with the launch of Tyco On, our integrated data and smart services platform. Tyco On provides a set of software-enabled Internet of Things capabilities that enhance safety and security systems using open standards to connect to a wide range of intelligent devices, systems and services, enabling customers from small businesses to large multinationals to improve their operations. I am pleased to share some examples on how we are delivering differentiated solutions to help address customer needs.
First, our ExacTech solution improves efficiency through a service application already in use in our installation and services business. ExacTech allows a single technician to perform fire alarm testing, eliminating the need of a second technician to complete the procedure. By using a mobile app, the technician can test detectors throughout a building and connect remotely to the system's fire panel. In the future, this application will offer cloud-enabled storage and access to testing documentation, providing a more cost-effective solution that would appeal to a broad base of customers.
Second, we are enabling more complex, smart solutions that leverage data from various devices and systems and apply advanced analytics to reveal insights that lead to better decisions, faster execution and transformational business outcomes for customers. For example, in over 4,000 retail locations, we are helping retailers tie together data from our RFID tags, video, electronic article surveillance and traffic centers, transforming it into actionable intelligence through our latest release of TrueVUE software. With these insights, retailers can optimize their inventory management, deliver a more pleasant shopper experience and maximize revenue.
Lastly, we continue to build our global library of system and device integrations. Our integrated solutions platform is now incorporated into our fire detection system certified for European markets and enables real-time visual verification of fire alarms, allowing immediate and appropriate response and action, providing compelling customer value.
In addition to the great progress the team has made, I am very pleased to have Daryll Fogal join our management team as our Chief Technology Officer. Daryll has global responsibility for executing our technology strategy, including the capabilities in operations needed to support the development of products, services and solutions. Daryll recently joined us after a long career at Honeywell and most recently, Eaton, where he was Chief Technology Officer and Vice President of engineering for their electrical sector. I am very excited to have Daryll join us in this critical role as we evolve into a growth and innovation company.
Turning to M&A. We continue to be very active on the M&A front. During the first quarter, we signed or completed 5 acquisitions focused on key areas of growth, including building on our services platform, expanding our presence in growth markets and growing our product portfolio, with all of them strengthening our technology platform.
Let me give you a brief summary. Within the U.K., we acquired First Choice Facilities, or FCF, which designs, installs, commissions and maintains a wide range of integrated fire and security solutions. FCF has a strong installed base with a very robust service delivery model, which strengthens our regional footprint and increases our recurring revenue. This acquisition will be reported within our Rest of World Install and Services segment.
The remaining 4 acquisitions are within our Global Products segment and span across the 3 platforms of Fire Protection, Security Products and Life Safety.
Within Fire Protection Products, we acquired Shanghai Jindun, a fire suppression products business in China, which complements our organic investments and quickly accelerates our position in a large and expanding Tier 2 market.
In Security Products, we made a majority investment in Qolsys, an IoT developer of the industry's most advanced interactive intrusion platform, supporting life safety, energy management and other functions.
In Life Safety, we acquired ISG Infrasys, a world leader in the design of thermal imaging technology with a reputation for top image quality. Coupled with our Scott brand and customer base, we can significantly leverage ISG's technology.
Additionally, within Life Safety, we signed a definitive agreement to acquire Industrial Safety Technologies, or IST, a leading player in the gas and flame detection industry. This is the largest transaction to date post separation, and it's expected to generate annualized revenues of approximately $140 million. The addition of IST to our Life Safety product portfolio will bring our customers a full range of safety solutions across both fixed and portable detection. This acquisition is not only a natural extension of our product portfolio but significantly expands our product offerings within Life Safety, which can now provide a full breadth of products in flame, gas and open path detection. IST is a high-growth, high-profit business with leading technology. We expect to leverage our global sales force in distribution channels to pull through additional IST products.  Over time, we intend to expand IST's service footprint, which accounts for approximately 25% of its annual revenue. We expect to close the IST transaction towards the end of our second quarter.
Altogether, these 5 acquisitions total approximately $470 million in purchase price, with annualized revenues of $240 million.
Subsequent to the quarter end, we signed 3 additional small bolt-ons for a total purchase price of $45 million, including a service business in North America, a leader in wireless fire detection technology and a provider of integrated RFID solutions. Together, these 3 acquisitions are expected to generate annualized revenue of approximately $25 million.
For fiscal 2015, we expect these 8 acquisitions to add an incremental $175 million to revenue and $0.03 to EPS, excluding the onetime impact of inventory step-ups, primarily related to the IST acquisition, which will be reported as a special item. We still have several nice opportunities in our M&A pipeline, which we will continue to work on during the year. These acquisitions, along with the internal investments we continue to make in technology, accelerate our strategic priorities with a focus on technology platforms that form the foundation of new innovative solutions, which our direct channel can utilize to solve the problems of our customers.
Before we get into the details of the first quarter, I thought I would provide an update on what we are seeing in the significant geographies that impact our performance around the world.
Starting with North America. We are continuing to see acceleration in order activity in our earlier-cycle fire business. We are also seeing a nice pickup in orders in security, with the first quarter of fiscal 2015 marking the highest install order quarter since separation. It is important to recognize that since separation, our North America security business has undergone a significant transformation in strategy and execution. Given recent order activity in both fire and security, we expect our North America install and service business to be a larger contributor to growth in the second half of this year.
Turning to Europe. We continue to expect a sluggish environment, which continues to bounce along the bottom. Additionally, the added headwind related to the strengthening U.S. dollar is and will continue to put pressure on our businesses. Given our significant restructuring actions over the years as well as our sourcing and productivity initiatives, we feel well positioned to continue to expand margins in a relatively low-growth environment.
In Australia, we started to see some larger orders come through at the end of our fiscal year, which made us feel somewhat optimistic that we had hit the bottom and would start to see a bit of stabilization. However, the last few months have proven to be more challenging, and we are now expecting a mid-single-digit decline in organic revenue for the year, with significant pressure on service revenue. Our team continues to stay close to the market and take actions required to maintain the fundamentals of the business despite the downturn. But in the meantime, this will have an impact on our Rest of World Install and Services results.
Turning to our growth markets. We continue to expect double-digit growth in 2015. What is critical in driving this performance is taking the success that we've had in our mature markets, including our depth and expertise, and localizing it so that we can deploy our products and services successfully within these markets. Our organic investments are enhanced by our M&A activity, which helps accelerate our ability to develop a local footprint. A perfect example of this is the acquisition we completed this quarter in China, which I spoke to earlier.
Now let me give you a quick overview of our results for the quarter, and Arun will focus on our results for each of our segments. Overall, I am pleased with our start to fiscal 2015. As I mentioned on our fourth quarter earnings call, the first quarter of fiscal 2014 was a very strong quarter for us, driven by a stronger-than-normal retail season with a favorable mix. Organic growth of 2% was led by a phenomenal growth quarter in our product businesses, which grew 10% organically. Segment operating margin expansion of 30 basis points was slightly ahead of our expectations for the quarter even after offsetting a 20 basis point headwind related to a labor matter. Earnings per share before special items of $0.49 was at the high end of our guidance and represents a 17% increase year-over-year. Overall, a solid start to the year.
Now let me turn it over to Arun to go through the details of our performance."
107534,280894848,752436,"Tyco International Ltd., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 30, 2015",2015-01-30,"Earnings Calls","Tyco International plc","Executives","Thank you, George, and good morning, everyone. You can follow my comments on our financial performance, starting with Slide 5.Let me start with an overview of our results for the first quarter. Revenue of $2.48 billion declined 1% year-over-year. As Geo",1096,"Thank you, George, and good morning, everyone. You can follow my comments on our financial performance, starting with Slide 5.
Let me start with an overview of our results for the first quarter. Revenue of $2.48 billion declined 1% year-over-year. As George mentioned, organic revenue grew 2%, led by 10% growth in Global Products. Within our Installation & Service businesses, Service revenue resumed growth in both North America and Rest of World, for total organic service growth of 1%. Installation revenue was relatively flat year-over-year. Acquisition growth of 1% was more than offset by a 4% headwind related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
Before special items, segment operating income was $326 million, including an $11 million headwind related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and the operating margin was 13.2%. Higher product revenues and the benefits from sourcing, productivity and restructuring initiatives were partially offset by a legal charge, resulting in net operating margin expansion of 30 basis points.
Earnings per share before special items increased $0.07 or 17% year-over-year. Operationally, we delivered an incremental $0.04 of earnings, driven by strong revenue growth in products, along with continued productivity initiatives. The remaining $0.03 of incremental earnings was primarily driven by the benefit of share repurchases during the quarter, offset by $0.02 related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and the $0.01 legal charge.
Turning to orders on Slide 6. As I've often mentioned in previous quarterly calls, it is important to keep in mind that order growth, particularly in our installation business, is lumpy and can be impacted by the timing of large projects. Orders in the quarter grew 2% year-over-year, with 6% growth in North America and 7% growth in products. Rest of World declined 5% due to pressure in Australia as well as a tough compare with the prior year.
Backlog of $4.8 billion increased 3% year-over-year and 2% on a quarter sequential basis.
Now let's get into the details of each of the segments. Starting first with North America Installation & Services on Slide 7. Revenue in the quarter of $951 million decreased 1% on a reported basis, driven by the weakening of the Canadian dollar. Organic growth was relatively muted in the first quarter, as 1% growth in service was offset by a 1% decline in installation revenue. We expect organic growth to increase in the second quarter and accelerate from there in the second half of the year. Before special items, operating income in the quarter was $131 million, and the operating margin was 13.8%. Operating income included an incremental charge related to a labor wage claim, which impacted the operating margin by 60 basis points. Despite unfavorable mix and the incremental legal charge, the operating margin improved 30 basis points year-over-year as the impact of these items was more than offset by productivity and restructuring benefits. Overall, orders grew 6% year-over-year in North America Installation & Services, with installation growth of 13%, driven by a few large orders in security and service growth of 1%. Total backlog of $2.5 billion grew 5% compared with the prior year and increased 1% on a quarter sequential basis.
Turning to Slide 8. Rest of World Installation & Services revenue of $917 million decreased 6% year-over-year, driven by a 7% unfavorable impact related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Organic growth was relatively flat, with modest growth in both service and installation revenue. Acquisitions contributed 2% revenue growth, which was partially offset by the impact of divestitures. Before special items, operating income was $90 million, and the operating margin decreased 80 basis points to 9.8%. The benefits of productivity and restructuring initiatives were more than offset by the mix of businesses contributing to growth, a lower percentage of high-margin service revenue as well as the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates.
Turning to order activity in Rest of World. Total orders declined 5% year-over-year. Service orders increased 3%, and installation orders declined 12% compared to 16% install order growth in the prior year. Backlog of $2.1 billion increased 2%, both on a year-over-year and quarter sequential basis.
Turning to Global Products on Slide 9. Revenue grew 8% in the quarter to $611 million. Organic revenue growth of 10% was driven by strong growth across all 3 platforms, led by Security Products and Life Safety. A 1% benefit to revenue from acquisitions was more than offset by a 3% decrease to revenue related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Before special items, operating income was $105 million, and the operating margin was 17.2%. The 130 basis point expansion in operating margin was driven by increased revenues, favorable mix as well as the benefit of productivity and restructuring initiatives. Product orders increased 7% year-over-year.
Now let me touch on a few other items on Slide 10. First, corporate expense before special items was $55 million for the quarter. We expect corporate expense in the second quarter to be on a similar level. Next, our effective tax rate before the impact of special items was 17.5% for the quarter. We expect the effective tax rate for the second quarter to be in the range of 17% to 18%. As it relates to share count, we repurchased 10 million shares for $417 million during the first quarter, resulting in a weighted average and quarter-end diluted share count of 427 million shares.
Turning to foreign exchange on Slide 11. The U.S. dollar has continued to appreciate over the last several months, putting additional pressure on both the top and bottom line. From our November earnings call to now, changes in foreign currency exchange rates have put an additional $0.09 of pressure on earnings per share on top of the $0.07 of pressure we previously forecasted. Our 2015 guidance now includes a $585 million headwind to revenue, which equates to a $0.16 headwind to EPS related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
Lastly, I would like to touch on the progress we have made on our restructuring and repositioning plans for this year. To date, we have taken restructuring and repositioning actions, resulting in $75 million of charges, and we now expect to be closer to the $150 million estimate we have provided for the year. As these actions are largely related to workforce reductions, the benefits of these actions will be reflected in our results in the second half of this year. We continue to have a strong pipeline of projects that are being executed to simplify our structure and improve operations.
Now let me turn things back over to George."

Let's turn now to Slide 12 for our earnings guidance for the second quarter, starting with the top line. As we move into the second quarter, we expect organic growth to accelerate from the 2% we saw this quarter to approximately 3%. Addition",566,"Thanks, Arun. Let's turn now to Slide 12 for our earnings guidance for the second quarter, starting with the top line. As we move into the second quarter, we expect organic growth to accelerate from the 2% we saw this quarter to approximately 3%. Additionally, recent acquisition activity is expected to add an additional point of revenue growth. Given current exchange rates, we expect growth in revenue to be offset by a 6 percentage point or $150 million year-over-year headwind related to changes in foreign currency. Taking these factors into account, we expect revenue in the second quarter to decline approximately 2% year-over-year on a reported basis.
I also want to remind you that in the second quarter of last year included a $21 million insurance recovery, which was reported within our Rest of World Install & Services segment.
If you refer to Slide 13, you can see that the insurance recovery benefited the Rest of World operating margin by 220 basis points and benefited total segment margin by 90 basis points. Additionally, this recovery contributed $0.04 of earnings per share.
Looking at the second quarter of fiscal 2015, on a normalized basis, we expect the segment operating margin before special items to expand 50 basis points to approximately 13.5%.
Turning to Slide 14. We expect operations in the second quarter to contribute approximately $0.05 of incremental earnings year-over-year. Additionally, our expected weighted average share count of 428 million shares in the second quarter is also expected to contribute an additional $0.05 of incremental earnings. This earnings growth is expected to be partially offset by the $0.04 benefit in the prior year related to the insurance recovery and a $0.03 headwind related to foreign currency exchange rates.
Taking all of these assumptions into account, we expect earnings per share before special items in the second quarter to be in the range of $0.48 to $0.50, a 4% to 9% increase over the prior year. Compared to a normalized earnings per share of $0.42 in the prior year, this represents a 14% to 19% increase in earnings per share before special items.
Moving to our expectations for the full year on Slide 15. We continue to expect organic revenue growth of approximately 4%. However, adjusting for current exchange rates and including recent acquisitions, we now expect revenue for the full year to be similar to last year on a reported basis. Additionally, we continue to expect segment operating margin before special items to expand 80 to 110 basis points, excluding the impact of recent acquisitions.
While we continue to deliver strong operating performance, the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar is putting additional pressure on our results. Our initial earnings per share before special items guidance for the full year of $2.35 to $2.45 had fully absorbed the expected $0.07 headwind related to changes in foreign currency, with accelerated productivity and restructuring actions. Current exchange rates have resulted in an incremental $0.09 of foreign currency headwinds, which we are able to partially offset with an expected $0.04 benefit from recent acquisitions and additional productivity. As a result, we are updating our full year earnings per share before special items guidance to be in the range of $2.30 to $2.40, which represents a 16% to 21% increase year-over-year.

We've been working on contingency because at that time, we saw a lot of headwind coming at us from an FX standpoint.

Arun talked about it in his prepared remarks that we accelerated some of the planned restructuring in the first quarter, and we're going to see some benefits from that. We also have been executing very well on our growth strategy, continuing to execute not only organic growth but also working on the acquisitions. And the benefits now from the acquisitions that we've been able to complete, we now see $0.03 of benefit in the second half of the year. And so we're going to continue to work. As we laid out our plan, we get about $150 million of productivity on an annualized basis that supports the significant reinvestment and growth, while we're continuing to expand our margins 80 to 100 basis points. And I can assure you that we're continuing to work every opportunity to make sure that we'll be positioned to deliver on the guidance -- the updated guidance that we provided."

So there is a natural hedge in place there.",410,"Deane, let me just start by saying that 75% of our business is install and service, where our cost structure and -- the currency of our cost structure is the same as the currency in which we drive our revenues. So there is a natural hedge in place there. We don't need -- there is no exposure from a currency perspective. The Global Products, as you rightly pointed out, is where we manufacture in a few locations and ship our products around the world in different currencies, and that's where we have the transactional exposure. And we do hedge that transactional exposure pretty close to 100% across the world in all the currencies. So we have no de minimis P&L impact from that transactional exposure on our Global Products businesses. Now there is -- the headwinds that you are seeing relate to translational exposure, as we translate the earnings that we have in different currencies into the U.S. dollar for reporting purposes. That translation exposure we do not hedge, as if you were to do that, it would actually create an economic risk to the enterprise. Now one benefit that we have, keep in mind, is our Irish domicile. As an Irish domicile company, we have complete access to our cash across the world on a daily basis, unlike a U.S. domicile company, which would have to dividend the cash back. So we do not have to worry about the repatriation of cash, which a U.S. domicile company is after. Now also, just to kind of keep on the subject of FX hedging and the exposure, there are obviously other operational things that we take into account as we look at the exposure, the translational exposure. Basically, I look at 3 things. One is pricing. And particularly in the high-inflation countries, we make sure that our pricing stays ahead of the inflation rate so that the fundamentals of the business remain intact. The second is our supply chain network. We have a very sophisticated supply chain network, led by a big leader in Andrea Greco. And he is constantly optimizing that supply chain to make sure that they're getting the benefits of the currency movements. And the third that George had referred to earlier is the cost rationalization. Clearly, that's another lever. You saw us pull that lever pretty strongly in the first quarter ahead of the $0.07 headwind that we had initially expected, and that lever stays in place."

As we think about our Rest of World business, basically, Europe, which is about 50% of Rest of World, is, like George mentioned in his prepared remarks, pretty stable. And the fundamentals of the business, the margins are expanding in a very low-growth environment. Australia is where we are seeing deterioration, and a large part of what you see here is really driven by Australia. And the second piece is our growth markets, which is where the growth is coming from. So growth markets are delivering the growth that we expected. But as you know, our growth markets, the service component in our growth markets is lower than the install component. And therefore, the margins in the growth markets tend to be lower.

About 17% of our Rest of World is split somewhat equally between Fire and Security. The difference here is we got about 70% service revenue. And now as we saw the decline in mining well over a year ago, and that started last year and continued through the year, we saw continued decline in that space, which was a big vertical segment for us. And then with the impact that, that has had on the economy, it's had a more broad-based impact on the other end markets that we support. Now I thought, in the latter part of last year, we started to see some green shoots with some new products -- projects coming to market that we've been successful in being able to win. But the continued downturn in the overall service segment has hit us here early this year. Now what I would say is that, and when you get into the situation, we do have some undisciplined competitors. And what we do is make sure that we stay focused on how we create value in getting the return for the value that we create. And as we've gone through these cycles in the past, whether it be in Europe and other distressed markets, we come out the other end better and positioned to be able to accelerate the growth with the investments we continue to make. And so we're seeing now, we're projecting that it's going to be down kind of mid to upper single digits here in Australia. But I can assure you that the work that we're doing locally in maintaining the fundamentals and the investments we continue to make that will support that business longer term, it will be well positioned to be able to deliver profitable growth."

Another good example is ExacTech, which we talked about. Not only does it enable us to be able to be much more efficient with how we perform the service, but the capabilities that we create with the data that we extract, and then the analytics that we apply to that data gives us a new service that we can offer to our customers to be able to grow the top line. So -- and then on the integrated solutions, when you look at fire and security equipment that's deployed across any one of our customer base, the ability to be able to integrate that in an efficient manner, collecting data and then being able to, again, apply analytics, that it gives us additional services to offer is what enables that. So it's not a standalone product that you would see revenue on, but it's supporting our ability to be able to accelerate the deployment of our technology and then build new services on that technology that will accelerate our growth. And that is why when you look at our growth -- when we project growth in service, we're in the early stages of deploying this technology, but the capability that it creates for us to be able to build new services is pretty significant longer term."

We get immediate traction. If it's a fire solution that we install, and then after a warranty period, then we pick up a preventative maintenance agreement, it could be 2 years out. So it varies. It's hard to say. And so what we're obviously working to do is making sure that we can embed technology upfront within the installation that we perform that then gives us the opportunity to be able to create more value right out of the gate with the customers that we serve. And so with the new technology that we've been developing, that's going to help us be able to pick up a higher percentage with the -- right after the immediate installation of the solution."

In addition, we will use certain non-GAAP measures in our discussions, and we ask that you read through the sections of our press release that address the use of these items.

Additionally, references to operating margins during the call exclude special items, and this metric is a non-GAAP measure and is reconciled in the schedules attached to our press release.
Now let me quickly recap this quarter's results. Revenue in the quarter of $2.48 billion declined 1% year-over-year on a reported basis. Organic revenue growth of 2% and a 1% benefit from acquisitions was more than offset by a 4% negative impact related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Tyco ordinary shareholders was $0.38 and included net charges of $0.11 related to special items. These special items related primarily to restructuring and repositioning charges. Earnings per share from continuing operations before special items was $0.49.

We are off to a solid start as we entered the final year of our initial 3-year plan as a new Tyco. Although the economic environment in certain regions is shaping up to be a bit more challenging than we had initially expected, the execution of our growth strategy and our disciplined capital allocation position us to accelerate top line growth, expand operating margins and deliver a strong earnings growth in 2015. Our growth strategy is supported by internal initiatives within our control, driven by our transformation into an integrated fire and security operating company. We have a proven track record of delivering productivity and are beginning to change how we do business by leveraging technology within our direct channel to deliver sustained growth over the long term.
Over the last 2 years, we have taken a holding company structure of multiple segments with multiple businesses, operating independently with a lot of variation across work streams and processes and have streamlined into an operating company structure. This has allowed us to leverage our depth and expertise across fire and security so that we could simplify our structure, create speed in how we support our customers, free up resources to reinvest in the businesses and deliver a strong margin improvement. We have made significant progress, and the Tyco business system has enabled this transformation.
As a result, we have a coordinated and aligned strategy that is deployed by business and by region. As we enter 2015, we now have all of our leaders across the company accountable for the total Tyco performance, not just their individual business units, embracing a one Tyco mindset, driven by top line growth, supported by a continuous operational improvement.
We've had a very productive start to 2016 with lots of progress on a number of fronts, including innovation, innovative solutions and M&A, which is summarized on Slide 3. As discussed during our recent Investor Day, we have made significant progress in our ability to enhance our service and productivity with the launch of Tyco On, our integrated data and smart services platform. Tyco On provides a set of software-enabled Internet of Things capabilities that enhance safety and security systems using open standards to connect to a wide range of intelligent devices, systems and services, enabling customers from small businesses to large multinationals to improve their operations. I am pleased to share some examples on how we are delivering differentiated solutions to help address customer needs.
First, our ExacTech solution improves efficiency through a service application already in use in our installation and services business. ExacTech allows a single technician to perform fire alarm testing, eliminating the need of a second technician to complete the procedure. By using a mobile app, the technician can test detectors throughout a building and connect remotely to the system's fire panel. In the future, this application will offer cloud-enabled storage and access to testing documentation, providing a more cost-effective solution that would appeal to a broad base of customers.
Second, we are enabling more complex, smart solutions that leverage data from varied devices and systems and apply advanced analytics to reveal insights that lead to better decisions, faster execution and transformational business outcomes for customers. For example, in over 4,000 retail locations, we are helping retailers tie together data from our RFID tags, video, electronic article surveillance and traffic centers, transforming it into actionable intelligence through our latest release of TrueVUE software. With these insights, retailers can optimize their inventory management, deliver a more pleasant shopper experience and maximize revenue.
Lastly, we continue to build our global library of system and device integrations. Our integrated solutions platform is now incorporated into our fire detection system certified for European markets and enables real-time visual verification of fire alarms, allowing immediate and appropriate response and action, providing compelling customer value.
In addition to the great progress the team has made, I am very pleased to have Daryll Fogal join our management team as our Chief Technology Officer. Daryll has global responsibility for executing our technology strategy, including the capabilities in operations needed to support the development of products, services and solutions. Daryll recently joined us after a long career at Honeywell and most recently, Eaton, where he was Chief Technology Officer and Vice President of engineering for their electrical sector. I am very excited to have Daryll join us in this critical role as we evolve into a growth and innovation company.
Turning to M&A. We continue to be very active on the M&A front. During the first quarter, we signed or completed 5 acquisitions focused on key areas of growth, including building on our services platform, expanding our presence in growth markets and growing our product portfolio, with all of them strengthening our technology platform.
Let me give you a brief summary. Within the U.K., we acquired First Choice Facilities, or FCF, which designs, installs, commissions and maintains a wide range of integrated fire and security solutions. FCF has a strong installed base with a very robust service delivery model, which strengthens our regional footprint and increases our recurring revenue. This acquisition will be reported within our Rest of World Install and Services segment.
The remaining 4 acquisitions are within our Global Products segment and span across the 3 platforms of Fire Protection, Security Products and Life Safety.
Within Fire Protection Products, we acquired Shanghai Jindun, a fire suppression products business in China, which complements our organic investments and quickly accelerates our position in a large and expanding Tier 2 market.
In Security Products, we made a majority investment in Qolsys, an IoT developer of the industry's most advanced interactive intrusion platform, supporting life safety, energy management and other functions.
In Life Safety, we acquired ISG Infrasys, a world leader in the design of thermal imaging technology with a reputation for top image quality. Coupled with our Scott brand and customer base, we can significantly leverage ISG's technology.
Additionally, within Life Safety, we signed a definitive agreement to acquire Industrial Safety Technologies, or IST, a leading player in the gas and flame detection industry. This is the largest transaction to date, post separation, and it's expected to generate annualized revenues of approximately $140 million. The addition of IST to our Life Safety product portfolio will bring our customers a full range of safety solutions across both fixed and portable detection. This acquisition is not only a natural extension of our product portfolio but significantly expands our product offerings within Life Safety, which can now provide a full breadth of products in flame, gas and open path detection. IST is a high-growth, high-profit business with leading technology. We expect to leverage our global sales force in distribution channels to pull through additional IST products.  Over time, we intend to expand IST's service footprint, which accounts for approximately 25% of its annual revenue. We expect to close the IST transaction towards the end of our second quarter.
Altogether, these 5 acquisitions total approximately $470 million in purchase price, with annualized revenues of $240 million.
Subsequent to the quarter end, we signed 3 additional small bolt-ons for a total purchase price of $45 million, including a service business in North America, a leader in wireless fire detection technology and a provider of integrated RFID solutions. Together, these 3 acquisitions are expected to generate annualized revenue of approximately $25 million.
For fiscal 2015, we expect these 8 acquisitions to add an incremental $175 million to revenue and $0.03 to EPS, excluding the onetime impact of inventory step-ups, primarily related to the IST acquisition, which will be reported as a special item. We still have several nice opportunities in our M&A pipeline, which we will continue to work on during the year. These acquisitions, along with the internal investments we continue to make in technology, accelerate our strategic priorities with a focus on technology platforms that form the foundation of new innovative solutions, which our direct channel can utilize to solve the problems of our customers.
Before we get into the details of the first quarter, I thought I would provide an update on what we are seeing in the significant geographies that impact our performance around the world.
Starting with North America. We are continuing to see acceleration in order activity in our earlier-cycle fire business. We are also seeing a nice pick up in orders in security, with the first quarter of fiscal 2015 marking the highest install order quarter since separation. It is important to recognize that since separation, our North America security business has undergone a significant transformation in strategy and execution. Given recent order activity in both fire and security, we expect our North America install and service business to be a larger contributor to growth in the second half of this year.
Turning to Europe. We continue to expect a sluggish environment, which continues to bounce along the bottom. Additionally, the added headwind related to the strengthening U.S. dollar is and will continue to put pressure on our businesses. Given our significant restructuring actions over the years as well as our sourcing and productivity initiatives, we feel well-positioned to continue to expand margins in a relatively low-growth environment.
In Australia, we started to see some larger orders come through at the end of our fiscal year, which made us feel somewhat optimistic that we had hit the bottom and would start to see a bit of stabilization. However, the last few months have proven to be more challenging, and we are now expecting a mid-single-digit decline in organic revenue for the year, with significant pressure on service revenue. Our team continues to stay close to the market and take actions required to maintain the fundamentals of the business despite the downturn. But in the meantime, this will have an impact on our Rest of World Install and Services results.
Turning to our growth markets. We continue to expect double-digit growth in 2015. What is critical in driving this performance is taking the success that we've had in our mature markets, including our depth and expertise, and localizing it so that we can deploy our products and services successfully within these markets. Our organic investments are enhanced by our M&A activity, which helps accelerate our ability to develop a local footprint. A perfect example of this is the acquisition we completed this quarter in China, which I spoke to earlier.
Now let me give you a quick overview of our results for the quarter, and Arun will focus on our results for each of our segments. Overall, I am pleased with our start to fiscal 2015. As I mentioned on our fourth quarter earnings call, the first quarter of fiscal 2014 was a very strong quarter for us, driven by a stronger-than-normal retail season with a favorable mix. Organic growth of 2% was led by a phenomenal growth quarter in our product businesses, which grew 10% organically. Segment operating margin expansion of 30 basis points was slightly ahead of our expectations for the quarter even after offsetting a 20 basis point headwind related to a labor matter. Earnings per share before special items of $0.49 was at the high end of our guidance and represents a 17% increase year-over-year. Overall, a solid start to the year.
Now let me turn it over to Arun to go through the details of our performance."

You can follow my comments on our financial performance, starting with Slide 5.Let me start with an overview of our results for the first quarter. Revenue of $2.48 billion declined 1% year-over-year. As Geo",1096,"Thank you, George, and good morning, everyone. You can follow my comments on our financial performance, starting with Slide 5.
Let me start with an overview of our results for the first quarter. Revenue of $2.48 billion declined 1% year-over-year. As George mentioned, organic revenue grew 2%, led by 10% growth in Global Products. Within our Installation & Service businesses, Service revenue resumed growth in both North America and Rest of World, for total organic service growth of 1%. Installation revenue was relatively flat year-over-year. Acquisition growth of 1% was more than offset by a 4% headwind related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
Before special items, segment operating income was $326 million, including an $11 million headwind related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and the operating margin was 13.2%. Higher product revenues and the benefits from sourcing, productivity and restructuring initiatives were partially offset by a legal charge, resulting in net operating margin expansion of 30 basis points.
Earnings per share before special items increased $0.07 or 17% year-over-year. Operationally, we delivered an incremental $0.04 of earnings, driven by strong revenue growth in products, along with continued productivity initiatives. The remaining $0.03 of incremental earnings was primarily driven by the benefit of share repurchases during the quarter, offset by $0.02 related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and the $0.01 legal charge.
Turning to orders on Slide 6. As I've often mentioned in previous quarterly calls, it is important to keep in mind that order growth, particularly in our installation business, is lumpy and can be impacted by the timing of large projects. Orders in the quarter grew 2% year-over-year, with 6% growth in North America and 7% growth in products. Rest of World declined 5% due to pressure in Australia as well as a tough compare with the prior year.
Backlog of $4.8 billion increased 3% year-over-year and 2% on a quarter sequential basis.
Now let's get into the details of each of the segments. Starting first with North America Installation & Services on Slide 7. Revenue in the quarter of $951 million decreased 1% on a reported basis, driven by the weakening of the Canadian dollar. Organic growth was relatively muted in the first quarter, as 1% growth in service was offset by a 1% decline in installation revenue. We expect organic growth to increase in the second quarter and accelerate from there in the second half of the year. Before special items, operating income in the quarter was $131 million, and the operating margin was 13.8%. Operating income included an incremental charge related to a labor wage claim, which impacted the operating margin by 60 basis points. Despite unfavorable mix and the incremental legal charge, the operating margin improved 30 basis points year-over-year as the impact of these items was more than offset by productivity and restructuring benefits. Overall, orders grew 6% year-over-year in North America Installation & Services, with installation growth of 13%, driven by a few large orders in security and service growth of 1%. Total backlog of $2.5 billion grew 5% compared with the prior year and increased 1% on a quarter sequential basis.
Turning to Slide 8. Rest of World Installation & Services revenue of $917 million decreased 6% year-over-year, driven by a 7% unfavorable impact related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Organic growth was relatively flat, with modest growth in both service and installation revenue. Acquisitions contributed 2% revenue growth, which was partially offset by the impact of divestitures. Before special items, operating income was $90 million, and the operating margin decreased 80 basis points to 9.8%. The benefits of productivity and restructuring initiatives were more than offset by the mix of businesses contributing to growth, a lower percentage of high-margin service revenue as well as the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates.
Turning to order activity in Rest of World. Total orders declined 5% year-over-year. Service orders increased 3%, and installation orders declined 12% compared to 16% install order growth in the prior year. Backlog of $2.1 billion increased 2%, both on a year-over-year and quarter sequential basis.
Turning to Global Products on Slide 9. Revenue grew 8% in the quarter to $611 million. Organic revenue growth of 10% was driven by strong growth across all 3 platforms, led by Security Products and Life Safety. A 1% benefit to revenue from acquisitions was more than offset by a 3% decrease to revenue related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Before special items, operating income was $105 million, and the operating margin was 17.2%. The 130 basis point expansion in operating margin was driven by increased revenues, favorable mix as well as the benefit of productivity and restructuring initiatives. Product orders increased 7% year-over-year.
Now let me touch on a few other items on Slide 10. First, corporate expense before special items was $55 million for the quarter. We expect corporate expense in the second quarter to be on a similar level. Next, our effective tax rate before the impact of special items was 17.5% for the quarter. We expect the effective tax rate for the second quarter to be in the range of 17% to 18%. As it relates to share count, we repurchased 10 million shares for $417 million during the first quarter, resulting in a weighted average and quarter-end diluted share count of 427 million shares.
Turning to foreign exchange on Slide 11. The U.S. dollar has continued to appreciate over the last several months, putting additional pressure on both the top and bottom line. From our November earnings call to now, changes in foreign currency exchange rates have put an additional $0.09 of pressure on earnings per share on top of the $0.07 of pressure we previously forecasted. Our 2015 guidance now includes a $585 million headwind to revenue, which equates to a $0.16 headwind to EPS related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
Lastly, I would like to touch on the progress we have made on our restructuring and repositioning plans for this year. To date, we have taken restructuring and repositioning actions, resulting in $75 million of charges, and we now expect to be closer to the $150 million estimate we have provided for the year. As these actions are largely related to workforce reductions, the benefits of these actions will be reflected in our results in the second half of this year. We continue to have a strong pipeline of projects that are being executed to simplify our structure and improve operations.
Now let me turn things back over to George."

Let's turn now to Slide 12 for our earnings guidance for the second quarter, starting with the top line. As we move into the second quarter, we expect organic growth to accelerate from the 2% we saw this quarter to approximately 3%. Addition",568,"Thanks, Arun. Let's turn now to Slide 12 for our earnings guidance for the second quarter, starting with the top line. As we move into the second quarter, we expect organic growth to accelerate from the 2% we saw this quarter to approximately 3%. Additionally, recent acquisition activity is expected to add an additional 1 point of revenue growth. Given current exchange rates, we expect growth in revenue to be offset by a 6 percentage point or $150 million year-over-year headwind related to changes in foreign currency. Taking these factors into account, we expect revenue in the second quarter to decline approximately 2% year-over-year on a reported basis.
I also want to remind you that in the second quarter of last year included a $21 million insurance recovery, which was reported within our Rest of World Install & Services segment.
If you refer to Slide 13, you can see that the insurance recovery benefited the Rest of World operating margin by 220 basis points and benefited total segment margin by 90 basis points. Additionally, this recovery contributed $0.04 of earnings per share.
Looking at the second quarter of fiscal 2015, on a normalized basis, we expect the segment operating margin before special items to expand 50 basis points to approximately 13.5%.
Turning to Slide 14. We expect operations in the second quarter to contribute approximately $0.05 of incremental earnings year-over-year. Additionally, our expected weighted average share count of 428 million shares in the second quarter is also expected to contribute an additional $0.05 of incremental earnings. This earnings growth is expected to be partially offset by the $0.04 benefit in the prior year related to the insurance recovery and a $0.03 headwind related to foreign currency exchange rates.
Taking all of these assumptions into account, we expect earnings per share before special items in the second quarter to be in the range of $0.48 to $0.50, a 4% to 9% increase over the prior year. Compared to a normalized earnings per share of $0.42 in the prior year, this represents a 14% to 19% increase in earnings per share before special items.
Moving to our expectations for the full year on Slide 15. We continue to expect organic revenue growth of approximately 4%. However, adjusting for current exchange rates and including recent acquisitions, we now expect revenue for the full year to be similar to last year on a reported basis. Additionally, we continue to expect segment operating margin before special items to expand 80 to 110 basis points, excluding the impact of recent acquisitions.
While we continued to deliver a strong operating performance, the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar is putting additional pressure on our results. Our initial earnings per share before special items guidance for the full year of $2.35 to $2.45 had fully absorbed the expected $0.07 headwind related to changes in foreign currency with accelerated productivity and restructuring actions. Current exchange rates have resulted in an incremental $0.09 of foreign currency headwinds, which we are able to partially offset with an expected $0.04 benefit from recent acquisitions and additional productivity. As a result, we are updating our full year earnings per share before special items guidance to be in the range of $2.30 to $2.40, which represents a 16% to 21% increase year-over-year.

And so we've been accelerating our restructuring, accelerating some of the productivity initiatives that has given us some benefit in the second half of the year. Arun talked about it in his prepared remarks that we accelerated some of the planned restructuring in the first quarter, and we're going to see some benefits from that. We also have been executing very well on our growth strategy, continuing to execute not only organic growth but also working on the acquisitions. And the benefits now from the acquisitions that we've been able to complete, we now see $0.03 of benefit in the second half of the year. And so we're going to continue to work. As we laid out our plan, we get about $150 million of productivity on an annualized basis that supports the significant reinvestment and growth, while we're continuing to expand our margins 80 to 100 basis points. And I can assure you that we're continuing to work every opportunity to make sure that we'll be positioned to deliver on the guidance -- the updated guidance that we provided."

So there is a natural hedge in place there.",413,"Deane, let me just start by saying that 75% of our business is install and service, where our cost structure and -- the currency of our cost structure is the same as the currency in which we derive our revenues. So there is a natural hedge in place there. We don't need -- there is no exposure from a currency perspective. The Global Products, as you rightly pointed out, is where we manufacture in a few locations and ship our products around the world in different currencies, and that's where we have the transactional exposure. And we do hedge that transactional exposure pretty close to 100% across the world in all the currencies. So we have no -- a de minimis P&L impact from that transactional exposure on our Global Products businesses. Now there is -- the headwinds that you are seeing relate to translational exposure, as we translate the earnings that we have in different currencies into the U.S. dollar for reporting purposes. That translation exposure we do not hedge, as -- if you were to do that, it would actually create an economic risk to the enterprise. Now one benefit that we have, keep in mind, is our Irish domicile. As an Irish domicile company, we have complete access to our cash across the world on a daily basis, unlike a U.S. domicile company, which would have to dividend the cash back. So we do not have to worry about the repatriation of cash, which U.S. domicile companies have to. Now also, just to kind of keep on the subject of FX hedging and the exposure, there are obviously other operational things that we take into account as we look at the exposure, the translational exposure. Basically, I look at 3 things. One is pricing. And particularly in the high-inflation countries, we make sure that our pricing stays ahead of the inflation rate so that the fundamentals of the business remain intact. The second is our supply chain network. We have a very sophisticated supply chain network, led by a big leader in Andrea Greco. And he is constantly optimizing that supply chain to make sure that we are getting the benefits of the currency movements. And the third, that George had referred to earlier, is the cost rationalization. Clearly, that's another lever. You saw us pull that lever pretty strongly in the first quarter ahead of the $0.07 headwind that we had initially expected, and that lever stays in place."

As we think about our Rest of World business, basically, Europe, which is about 50% of Rest of World, is, like George mentioned in his prepared remarks, pretty stable. And the fundamentals of the business, the margins are expanding in a very low-growth environment. Australia is where we are seeing deterioration, and a large part of what you see here is really driven by Australia. And the second piece is our growth markets, which is where the growth is coming from. So growth markets are delivering the growth that we expected. But as you know, our growth markets -- the service component in our growth markets is lower than the install component. And therefore, the margins in the growth markets tend to be lower.

And what we do is make sure that we stay focused on how we create value in getting the return for the value that we create.

Now with the enterprise software that we're deploying, the capability that we're creating, we're now -- our new release with our store performance solutions software is going to enable our TrueVUE suite to operate on mobile devices with our customers -- at the retail customers. And this will now enable them to improve productivity of their store personnel with that type of solution. So it's the enablement of that, that is creating additional service, and then with that, additional productivity for the customers that we serve. Another good example is ExacTech, which we talked about. Not only does it enable us to be able to be much more efficient with how we perform the service, but the capabilities that we create with the data that we extract, and then the analytics that we apply to that data gives us a new service that we can offer to our customers to be able to grow the top line. So -- and then on the integrated solutions, when you look at fire and security equipment that's deployed across any one of our customer base, the ability to be able to integrate that in an efficient manner, collecting data and then being able to, again, apply analytics, that it gives us additional services to offer is what enables that. So it's not a standalone product that you would see revenue on, but it's supporting our ability to be able to accelerate the deployment of our technology and then build new services on that technology that will accelerate our growth. And that is why when you look at our growth -- when we project growth in service, we're in the early stages of deploying this technology, but the capability that it creates for us to be able to build new services is pretty significant longer term."

If you look at the investments we're making, so when you look at the R&D increase year-on-year, it's up about 10% or it's roughly $35 million, $40 million. There's a high mix of that investment that's building capability so that when we install a system, we're going to be much better positioned to be able to create services on top of that system with the enterprise software. And so we don't get the traction. There's not an immediate pickup in short term. But longer term, with the systems that are being deployed, it gives us a much better base to be able to solve customer problems, to create value in solving those problems, and then we ultimately get paid through service.

With me today are Tyco's Chief Executive Officer, George Oliver; and our Chief Financial Officer, Arun Nayer.
I would like to remind you that during the course of today's call, we will be providing certain forward-looking information. We ask that you look at today's press release and read through the forward-looking cautionary informational statements that we've included there.
In addition, we will use certain non-GAAP measures in our discussions, and we ask that you look through the sections of our press release that address the use of these items. The press release issued this morning and all related tables as well as the conference call slides, which George and Arun will refer to, can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at tyco.com. Please also note that we will be filing our quarterly SEC Form 10-Q later today.
During the quarter, the company committed to a plan to sell Security monitoring business in China, which was previously reported within the Rest of World Installation & Services operating segment. This business generated $8 million of revenue in fiscal 2014 with an operating loss of $3 million. Current and historical results related to this business are now classified as discontinued operations. Re-casted financial information for the quarters of fiscal year 2014, as well as the fiscal first quarter of 2015, is available on the Investor Relations portion of our website.
Additionally, during the second quarter, the company committed to a plan to sell its majority interest in a fire installation joint venture in China. This business is classified as held for sale on the balance sheet as of quarter end, and the company expects to complete the sale of this business in April. Annualized sales related to this business are approximately $130 million.
In discussing our segment operations, when we refer to changes in backlog and order activity, these figures exclude the impact of foreign currency and divestitures. Additionally, references to operating margins during the call exclude special items, and this metric is a non-GAAP measure and is reconciled in the schedules attached to our press release.
Now, let me quickly recap this quarter's results. Revenue in the quarter of $2.43 billion declined 2% year-over-year on a reported basis. Organic revenue growth of 2% and a 2% benefit from acquisition were more than offset by a 6% negative impact related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Tyco ordinary shareholders was $0.43 and included net charges of $0.12 related to special items. These special items related primarily to an expected loss on the divestiture of our majority interest in a joint venture as well as restructuring and repositioning charges. Earnings per share from continuing operations before special items was $0.55 compared to our guidance of $0.48 to $0.50. Operationally, we were at the high end of our guidance range, with the remaining $0.05 of earnings attributable to lower corporate expense and a lower tax rate.
Now, let me turn the call over to George."

I am pleased with our operational performance in the second quarter as we continued to deliver strong profitability.

I am pleased with our operational performance in the second quarter as we continued to deliver strong profitability. As you can see on Slide 3, we delivered $0.05 of incremental earnings from operations year-over-year. This, coupled with a $0.05 contribution from share repurchases, drove a strong 17% increase in earnings per share before special items for the second quarter.
Before I touch on the progress our teams are making on our strategic initiatives, I want to start with 2 big themes I know everyone is focused on, the impact of the strengthening U.S. dollar and the impact of lower oil prices on the oil and gas industry and the associated effects on other end markets.
Starting with the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on Slide 4. The U.S. dollar has continued to strengthen against most of our significant currencies during the quarter. And this trend has continued in the month of April. The most significant drop has been in the euro, which decreased to a recent low of 1.05 and is currently trading a bit higher. The significant swings in currency during the second quarter and through April are adding an additional $0.02 of pressure to our earnings this year, bringing the full year impact of foreign currency translation to an $0.18 headwind on a year-over-year basis.
Moving to the oil and gas sector on Slide 5. Starting in March and continuing in the month of April, we have seen incremental weakness in our oil and gas end market. As I have mentioned before, our direct exposure to this vertical is about 5% of total revenue, which is across the installation service businesses and within our Global Products segment, with the largest exposure within our U.K. install and services business and our Fire Protection Products business. Based on what we have seen over the last 6 weeks or so, we are now expecting a 15% decline in the revenue tied to this vertical. It's important to keep in mind that a majority of our revenue in the oil and gas space is high-margin service revenue as well as special hazard product sales, which tend to carry a higher-than-average margin. We expect the recent softness we are seeing in the oil and gas vertical to be an incremental headwind of about $0.06 to our previous full year guidance.
Now let me get into a little more detail as to what we are seeing in the macro economic environment across the various parts of the globe on Slide 6. Starting with North America, nonresidential construction in the U.S. continues to be better year-over-year. We continue to see good order activity, particularly in the retail and healthcare verticals, with softness in oil and gas. As activity in the Canadian market is very much tied to the petrochemical oil and gas industry, we have seen a broad-based slowdown, particularly in Western Canada. CapEx spending has come more in focus due to the decline in oil prices, which is resulting in some project activity being shifted to the right and delays in new order activity being awarded. Overall, our North America install and service business is continuing to show nice improvement. We saw an increase in organic growth as the Security business has turned the corner and is now accelerating growth for the first time since separation. We are also seeing very good traction in our Global Products business in North America across Fire, Security and Life Safety. Overall, we grew 5% organically in North America.
Turning to Europe. Our team continues to execute well and gained share despite the increased pressure from foreign currency exchange rates. The European market shows demand for integrated solutions, which we expect will help to drive our service growth in the region in the future and also contribute to margin expansion. We are seeing nice activity in the general commercial and retail space, the service industry as well as manufacturing, while oil and gas and heavy industrial end markets are noticeably softer, consistent with global trends.
In the U.K., we have direct oil and gas exposure related to the North Sea offshore oil rigs where we primarily earned service revenue on the maintenance of the Fire safety systems. The impact of lower oil prices has caused a considerable slowdown in nonessential maintenance, resulting in delays of service-related activities. While we do expect some improvement in this vertical later this year due to pent-up demand for the required maintenance of customer sites, this has and will continue to put pressure on the top line results.
For Europe, overall, our current view is that it will be relatively flat to modestly down for the year compared to our previous expectation of modest growth. Despite the top line pressure, margin expansion has been strong in Europe, as sourcing and productivity initiatives, combined with restructuring actions, are helping to mitigate the lower volume.
In Australia, we are seeing a bit of growth in the general commercial space. However, this is being more than offset by the downturn in the industrial and mining sectors. Very similar to last quarter, organic revenue is decreasing in the mid-single-digit range driven by a decline in service. We expect these conditions to continue during the second half of the year, in line with our previous expectations.
In the growth markets, we are seeing a slowdown in installation projects related to oil and gas, particularly in Asia. However, we expect a mid- to upper single digit growth for the full year, given the strong level of bidding activity in Asia, Latin America and our other growth markets in verticals such as general commercial, retail and industrial.
Moving on to our strategic initiatives, I am impressed with the progress our teams are making internally to drive revenue growth, both organically and inorganically, as well as executing on our productivity initiatives.
Starting with the top line, excluding the impact of foreign currency, revenue grew 4% year-over-year. Although overall organic growth continues to remain in the low single digits, we are beginning to see some green shoots that indicate growth will accelerate over the longer term. For example, installation growth in North America accelerated to 3% organically. And as I previously mentioned, the Commercial Security business is contributing nicely to growth for the first time since separation. The teams have done a great job converting the backlog of strong orders that we received over the last few quarters to revenue. I have confidence that the growth in our installed base, along with strengthening our service capabilities across the globe, will allow us to build our service revenue over time.
In terms of M&A, we closed all of the acquisitions discussed in our January earnings call, including Industrial Safety Technologies, or IST, our largest acquisition post separation, which closed at the end of February. Our teams are diligently working to ensure the integration of these businesses occur seamlessly and within the expected time frames.
All together, these acquisitions totaled about $500 million in purchase price, with annualized revenues of approximately $275 million. We are currently working on a rich pipeline of potential opportunities. In the aggregate, the purchase price ranges from $200 million to $500 million. These deals are centered around increasing our service mix and executing on our technology strategy. They are core to our business, and it will help drive service growth in the future.
Lastly, we are seeing productivity and cost savings being generated by bringing the Fire & Security businesses together. We are driving sourcing and productivity initiatives, simplifying our global footprint and transforming our functions. We expect that these actions will generate gross savings in excess of $150 million this year, which after offsetting annual inflation we incur related to our labor force and incremental investments in R&D and sales and marketing, we expect to net $60 million to $70 million to the bottom line. And I'd say that these initiatives will continue far beyond 201. We're in the early stages of these efforts, and we expect they will continue to support our margin expansion in the years to come. It is important to keep in mind that we had planned for incremental investments in R&D and sales and marketing of $50 million this year. We fully expect to make these investments despite the tougher macroenvironment as they are core to delivering on our long-term growth strategy.
Overall, the investments we are making to expand our capabilities in technology, along with our efforts to further streamline our operations, position us well to deliver strong double-digit earnings growth this year. And I feel even better today about the execution of our growth strategy and delivering on the commitments we made at our November Investor Day.
Now let me turn it over to Arun to go through the details of our performance."
107534,289399098,794099,"Tyco International Ltd., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2015",2015-04-24,"Earnings Calls","Tyco International plc","Executives","Thank you, George, and good morning, everyone. You can follow my comments on our financial performance starting with Slide 8. Let me start with an overview of our results for the second quarter. Revenue of $2.43 billion declined 2% year-over-year on a rep",1244,"Thank you, George, and good morning, everyone. You can follow my comments on our financial performance starting with Slide 8. Let me start with an overview of our results for the second quarter. Revenue of $2.43 billion declined 2% year-over-year on a reported basis, including a 6% headwind related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Excluding FX, revenue grew 4% in the quarter, with a combination of 2% organic growth and 2% acquisition growth. Excluding FX, service was up 2%, installation grew 5% and Global Products was up 11%. Organic growth of 2% was a bit below our expectation of 3% due to, as George discussed, the softness in the macroenvironment.
Before special items, segment operating income was $331 million, which includes a $17 million headwind from FX and the segment operating margin was 13.6%. Normalizing for last year's insurance recovery of $21 million, segment operating margin expansion was 50 basis points and resulted from higher revenues, improved execution and the benefits from restructuring and productivity initiatives.
Earnings per share before special items increased $0.08 or 17% year-over-year. Operationally, we delivered an incremental $0.05 of earnings, driven by revenue growth in Global Products and North America install and services, along with continued productivity initiatives. A lower share count provided an additional $0.05 benefit, which was partially offset by a $0.03 headwind related to foreign currency translation. The remaining $0.01 benefit resulted from the net impact of lower corporate expense and below-the-line items, offset by the insurance recovery received in the prior year.
Turning to orders on Slide 9. As I've often mentioned in previous quarterly calls, it is important to keep in mind that order growth, particularly in our installation business, is lumpy and can be impacted by the timing of large projects. Orders in the quarter increased 1% year-over-year, with 9% growth in products, 2% growth in service and a decline of 6% in installation, driven by a significant amount of large installation orders in the prior year and softness within the oil and gas vertical. Backlog of $4.7 billion was relatively flat on both a year-over-year and a quarter sequential basis.
Now let's get into the details of each of the segments, starting first with North America Installation & Services on Slide 10. Revenue in the quarter of $944 million increased 1% on a reported basis. Organic growth increased to 2%, with 3% growth in installation. Service revenue was relatively flat due to adverse weather conditions in the quarter as well as some softness in our Canadian business related to oil and gas. FX negatively impacted revenue growth by 1 percentage point.
Before special items, operating income in the quarter was $125 million and the operating margin was 13.2%. The operating margin improved 70 basis points year-over-year driven by improved execution and the benefits of productivity and restructuring initiatives. Overall, orders decreased 2% year-over-year in North America install and services. Service orders remained relatively flat, while installation orders declined 5%. Underlying mid-single-digit install order growth was more than offset by a $30 million Fire order in the prior year, as well as a decline in the oil and gas vertical. Current backlog of $2.5 billion grew 3% compared with the prior year and was relatively flat on a quarter sequential basis.
Turning to Slide 11. Rest of World Installation & Services revenue of $847 million decreased 10% year-over-year, driven by an 11% unfavorable impact related to FX. Organic growth was relatively flat, with 1% growth in service revenue offset by a decline of 1% in installation revenue. Acquisitions contributed 1% to revenue growth. Before special items, operating income was $90 million, which included a $10 million FX headwind. Normalizing for the $21 million insurance recovery booked in Q2 2014, the segment operating margin was flat at 10.6% as the benefit of productivity and restructuring initiatives was offset by the mix of geographies contributing to growth.
Turning to order activity in Rest of World. Total orders declined 2% year-over-year. Service orders increased 3% and installation orders declined 7%, driven by the timing of large orders in the prior year as well as weakness in the oil and gas vertical. Backlog of $2 billion decreased 2% on a year-over-year basis and decreased 1% on a quarter sequential basis.
Turning to Global Products on Slide 12. Revenue grew 6% in the quarter to $639 million. Organic revenue growth of 7% was driven by strong growth in the Life Safety and Security Products businesses, which was partially offset by softness in Fire Protection Products related to sales in the oil and gas sector. Organic growth, including a 3 percentage point benefit from increased shipments of Air-Paks compared to the prior year, a 4% benefit to revenue from acquisitions was more than offset by a 6% decrease to revenue related to FX. Before special items, operating income was $116 million and included a $6 million FX headwind. The operating margin increased 20 basis points to 18.2% on a reported basis. Increased revenue and productivity benefits drove 120 basis points of margin expansion, which was partially offset by 70 basis points related to incremental investments in R&D and 30 basis points related to noncash purchase accounting. Product orders increased 9% year-over-year.
Now let me touch on a few other items on Slide 13. First, corporate expense before special items was $51 million for the quarter. We expect corporate expense in the third quarter to increase to $55 million in line with our normal increase in the second half of the year. Given the favorability in corporate expense year-to-date, we now expect corporate expense for the full year to be approximately $220 million versus our previous expectation of $225 million.
During the quarter, we raised EUR 500 million debt with a maturity of 10 years and a coupon of 1.375%. This will result in incremental interest expense of approximately $4 million in the second half of the year.
Moving to tax. Our effective tax rate before the impact of special items was 11.5% for the quarter. The lower-than-projected tax rate was due to a onetime benefit related to the realization of certain non-U.S. deferred tax assets as a result of restructuring activities in Europe. We expect the effective tax rate for the third and fourth quarter to be approximately 18% and the full year tax rate to be approximately 16.5%.
We ended the quarter with a weighted average diluted share count of 427 million shares and an exit rate of 428 million shares. For the fiscal third quarter and full year, we expect a weighted average diluted share count of 428 million shares.
Finally, I would like to give an update on our restructuring and repositioning activities and the funding of our asbestos liabilities. To date, we have taken restructuring and repositioning actions, resulting in approximately $100 million of charges. Given the macro uncertainties and FX pressures we are facing this year, we continue to identify additional projects that will help to further streamline our structure and improve operations this year and beyond. As a result, we continue to expect restructuring and repositioning actions to be closer to $150 million, which is at the high end of the range we provided in November.
Regarding our legacy asbestos liabilities, we funded the expected $275 million for [indiscernible] during the second quarter. We have received bankruptcy court approval and expect to fund the $325 million for Yarway in the third quarter.
Now let me turn things back over to George."
107534,289399098,794099,"Tyco International Ltd., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2015",2015-04-24,"Earnings Calls","Tyco International plc","Executives","Thanks, Arun. Let's turn now to Slide 14 for our earnings guidance for the third quarter, starting with the top line.As we move into the third quarter, we expect organic revenue growth in the 1% to 2% range against a difficult compare in the prior year.",603,"Thanks, Arun. Let's turn now to Slide 14 for our earnings guidance for the third quarter, starting with the top line.
As we move into the third quarter, we expect organic revenue growth in the 1% to 2% range against a difficult compare in the prior year. As you may recall, the backlog buildup in our Life Safety business in 2014 was related to Air-Paks, which were all shipped during our fiscal third quarter. This resulted in 12% organic growth in Global Products in the third quarter of last year, of which 5 percentage points was attributable to conversion of the built-up the backlog of Air-Paks. The impact of this on Tyco's overall organic growth last year was a full percentage point. Against that backdrop, we expect Global Products to be relatively flat organically in the third quarter, with North America I&S growing in the 2% to 3% range and Rest of World I&S being flat to up 1% organically. Acquisitions will offset divestitures and deliver about a 1.5 points to overall revenue growth. Given current exchange rates, we expect growth in revenue to be offset by an 8 percentage point or $205 million year-over-year headwind related to FX. Taking all of these factors into account, we expect revenue in the third quarter to decline approximately 5% year-over-year on a reported basis.
We expect the segment operating margin before special items to be relatively flat on a reported basis due to a 30 basis point lift in the prior year margin due to the timing of Air-Paks shipments, as well as the absorption of 30 basis points of noncash purchase accounting. Adjusting for these items, underlying operations are expected to improve approximately 60 basis points year-over-year. Taking all of these assumptions into account, we expect earnings per share before special items in the third quarter to be in the range of $0.55 to the $0.57.
As you can see on Slide 15, year-over-year, we expect underlying operations in the third quarter to contribute about $0.05, which is partially offset by the $0.02 shift in earnings in the prior year related to the Air-Paks. The $0.05 benefit from the reduced share count is expected to be more than offset by a $0.06 headwind related to FX.
Moving to our expectations for the full year on Slide 16. We expect organic revenue growth in the 2% to 3% range. Acquisitions will offset divestitures and add an additional point of revenue growth. We expect $645 million or a 6% headwind related to FX. Overall, we expect revenue will decline approximately 3% on a reported basis.
We expect the segment operating margin before special items to expand approximately 50 basis points on a reported basis after absorbing a 20 basis point headwind from noncash amortization related to the recent acquisitions.
Taking all of this into account, as well as the guidance for corporate expense and below-the-line items Arun provided, we are updating our full year earnings per share before special items guidance from a range of $2.30 to $2.40 to a range of $2.23 to $2.27. As you can been see on Slide 17, our prior guidance is being adjusted for softness in the macroenvironment driven by oil and gas, additional pressure from FX and the net impact related to the divestiture of a joint venture and below-the-line items. Our revised guidance of $2.23 to $2.27 represents a year-over-year increase of 12% to 14% compared to the prior year earnings per share before special items of $2.

So looking at the second quarter, service growth, it was 2% x FX. Now acquisitions are helping to offset some of the double-digit declines that we're seeing in Australia, as well as now more recently in the U.K. in the oil and gas vertical. And when we forecast the total year, we're still going to be positioned to deliver 2% for the total year. Now longer-term, we've been working and focusing on technology in commercial investments that are going to significantly change the profile of how we drive service growth going forward. So we've had lots of projects being brought to market. It's going to enhance the capabilities that we have, it's going to embed new technologies, and that's going to create the platform to be able to bring new services, create new value for the customers that we support and ultimately, project our service growth to support the Three-Year Plan that we outlined back in November. Now relative to the margins in Rest of World, what I would say is I would start by saying, the external macros have been extremely difficult, but the fundamentals of how we're driving the businesses are extremely strong, very strong operational performance. We're offsetting FX headwinds of $10 million. We're offsetting mix -- a significant mix with the decline in services in the U.K. and Australia, and that equates to about 80 basis points year-on-year. And at the same time, we're investing in our growth markets, which we believe are absolutely critical to be able to build the business and deliver growth to support the Three-Year Plan that we outlined back in November. This all now has when you normalize it, without the $21 million of insurance recovery that we got last year, will deliver relatively flat margin year-on-year. But what's built in that overall margin is significant productivity offsetting a tremendous amount of headwind."

And for the year, I think it was just modest decline for the total year in our original forecast. What we've seen here in March and it has continued in April, we've seen a pretty significant drop-off. And now based on what we're seeing, we're projecting that we're going to see about a 15% decline for the total year in the oil and gas vertical. So it is a significant drop-off. It's being driven by our Fire Protection Products business where we provide special hazard solutions, both upstream and downstream, as well as our U.K. and Canada, mainly Western Canada business, where we do significant installations as well as we have strong service businesses that are going to decline about -- just about double-digit. And so the combination of that has got a pretty significant drop in the second half, which positions us to see about a 15% decline for the total year."

There was a slight dip in January and February, but it's back up in March. We've seen continuing positive activity in the U.S. with the exception of oil and gas. When we look at the overall North America market, if you segment the large order that Arun talked about that we had last year in Canada, the $30 million order, and you segment out the oil and gas decline that we felt pretty significantly in Western Canada, our U.S. order rate continued to be very strong, kind of mid-single digits, which is in line with what we've seen over the last 3 quarters. And so maybe we tempered our position because of the impact that we've had in total North America driven by Canada, but that hasn't changed our view relative to how we are positioning in the U.S. to be able to capitalize on the nonresi recovery."

The Air-Pak, the new product that has received extremely well received in the market by our customers, we're seeing a nice pickup there, as well as we're going to be going through a replacement cycle, because all of the Air-Paks that were putting into the market post 9/11 are now needing to be replaced, and so the opportunity that we have there has been significant. We've positioned our business well with the technology and the new products we brought into market and we are capitalizing on that. So that's helping our Life Safety business. The acquisition we did in IST, which is the gas detection business, now that's part of a portfolio. We're immediately beginning to see some synergies on our core business and how we leverage that with expanded distribution as well as now working on the cost synergies. So that would be what's driving Life Safety. When you go into Security Products, we are the market leader in whether it be intrusion, access technologies and a player within the video space. There's a lot of new markets that's being opened up that we're providing product to with our sensors and devices that are going into the home, that are going into the new solutions. We've been investing pretty significantly within this space, and we're beginning to see the traction now in the orders and we see that continuing, that order growth continuing, with our ability to be able to drive strong, in spite of our FPP, the Fire Protection Products softness that we're seeing in oil and gas, continue to deliver very strong mid-single-digit organic growth and then combined with the acquisitions we've made, very nice total growth within our product business businesses this year and beyond."

We were seeing nice performance in the U.K. prior to this downturn in oil and gas. So the rest of the year is going to be a little bit tough. But if you go to Continental Europe, in spite of the what the economy has been doing there, we've been seeing nice growth there. It's been 2, 3, we are projecting maybe even more on service growth within our Continental Europe business. So we're seeing nice pickup. And a lot of that has been the deployment of our technology strategy, embedding technology in the installations that we are performing. And then with that, that's enabling us to be able to get the recurring revenue and the services with those installations. In the growth markets, where we're seeing a nice pickup is in Latin America. We're seeing this across some of the businesses there. We've been putting additional resources in. We've been deploying new technologies and we're starting to see nice pickup with the service performance there. That would be what's driving the overall growth market service revenue."

With me today are Tyco's Chief Executive Officer, George Oliver; and our Chief Financial Officer, Arun Nayar.
I would like to remind you that during the course of today's call, we will be providing certain forward-looking information. We ask that you look at today's press release and read through the forward-looking cautionary informational statements that we've included there.
In addition, we will use certain non-GAAP measures in our discussions, and we ask that you look through the sections of our press release that address the use of these items. The press release issued this morning and all related tables as well as the conference call slides, which George and Arun will refer to, can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at tyco.com. Please also note that we will be filing our quarterly SEC Form 10-Q later today.
During the quarter, the company committed to a plan to sell security monitoring business in China, which was previously reported within the Rest of World Installation & Services operating segment. This business generated $8 million of revenue in fiscal 2014, with an operating loss of $3 million. Current and historical results related to this business are now classified as discontinued operations. Re-casted financial information for the quarters of fiscal year 2014 as well as the fiscal first quarter of 2015 is available on the Investor Relations portion of our website.
Additionally, during the second quarter, the company committed to a plan to sell its majority interest in a fire installation joint venture in China. This business is classified as held for sale on the balance sheet as of quarter end, and the company expects to complete the sale of this business in April. Annualized sales related to this business are approximately $130 million.
In discussing our segment operations, when we refer to changes in backlog and order activity, these figures exclude the impact of foreign currency and divestitures. Additionally, references to operating margins during the call exclude special items, and this metric is a non-GAAP measure and is reconciled in the schedules attached to our press release.
Now let me quickly recap this quarter's results. Revenue in the quarter of $2.43 billion declined 2% year-over-year on a reported basis. Organic revenue growth of 2% and a 2% benefit from acquisitions were more than offset by a 6% negative impact related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Tyco ordinary shareholders was $0.43 and included net charges of $0.12 related to special items. These special items related primarily to an expected loss on the divestiture of our majority interest in a joint venture as well as restructuring and repositioning charges. Earnings per share from continuing operations before special items was $0.55 compared to our guidance of $0.48 to $0.50. Operationally, we were at the high end of our guidance range, with the remaining $0.05 of earnings attributable to lower corporate expense and a lower tax rate.
Now let me turn the call over to George."

I am pleased with our operational performance in the second quarter as we continued to deliver strong profitability.

I am pleased with our operational performance in the second quarter as we continued to deliver strong profitability. As you can see on Slide 3, we delivered $0.05 of incremental earnings from operations year-over-year. This, coupled with a $0.05 contribution from share repurchases, drove a strong 17% increase in earnings per share before special items for the second quarter.
Before I touch on the progress our teams are making on our strategic initiatives, I want to start with 2 big themes I know everyone is focused on: the impact of the strengthening U.S. dollar and the impact of lower oil prices on the oil and gas industry and the associated effects on other end markets.
Starting with the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on Slide 4. The U.S. dollar has continued to strengthen against most of our significant currencies during the quarter. And this trend has continued in the month of April. The most significant drop has been in the euro, which decreased to a recent low of 1.05 and is currently trading a bit higher. The significant swings in currency during the second quarter and through April are adding an additional $0.02 of pressure to our earnings this year, bringing the full year impact of foreign currency translation to an $0.18 headwind on a year-over-year basis.
Moving to the oil and gas sector on Slide 5. Starting in March and continuing in the month of April, we have seen incremental weakness in our oil and gas end market. As I have mentioned before, our direct exposure to this vertical is about 5% of total revenue, which is across the installation service businesses and within our Global Products segment, with the largest exposure within our U.K. install and services business and our Fire Protection Products business. Based on what we have seen over the last 6 weeks or so, we are now expecting a 15% decline in the revenue tied to this vertical. It's important to keep in mind that a majority of our revenue in the oil and gas space is high-margin service revenue as well as special hazard product sales, which tend to carry a higher-than-average margin. We expect the recent softness we are seeing in the oil and gas vertical to be an incremental headwind of about $0.06 to our previous full year guidance.
Now let me get into a little more detail as to what we are seeing in the macroeconomic environment across the various parts of the globe on Slide 6. Starting with North America. Nonresidential construction in the U.S. continues to be better year-over-year. We continue to see good order activity, particularly in the retail and healthcare verticals, with softness in oil and gas. As activity in the Canadian market is very much tied to the petrochemical oil and gas industry, we have seen a broad-based slowdown, particularly in Western Canada. CapEx spending has come more in focus due to the decline in oil prices, which is resulting in some project activity being shifted to the right and delays in new order activity being awarded. Overall, our North America install and service business is continuing to show nice improvement. We saw an increase in organic growth as the security business has turned the corner and is now accelerating growth for the first time since separation. We are also seeing very good traction in our Global Products business in North America across Fire, Security and Life Safety. Overall, we grew 5% organically in North America.
Turning to Europe. Our team continues to execute well and gain share despite the increased pressure from foreign currency exchange rates. The European market shows demand for integrated solutions, which we expect will help to drive our service growth in the region in the future and also contribute to margin expansion. We are seeing nice activity in the general commercial and retail space, the service industry as well as manufacturing, while oil and gas and heavy industrial end markets are noticeably softer, consistent with global trends.
In the U.K., we have direct oil and gas exposure related to the North Sea offshore oil rigs, where we primarily earned service revenue on the maintenance of the fire safety systems. The impact of lower oil prices has caused a considerable slowdown in nonessential maintenance, resulting in delays of service-related activities. While we do expect some improvement in this vertical later this year due to pent-up demand for the required maintenance of customer sites, this has and will continue to put pressure on the top line results.
For Europe overall, our current view is that it will be relatively flat to modestly down for the year compared to our previous expectation of modest growth. Despite the top line pressure, margin expansion has been strong in Europe as sourcing and productivity initiatives, combined with restructuring actions, are helping to mitigate the lower volume.
In Australia, we are seeing a bit of growth in the general commercial space. However, this is being more than offset by the downturn in the industrial and mining sectors. Very similar to last quarter, organic revenue is decreasing in the mid-single-digit range, driven by a decline in service. We expect these conditions to continue during the second half of the year, in line with our previous expectations.
In the growth markets, we are seeing a slowdown in installation projects related to oil and gas, particularly in Asia. However, we expect a mid- to upper single-digit growth for the full year, given the strong level of bidding activity in Asia, Latin America and our other growth markets in verticals such as general commercial, retail and industrial.
Moving on to our strategic initiatives. I am impressed with the progress our teams are making internally to drive revenue growth, both organically and inorganically, as well as executing on our productivity initiatives.
Starting with the top line. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, revenue grew 4% year-over-year. Although overall organic growth continues to remain in the low single digits, we are beginning to see some green shoots that indicate growth will accelerate over the longer term. For example, installation growth in North America accelerated to 3% organically. And as I previously mentioned, the Commercial Security business is contributing nicely to growth for the first time since separation. The teams had done a great job converting the backlog of strong orders that we received over the last few quarters to revenue. I have confidence that the growth in our installed base, along with strengthening our service capabilities across the globe, will allow us to build our service revenue over time.
In terms of M&A, we closed all of the acquisitions discussed in our January earnings call, including Industrial Safety Technologies, or IST, our largest acquisition post separation, which closed at the end of February. Our teams are diligently working to ensure the integration of these businesses occur seamlessly and within the expected time frames.
All together, these acquisitions totaled about $500 million in purchase price, with annualized revenues of approximately $275 million. We are currently working on a rich pipeline of potential opportunities. In the aggregate, the purchase price ranges from $200 million to $500 million. These deals are centered around increasing our service mix and executing on our technology strategy. They are core to our business and will help drive service growth in the future.
Lastly, we are seeing productivity and cost savings being generated by bringing the Fire & Security businesses together. We are driving sourcing and productivity initiatives, simplifying our global footprint and transforming our functions. We expect that these actions will generate gross savings in excess of $150 million this year, which after offsetting annual inflation we incur related to our labor force and incremental investments in R&D and sales and marketing, we expect to net $60 million to $70 million to the bottom line. And I'd say that these initiatives will continue far beyond 2015. We're in the early stages of these efforts, and we expect they will continue to support our margin expansion in the years to come. It is important to keep in mind that we had planned for incremental investments in R&D and sales and marketing of $50 million this year. We fully expect to make these investments despite the tougher macroenvironment as they are core to delivering on our long-term growth strategy.
Overall, the investments we are making to expand our capabilities in technology, along with our efforts to further streamline our operations, position us well to deliver strong double-digit earnings growth this year. And I feel even better today about the execution of our growth strategy and delivering on the commitments we made at our November Investor Day.
Now let me turn it over to Arun to go through the details of our performance."

Let me start with an overview of our results for the second quarter. Revenue of $2.43 billion declined 2% year-over-year on a reported basis, including a 6% headwind related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Excluding FX, revenue grew 4% in the quarter, with a combination of 2% organic growth and 2% acquisition growth. Excluding FX, service was up 2%, installation grew 5% and Global Products was up 11%. Organic growth of 2% was a bit below our expectation of 3% due to, as George discussed, the softness in the macroenvironment.
Before special items, segment operating income was $331 million, which includes a $17 million headwind from FX, and the segment operating margin was 13.6%. Normalizing for last year's insurance recovery of $21 million, segment operating margin expansion was 50 basis points and resulted from higher revenues, improved execution and the benefits from restructuring and productivity initiatives.
Earnings per share before special items increased $0.08 or 17% year-over-year. Operationally, we delivered an incremental $0.05 of earnings, driven by revenue growth in Global Products and North America install and services, along with continued productivity initiatives. A lower share count provided an additional $0.05 benefit, which was partially offset by a $0.03 headwind related to foreign currency translation. The remaining $0.01 benefit resulted from the net impact of lower corporate expense and below-the-line items, offset by the insurance recovery received in the prior year.
Turning to orders on Slide 9. As I've often mentioned in previous quarterly calls, it is important to keep in mind that order growth, particularly in our installation business, is lumpy and can be impacted by the timing of large projects. Orders in the quarter increased 1% year-over-year, with 9% growth in products, 2% growth in service and a decline of 6% in installation, driven by a significant amount of large installation orders in the prior year and softness within the oil and gas vertical. Backlog of $4.7 billion was relatively flat on both a year-over-year and a quarter sequential basis.
Now let's get into the details of each of the segments, starting first with North America Installation & Services on Slide 10. Revenue in the quarter of $944 million increased 1% on a reported basis. Organic growth increased to 2%, with 3% growth in installation. Service revenue was relatively flat due to adverse weather conditions in the quarter as well as some softness in our Canadian business related to oil and gas. FX negatively impacted revenue growth by 1 percentage point.
Before special items, operating income in the quarter was $125 million and the operating margin was 13.2%. The operating margin improved 70 basis points year-over-year, driven by improved execution and the benefits of productivity and restructuring initiatives.
Overall, orders decreased 2% year-over-year in North America install and services. Service orders remained relatively flat, while installation orders declined 5%. Underlying mid-single-digit install order growth was more than offset by a $30 million fire order in the prior year as well as a decline in the oil and gas vertical. Total backlog of $2.5 billion grew 3% compared with the prior year and was relatively flat on a quarter sequential basis.
Turning to Slide 11, Rest of World Installation & Services. Revenue of $847 million decreased 10% year-over-year, driven by an 11% unfavorable impact related to FX. Organic growth was relatively flat, with 1% growth in service revenue, offset by a decline of 1% in installation revenue. Acquisitions contributed 1% to revenue growth.
Before special items, operating income was $90 million, which included a $10 million FX headwind. Normalizing for the $21 million insurance recovery booked in Q2 2014, the segment operating margin was flat at 10.6% as the benefit of productivity and restructuring initiatives was offset by the mix of geographies contributing to growth.
Turning to order activity in Rest of World. Total orders declined 2% year-over-year. Service orders increased 3%, and installation orders declined 7%, driven by the timing of large orders in the prior year as well as weakness in the oil and gas vertical. Backlog of $2 billion decreased 2% on a year-over-year basis and decreased 1% on a quarter sequential basis.
Turning to Global Products on Slide 12. Revenue grew 6% in the quarter to $639 million. Organic revenue growth of 7% was driven by strong growth in the Life Safety and Security Products businesses, which was partially offset by softness in Fire Protection Products related to sales in the oil and gas sector. Organic growth including a 3 percentage point benefit from increased shipments of Air-Paks compared to the prior year. A 4% benefit to revenue from acquisitions was more than offset by a 6% decrease to revenue related to FX.
Before special items, operating income was $116 million and included a $6 million FX headwind. The operating margin increased 20 basis points to 18.2% on a reported basis. Increased revenue and productivity benefits drove 120 basis points of margin expansion, which was partially offset by 70 basis points related to incremental investments in R&D and 30 basis points related to noncash purchase accounting. Product orders increased 9% year-over-year.
Now let me touch on a few other items on Slide 13. First, corporate expense before special items was $51 million for the quarter. We expect corporate expense in the third quarter to increase to $55 million, in line with our normal increase in the second half of the year. Given the favorability in corporate expense year-to-date, we now expect corporate expense for the full year to be approximately $220 million versus our previous expectation of $225 million.
During the quarter, we raised EUR 500 million debt with a maturity of 10 years and a coupon of 1.375%. This will result in incremental interest expense of approximately $4 million in the second half of the year.
Moving to tax. Our effective tax rate before the impact of special items was 11.5% for the quarter. The lower-than-projected tax rate was due to a onetime benefit related to the realization of certain non-U.S. deferred tax assets as a result of restructuring activities in Europe. We expect the effective tax rate for the third and fourth quarter to be approximately 18% and the full year tax rate to be approximately 16.5%.
We ended the quarter with a weighted average diluted share count of 427 million shares and an exit rate of 428 million shares. For the fiscal third quarter and full year, we expect a weighted average diluted share count of 428 million shares.
Finally, I would like to give an update on our restructuring and repositioning activities and the funding of our asbestos liabilities. To date, we have taken restructuring and repositioning actions, resulting in approximately $100 million of charges. Given the macro uncertainties and FX pressures we are facing this year, we continue to identify additional projects that will help to further streamline our structure and improve operations this year and beyond. As a result, we continue to expect restructuring and repositioning actions to be closer to $150 million, which is at the high end of the range we provided in November.
Regarding our legacy asbestos liabilities, we funded the expected $275 million for Grinnell during the second quarter. We have received bankruptcy court approval and expect to fund the $325 million for Yarway in the third quarter.
Now let me turn things back over to George."
107534,289399098,794319,"Tyco International Ltd., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2015",2015-04-24,"Earnings Calls","Tyco International plc","Executives","Thanks, Arun. Let's turn now to Slide 14 for our earnings guidance for the third quarter, starting with the top line.As we move into the third quarter, we expect organic revenue growth in the 1% to 2% range against a difficult compare in the prior year.",601,"Thanks, Arun. Let's turn now to Slide 14 for our earnings guidance for the third quarter, starting with the top line.
As we move into the third quarter, we expect organic revenue growth in the 1% to 2% range against a difficult compare in the prior year. As you may recall, the backlog buildup in our Life Safety business in 2014 was related to Air-Paks, which were all shipped during our fiscal third quarter. This resulted in 12% organic growth in Global Products in the third quarter of last year, of which 5 percentage points was attributable to conversion of the built up backlog of Air-Paks. The impact of this on Tyco's overall organic growth last year was a full percentage point. Against that backdrop, we expect Global Products to be relatively flat organically in the third quarter, with North America I&S growing in the 2% to 3% range and Rest of World I&S being flat to up 1% organically. Acquisitions will offset divestitures and deliver about a 1.5 points to overall revenue growth. Given current exchange rates, we expect growth in revenue to be offset by an 8 percentage point or $205 million year-over-year headwind related to FX. Taking all of these factors into account, we expect revenue in the third quarter to decline approximately 5% year-over-year on a reported basis.
We expect the segment operating margin before special items to be relatively flat on a reported basis due to a 30 basis point lift in the prior year margin due to the timing of Air-Paks shipments as well as the absorption of 30 basis points of noncash purchase accounting. Adjusting for these items, underlying operations are expected to improve approximately 60 basis points year-over-year. Taking all of these assumptions into account, we expect earnings per share before special items in the third quarter to be in the range of $0.55 to $0.57.
As you can see on Slide 15, year-over-year, we expect underlying operations in the third quarter to contribute about $0.05, which is partially offset by the $0.02 shift in earnings in the prior year related to the Air-Paks. The $0.05 benefit from the reduced share count is expected to be more than offset by a $0.06 headwind related to FX.
Moving to our expectations for the full year on Slide 16. We expect organic revenue growth in the 2% to 3% range. Acquisitions will offset divestitures and add an additional point of revenue growth. We expect $645 million or a 6% headwind related to FX. Overall, we expect revenue will decline approximately 3% on a reported basis.
We expect the segment operating margin before special items to expand approximately 50 basis points on a reported basis after absorbing a 20 basis point headwind from noncash amortization related to the recent acquisitions.
Taking all of this into account as well as the guidance for corporate expense and below-the-line items Arun provided, we are updating our full year earnings per share before special items guidance from a range of $2.30 to $2.40 to a range of $2.23 to $2.27.
As you can see on Slide 17, our prior guidance is being adjusted for softness in the macroenvironment, driven by oil and gas, additional pressure from FX and the net impact related to the divestiture of a joint venture and below-the-line items. Our revised guidance of $2.23 to $2.27 represents a year-over-year increase of 12% to 14% compared to the prior year earnings per share before special items of $2.

So looking at the second quarter, service growth, it was 2% x FX. Now acquisitions are helping to offset some of the double-digit declines that we're seeing in Australia as well as now, more recently in the U.K., in the oil and gas vertical. And when we forecast the total year, we're still going to be positioned to deliver 2% for the total year. Now longer term, we've been working and focusing on technology in commercial investments that are going to significantly change the profile of how we drive service growth going forward. So we've had lots of projects being brought to market. It's going to enhance the capabilities that we have. It's going to embed new technologies. And that's going to create the platform to be able to bring new services, create new value for the customers that we support and, ultimately, project our service growth to support the 3-year plan that we outlined back in November. Now relative to the margins in Rest of World, what I would say is, I would start by saying, the external macros have been extremely difficult, but the fundamentals of how we're driving the businesses are extremely strong, very strong operational performance. We're offsetting FX headwinds of $10 million. We're offsetting mix -- a significant mix with the decline in services in the U.K. and Australia, and that equates to about 80 basis points year-on-year. And at the same time, we're investing in our growth markets, which we believe are absolutely critical to be able to build the business and deliver growth to support the 3-year plan that we outlined back in November. This all now is -- when you normalize it, without the $21 million of insurance recovery that we got last year, will deliver relatively flat margin year-on-year.

What we've seen here in March, and it has continued in April, we've seen a pretty significant drop-off. And now based on what we're seeing, we're projecting that we're going to see about a 15% decline for the total year in the oil and gas vertical. So it is a significant drop-off. It's being driven by our Fire Protection Products business where we provide special hazard solutions, both upstream and downstream, as well as our U.K. and Canada, mainly Western Canada business, where we do significant installations as well as we have strong service businesses that are going to decline about -- just about double digit.

Let me talk about Life Safety. Life Safety has been a business that we've been investing in. The Air-Pak, the new product that has received -- extremely well received in the market by our customers, we're seeing a nice pickup there as well as we're going to be going through a replacement cycle because all of the Air-Paks that we're putting into the market post 9/11 are now needing to be replaced. And so the opportunity that we have there has been significant. We've positioned our business well with the technology and the new products we brought into market, and we're capitalizing on that. So that's helping our Life Safety business. The acquisition we did in IST, which is the gas detection business, now that's part of the portfolio. We're immediately beginning to see some synergies on our core business and how we leverage that with expanded distribution as well as now working on the cost synergies. So that would be what's driving Life Safety. When you go into Security Products, we are the market leader in  whether it be intrusion, access technologies, and a player within the video space. There's a lot of new markets that's being opened up that we're providing product to with our sensors and devices that are going into the home, that are going into new solutions. We've been investing pretty significantly within this space, and we're beginning to see the traction now in the orders. And we see that continuing, that order growth continuing, with our ability to be able to drive strong, in spite of our FPP, the Fire Protection Products, softness that we're seeing in oil and gas, continue to deliver very strong mid-single-digit organic growth and then combined with the acquisitions we've made, very nice total growth within our product businesses this year and beyond."

With me today are Tyco's Chief Executive Officer, George Oliver; and our Chief Financial Officer, Arun Nayar.
I would like to remind you that during the course of today's call, we will be providing certain forward-looking information. We ask that you look at today's press release and read through the forward-looking cautionary informational statements that we've included there.
In addition, we will use certain non-GAAP measures in our discussions, and we ask that you look through the sections of our press release that address the use of these items. The press release issued this morning and all related tables as well as the conference call slides, which George and Arun will refer to, can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at tyco.com. Please also note that we will be filing our quarterly SEC Form 10-Q later today.
During the quarter, the company committed to a plan to sell security monitoring business in China, which was previously reported within the Rest of World Installation & Services operating segment. This business generated $8 million of revenue in fiscal 2014, with an operating loss of $3 million. Current and historical results related to this business are now classified as discontinued operations. Re-casted financial information for the quarters of fiscal year 2014 as well as the fiscal first quarter of 2015 is available on the Investor Relations portion of our website.
Additionally, during the second quarter, the company committed to a plan to sell its majority interest in a fire installation joint venture in China. This business is classified as held for sale on the balance sheet as of quarter end, and the company expects to complete the sale of this business in April. Annualized sales related to this business are approximately $130 million.
In discussing our segment operations, when we refer to changes in backlog and order activity, these figures exclude the impact of foreign currency and divestitures. Additionally, references to operating margins during the call exclude special items, and this metric is a non-GAAP measure and is reconciled in the schedules attached to our press release.
Now let me quickly recap this quarter's results. Revenue in the quarter of $2.43 billion declined 2% year-over-year on a reported basis. Organic revenue growth of 2% and a 2% benefit from acquisitions were more than offset by a 6% negative impact related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Tyco ordinary shareholders was $0.43 and included net charges of $0.12 related to special items. These special items related primarily to an expected loss on the divestiture of our majority interest in a joint venture as well as restructuring and repositioning charges. Earnings per share from continuing operations before special items was $0.55 compared to our guidance of $0.48 to $0.50. Operationally, we were at the high end of our guidance range, with the remaining $0.05 of earnings attributable to lower corporate expense and a lower tax rate.
Now let me turn the call over to George."
107534,289399098,794569,"Tyco International Ltd., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2015",2015-04-24,"Earnings Calls","Tyco International plc","Executives","Thanks, Antonella, and good morning, everyone. I am pleased with our operational performance in the second quarter as we continued to deliver strong profitability. As you can see on Slide 3, we delivered $0.05 of incremental earnings from operations year-",1468,"Thanks, Antonella, and good morning, everyone. I am pleased with our operational performance in the second quarter as we continued to deliver strong profitability. As you can see on Slide 3, we delivered $0.05 of incremental earnings from operations year-over-year. This, coupled with a $0.05 contribution from share repurchases, drove a strong 17% increase in earnings per share before special items for the second quarter.
Before I touch on the progress our teams are making on our strategic initiatives, I want to start with 2 big themes I know everyone is focused on: the impact of the strengthening U.S. dollar and the impact of lower oil prices on the oil and gas industry and the associated effects on other end markets.
Starting with the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on Slide 4. The U.S. dollar has continued to strengthen against most of our significant currencies during the quarter. And this trend has continued in the month of April. The most significant drop has been in the euro, which decreased to a recent low of 1.05 and is currently trading a bit higher. The significant swings in currency during the second quarter and through April are adding an additional $0.02 of pressure to our earnings this year, bringing the full year impact of foreign currency translation to an $0.18 headwind on a year-over-year basis.
Moving to the oil and gas sector on Slide 5. Starting in March and continuing in the month of April, we have seen incremental weakness in our oil and gas end market. As I have mentioned before, our direct exposure to this vertical is about 5% of total revenue, which is across the installation service businesses and within our Global Products segment, with the largest exposure within our U.K. install and services business and our Fire Protection Products business. Based on what we have seen over the last 6 weeks or so, we are now expecting a 15% decline in the revenue tied to this vertical. It's important to keep in mind that a majority of our revenue in the oil and gas space is high-margin service revenue as well as special hazard product sales, which tend to carry a higher-than-average margin. We expect the recent softness we are seeing in the oil and gas vertical to be an incremental headwind of about $0.06 to our previous full year guidance.
Now let me get into a little more detail as to what we are seeing in the macroeconomic environment across the various parts of the globe on Slide 6. Starting with North America. Nonresidential construction in the U.S. continues to be better year-over-year. We continue to see good order activity, particularly in the retail and healthcare verticals, with softness in oil and gas. As activity in the Canadian market is very much tied to the petrochemical oil and gas industry, we have seen a broad-based slowdown, particularly in Western Canada. CapEx spending has come more in focus due to the decline in oil prices, which is resulting in some project activity being shifted to the right and delays in new order activity being awarded. Overall, our North America install and service business is continuing to show nice improvement. We saw an increase in organic growth as the security business has turned the corner and is now accelerating growth for the first time since separation. We are also seeing very good traction in our Global Products business in North America across Fire, Security and Life Safety. Overall, we grew 5% organically in North America.
Turning to Europe. Our team continues to execute well and gain share despite the increased pressure from foreign currency exchange rates. The European market shows demand for integrated solutions, which we expect will help to drive our service growth in the region in the future and also contribute to margin expansion. We are seeing nice activity in the general commercial and retail space, the service industry as well as manufacturing, while oil and gas and heavy industrial end markets are noticeably softer, consistent with global trends.
In the U.K., we have direct oil and gas exposure related to the North Sea offshore oil rigs, where we primarily earned service revenue on the maintenance of the fire safety systems. The impact of lower oil prices has caused a considerable slowdown in nonessential maintenance, resulting in delays of service-related activities. While we do expect some improvement in this vertical later this year due to pent-up demand for the required maintenance of customer sites, this has and will continue to put pressure on the top line results.
For Europe overall, our current view is that it will be relatively flat to modestly down for the year compared to our previous expectation of modest growth. Despite the top line pressure, margin expansion has been strong in Europe as sourcing and productivity initiatives, combined with restructuring actions, are helping to mitigate the lower volume.
In Australia, we are seeing a bit of growth in the general commercial space. However, this is being more than offset by the downturn in the industrial and mining sectors. Very similar to last quarter, organic revenue is decreasing in the mid-single-digit range, driven by a decline in service. We expect these conditions to continue during the second half of the year, in line with our previous expectations.
In the growth markets, we are seeing a slowdown in installation projects related to oil and gas, particularly in Asia. However, we expect a mid- to upper single-digit growth for the full year, given the strong level of bidding activity in Asia, Latin America and our other growth markets in verticals such as general commercial, retail and industrial.
Moving on to our strategic initiatives. I am impressed with the progress our teams are making internally to drive revenue growth, both organically and inorganically, as well as executing on our productivity initiatives.
Starting with the top line. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, revenue grew 4% year-over-year. Although overall organic growth continues to remain in the low single digits, we are beginning to see some green shoots that indicate growth will accelerate over the longer term. For example, installation growth in North America accelerated to 3% organically. And as I previously mentioned, the Commercial Security business is contributing nicely to growth for the first time since separation. The teams had done a great job converting the backlog of strong orders that we received over the last few quarters to revenue. I have confidence that the growth in our installed base, along with strengthening our service capabilities across the globe, will allow us to build our service revenue over time.
In terms of M&A, we closed all of the acquisitions discussed in our January earnings call, including Industrial Safety Technologies, or IST, our largest acquisition post separation, which closed at the end of February. Our teams are diligently working to ensure the integration of these businesses occur seamlessly and within the expected time frames.
All together, these acquisitions totaled about $500 million in purchase price, with annualized revenues of approximately $275 million. We are currently working on a rich pipeline of potential opportunities. In the aggregate, the purchase price ranges from $200 million to $500 million. These deals are centered around increasing our service mix and executing on our technology strategy. They are core to our business and will help drive service growth in the future.
Lastly, we are seeing productivity and cost savings being generated by bringing the Fire & Security businesses together. We are driving sourcing and productivity initiatives, simplifying our global footprint and transforming our functions. We expect that these actions will generate gross savings in excess of $150 million this year, which after offsetting annual inflation we incur related to our labor force and incremental investments in R&D and sales and marketing, we expect to net $60 million to $70 million to the bottom line. And I'd say that these initiatives will continue far beyond 2015. We're in the early stages of these efforts, and we expect they will continue to support our margin expansion in the years to come. It is important to keep in mind that we had planned for incremental investments in R&D and sales and marketing of $50 million this year. We fully expect to make these investments despite the tougher macroenvironment as they are core to delivering on our long-term growth strategy.
Overall, the investments we are making to expand our capabilities in technology, along with our efforts to further streamline our operations, position us well to deliver strong double-digit earnings growth this year. And I feel even better today about the execution of our growth strategy and delivering on the commitments we made at our November Investor Day.
Now let me turn it over to Arun to go through the details of our performance."

You can follow my comments on our financial performance, starting with Slide 8. Let me start with an overview of our results for the second quarter.

Let me start with an overview of our results for the second quarter. Revenue of $2.43 billion declined 2% year-over-year on a reported basis, including a 6% headwind related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Excluding FX, revenue grew 4% in the quarter, with a combination of 2% organic growth and 2% acquisition growth. Excluding FX, service was up 2%, installation grew 5% and Global Products was up 11%. Organic growth of 2% was a bit below our expectation of 3% due to, as George discussed, the softness in the macroenvironment.
Before special items, segment operating income was $331 million, which includes a $17 million headwind from FX, and the segment operating margin was 13.6%. Normalizing for last year's insurance recovery of $21 million, segment operating margin expansion was 50 basis points and resulted from higher revenues, improved execution and the benefits from restructuring and productivity initiatives.
Earnings per share before special items increased $0.08 or 17% year-over-year. Operationally, we delivered an incremental $0.05 of earnings, driven by revenue growth in Global Products and North America install and services, along with continued productivity initiatives. A lower share count provided an additional $0.05 benefit, which was partially offset by a $0.03 headwind related to foreign currency translation. The remaining $0.01 benefit resulted from the net impact of lower corporate expense and below-the-line items, offset by the insurance recovery received in the prior year.
Turning to orders on Slide 9. As I've often mentioned in previous quarterly calls, it is important to keep in mind that order growth, particularly in our installation business, is lumpy and can be impacted by the timing of large projects. Orders in the quarter increased 1% year-over-year, with 9% growth in products, 2% growth in service and a decline of 6% in installation, driven by a significant amount of large installation orders in the prior year and softness within the oil and gas vertical. Backlog of $4.7 billion was relatively flat on both a year-over-year and a quarter sequential basis.
Now let's get into the details of each of the segments, starting first with North America Installation & Services on Slide 10. Revenue in the quarter of $944 million increased 1% on a reported basis. Organic growth increased to 2%, with 3% growth in installation. Service revenue was relatively flat due to adverse weather conditions in the quarter as well as some softness in our Canadian business related to oil and gas. FX negatively impacted revenue growth by 1 percentage point.
Before special items, operating income in the quarter was $125 million and the operating margin was 13.2%. The operating margin improved 70 basis points year-over-year, driven by improved execution and the benefits of productivity and restructuring initiatives.
Overall, orders decreased 2% year-over-year in North America install and services. Service orders remained relatively flat, while installation orders declined 5%. Underlying mid-single-digit install order growth was more than offset by a $30 million fire order in the prior year as well as a decline in the oil and gas vertical. Total backlog of $2.5 billion grew 3% compared with the prior year and was relatively flat on a quarter sequential basis.
Turning to Slide 11, Rest of World Installation & Services. Revenue of $847 million decreased 10% year-over-year, driven by an 11% unfavorable impact related to FX. Organic growth was relatively flat, with 1% growth in service revenue, offset by a decline of 1% in installation revenue. Acquisitions contributed 1% to revenue growth.
Before special items, operating income was $90 million, which included a $10 million FX headwind. Normalizing for the $21 million insurance recovery booked in Q2 2014, the segment operating margin was flat at 10.6% as the benefit of productivity and restructuring initiatives was offset by the mix of geographies contributing to growth.
Turning to order activity in Rest of World. Total orders declined 2% year-over-year. Service orders increased 3%, and installation orders declined 7%, driven by the timing of large orders in the prior year as well as weakness in the oil and gas vertical. Backlog of $2 billion decreased 2% on a year-over-year basis and decreased 1% on a quarter sequential basis.
Turning to Global Products on Slide 12. Revenue grew 6% in the quarter to $639 million. Organic revenue growth of 7% was driven by strong growth in the Life Safety and Security Products businesses, which was partially offset by softness in Fire Protection Products related to sales in the oil and gas sector. Organic growth including a 3 percentage point benefit from increased shipments of Air-Paks compared to the prior year. A 4% benefit to revenue from acquisitions was more than offset by a 6% decrease to revenue related to FX.
Before special items, operating income was $116 million and included a $6 million FX headwind. The operating margin increased 20 basis points to 18.2% on a reported basis. Increased revenue and productivity benefits drove 120 basis points of margin expansion, which was partially offset by 70 basis points related to incremental investments in R&D and 30 basis points related to noncash purchase accounting. Product orders increased 9% year-over-year.
Now let me touch on a few other items on Slide 13. First, corporate expense before special items was $51 million for the quarter. We expect corporate expense in the third quarter to increase to $55 million, in line with our normal increase in the second half of the year. Given the favorability in corporate expense year-to-date, we now expect corporate expense for the full year to be approximately $220 million versus our previous expectation of $225 million.
During the quarter, we raised EUR 500 million debt with a maturity of 10 years and a coupon of 1.375%. This will result in incremental interest expense of approximately $4 million in the second half of the year.
Moving to tax. Our effective tax rate before the impact of special items was 11.5% for the quarter. The lower-than-projected tax rate was due to a onetime benefit related to the realization of certain non-U.S. deferred tax assets as a result of restructuring activities in Europe. We expect the effective tax rate for the third and fourth quarter to be approximately 18% and the full year tax rate to be approximately 16.5%.
We ended the quarter with a weighted average diluted share count of 427 million shares and an exit rate of 428 million shares. For the fiscal third quarter and full year, we expect a weighted average diluted share count of 428 million shares.
Finally, I would like to give an update on our restructuring and repositioning activities and the funding of our asbestos liabilities. To date, we have taken restructuring and repositioning actions, resulting in approximately $100 million of charges. Given the macro uncertainties and FX pressures we are facing this year, we continue to identify additional projects that will help to further streamline our structure and improve operations this year and beyond. As a result, we continue to expect restructuring and repositioning actions to be closer to $150 million, which is at the high end of the range we provided in November.
Regarding our legacy asbestos liabilities, we funded the expected $275 million for Grinnell during the second quarter. We have received bankruptcy court approval and expect to fund the $325 million for Yarway in the third quarter.
Now let me turn things back over to George."
107534,289399098,794569,"Tyco International Ltd., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2015",2015-04-24,"Earnings Calls","Tyco International plc","Executives","Thanks, Arun. Let's turn now to Slide 14 for our earnings guidance for the third quarter, starting with the top line.As we move into the third quarter, we expect organic revenue growth in the 1% to 2% range against a difficult compare in the prior year.",601,"Thanks, Arun. Let's turn now to Slide 14 for our earnings guidance for the third quarter, starting with the top line.
As we move into the third quarter, we expect organic revenue growth in the 1% to 2% range against a difficult compare in the prior year. As you may recall, the backlog buildup in our Life Safety business in 2014 was related to Air-Paks, which were all shipped during our fiscal third quarter. This resulted in 12% organic growth in Global Products in the third quarter of last year, of which 5 percentage points was attributable to conversion of the built up backlog of Air-Paks. The impact of this on Tyco's overall organic growth last year was a full percentage point. Against that backdrop, we expect Global Products to be relatively flat organically in the third quarter, with North America I&S growing in the 2% to 3% range and Rest of World I&S being flat to up 1% organically. Acquisitions will offset divestitures and deliver about a 1.5 points to overall revenue growth. Given current exchange rates, we expect growth in revenue to be offset by an 8 percentage point or $205 million year-over-year headwind related to FX. Taking all of these factors into account, we expect revenue in the third quarter to decline approximately 5% year-over-year on a reported basis.
We expect the segment operating margin before special items to be relatively flat on a reported basis due to a 30 basis point lift in the prior year margin due to the timing of Air-Paks shipments as well as the absorption of 30 basis points of noncash purchase accounting. Adjusting for these items, underlying operations are expected to improve approximately 60 basis points year-over-year. Taking all of these assumptions into account, we expect earnings per share before special items in the third quarter to be in the range of $0.55 to $0.57.
As you can see on Slide 15, year-over-year, we expect underlying operations in the third quarter to contribute about $0.05, which is partially offset by the $0.02 shift in earnings in the prior year related to the Air-Paks. The $0.05 benefit from the reduced share count is expected to be more than offset by a $0.06 headwind related to FX.
Moving to our expectations for the full year on Slide 16. We expect organic revenue growth in the 2% to 3% range. Acquisitions will offset divestitures and add an additional point of revenue growth. We expect $645 million or a 6% headwind related to FX. Overall, we expect revenue will decline approximately 3% on a reported basis.
We expect the segment operating margin before special items to expand approximately 50 basis points on a reported basis after absorbing a 20 basis point headwind from noncash amortization related to the recent acquisitions.
Taking all of this into account as well as the guidance for corporate expense and below-the-line items Arun provided, we are updating our full year earnings per share before special items guidance from a range of $2.30 to $2.40 to a range of $2.23 to $2.27.
As you can see on Slide 17, our prior guidance is being adjusted for softness in the macroenvironment, driven by oil and gas, additional pressure from FX and the net impact related to the divestiture of a joint venture and below-the-line items. Our revised guidance of $2.23 to $2.27 represents a year-over-year increase of 12% to 14% compared to the prior year earnings per share before special items of $2.

So looking at the second quarter, service growth, it was 2% x FX. Now acquisitions are helping to offset some of the double-digit declines that we're seeing in Australia as well as now, more recently in the U.K., in the oil and gas vertical. And when we forecast the total year, we're still going to be positioned to deliver 2% for the total year. Now longer term, we've been working and focusing on technology in commercial investments that are going to significantly change the profile of how we drive service growth going forward. So we've had lots of projects being brought to market. It's going to enhance the capabilities that we have. It's going to embed new technologies. And that's going to create the platform to be able to bring new services, create new value for the customers that we support and, ultimately, project our service growth to support the 3-year plan that we outlined back in November. Now relative to the margins in Rest of World, what I would say is, I would start by saying, the external macros have been extremely difficult, but the fundamentals of how we're driving the businesses are extremely strong, very strong operational performance. We're offsetting FX headwinds of $10 million. We're offsetting mix -- a significant mix with the decline in services in the U.K. and Australia, and that equates to about 80 basis points year-on-year. And at the same time, we're investing in our growth markets, which we believe are absolutely critical to be able to build the business and deliver growth to support the 3-year plan that we outlined back in November. This all now is -- when you normalize it, without the $21 million of insurance recovery that we got last year, will deliver relatively flat margin year-on-year. But what's built in that overall margin is significant productivity offsetting a tremendous amount of headwind."

What we've seen here in March, and it has continued in April, we've seen a pretty significant drop-off. And now based on what we're seeing, we're projecting that we're going to see about a 15% decline for the total year in the oil and gas vertical. So it is a significant drop-off. It's being driven by our Fire Protection Products business where we provide special hazard solutions, both upstream and downstream, as well as our U.K. and Canada, mainly Western Canada business, where we do significant installations as well as we have strong service businesses that are going to decline about -- just about double digits.

Given the current macroenvironment, we're not going to ultimately be able to do that. But I have confidence that we're going to continue to be able to execute better. That's going to position us well to be able to deliver the second half and then be able to be positioned for a strong year in 2016. So all of the restructuring actions that we accelerated is actually going to benefit us in the second half, where not the only did it help us offset some of the pressure at the end of the second quarter with the pressure in oil and gas, but as we now project the second half, we'll see accelerating benefits during -- as we get through Q3 and then Q4, with significant benefits in the fourth quarter.

Let me talk about Life Safety. Life Safety has been a business that we've been investing in. The Air-Pak, the new product that has received -- extremely well received in the market by our customers, we're seeing a nice pickup there as well as we're going to be going through a replacement cycle because all of the Air-Paks that were putting into the market post 9/11 are now needing to be replaced. And so the opportunity that we have there has been significant. We've positioned our business well with the technology and the new products we brought into market, and we're capitalizing on that. So that's helping our Life Safety business. The acquisition we did in IST, which is the gas detection business, now that's part of the portfolio. We're immediately beginning to see some synergies on our core business and how we leverage that with expanded distribution as well as now working on the cost synergies. So that would be what's driving Life Safety. When you go into Security Products, we are the market leader in  whether it be intrusion, access technologies, and a player within the video space. There's a lot of new markets that's being opened up that we're providing product to with our sensors and devices that are going into the home, that are going into new solutions. We've been investing pretty significantly within this space, and we're beginning to see the traction now in the orders. And we see that continuing, that order growth continuing, with our ability to be able to drive strong, in spite of our FPP, the Fire Protection Products, softness that we're seeing in oil and gas, continue to deliver very strong mid-single-digit organic growth and then combined with the acquisitions we've made, very nice total growth within our product businesses this year and beyond."

And as the industry leader with what we do, we stay very disciplined in how we price not only our products but the service that we perform. So there is some risk with some of the volume when we go through these cycles. But if we look back, as we've gone through these cycles, we've come out the other end much stronger, staying disciplined, investing in technology and then positioning to be able to continue to support the customers that we serve. When you net the pressure that we have there in mining, in oil and gas, in some of the areas where we're having some challenges, we are still going to deliver price across the enterprise somewhere between 0.5 to 1 point over the enterprise. And so we're staying very disciplined. Pricing is one of our key levers across all what we do that we're driving that we believe is going to continue to be some of the ability to be able to mitigate some of the pressures that we continue to experience."

With me today are Tyco's Chief Executive Officer, George Oliver and our Chief Financial Officer, Arun Nayar.
I would like to remind you that during the course of today's call we will be providing certain forward-looking information. We ask that you look at today's press release and read through the forward-looking cautionary informational statements that we've included there.
In addition, we will use certain non-GAAP measures in our discussions, and we ask that you read through the sections of our press release that address the use of these items. The press release issued this morning and all related tables as well as the conference call slides, which George and Arun will refer to, can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at tyco.com. Please also note that we will be filing our quarterly SEC form 10-Q later today.
In discussing our segment operations, when we refer to changes in backlog and order activity, these figures exclude the impact of foreign currency and divestitures. Additionally, references to operating margins during the call exclude special items, and this metric is a non-GAAP measure and is reconciled in the schedules attached to our press release.
Now let me quickly recap this quarter's results. Revenue in the quarter of $2.5 billion declined 6% year-over-year on a reported basis driven by a 7% headwind related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. A 1% organic revenue decline was more than offset by the net favorable impact of acquisitions and divestitures. Earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Tyco ordinary shareholders was $0.44 and include net charges of $0.15 related to special items. These special items related primarily to restructuring and repositioning charges. Earnings per share from continuing operations before special items was $0.59 compared to our guidance of $0.55 to $0.57 per share.
Now let me turn the call over to George."

Although we were disappointed from an organic growth perspective, we exceeded the high end of our third quarter earnings per share guidance. Our continued focus on productivity and self-help initiatives drove our operating results this quarter. As we're starting to see the top line soften versus our expectation, the teams are aggressively executing cost actions and accelerated our pipeline of restructuring initiatives, which we expect to benefit the bottom line in 2015 will also carry over into 2016. I am proud of how our teams came together to offset the revenue pressure and exceed our earnings per share commitment. This is a great example of the benefits of an operating company structure, and I am pleased with our solid operational results this quarter.
Turning to Slide 4. I am happy to announce that we have continued to strengthen our leadership team to execute on our long-term growth and marketing commitments. This quarter we welcomed Girish Rishi to lead our North America Installation & Services segment in global retail solutions business. Most recently, Girish served as Senior Vice President Enterprise Visibility and Mobility with Zebra Technologies. Prior to that role, he oversaw product development, product management and engineering for the enterprise division of Motorola Solutions. Girish had deep software and hardware technology expertise that includes delivering solutions through common technology platforms, which is particularly valuable as we seek to build on our strong position in the North America in global retail markets by offering new technology-enabled solutions. He has a strong record of leadership in transformative environments as well as guiding complex business integrations, which are key as we continue to integrate our Fire & Security Installation & Service businesses in North America.
Additionally, earlier this month, we announced that Johan Pfeiffer has joined Tyco to lead our Rest of World Installation & Services segment. Johan has an exceptional track record of driving growth through innovations in leading in complex environments in both global and regional roles and across various businesses. He has more than 25 years of experience in business and technology leadership roles, including over 20 years with FMC Technologies. Most recently, he served as Vice President leading their global service technologies in the energy infrastructure businesses. Johan's expertise in the global markets, coupled with his proven leadership, will be a significant asset as we position of these businesses for future growth and improved profitability.
Both Girish and Johan will work closely with Brian Young, who you may recall joined us about a year ago from 3M to lead our Global Commercial Sales Process. Over the last year, we have made significant strides in streamlining and strengthening our commercial structure. Brian has been diligently increasing and upgrading front-line sales management talent, improving and standardizing sales processes and realigning our sales compensation programs toward accelerated growth. We are seeing the benefits of these actions in our sales force productivity, which has translated into increased orders over the last few quarters. This will continue to be a top area of focus as we move forward.
Turning to Slide 5, let me spend a few minutes on what we are seeing in the macroeconomic environment across the various parts of the globe and how that is impacting our performance.
Starting with North America. The U.S. market continues to trend positively with improved growth in nonresidential construction year-over-year. We continue to see good order activity, particularly in the commercial, retail and institutional verticals. As expected, activity in Canada remains weak as the market is very much tied to the petrochemical oil and gas industry, which is having a significant impact on Western Canada. Overall, our North America Install & Service business is performing well. The teams have done a phenomenal job improving operating margins by over 400 basis points since separation. And now with the enhanced commercial structure, the business is well-positioned to drive growth. The significant actions we have taken in our North America Install & Service business to improve the efficiency of our operations, along with the nice traction in order activity and backlog, position us well for fiscal 2016.
Moving to Rest of World, let me start with Europe. I would characterize the overall environment as soft. Concerns over the stability of the euro zone, a continued slowing in the oil and gas industry and pressure from foreign currency exchange rates have all led to a sluggish environment. We are seeing nice activity in the general commercial, retail and manufacturing verticals, while oil and gas and heavy industrial end markets continue to be noticeably soft. Despite the top line pressures, margin expansion has been strong in Europe as sourcing, productivity and cost-out initiatives, combined with the benefits of restructuring, are helping to mitigate the lower volume.
In Australia, the downturn in the industrial and mining sectors are continuing to have a significant impact on the economic environment. Much of our business in Australia was built up during the mining boom, which during in time it doubled. And then over the last 2 years, it has declined pretty significantly. Very similar to last quarter, organic revenue is decreasing in the mid-single-digit range driven by a declining service. Operationally, we've been able to offset a good portion of that deleverage, but certainly, it has created margin headwind.
In the growth markets, we are continuing to see growth in the mid to upper single-digit range, led by Latin America. Order activity in the growth markets is healthy, particularly in the general commercial and retail verticals. As expected, our oil and gas businesses, which represent about 5% of our total revenue, continue to be under significant pressure. The impact of lower oil prices has caused a considerable slowdown in new project activity, nonessential maintenance as well as OpEx spend. Our oil and gas businesses were down about 20% on a year-over-year basis in the third quarter, and we expect a similar decline in the fourth quarter. In line with our previous expectations, we continue to expect our oil and gas vertical to be down about 15% for the full year.
Before I pass it over to Arun to discuss our financials in more detail, I wanted to touch on our portfolio and our M&A strategy. As I have said many times, we are constantly looking at the portfolio, reviewing market dynamics and understanding what is going to be required from a technology standpoint to not only maintain our position in the market but also accelerate our growth. We then redeploy our resources appropriately where we believe we can create the most value and get the highest return. As we remix the portfolio, we are focused on acquisitions that enhance our technology offerings, expand our product portfolio, broaden our service in vertical solutions and strengthen our geographic reach. In line with that strategy, we recently completed the acquisition of Footfall, a global retail intelligence leader. Footfall provides thousands of retailers and retail property owners with end-to-end technology, services and retail analytic solutions to collect, measure and analyze customer traffic in their stores and property portfolios. This acquisition positions Tyco as a leading provider of traffic intelligent solutions globally and expands a key capability in our portfolio of information-based performance solutions. This enables us to support our retail customers in achieving their core mission by helping them drive revenue, optimize operations and enhance merchandising. We expect this acquisition to generate approximately $40 million in revenue on an annualized basis.
Year-to-date, total capital allocated to acquisitions is approximately $575 million. We continue to work our pipeline of opportunities. There are a few transactions in the midsize range we expect to announce over the next 3 to 6 months, which could total between $200 million and $500 million in purchase price.
Now let me turn it over to Arun to go through the details of our performance."
107534,305385382,844028,"Tyco International Ltd., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 31, 2015",2015-07-31,"Earnings Calls","Tyco International plc","Executives","Thank you, George, and good morning, everyone. You can follow my comments on our financial performance starting with Slide 7. Let me start with an overview of our results for the third quarter.Revenue of $2.5 billion declined 6% year-over-year on a repo",1533,"Thank you, George, and good morning, everyone. You can follow my comments on our financial performance starting with Slide 7. Let me start with an overview of our results for the third quarter.
Revenue of $2.5 billion declined 6% year-over-year on a reported basis, including a 7% headwind related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Acquisitions contributed 2 percentage points of revenue growth, which was partially offset by a 1% organic revenue decline and a modest decline related to the impact of a divestiture.
Excluding FX, Service was up 1%, Installation was relatively flat and Global Products grew 4%. The organic revenue decline of 1% was below our expectation of 1% to 2% growth, primarily due to general softness in our Install & Service businesses in Europe and Asia and increased weakness in demand for our heavy industrial higher asset Fire Protection Products.
Before special items, segment operating income was $369 million and the segment operating margin improved 30 basis points to 14.8%. It's important to keep in mind that the prior year included a 30 basis point lift due to the timing of Air-Pak shipments and the current year margin includes the absorption of another 30 basis points of noncash purchase accounting for intangibles.
Normalizing for these items, underlying operations improved 90 basis points year-over-year. This year-over-year operating margin expansion was driven by improved execution and the benefits from cost actions, restructuring and productivity initiatives. Underlying operations contributed $0.05, which was partially offset by the $0.02 shift in earnings in the prior year related to the Air-Paks. A $0.05 benefit from the reduced share count was offset by a $0.05 headwind related to FX. Corporate and other income contributed the remaining $0.02.
Overall, earnings per share before special items increased $0.05 or 9% year-over-year. If you normalize for the timing of the Air-Pak shipments in the prior year, earnings per share increased 13%.
Turning to orders on Slide 8. As I've often mentioned in previous quarterly calls, it is important to keep in mind that order growth, particularly in our installation business, is lumpy, and can be impacted by the timing of large projects. 
Order dollars reached an all-time high in the third quarter. Overall, orders increased 5% year-over-year, with 16% growth in Products, 3% growth in Installation and 1% growth in Service. Total backlog of $4.7 billion increased 2% on both year-over-year and quarter-sequential basis. As a reminder, given the seasonality of our business, backlog normally grows sequentially in the first, second and third quarter. We typically see a seasonal decline in backlog in the fourth quarter as a significant amount of electronic fire upgrade work is performed during the summer months. We expect this trend to continue in the fourth quarter of this year as well.
Now let's get into the details of each of the segments. Starting first with North America Installation & Services on Slide 9. Revenue in the quarter of $972 million was relatively flat on a reported basis. Organic revenue grew 1%, with 3% growth in Installation and flat Service revenue. FX negatively impacted revenue growth by 1 percentage point. Before special items, operating income in the quarter was $157 million and the operating margin was 16.2%. The operating margin improved 240 basis points year-over-year driven by increased revenue, improved execution and the benefits from restructuring cost containment and productivity initiatives.
As George discussed, we have made significant changes in the structure of our North America Install & Service businesses, and we are seeing the benefit of those changes in the margin expansion. As growth gains traction, we expect to see a very nice flow through to operating income.
Overall, orders increased 3% year-over-year in North America Install & Services, service orders increased 1% and Installation orders increased 6% off a 10% increase last year related to several large orders in Fire & Security in both periods. The strong Install order activity this year was driven by the commercial, retail and institutional verticals.
As we look to the fourth quarter, it's important to keep in mind that we have a tough compare in install order activity as last year's Q4 install orders increased 18%, driven by several large projects. Total backlog of $2.5 billion grew 4% year-over-year and 2% on a quarter sequential basis.
Turning to Slide 10. Rest of World Installation & Services revenue of $842 million decreased 16% year-over-year driven by a 13% unfavorable impact related to FX. Organic revenue declined 2%, with 1% decline in service and 3% decline in installation revenue. Acquisitions contributed 1% to revenue growth, which was more than offset by a 2 percentage point decline in revenue related to a divestiture. 
As you're aware, we've had our challenges with Rest of World this year with mining and oil and gas having significant pressure on both the top and bottom line. We're also seeing general softness in Europe and Asia based on the macroeconomic environment. We are making sure that we are staying disciplined that the projects we take on meet our fundamentals and that we continue to execute on our long-term growth strategy.
Before special items, operating income was $93 million. The operating margin declined 30 basis points year-over-year to 11% as the benefits of productivity and restructuring initiatives were more than offset by the volume deleverage and the mix of geographies contributing to operating income.
Turning to order activity in Rest of World, we saw a nice improvement sequentially in order intake. Year-over-year, total orders increased 1%, with 1% growth in both service and installation. Backlog of $1.9 billion was down 1% on a year-over-year basis but increased 1% on a quarter sequential basis.
Turning to Global Products on Slide 11. Revenue declined 3% in the quarter to $675 million. Organically, revenue declined 3% as nice growth in Security Products was more than offset by a decline in the Life Safety and the Fire Protection Products businesses. Organic growth was impacted by a 5 percentage point headwind from increased shipments of Air-Paks in the prior year. Normalizing for the Air-Paks, organic revenue increased by 2%. A 7% benefit to revenue from acquisitions was fully offset by a 7% decrease to revenue related to FX. 
Before special items, operating income was $119 million. As expected, the operating margin decreased 260 basis points to 17.6%. Productivity initiatives were more than offset by the strength of Air-Pak shipments in the prior year, purchase price accounting for intangibles and the timing of incremental investments in R&D, which in total negatively impacted the operating margin by 330 basis points. Underlying operations improved 70 basis points year-over-year.
Product orders increased 16% year-over-year off a relatively easy compare, and half the growth was attributable to recent acquisitions.
Now let me touch on a few other items on Slide 12. First, corporate expense before special items was $50 million for the quarter, about $5 million lower than we had expected due to the benefit of cost actions. Similar to prior years, we expect corporate expense in the fourth quarter to increase on a sequential basis to approximately $55 million. Given the favorability in corporate expense year-to-date, we now expect corporate expense for the full year be approximately $210 million.
Next, our effective tax rate before the impact of special items was 17.2% for the quarter, and we expect a similar tax rate in the fourth quarter. This would bring our full year tax rate to be approximately 16%, driven by a onetime benefit recorded in the second quarter related to the realization of certain non-U.S. deferred tax assets.
Moving to cash flow. Our profile is typically weighted to the second half of the year. We have made significant progress in the quarter, converting our income to cash, with $230 million in adjusted free cash flow, representing a conversion rate of 92%. We expect a strong Q4 in terms of cash conversion, bringing the full year closer to a 90% conversion rate. As we look ahead to 2016, we fully expect to be back to the 90% 100% conversion rate. 
Finally, I would like to give an update on our restructuring and repositioning activities. As George mentioned, we've been accelerating restructuring actions and driving strong productivity across the cost base to be well positioned to deliver on our overall EPS commitment. To date, we have incurred $169 million of charges related to restructuring and repositioning actions, and we now expect these charges to be approximately $225 million for the year.
Before I turn it back over to George, let me provide you a quick update on our legacy liabilities. Starting with asbestos. We expect to fund the Yarway trust in the amount of $325 million in the fourth quarter as we have now received all approvals required for the reorganization plan.
With respect to the tax litigation for the 1997 through 2000 period, a trial in the U.S. tax code was originally set to begin in Feb of 2016. The IRS subsequently requested an additional year to prepare for trial, which we objected to, and ultimately agreed to a trial date in October 2016. In the meantime, we continue to explore the possibility of resolution before trial.
Now let me turn things back over to George."

Let's turn now to Slide 13 for our earnings guidance for the fourth quarter and for the full year. We expect revenue in the fourth quarter of approximately $2.5 billion, with negative 1% to flat organic revenue growth. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates are expected to result in a $195 million or 7% headwind to revenue. Net acquisition and divestiture activity is expected to contribute a benefit of 1%.
Taking all of these factors into account, we expect revenue in the fourth quarter to decline approximately 6% year-over-year on a reported basis.
We expect continued solid operational execution, with 120 basis points of segment margin expansion year-over-year, including the absorption of a 30 basis points headwind related to noncash purchase accounting and a 40 basis point tailwind related to a legal matter in the prior year.
As a result, we expect earnings per share before special items in the fourth quarter to be in the range of $0.60 to $0.62. This represents a 7% to 11% increase in earnings per share year-over-year compared to last year's fourth quarter earnings of $0.56 per share.
With that, we are tightening our full year guidance range previously provided to $2.23 to $2.25 per share, which represents a 12% to 13% increase year-over-year off a base of $2 per share in fiscal 2014.
Thanks for joining us on the conference call this morning. And with that, operator, please open the lines for questions."

And then if I sort of think about the big buckets going to next year, I'm looking at -- I'm still thinking about $0.07 to $0.09 of incremental M&A, $30 million to $40 million of net productivity. You get back $150 million by going to your normalized restructuring, volume leverage on top of that. That all gets me to about 2 35 still in that range, 2 35 to 2 40 or 2 30 or 2 40.

But let me share a few thoughts. I would start with tailwinds. I think from a volume standpoint, the work that Brian Young has done over the last year where we have remixed our sales team, about 20% of our sales team, we got a new structure, the different incentives, we're starting to get some real traction, and that's supporting the orders growth that you see. I'm confident that we'll continue to see volume improvement going into 2016. The productivity that you mentioned with the actions that we've taken, the accelerated restructuring this year, we took additional $75 million. That's now going to let us increase what we originally projected to be net savings of $30 million to $40 million. That is looking towards now $50 million to $60 million of net productivity. The acquisitions that we've done this year, as we have discussed, will contribute about $0.07. And in the continued capital allocation during the course of the year, we'll also benefit. As you think about the headwinds, we will see continued pressure from foreign exchange in the early part of the year, and we're estimating right now it could be about $0.05. We will have higher interest expense. And then we'll get a more normalized rate -- tax rate of about 17% to 18%. So what I would say, as we are planning for 2016, we'll see improvement in revenue from 2015, and that's supported with the orders growth that we're seeing. With the significant productivity and cost-out that we achieved in 2015, that positions us well to continue to expand margins in the range that we had forecasted back during our November Investor Day when we could achieve 50 to 70 basis points on an annualized basis over the next 3-year plan. And that will position us to be able to deliver very nice EPS growth in 2016."

And we don't -- we are not able to claim our revenue until we actually complete our project. So this gives me a lot of confidence with the backlog we've built, with the continued progress we're making within our commercial structure, with the orders performance, that we're going to start to see revenue continue to improve consecutively here as we go through these quarters, as we go through 2016."

And over the last year, that Three-Year Plan, we very much got focused on improving our commercial processes. We brought in Brian Young. We've done tremendous work there, and we are beginning to see lift with the work that's been done. Now as we thought about the next Three-Year Plan, it's important that we build the leadership team with the depth and expertise to be able to drive growth, and that's what drove bringing in Girish in North America and Johan for Rest of World. So the way that I look at it, with the investments we're making not only in products but also now in our service offerings, the combination of the 2, with normal GDP growth, we should be positioned to deliver on our core 1.5 plus times GDP on the core business. But then we're working on new business models, with new technologies, that's now going to be the accelerator of our growth going forward. We'll be able to add on new services, services that actually provide very high ROI to our customers, that enable us to not only support the customer delivering more value, but in turn being able to deliver very nice returns for our shareholders. So I think we are at that inflection point as we get into our next Three-Year Plan. It will be very much focused on taking the very strong fundamentals that we built in the first 3 years.

All of the restructuring and repositioning that we've done delivers a 2-year payback. We're increasing restructuring and repositioning this year by $75 million. That has enabled us to be able to take our net savings for this year that we originally had projected to be $60 million to $70 million to $80 million. And with the work that we've done this year, that's going to take the net savings, the initial plan for 2016 from $30 million to $40 million in savings to $50 million to $60 million in savings. So it is broad base. It's looking at not only simplifying the supply chain on cost of goods and cost of service, but also simplifying infrastructure, simplifying our branch network as well as the simplification of our functional activities across the globe.

With me today are Tyco's Chief Executive Officer, George Oliver; and our Chief Financial Officer, Arun Nayar.
I would like to remind you that during the course of today's call, we will be providing certain forward-looking information. We ask that you look at today's press release and read through the forward-looking cautionary informational statements that we've included there.
In addition, we will use certain non-GAAP measures in our discussions, and we ask that you read through the sections of our press release that address the use of these items. The press release issued this morning and all related tables as well as the conference call slides, which George and Arun will refer to, can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at tyco.com. Please also note that we will be filing our quarterly SEC form 10-Q later today.
In discussing our segment operations, when we refer to changes in backlog and order activity, these figures exclude the impact of foreign currency and divestitures. Additionally, references to operating margins during the call exclude special items, and this metric is a non-GAAP measure and is reconciled in the schedules attached to our press release.
Now let me quickly recap this quarter's results. Revenue in the quarter of $2.5 billion declined 6% year-over-year on a reported basis, driven by a 7% headwind related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. A 1% organic revenue decline was more than offset by the net favorable impact of acquisitions and divestitures. 
Earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Tyco ordinary shareholders was $0.44 and included net charges of $0.15 related to special items. These special items related primarily to restructuring and repositioning charges. Earnings per share from continuing operations before special items was $0.59 compared to our guidance of $0.55 to $0.57 per share.
Now let me turn the call over to George."

Although we were disappointed from an organic growth perspective, we exceeded the high end of our third quarter earnings per share guidance. Our continued focus on productivity and self-help initiatives drove our operating results this quarter. 
As we've started to see the top line soften versus our expectation, the teams are aggressively executing cost actions and accelerated our pipeline of restructuring initiatives, which we expect to benefit the bottom line in 2015 will also carry over into 2016. I am proud of how our teams came together to offset the revenue pressure and exceed our earnings per share commitment. This is a great example of the benefits of an operating company structure, and I am pleased with our solid operational results this quarter.
Turning to Slide 4. I am happy to announce that we have continued to strengthen our leadership team to execute on our long-term growth and marketing commitments. This quarter, we welcomed Girish Rishi to lead our North America Installation & Services segment and Global Retail Solutions business. Most recently, Girish served as Senior Vice President, Enterprise Visibility and Mobility, with Zebra Technologies. Prior to that role, he oversaw product development, product management and engineering for the Enterprise division of Motorola Solutions. 
Girish has deep software and hardware technology expertise that includes delivering solutions through common technology platforms, which is particularly valuable as we seek to build on our strong position in the North America and global retail markets by offering new technology-enabled solutions. He has a strong record of leadership in transformative environments as well as guiding complex business integrations, which are key as we continue to integrate our Fire & Security, Installation & Service businesses in North America.
Additionally, earlier this month, we announced that Johan Pfeiffer has joined Tyco to lead our Rest of World Installation & Services segment. Johan has an exceptional track record of driving growth through innovation in leading in complex environments in both global and regional roles and across varied businesses. 
He has more than 25 years of experience in business and technology leadership roles, including over 20 years with FMC Technologies. Most recently, he served as Vice President leading their global Surface Technologies and Energy Infrastructure businesses. Johan's expertise in the global markets, coupled with his proven leadership, will be a significant asset as we position these businesses for future growth and improved profitability.
Both Girish and Johan will work closely with Brian Young, who you may recall joined us about a year ago from 3M to lead our global commercial sales process. Over the last year, we have made significant strides in streamlining and strengthening our commercial structure. Brian has been diligently increasing and upgrading frontline sales management talent, improving and standardizing sales processes and realigning our sales compensation programs toward accelerated growth. We are seeing the benefits of these actions in our sales force productivity, which has translated into increased orders over the last few quarters. This will continue to be a top area of focus as we move forward.
Turning to Slide 5, let me spend a few minutes on what we are seeing in the macroeconomic environment across the various parts of the globe and how that is impacting our performance.
Starting with North America. The U.S. market continues to trend positively with improved growth in nonresidential construction year-over-year. We continue to see good order activity, particularly in the commercial, retail and institutional verticals. As expected, activity in Canada remains weak as the market is very much tied to the petrochemical oil and gas industry, which is having a significant impact on Western Canada. 
Overall, our North America Install & Service business is performing well. The teams have done a phenomenal job improving operating margins by over 400 basis points since separation. And now with the enhanced commercial structure, the business is well positioned to drive growth. The significant actions we have taken in our North America Install & Service business to improve the efficiency of our operations, along with the nice traction in order activity and backlog, position us well for fiscal 2016.
Moving to Rest of World, let me start with Europe. I would characterize the overall environment as soft. Concerns over the stability of the Eurozone, a continued slowing in the oil and gas industry and pressure from foreign currency exchange rates have all led to a sluggish environment. We are seeing nice activity in the general commercial, retail and manufacturing verticals, while oil and gas and heavy industrial end markets continue to be noticeably soft. 
Despite the top line pressures, margin expansion has been strong in Europe as sourcing, productivity and cost-out initiatives, combined with the benefits of restructuring, are helping to mitigate the lower volume.
In Australia, the downturn in the industrial and mining sectors are continuing to have a significant impact on the economic environment. Much of our business in Australia was built up during the mining boom, which -- during which time it doubled. And then over the last 2 years, it has declined pretty significantly. 
Very similar to last quarter, organic revenue is decreasing in the mid-single-digit range driven by a decline in Service. Operationally, we've been able to offset a good portion of that deleverage, but certainly, it has created margin headwinds.
In the growth markets, we are continuing to see growth in the mid- to upper single-digit range, led by Latin America. Order activity in the growth markets is healthy particularly in the general commercial and retail verticals. 
As expected, our oil and gas businesses, which represent about 5% of our total revenue, continue to be under significant pressure. The impact of lower oil prices has caused a considerable slowdown in new project activity, nonessential maintenance as well as OpEx spend. Our oil and gas businesses were down about 20% on a year-over-year basis in the third quarter, and we expect a similar decline in the fourth quarter. In line with our previous expectations, we continue to expect our oil and gas vertical to be down about 15% for the full year.
Before I pass it over to Arun to discuss our financials in more detail, I wanted to touch on our portfolio and our M&A strategy. As I have said many times, we are constantly looking at the portfolio, reviewing market dynamics and understanding what is going to be required from a technology standpoint to not only maintain our position in the market but also accelerate our growth. We then redeploy our resources appropriately where we believe we can create the most value and get the highest return. As we remix the portfolio, we are focused on acquisitions that enhance our technology offerings, expand our product portfolio, broaden our service in vertical solutions and strengthen our geographic reach. 
In line with that strategy, we recently completed the acquisition of FootFall, a global retail intelligence leader. FootFall provides thousands of retailers and retail property owners with end-to-end technology, services and retail analytics solutions to collect, measure and analyze customer traffic in their stores and property portfolios. This acquisition positions Tyco as a leading provider of traffic intelligent solutions globally and expands a key capability in our portfolio of information-based store performance solutions. 
This enables us to support our retail customers in achieving their core mission by helping them drive revenue, optimize operations and enhance merchandising. We expect this acquisition to generate approximately $40 million in revenue on an annualized basis.
Year-to-date, total capital allocated to acquisitions is approximately $575 million. We continue to work our pipeline of opportunities. There are a few transactions in the midsize range we expect to announce over the next 3 to 6 months, which could total between $200 million and $500 million in purchase price.
Now let me turn it over to Arun to go through the details of our performance."
107534,305385382,844286,"Tyco International Ltd., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 31, 2015",2015-07-31,"Earnings Calls","Tyco International plc","Executives","Thank you, George, and good morning, everyone. You can follow my comments on our financial performance, starting with Slide 7. Let me start with an overview of our results for the third quarter.Revenue of $2.5 billion declined 6% year-over-year on a rep",1533,"Thank you, George, and good morning, everyone. You can follow my comments on our financial performance, starting with Slide 7. Let me start with an overview of our results for the third quarter.
Revenue of $2.5 billion declined 6% year-over-year on a reported basis, including a 7% headwind related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Acquisitions contributed 2 percentage points of revenue growth, which was partially offset by a 1% organic revenue decline and a modest decline related to the impact of a divestiture.
Excluding FX, Service was up 1%, Installation was relatively flat and Global Products grew 4%. The organic revenue decline of 1% was below our expectation of 1% to 2% growth, primarily due to general softness in our Install & Service businesses in Europe and Asia and increased weakness in demand for our heavy industrial higher asset Fire Protection Products.
Before special items, segment operating income was $369 million, and the segment operating margin improved 30 basis points to 14.8%. It's important to keep in mind that the prior year included a 30 basis point lift due to the timing of Air-Pak shipments, and the current year margin includes the absorption of another 30 basis points of noncash purchase accounting for intangibles.
Normalizing for these items, underlying operations improved 90 basis points year-over-year. This year-over-year operating margin expansion was driven by improved execution and the benefits from cost actions, restructuring and productivity initiatives. Underlying operations contributed $0.05, which was partially offset by the $0.02 shift in earnings in the prior year related to the Air-Paks. A $0.05 benefit from the reduced share count was offset by a $0.05 headwind related to FX. Corporate and other income contributed the remaining $0.02.
Overall, earnings per share before special items increased $0.05 or 9% year-over-year. If you normalize for the timing of the Air-Pak shipments in the prior year, earnings per share increased 13%.
Turning to orders on Slide 8. As I've often mentioned in previous quarterly calls, it is important to keep in mind that order growth, particularly in our Installation business, is lumpy, and can be impacted by the timing of large projects. 
Order dollars reached an all-time high in the third quarter. Overall, orders increased 5% year-over-year, with 16% growth in Products, 3% growth in Installation and 1% growth in Service. 
Total backlog of $4.7 billion increased 2% on both year-over-year and quarter-sequential basis. As a reminder, given the seasonality of our business, backlog normally grows sequentially in the first, second and third quarter. We typically see a seasonal decline in backlog in the fourth quarter as a significant amount of electronic fire upgrade work is performed during the summer months. We expect this trend to continue in the fourth quarter of this year as well.
Now let's get into the details of each of the segments. Starting first with North America Installation & Services on Slide 9. Revenue in the quarter of $972 million was relatively flat on a reported basis. Organic revenue grew 1%, with 3% growth in Installation and flat Service revenue. 
FX negatively impacted revenue growth by 1 percentage point. Before special items, operating income in the quarter was $157 million, and the operating margin was 16.2%. The operating margin improved 240 basis points year-over-year, driven by increased revenue, improved execution and the benefits from restructuring cost containment and productivity initiatives.
As George discussed, we have made significant changes in the structure of our North American Install & Service businesses, and we are seeing the benefit of those changes in the margin expansion. As growth gains traction, we expect to see a very nice flow-through to operating income. 
Overall, orders increased 3% year-over-year in North America Install & Services. Service orders increased 1% and Installation orders increased 6% off a 10% increase last year related to several large orders in Fire & Security in both periods. The strong Install order activity this year was driven by the commercial, retail and institutional verticals.
As we look to the fourth quarter, it's important to keep in mind that we have a tough compare in Install order activity as last year's Q4 Install orders increased 18%, driven by several large projects. Total backlog of $2.5 billion grew 4% year-over-year and 2% on a quarter-sequential basis.
Turning to Slide 10, Rest of World Installation & Services. Revenue of $842 million decreased 16% year-over-year, driven by a 13% unfavorable impact related to FX. Organic revenue declined 2%, with 1% decline in Service and 3% decline in Installation revenue. Acquisitions contributed 1% to revenue growth, which was more than offset by a 2 percentage point decline in revenue related to a divestiture. 
As you're aware, we've had our challenges with Rest of World this year, with mining and oil and gas having significant pressure on both the top and bottom line. We are also seeing general softness in Europe and Asia based on the macroeconomic environment. We are making sure that we are staying disciplined, that the projects we take on meet our fundamentals and that we continue to execute on our long-term growth strategy.
Before special items, operating income was $93 million. The operating margin declined 30 basis points year-over-year to 11% as the benefits of productivity and restructuring initiatives were more than offset by the volume deleverage and the mix of geographies contributing to operating income.
Turning to order activity in Rest of World, we saw a nice improvement sequentially in order intake. Year-over-year, total orders increased 1%, with 1% growth in both Service and Installation. Backlog of $1.9 billion was down 1% on a year-over-year basis but increased 1% on a quarter-sequential basis.
Turning to Global Products on Slide 11. Revenue declined 3% in the quarter to $675 million. Organically, revenue declined 3% as nice growth in Security Products was more than offset by a decline in the Life Safety and the Fire Protection Products businesses. Organic growth was impacted by a 5 percentage point headwind from increased shipments of Air-Paks in the prior year. Normalizing for the Air-Paks, organic revenue increased by 2%. A 7% benefit to revenue from acquisitions was fully offset by a 7% decrease to revenue related to FX. 
Before special items, operating income was $119 million. As expected, the operating margin decreased 260 basis points to 17.6%. Productivity initiatives were more than offset by the strength of Air-Pak shipments in the prior year, purchase price accounting for intangibles and the timing of incremental investments in R&D, which in total negatively impacted the operating margin by 330 basis points. Underlying operations improved 70 basis points year-over-year.
Product orders increased 16% year-over-year off a relatively easy compare, and half the growth was attributable to recent acquisitions.
Now let me touch on a few other items on Slide 12. First, corporate expense before special items was $50 million for the quarter, about $5 million lower than we had expected due to the benefit of cost actions. Similar to prior years, we expect corporate expense in the fourth quarter to increase on a sequential basis to approximately $55 million. Given the favorability in corporate expense year-to-date, we now expect corporate expense for the full year to be approximately $210 million.
Next, our effective. Tax rate before the impact of special items was 17.2% for the quarter, and we expect a similar tax rate in the fourth quarter. This would bring our full year tax rate to be approximately 16%, driven by a onetime benefit recorded in the second quarter related to the realization of certain non-U.S. deferred tax assets.
Moving to cash flow. Our profile is typically weighted to the second half of the year. We have made significant progress in the quarter, converting our income to cash, with $230 million in adjusted free cash flow, representing a conversion rate of 92%. We expect a strong Q4 in terms of cash conversion, bringing the full year closer to a 90% conversion rate. As we look ahead to 2016, we fully expect to be back to the 90% to 100% conversion rate. 
Finally, I would like to give an update on our restructuring and repositioning activities. As George mentioned, we've been accelerating restructuring actions and driving strong productivity across the cost base to be well positioned to deliver on our overall EPS commitment. To date, we have incurred $169 million of charges related to restructuring and repositioning actions, and we now expect these charges to be approximately $225 million for the year.
Before I turn it back over to George, let me provide you a quick update on our legacy liabilities. Starting with asbestos. We expect to fund the Yarway Trust in the amount of $325 million in the fourth quarter as we have now received all approvals required for the reorganization plan.
With respect to the tax litigation for the 1997 through 2000 period, a trial in the U.S. Tax Court was originally set to begin in Feb of 2016. The IRS subsequently requested an additional year to prepare for trial, which we objected to, and ultimately agreed to a trial date in October 2016. In the meantime, we continue to explore the possibility of resolution before trial.
Now let me turn things back over to George."

Let's turn now to Slide 13 for our earnings guidance for the fourth quarter and for the full year. We expect revenue in the fourth quarter of approximately $2.5 billion, with negative 1% to flat organic revenue growth. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates are expected to result in a $195 million or 7% headwind to revenue. Net acquisition and divestiture activity is expected to contribute a benefit of 1%.
Taking all of these factors into account, we expect revenue in the fourth quarter to decline approximately 6% year-over-year on a reported basis.
We expect continued solid operational execution with 120 basis points of segment margin expansion year-over-year, including the absorption of a 30 basis point headwind related to noncash purchase accounting and a 40 basis point tailwind related to a legal matter in the prior year.
As a result, we expect earnings per share before special items in the fourth quarter to be in the range of $0.60 to $0.62. This represents a 7% to 11% increase in earnings per share year-over-year compared to last year's fourth quarter earnings of $0.56 per share.
With that, we are tightening our full year guidance range previously provided to $2.23 to $2.25 per share, which represents a 12% to 13% increase year-over-year off a base of $2 per share in fiscal 2014.

And then if I sort of think about the big buckets going to next year, I'm looking at -- I'm still thinking about $0.07 to $0.09 of incremental M&A, $30 million to $40 million of net productivity. You get back $150 million by going to your normalized restructuring, volume leverage on top of that. That all gets me to about $2.35 still in that range, $2.35 to $2.40 or $2.30 to $2.40.

We will be providing formal on guidance for 2016 in November, but let me share a few thoughts. I would start with tailwinds. I think from a volume standpoint, the work that Brian Young has done over the last year, whether we have remixed our sales team, about 20% of our sales team, we've got a new structure, the different incentives, we're starting to get some real traction, and that's supporting the orders growth that you see. I'm confident that we'll continue to see volume improvement going into 2016. The productivity that you mentioned, with the actions that we've taken, the accelerated restructuring this year, we took additional $75 million. That's now going to let us increase the -- what we originally projected to be net savings of $30 million to $40 million. That is looking towards now $50 million to $60 million of net productivity. The acquisitions that we've done this year, as we have discussed, will contribute about $0.07, and then the continued capital allocation during the course of the year will also benefit. As we think about the headwinds, we will see continued pressure from foreign exchange in the early part of the year, and we're estimating right now it could be about $0.05. We will have higher interest expense. And then we'll get a more normalized rate -- tax rate of about 17% to 18%. So what I would say, as we're planning for 2016, we'll see improvement in revenue from 2015, and that's supported with the orders growth that we're seeing. With the significant productivity and cost-out that we achieved in 2015, that positions us well to continue to expand margins in the range that we had forecasted back during our November Investor Day where we could achieve 50 to 70 basis points on an annualized basis over the next 3-year plan. And that will position us to be able to deliver very nice EPS growth in 2016."

And so although we haven't -- a little bit disappointed in our ability to convert revenue during the last 2 quarters, a lot of that is actually impacted by the customer with the other work that's taking place on the customer side. And we don't -- we're not able to claim our revenue until we actually complete our project. So this gives me a lot of confidence with the backlog we've built, with the continued progress we're making within our commercial structure, with the orders performance, that we're going to start to see revenue continue to improve consecutively here as we go through these quarters, as we go through 2016."

If you break down the verticals and if you separate it by security and fire, what I would say in security, we're seeing nice strength in retail, higher education, we've talked a little bit about the commercial space, government, banking as well as telecom. On the fire side, we've seen significant strength in the commercial space, higher education, health care, hospitality as well as the infrastructure. I think what we're also seeing, Scott, is the benefit of the work that Brian Young has done over the last year. The way that we've upgraded our sales team, we've got a remix of about 20%, we've put in a lot of discipline and accountability, we're getting good productivity, and with that, we're now adding resources. So the combination of the market improving, the work we've done on the commercial front end, that has given me confidence that we're going to continue to see similar type of order growth. We'll see backlogs continuing, and that will play out with the conversion cycle that we're seeing. Over the next 12 months, we'll begin to see some very nice revenue growth."

Let me reflect on the first 3 years. The first 3 years, we were very much focused on self-help. With the combination of the businesses came together, we saw a tremendous opportunity to drive cost out, to deliver synergies, and that was going to deliver very strong EPS growth for our shareholders. And over the last year of that 3-year plan, we very much got focused on improving our commercial processes. We've brought in Brian Young, we've done tremendous work there, and we're beginning to see lift with the work that's been done. Now as we thought about the next 3-year plan, it was important that we build the leadership team with the depth and expertise to be able to drive growth, and that's what drove bringing in Girish in North America and Johan for Rest of World. So the way that I look at it, with the investments we're making not only in products but also now in our service offerings, the combination of the 2, with the -- with normal GDP growth, we should be positioned to deliver on our core 1.5 plus times GDP on the core business. But then we're working on new business models, with new technologies, that's now going to be the accelerator of our growth going forward to be able to add on new services that -- services that actually provide very high ROI to our customers, that enable us to not only support the customer delivering more value but in turn being able to deliver very nice returns for our shareholders. So I think we are at that inflection point as we get into our next 3-year plan, it will be very much focused on taking the very strong fundamentals that we've built in the first 3 years and, now with the commercial structure we have in place, being able to leverage those fundamentals in addition to the investments that we're making to be able to deliver on the growth strategy."

The team has done a phenomenal job and has been through not only simplifying the infrastructure we have in North America, streamlining the organization, driving strong productivity, both in gross margins as well as within the G&A structure. All of that has contributed to us to be able to exceed our original thoughts relative to how we can improve margin rates in North America. When you look at third quarter, we were up significantly. Now as we project to roughly 16% or so and as we project fourth quarter, that's going to continue, that we're seeing now sustainability of these margin rates, we're seeing continued opportunity to be able to drive improvement. And as we now position to plan for 2016, the progress that we made here over the last 3 years is going to position us to be able to continue to improve North America to be able to support the 50 to 70 basis points that we're committing to on an annualized basis over the next 3-year plan.

With me today are Tyco's Chief Executive Officer, George Oliver; and our Chief Financial Officer, Arun Nayar.
I would like to remind you that during the course of today's call, we will be providing certain forward-looking information. We ask that you look at today's press release and read through the forward-looking cautionary informational statements that we've included there.
In addition, we will use certain non-GAAP measures in our discussions, and we ask that you read through the sections of our press release that address the use of these items. The press release issued this morning and all related tables as well as the conference call slides, which George and Arun will refer to, can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at tyco.com. Please also note that we will be filing our quarterly SEC form 10-Q later today.
In discussing our segment operations, when we refer to changes in backlog and order activity, these figures exclude the impact of foreign currency and divestitures. Additionally, references to operating margins during the call exclude special items, and this metric is a non-GAAP measure and is reconciled in the schedules attached to our press release.
Now let me quickly recap this quarter's results. Revenue in the quarter of $2.5 billion declined 6% year-over-year on a reported basis, driven by a 7% headwind related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. A 1% organic revenue decline was more than offset by the net favorable impact of acquisitions and divestitures. 
Earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Tyco ordinary shareholders was $0.44 and included net charges of $0.15 related to special items. These special items related primarily to restructuring and repositioning charges. Earnings per share from continuing operations before special items was $0.59 compared to our guidance of $0.55 to $0.57 per share.
Now let me turn the call over to George."

Although we were disappointed from an organic growth perspective, we exceeded the high end of our third quarter earnings per share guidance. Our continued focus on productivity and self-help initiatives drove our operating results this quarter. 
As we've started to see the top line soften versus our expectation, the teams are aggressively executing cost actions and accelerated our pipeline of restructuring initiatives, which we expect to benefit the bottom line in 2015 will also carry over into 2016. I am proud of how our teams came together to offset the revenue pressure and exceed our earnings per share commitment. This is a great example of the benefits of an operating company structure, and I am pleased with our solid operational results this quarter.
Turning to Slide 4. I am happy to announce that we have continued to strengthen our leadership team to execute on our long-term growth and marketing commitments. This quarter, we welcomed Girish Rishi to lead our North America Installation & Services segment and Global Retail Solutions business. Most recently, Girish served as Senior Vice President, Enterprise Visibility and Mobility, with Zebra Technologies. Prior to that role, he oversaw product development, product management and engineering for the Enterprise division of Motorola Solutions. 
Girish has deep software and hardware technology expertise that includes delivering solutions through common technology platforms, which is particularly valuable as we seek to build on our strong position in the North America and global retail markets by offering new technology-enabled solutions. He has a strong record of leadership in transformative environments as well as guiding complex business integrations, which are key as we continue to integrate our Fire & Security, Installation & Service businesses in North America.
Additionally, earlier this month, we announced that Johan Pfeiffer has joined Tyco to lead our Rest of World Installation & Services segment. Johan has an exceptional track record of driving growth through innovation in leading in complex environments in both global and regional roles and across varied businesses. 
He has more than 25 years of experience in business and technology leadership roles, including over 20 years with FMC Technologies. Most recently, he served as Vice President leading their global Surface Technologies and Energy Infrastructure businesses. Johan's expertise in the global markets, coupled with his proven leadership, will be a significant asset as we position these businesses for future growth and improved profitability.
Both Girish and Johan will work closely with Brian Young, who you may recall joined us about a year ago from 3M to lead our global commercial sales process. Over the last year, we have made significant strides in streamlining and strengthening our commercial structure. Brian has been diligently increasing and upgrading frontline sales management talent, improving and standardizing sales processes and realigning our sales compensation programs toward accelerated growth. We are seeing the benefits of these actions in our sales force productivity, which has translated into increased orders over the last few quarters. This will continue to be a top area of focus as we move forward.
Turning to Slide 5, let me spend a few minutes on what we are seeing in the macroeconomic environment across the various parts of the globe and how that is impacting our performance.
Starting with North America. The U.S. market continues to trend positively with improved growth in nonresidential construction year-over-year. We continue to see good order activity, particularly in the commercial, retail and institutional verticals. As expected, activity in Canada remains weak as the market is very much tied to the petrochemical oil and gas industry, which is having a significant impact on Western Canada. 
Overall, our North America Install & Service business is performing well. The teams have done a phenomenal job improving operating margins by over 400 basis points since separation. And now with the enhanced commercial structure, the business is well positioned to drive growth. The significant actions we have taken in our North America Install & Service business to improve the efficiency of our operations, along with the nice traction in order activity and backlog, position us well for fiscal 2016.
Moving to Rest of World, let me start with Europe. I would characterize the overall environment as soft. Concerns over the stability of the Eurozone, a continued slowing in the oil and gas industry and pressure from foreign currency exchange rates have all led to a sluggish environment. We are seeing nice activity in the general commercial, retail and manufacturing verticals, while oil and gas and heavy industrial end markets continue to be noticeably soft. 
Despite the top line pressures, margin expansion has been strong in Europe as sourcing, productivity and cost-out initiatives, combined with the benefits of restructuring, are helping to mitigate the lower volume.
In Australia, the downturn in the industrial and mining sectors are continuing to have a significant impact on the economic environment. Much of our business in Australia was built up during the mining boom, which -- during which time it doubled. And then over the last 2 years, it has declined pretty significantly. 
Very similar to last quarter, organic revenue is decreasing in the mid-single-digit range driven by a decline in Service. Operationally, we've been able to offset a good portion of that deleverage, but certainly, it has created margin headwinds.
In the growth markets, we are continuing to see growth in the mid- to upper single-digit range, led by Latin America. Order activity in the growth markets is healthy particularly in the general commercial and retail verticals. 
As expected, our oil and gas businesses, which represent about 5% of our total revenue, continue to be under significant pressure. The impact of lower oil prices has caused a considerable slowdown in new project activity, nonessential maintenance as well as OpEx spend. Our oil and gas businesses were down about 20% on a year-over-year basis in the third quarter, and we expect a similar decline in the fourth quarter. In line with our previous expectations, we continue to expect our oil and gas vertical to be down about 15% for the full year.
Before I pass it over to Arun to discuss our financials in more detail, I wanted to touch on our portfolio and our M&A strategy. As I have said many times, we are constantly looking at the portfolio, reviewing market dynamics and understanding what is going to be required from a technology standpoint to not only maintain our position in the market but also accelerate our growth. We then redeploy our resources appropriately where we believe we can create the most value and get the highest return. As we remix the portfolio, we are focused on acquisitions that enhance our technology offerings, expand our product portfolio, broaden our service in vertical solutions and strengthen our geographic reach. 
In line with that strategy, we recently completed the acquisition of FootFall, a global retail intelligence leader. FootFall provides thousands of retailers and retail property owners with end-to-end technology, services and retail analytics solutions to collect, measure and analyze customer traffic in their stores and property portfolios. This acquisition positions Tyco as a leading provider of traffic intelligent solutions globally and expands a key capability in our portfolio of information-based store performance solutions. 
This enables us to support our retail customers in achieving their core mission by helping them drive revenue, optimize operations and enhance merchandising. We expect this acquisition to generate approximately $40 million in revenue on an annualized basis.
Year-to-date, total capital allocated to acquisitions is approximately $575 million. We continue to work our pipeline of opportunities. There are a few transactions in the midsize range we expect to announce over the next 3 to 6 months, which could total between $200 million and $500 million in purchase price.
Now let me turn it over to Arun to go through the details of our performance."
107534,305385382,844581,"Tyco International Ltd., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 31, 2015",2015-07-31,"Earnings Calls","Tyco International plc","Executives","Thank you, George, and good morning, everyone. You can follow my comments on our financial performance, starting with Slide 7. Let me start with an overview of our results for the third quarter.Revenue of $2.5 billion declined 6% year-over-year on a rep",1533,"Thank you, George, and good morning, everyone. You can follow my comments on our financial performance, starting with Slide 7. Let me start with an overview of our results for the third quarter.
Revenue of $2.5 billion declined 6% year-over-year on a reported basis, including a 7% headwind related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Acquisitions contributed 2 percentage points of revenue growth, which was partially offset by a 1% organic revenue decline and a modest decline related to the impact of a divestiture.
Excluding FX, Service was up 1%, Installation was relatively flat and Global Products grew 4%. The organic revenue decline of 1% was below our expectation of 1% to 2% growth, primarily due to general softness in our Install & Service businesses in Europe and Asia and increased weakness in demand for our heavy industrial higher asset Fire Protection Products.
Before special items, segment operating income was $369 million, and the segment operating margin improved 30 basis points to 14.8%. It's important to keep in mind that the prior year included a 30 basis point lift due to the timing of Air-Pak shipments, and the current year margin includes the absorption of another 30 basis points of noncash purchase accounting for intangibles.
Normalizing for these items, underlying operations improved 90 basis points year-over-year. This year-over-year operating margin expansion was driven by improved execution and the benefits from cost actions, restructuring and productivity initiatives. Underlying operations contributed $0.05, which was partially offset by the $0.02 shift in earnings in the prior year related to the Air-Paks. A $0.05 benefit from the reduced share count was offset by a $0.05 headwind related to FX. Corporate and other income contributed the remaining $0.02.
Overall, earnings per share before special items increased $0.05 or 9% year-over-year. If you normalize for the timing of the Air-Pak shipments in the prior year, earnings per share increased 13%.
Turning to orders on Slide 8. As I've often mentioned in previous quarterly calls, it is important to keep in mind that order growth, particularly in our Installation business, is lumpy, and can be impacted by the timing of large projects. 
Order dollars reached an all-time high in the third quarter. Overall, orders increased 5% year-over-year, with 16% growth in Products, 3% growth in Installation and 1% growth in Service. 
Total backlog of $4.7 billion increased 2% on both year-over-year and quarter-sequential basis. As a reminder, given the seasonality of our business, backlog normally grows sequentially in the first, second and third quarter. We typically see a seasonal decline in backlog in the fourth quarter as a significant amount of electronic fire upgrade work is performed during the summer months. We expect this trend to continue in the fourth quarter of this year as well.
Now let's get into the details of each of the segments. Starting first with North America Installation & Services on Slide 9. Revenue in the quarter of $972 million was relatively flat on a reported basis. Organic revenue grew 1%, with 3% growth in Installation and flat Service revenue. 
FX negatively impacted revenue growth by 1 percentage point. Before special items, operating income in the quarter was $157 million, and the operating margin was 16.2%. The operating margin improved 240 basis points year-over-year, driven by increased revenue, improved execution and the benefits from restructuring cost containment and productivity initiatives.
As George discussed, we have made significant changes in the structure of our North American Install & Service businesses, and we are seeing the benefit of those changes in the margin expansion. As growth gains traction, we expect to see a very nice flow-through to operating income. 
Overall, orders increased 3% year-over-year in North America Install & Services. Service orders increased 1% and Installation orders increased 6% off a 10% increase last year related to several large orders in Fire & Security in both periods. The strong Install order activity this year was driven by the commercial, retail and institutional verticals.
As we look to the fourth quarter, it's important to keep in mind that we have a tough compare in Install order activity as last year's Q4 Install orders increased 18%, driven by several large projects. Total backlog of $2.5 billion grew 4% year-over-year and 2% on a quarter-sequential basis.
Turning to Slide 10, Rest of World Installation & Services. Revenue of $842 million decreased 16% year-over-year, driven by a 13% unfavorable impact related to FX. Organic revenue declined 2%, with 1% decline in Service and 3% decline in Installation revenue. Acquisitions contributed 1% to revenue growth, which was more than offset by a 2 percentage point decline in revenue related to a divestiture. 
As you're aware, we've had our challenges with Rest of World this year, with mining and oil and gas having significant pressure on both the top and bottom line. We are also seeing general softness in Europe and Asia based on the macroeconomic environment. We are making sure that we are staying disciplined, that the projects we take on meet our fundamentals and that we continue to execute on our long-term growth strategy.
Before special items, operating income was $93 million. The operating margin declined 30 basis points year-over-year to 11% as the benefits of productivity and restructuring initiatives were more than offset by the volume deleverage and the mix of geographies contributing to operating income.
Turning to order activity in Rest of World, we saw a nice improvement sequentially in order intake. Year-over-year, total orders increased 1%, with 1% growth in both Service and Installation. Backlog of $1.9 billion was down 1% on a year-over-year basis but increased 1% on a quarter-sequential basis.
Turning to Global Products on Slide 11. Revenue declined 3% in the quarter to $675 million. Organically, revenue declined 3% as nice growth in Security Products was more than offset by a decline in the Life Safety and the Fire Protection Products businesses. Organic growth was impacted by a 5 percentage point headwind from increased shipments of Air-Paks in the prior year. Normalizing for the Air-Paks, organic revenue increased by 2%. A 7% benefit to revenue from acquisitions was fully offset by a 7% decrease to revenue related to FX. 
Before special items, operating income was $119 million. As expected, the operating margin decreased 260 basis points to 17.6%. Productivity initiatives were more than offset by the strength of Air-Pak shipments in the prior year, purchase price accounting for intangibles and the timing of incremental investments in R&D, which in total negatively impacted the operating margin by 330 basis points. Underlying operations improved 70 basis points year-over-year.
Product orders increased 16% year-over-year off a relatively easy compare, and half the growth was attributable to recent acquisitions.
Now let me touch on a few other items on Slide 12. First, corporate expense before special items was $50 million for the quarter, about $5 million lower than we had expected due to the benefit of cost actions. Similar to prior years, we expect corporate expense in the fourth quarter to increase on a sequential basis to approximately $55 million. Given the favorability in corporate expense year-to-date, we now expect corporate expense for the full year to be approximately $210 million.
Next, our effective tax rate before the impact of special items was 17.2% for the quarter, and we expect a similar tax rate in the fourth quarter. This would bring our full year tax rate to be approximately 16%, driven by a onetime benefit recorded in the second quarter related to the realization of certain non-U.S. deferred tax assets.
Moving to cash flow. Our profile is typically weighted to the second half of the year. We have made significant progress in the quarter, converting our income to cash, with $230 million in adjusted free cash flow, representing a conversion rate of 92%. We expect a strong Q4 in terms of cash conversion, bringing the full year closer to a 90% conversion rate. As we look ahead to 2016, we fully expect to be back to the 90% to 100% conversion rate. 
Finally, I would like to give an update on our restructuring and repositioning activities. As George mentioned, we've been accelerating restructuring actions and driving strong productivity across the cost base to be well positioned to deliver on our overall EPS commitment. To date, we have incurred $169 million of charges related to restructuring and repositioning actions, and we now expect these charges to be approximately $225 million for the year.
Before I turn it back over to George, let me provide you a quick update on our legacy liabilities. Starting with asbestos. We expect to fund the Yarway Trust in the amount of $325 million in the fourth quarter as we have now received all approvals required for the reorganization plan.
With respect to the tax litigation for the 1997 through 2000 period, our trial in the U.S. Tax Court was originally set to begin in Feb. of 2016. The IRS subsequently requested an additional year to prepare for trial, which we objected to, and ultimately agreed to a trial date in October 2016. In the meantime, we continue to explore the possibility of resolution before trial.
Now let me turn things back over to George."

Let's turn now to Slide 13 for our earnings guidance for the fourth quarter and for the full year. We expect revenue in the fourth quarter of approximately $2.5 billion, with negative 1% to flat organic revenue growth. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates are expected to result in a $195 million or 7% headwind to revenue. Net acquisition and divestiture activity is expected to contribute a benefit of 1%.
Taking all of these factors into account, we expect revenue in the fourth quarter to decline approximately 6% year-over-year on a reported basis.
We expect continued solid operational execution with 120 basis points of segment margin expansion year-over-year, including the absorption of a 30 basis point headwind related to noncash purchase accounting and a 40 basis point tailwind related to a legal matter in the prior year.
As a result, we expect earnings per share before special items in the fourth quarter to be in the range of $0.60 to $0.62. This represents a 7% to 11% increase in earnings per share year-over-year compared to last year's fourth quarter earnings of $0.56 per share.
With that, we are tightening our full year guidance range previously provided to $2.23 to $2.25 per share, which represents a 12% to 13% increase year-over-year off a base of $2 per share in fiscal 2014.

And then if I sort of think about the big buckets going to next year, I'm looking at -- I'm still thinking about $0.07 to $0.09 of incremental M&A, $30 million to $40 million of net productivity. You get back $150 million by going to your normalized restructuring, volume leverage on top of that. That all gets me to about $2.35 still in that range, $2.35 to $2.40 or $2.30 to $2.40. How are you guys thinking about that relative to what you've been talking about for the last few months?"

We will be providing formal guidance for 2016 in November, but let me share a few thoughts. I would start with tailwinds. I think, from a volume standpoint, the work that Brian Young has done over the last year, whether we have remixed our sales team, about 20% of our sales team, we've got a new structure, the different incentives, we're starting to get some real traction, and that's supporting the orders growth that you see. I'm confident that we'll continue to see volume improvement going into 2016. 
The productivity that you mentioned, with the actions that we've taken, the accelerated restructuring this year, we took additional $75 million. That's now going to let us increase the -- what we originally projected to be net savings of $30 million to $40 million. That is looking towards now $50 million to $60 million of net productivity. The acquisitions that we've done this year, as we have discussed, will contribute about $0.07, and then the continued capital allocation during the course of the year will also benefit. As we think about the headwinds, we will see continued pressure from foreign exchange in the early part of the year, and we're estimating right now it could be about $0.05. We will have higher interest expense. And then we'll get a more normalized rate -- tax rate of about 17% to 18%. So what I would say, as we're planning for 2016, we'll see improvement in revenue from 2015, and that's supported with the orders growth that we're seeing. With the significant productivity and cost-out that we achieved in 2015, that positions us well to continue to expand margins in the range that we had forecasted back during our November Investor Day where we could achieve 50 to 70 basis points on an annualized basis over the next 3-year plan. And that will position us to be able to deliver very nice EPS growth in 2016."

And so although we haven't -- we're a little bit disappointed in our ability to convert revenue during the last 2 quarters, a lot of that is actually impacted by the customer with the other work that's taking place on the customer site. And we don't -- we're not able to claim our revenue until we actually complete our project. So this gives me a lot of confidence with the backlog we've built, with the continued progress we're making within our commercial structure with the orders performance, that we're going to start to see revenue continue to improve consecutively here as we go through these quarters, as we go through 2016."

If you break down the verticals and if you separate it by security and fire, what I would say in security, we're seeing nice strength in retail, higher education, we've talked a little bit about the commercial space, government, banking as well as telecom. On the fire side, we've seen significant strength in the commercial space, higher education, health care, hospitality as well as infrastructure. 
I think what we're also seeing, Scott, is the benefit of the work that Brian Young has done over the last year. The way that we've upgraded our sales team, we've got a remix of about 20%, we've put in a lot of discipline and accountability, we're getting good productivity, and with that, we're now adding resources. 
So the combination of the market improving, the work we've done on the commercial front end, that has given me confidence that we're going to continue to see similar type of order growth.

Let me reflect on the first 3 years. The first 3 years, we were very much focused on self-help. With the combination of the businesses came together, we saw a tremendous opportunity to drive cost out, to deliver synergies, and that was going to deliver very strong EPS growth for our shareholders. And over the last year of that 3-year plan, we very much got focused on improving our commercial processes. We've brought in Brian Young, we've done tremendous work there in that. We're beginning to see lift with the work that's been done. Now as we thought about the next 3-year plan, it was important that we build the leadership team with the depth and expertise to be able to drive growth, and that's what drove bringing in Girish in North America and Johan for Rest of World. So the way that I look at it, with the investments we're making not only in products but also now in our service offerings, the combination of the 2, with the -- with normal GDP growth, we should be positioned to deliver on our core 1.5-plus times GDP on the core business. 
But then we're working on new business models, with new technologies, that's now going to be the accelerator of our growth going forward to be able to add on new services that -- services that actually provide very high ROI to our customers, that enable us to not only support the customer delivering more value but in turn being able to deliver very nice returns for our shareholders. So I think we are at that inflection point as we get into our next 3-year plan, it will be very much focused on taking the very strong fundamentals that we've built in the first 3 years and, now with the commercial structure we have in place, being able to leverage those fundamentals in addition to the investments that we're making to be able to deliver on the growth strategy."

The team has done a phenomenal job and has been through not only simplifying the infrastructure we have in North America, streamlining the organization, driving strong productivity, both in gross margins as well as within the G&A structure. All of that has contributed to us to be able to exceed our original thoughts relative to how we can improve margin rates in North America. When you look at third quarter, we were up significantly. Now as we project to roughly 16% or so and as we project fourth quarter, that's going to continue, that we're seeing now sustainability of these margin rates, we're seeing continued opportunity to be able to drive improvement. And as we now position to plan for 2016, the progress that we made here over the last 3 years is going to position us to be able to continue to improve North America to be able to support the 50 to 70 basis points that we're committing to on an annualized basis over the next 3-year plan.

And with the focus and discipline that we've had, we're maintaining that. And from a pricing standpoint, we continue to get increased price. We net for the company about 50 basis points or greater of price on an annualized basis. And so specific to North America, I think as we have refocused that business, we're now leveraging technology. We're leveraging all of our depth and expertise to create more value for our customers. And as a result, now we're accelerating our growth with the work that we're doing.

With me today are Tyco's Chief Executive Officer, George Oliver; our",579,"Good morning, and thank you for joining our conference call to discuss Tyco's fourth quarter and full-year results for fiscal year 2015 and the press release issued earlier this morning. With me today are Tyco's Chief Executive Officer, George Oliver; our Chief Financial Officer, Arun Nayar; and Robert Olson, who will be succeeding Arun as CFO following the filing of our Form 10-K which we expect to do later today.
I would like to remind you that during the course of today's call we will be providing certain forward-looking information. We ask that you look at today's press release and read through the forward-looking cautionary informational statements that we've included there.
In addition, we will use certain non-GAAP measures in our discussions, and we ask that you read through the sections of our press release that address the use of these items. The press release issued this morning and all related table as well as the conference call slides, which George and Arun will refer to, can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at tyco.com.
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, we changed the name of our North America Installation & Services and Rest of World Installation & Services segment to North America Integrated Solutions & Services and Rest of World Integrated Solutions & Services to better reflect our focus on providing technology-enabled solutions that are tailored to our customers' needs. There was no change in the underlying segment structure and no impact to previously disclosed segment information.
In discussing our segment operations, when we refer to changes in backlog and order activity, these figures exclude the impact of foreign currency and divestitures. Additionally, references to operating margins during the call exclude special items, and this metric is a non-GAAP measure and it reconciles in the schedules attached to our press release.
Also, I would like to remind everyone that beginning in fiscal 2016, we will be including restructuring and repositioning within our reported earnings per share before special items. As we are now 3 years out from the separation, we have completed the bulk of the restructuring and repositioning actions related to that transaction. Our view of a normal run rate for these charges is approximately $75 million on an annual basis. Given the current economic environment, our guidance for fiscal 2016 includes a range of $75 million to $100 million or $0.14 to $0.19 of restructuring and repositioning charges. These charges will be shown as a separate line item below segment operating income to allow greater visibility to the underlying segment results. We have recast the quarters of fiscal 2015 to include restructuring and repositioning charges as well as the related tax impact in the appendix to the slides.
Now let me quickly recap this quarter's results. Revenue in the quarter of $2.5 billion declined 7% year-over-year on a reported basis, driven by a 7% headwind from changes in foreign currency. The favorable impact of net acquisition and divestiture activity was offset by a 1% organic revenue decline. 
Earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Tyco ordinary shareholders was $0.19 and included net charges of $0.42 related to special items. These special items related primarily to restructuring and repositioning charges as well as the charge for the early retirement of debt. Earnings per share from continuing operations before special items was $0.61 compared to our guidance of $0.60 to $0.62 per share.
Now let me turn the call over to George."

This was a solid quarter of operational execution.

Ove",1397,"Thanks, Antonella, and good morning, everyone. This was a solid quarter of operational execution. Our continued focus on productivity and self-help initiatives across all of the businesses and global functions drove our operating results this quarter. Overall, fiscal 2015 was a challenging year. Macro headwinds coupled with the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar has put significant pressure on our results this year. Our team stepped up to the challenge and aggressively executed cost actions and accelerated our pipeline of restructuring initiatives to help mitigate the pressure and drive strong earnings growth both for the fourth quarter and for the year. I am very proud of how our teams came together and thank them for their leadership.
Starting on Slide 4, let me spend a few minutes on what we are seeing in the macro economic environment and our expectations for fiscal 2016. Overall, the global industrial economy has come under increased pressure over the last few months. Although pockets of strength exist in certain verticals, many markets directly or indirectly exposed to commodity-linked resources continue to beef sluggish.
Starting with North America, the U.S. market remains a relative bright spot with continued growth in nonresidential construction year-over-year. We continue to see increased activity over prior year levels with strength in the commercial, retail and institutional verticals. As expected, Western Canada remains weak as the market is very much tied to the petrochemical oil and gas industry. Overall, our North America Integrated Solutions & Services business performed very well in the quarter. Organic growth accelerated to 2%, and the operating margin continue to expand. When I reflect back on the last 3 years, this business has been through significant changes. Although the top line has remained relatively flat on an organic basis, the operating margin before special items improved by 480 basis points to an annual rate of 15.3% and operating income increased 43% over this period. This far exceeded the expectations set 3 years ago to achieve an operating margin of 13% to 14%. Even more importantly, our work is not done. We are investing in the business while continuing to improve the efficiency of our operations.
Moving to Rest of World, let me start with Europe. In general, the environment remains sluggish. GDP estimates continue to be revised downward due to economic uncertainty. Overall, our European businesses have executed well despite softness in the top line. Our operating margins have been improving as the teams are executing productivity initiatives to reduce our cost structure and drive operational efficiencies. With that being said, we anticipate relatively flat revenue growth in Europe in 2016 on a year-over-year basis.
In Australia, the industrial and mining sector downturn continues to damp an overall industrial activity in the region. This macroenvironment has persisted throughout 2015, and we are planning for a similar environment in 2016.
In the growth markets, we continue to see growth in the mid-single digit range and expect this to continue in fiscal 2016.
Despite the economic conditions in Latin America, our business, which represents approximately 5% of sales, had solid performance with about 10% organic growth for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2015.
Given the impact the oil and gas vertical has had on our results this year, I'd like to take a minute to update you on our performance during the quarter and for the full year.
In aggregate, our oil and gas businesses were down about 20% on a year-over-year basis in the fourth quarter and down 15% on a full-year basis, both in line with our previous expectations. Despite representing only about 5% of sales, the mix impact associated with the decline in this vertical created a $0.06 EPS headwind in fiscal 2015.
As we continue to the next phase of our journey, we remain intently focused on disciplined growth and continuous operational improvement. Disciplined growth is focused on ensuring that we provide products and services that our customers value and are willing to pay a premium for, whether it's the products we sell through our distribution channels or the technology embedded in our Integrated Solutions & Services that are delivered by our direct channel. We are a leader in many of the markets we serve as the combination of our brands, technology and reliability make us a premium player in the Fire & Security industry. Innovation is at the heart of everything we do. We live in a world where sensors and devices are gathering increased volumes of data, which creates opportunities for improved analytics that help our clients improve operations, keep customer safe, safeguard their facilities and comply with codes and standards. We no longer consider our total addressable market to be limited to the Fire & Security industry when developing new products and services. We are now looking at the total customer problem and how our resources, our devices and our factories in the field can help create solutions to solve these problems.
Every customer process, every customer building, every customer business needs data for continuous improvement. The right real-time data leads to the operational insights customers need to optimize performance. For example, the combination of our store performance solutions with our creative systems and FootFall acquisitions provides a full view of inventory, traffic and other analytics to fundamentally change the retailers' operations. Retailers can plan better around store hours, figure out when to restock their stores, lead customers directly to inventory on the shelves and upsell them more effectively when they choose to try on close.
The combination of our investments along with the changes made to the sales team to better align to our strategy has resulted in a mid-single-digit increase in our retail business in fiscal 2015. Although this is only a piece of our portfolio, it lays the path of what can be done across the enterprise. This requires making the right decisions around resource allocation as well as making smart investments in R&D and sales and marketing.
Over the past 3 years, we've been focused on streamlining operations. While we will continue doing so, we are shifting to driving commercial excellence across the portfolio. We are making incremental investments in 2016 to drive productivity within our sales force. We have just initiated a global program to create a commercial ecosystem using salesforce.com to align all Tyco employees around the customer and drive a superior customer experience.
The program is called E3, which stands for everyone sells, everyone serves, everyone helps. E3 will allow 30,000 customer-facing team members to collaborate around a 360-degree view of our customers and for our customers to have a more seamless experience with Tyco. E3 is being rolled out in phases over the next 2 years, it will be the foundation for commercial excellence.
Shifting to continuous improvement. The combination of our productivity initiatives along with the additional restructuring actions taken in fiscal 2015 position us to increase our expected growth savings to approximately $180 million to $210 million in 2016. These savings are expected to be somewhat offset by wage inflation costs of approximately $60 million. Additionally, we expect to increase our incremental investments for R&D and sales and marketing initiatives to a range of $70 million to $90 million. As the incremental gross savings will fund these increased investments, we still expect to deliver a $50 million to $60 million benefit to the bottom line.
We will continue to supplement these internal growth initiatives with strategic acquisitions. During fiscal 2015, we committed about $575 million of capital for acquisitions, which we expect to yield approximately $300 million of revenue on an annualized basis.
We continue to actively work a strong pipeline of M&A opportunities with a few transactions in the near term, which can total between $200 million and $500 million in purchase price.
In addition to acquisitions, we continue to review the portfolio. We recently made a decision to divest a business which manufactures piping components within our Global Products segment. This business generated approximately $45 million in revenue in fiscal 2015.
Additionally, share repurchase remains an important component of our capital allocation strategy. We currently have a $1 billion authorization in place. Our current plan is to offset dilution at a minimum and potentially repurchase additional shares if cash builds up on the balance sheet and there is no acquisition activity.
Now let me turn it over to Arun to go through the details of our performance."

Beginning with our full-year results, revenue of $9.9 billion grew 1% organically. The net impact of acquisitions and divestitures added an additional point to revenue growth, which more than offset -- which was more than offset by a 6% headwind from changes in foreign currency for an overall revenue decline of 4%.
In total, segment operating margin before special items expanded 50 basis points to 14.4%. The margin expansion was led by North America Integrated Solutions & Services, which expanded margins by 200 basis points, helping to offset the margin pressure in Rest of World and Global Products.
Earnings per share before special items increased 12% in 2015, led by strong operations, including aggressive cost actions which, together, contributed $0.17 of incremental earnings year-over-year despite a tougher-than-expected macroenvironment.
Now focusing on the quarter, please turn to Slide 8. Revenue of $2.5 billion declined 7% year-over-year on a reported basis, including a 7% headwind from changes in foreign currency. In line with our expectation, organic revenue declined 1%. Acquisitions contributed 2 percentage points of revenue growth, which was partially offset by a 1% decline related to the impact of a divestiture. 
Excluding FX, service was up 2%, integrated solutions declined 3% and Global Products grew 5%. Before special items, segment operating income was $394 million, and the segment operating margin improved 150 basis points to 15.7%. The year-over-year operating margin expansion was driven by improved execution and the benefits from cost actions, restructuring and productivity initiatives. Overall, earnings per share before special items increased 9% year-over-year.
Turning to orders on Slide 9. As I've mentioned in previous quarterly calls, it is important to keep in mind that order growth, particularly in our integrated solutions business is lumpy and can be impacted by the timing of large projects. Overall, orders increased 3% year-over-year, with 10% growth in products, 2% growth in service and a 1% decline in integrated solutions. Total backlog of $4.6 billion increased 3% on a year-over-year basis and was flat on a quarter sequential basis.
Now let's get into the details of each of the segments, starting first with North America Integrated Solutions & Services on Slide 10. Revenue in the quarter of $1 billion was flat on a reported basis. Organic revenue growth of 2% was fully offset by the negative impact of the weaker Canadian dollar. We saw nice growth in service revenue, which increased close to 3% organically in the quarter. Additionally, integrated solutions grew 1% organically.
Before special items, operating income in the quarter was $180 million and the operating margin was 17.8%. The operating margin improved 460 basis points year-over-year. The prior year included a $10 million legal charge, which resulted in a 100 basis point tailwind to the year-over-year operating margin expansion. Additionally, the current year benefited from discreet items, which favorably impacted the operating margin by approximately 120 basis points. Underlying margin expansion of 240 basis points was driven by increased revenue, improved execution and the benefits from restructuring and productivity initiatives.
As George mentioned, we have made significant changes in our North American Integrated Solutions & Services business, and we are seeing the benefits of those changes in the margin expansion.
As I've discussed on last quarter's call, orders in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 benefited from several large orders, resulting in a difficult compare in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. As expected, overall orders decreased 4% year-over-year in North America Integrated Solutions & Services. Service orders increased 3%, and Integrated Solutions orders decreased 11% off an 18% increase last  year. Order activity this year was driven by the commercial retail and government verticals.
As we look to the first quarter, it's important to keep in mind that we have another tough compare in order activity as last year's Q1 Integrated Solutions orders increased 13%, driven by several large projects.
Total backlog of $2.5 billion increased 2% year-over-year and, in line with normal seasonality, declined 1% on a quarter sequential basis.
Turning to Slide 11. Rest of World Integrated Solutions & Services revenue of $827 million decreased 18% year-over-year driven by a 13% unfavorable impact from FX. Organic revenue declined 3%, driven by a 7% decline in integrated solutions, partly due to a tough compare of 7% growth in the prior year as well as pressure in the U.K. and the Asia Pacific regions mainly from the oil and gas vertical. Acquisitions contributed 2% to revenue growth, which was more than offset by the impact of a divestiture.
Before special items, operating income was $90 million. The segment operating margin declined 90 basis points year-over-year to 10.9% as the benefits of productivity and restructuring initiatives were more than offset by the volume deleverage and the mix of geographies contributing to operating income.
Turning to order activity in Rest of World, we saw a nice improvement in order intake. Year-over-year, total orders increased 6%, with 1% growth in service and an 11% increase in integrated solutions, which included several large orders in Latin America and Asia. 
Backlog of $1.9 billion grew 4% on a year-over-year basis and 2% on a quarter sequential basis.
Turning to Global Products on Slide 12. Revenue declined 2% on both a reported and organic basis to $666 million. A 7% benefit to revenue from acquisitions was fully offset by a 7% decrease to revenue from FX. The organic revenue decline resulted from a slowdown in of the U.S. Fire market as well as significant decrease in demand in the Middle East related to the oil and gas vertical, each of which negatively impacted our Life Safety business.
Before special items, operating income was $124 million and the operating margin declined 60 basis points to 18.6%. Productivity initiatives were more than offset by volume deleverage and mix as well as an 80 basis point impact from noncash purchase accounting. Product orders increased 10% year-over-year, primarily due to recent acquisitions.
Now let me touch on a few other items on Slide 13. First, corporate expense before special items was $45 million for the quarter. This is about $10 million lower than we had expected and was offset by a $10 million increase in other expense. Corporate expense for the full year was $201 million. Looking ahead to fiscal 2016, we expect corporate expense to be in the range of $205 million to $215 million.
Next. Our effective tax rate before the impact of special items was 17.4% for the quarter and 16% for the year, driven by a onetime benefit recorded in the second quarter related to the realization of certain non-U.S. deferred tax assets. As we look forward to fiscal 2016, we expect the tax rate before special items to be in the range of 17% to 18%.
Moving to cash flow. We had a strong conversion quarter with adjusted free cash flow of $339 million, representing 130% conversion rate. We have made significant progress in the last 6 months converting our income to cash. However, the weaker-than-normal conversion in the first half of the year takes our full-year adjusted free cash flow of $761 million to a conversion rate of 80%. As we look ahead to 2016, we fully expect to be back to the 90% to 100% conversion rate for adjusted free cash flow.
Moving to restructuring and repositioning activities. We incurred charges of $120 million for the quarter and $289 million for the year, of which $176 million related to restructuring actions. These actions, primarily related to severance and other employee-related charges, with an expected payback within 2 years. These and past restructuring and repositioning actions, along with our strong productivity initiatives, have offset the weaker macroenvironment and have been a strong contributor to our double-digit EPS growth this year.
As Antonella mentioned, beginning in 2016, our EPS before special items will include restructuring and repositioning charges. Our expectation for restructuring and repositioning charges for 2016 based on our current outlook is $75 million to $100 million, with approximately $20 million expected to be included in our first quarter results.
Before I turn it back over to George, let me provide you a quick update on our recent debt refinancing, which is detailed on Slide 14. In September, we took advantage of the low interest rate environment and raised $1.5 billion of debt. Half was issued with a 10-year term and at an annual interest rate of 3.9%. And the other half has a 30-year term at an annual rate of 5.125%. All the proceeds were used to redeem several tranches of higher interest rate debt, made whole payments for the early redemption and repaid debt that matured in October 2015.
During the course of the year, and including the recent debt refinancing, we increased our long-term debt by $700 million to $2.2 billion, with a weighted average interest rate of 3.7%. Despite a higher debt balance, we expect to reduce net interest expense in 2016 to approximately $80 million. Additionally, we expanded the capacity under our credit facility from $1 billion to $1.5 billion and extended the term 5 years out through 2020.
Now let me turn things back over to George."
107534,315311905,903162,"Tyco International plc, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Nov 13, 2015",2015-11-13,"Earnings Calls","Tyco International plc","Executives","Thanks, Arun. Let's turn now to Slide 15 for our earnings guidance for fiscal 2016.Let me begin by noting that the uncertainty created by the macro economic environment, particularly in our international markets, has resulted in a more cautious outlook",933,"Thanks, Arun. Let's turn now to Slide 15 for our earnings guidance for fiscal 2016.
Let me begin by noting that the uncertainty created by the macro economic environment, particularly in our international markets, has resulted in a more cautious outlook for 2016. Additionally, the headwind created by lower oil prices has kept pressure on customer CapEx budgets and OpEx spend, including continued deferral of discretionary maintenance. Based on the timing of the decline in our results in 2015, which began at the tail end of our fiscal second quarter, we expect our fiscal 2016 results to reflect low double-digit declines in our oil and gas vertical on a year-over-year basis. Although underlying activity may still be subdued throughout fiscal 2016, our year-over-year comparisons ease significantly in the back half. 
With that in mind, let's get into the details of our fiscal 2016 guidance. We expect total revenue to be in the range of $9.65 billion to $9.85 billion, with organic revenue growth being flat to up 2% year-over-year.
We expect to start the year with an organic revenue decline, given the compares with fiscal 2015, but we expect to see the growth rate pick up, particularly in the second half of the year.
Included in our full-year revenue guidance is a $310 million or 3% headwind related to FX and the net benefit of recent acquisitions and divestitures of approximately $30 million.
The overall segment margin before special items for 2016 is expected to expand 50 to 80 basis points year-over-year. As Arun mentioned, our EPS before special items guidance for fiscal 2016 includes a range of $75 million to $100 million for restructuring and repositioning charges. Based on these items and the specific guidance Arun provided for corporate expense and below-the-line items, we expect earnings per share from continuing operations before special items for the full year to be in the range of $2.05 to $2.20 based on a weighted average share count of 427 million shares. This compares to fiscal 2015 EPS before special items of $1.74, which has been recast to include restructuring and repositioning charges of $289 million.
Historically, our EPS before special items has been stronger in the second half of the year due to the seasonality of our businesses. We expect this to continue in 2016. However, given the oil and gas and FX comps we are facing in the first half, we expect our earnings to be a bit more skewed to the second half in fiscal 2016.
Now let's shift to our guidance for the first quarter. Based on the factors just outlined, we expect that the first quarter will be our most difficult comparison of the year from both a reported and organic revenue standpoint as well as a segment margin perspective.
Turning to Slide 16, our first quarter fiscal 2015 recast EPS before special items was $0.38. Let me walk you to our year-over-year earnings growth. First, the prior year included $75 million of restructuring and repositioning charges, which, when tax affected, equates to $0.11 of EPS versus our expectation of $20 million of charges or $0.04 of EPS in the first quarter of 2016. Year-over-year, this results in a tailwind of $0.07.
Next, the first quarter of last year do not reflect any negative impact in our oil and gas vertical. We expect this will be a $0.02 headwind year-over-year. 
Third, the U.S. dollar continued to strengthen throughout fiscal 2015, resulting in an FX headwind of $0.03 year-over-year in the first quarter. Additionally, a decline in volume and unfavorable mix is expected to be a $0.03 headwind year-over-year, which will be fully offset by the net savings in the quarter. Overall, we expect earnings per share from continuing operations before special items of approximately $0.40 in the first quarter of 2016.
Before the operator opens up the line for questions, I want to take a few minutes to thank Arun for his hard work and dedication over the last 8 years at Tyco. Arun has lead us through the separation and has been our Chief Financial Officer since 2012. Arun was integral in launching the new Tyco and taking us through many acquisitions, divestitures and capital market transactions all while leading the transformation of our finance function. Arun and I have worked closely together over the last 3 years, and I want to take this opportunity, with our shareholders and analysts, to say thank you. Thank you, Arun, for your commitment, candor and leadership, and I wish you all the best as you retire at the end of the year.
As many of you are aware, Arun is 65, and we have been planning a transition over the last year. While we will all miss Arun, I am happy to welcome Robert Olson, who will be succeeding Arun as our Chief Financial Officer. Previously, Robert was CFO of Dish Network, a provider of satellite video services and technology, where he served as the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer for 5 years. Robert also has vast experience in the commercial space, which he gained during this his time as Chief Financial Officer of Terrain Commercial Systems, the largest operating division of American Standard from 2006 to 2008. I am pleased to welcome such an accomplished financial executive to our senior leadership team. Rob's experience as a Chief Financial Officer, combined with his broad experience in service-oriented technology companies, will be especially valuable as we grow our services and solutions businesses.
Thanks for joining us on the conference call this morning. And with that, operator, please open the lines for questions."

As we went through a difficult 2015, we also recognized that we needed to free up additional resources to then put to work on the growth side of the company. And so as we accelerated the restructuring and repositioning, we were planning on now taking those strong fundamentals that we've delivered in the first 3 years and now leveraging those to a greater degree in the top line. Now let me give you an example. In retail, we've been working on retail, investing on the front end of our business while we've been accelerating the investments in technology and new solutions within our strong performance solutions. And with that effort, in 2015, we saw a nice mid single-digit improvement in our retail orders, and that's playing through now. We've taken that same approach now across the enterprise. And with the incremental roughly $30 million, $35 million that we put to work in 2016, that gives us complete confidence that with the same discipline that we went about driving operational improvement, we are putting to work on the commercial side of our business and believe that with that we'll be positioned very well to be able to create order growth, which will translate to accelerated revenue growth over the next couple of years."

As we look at the current environment being somewhat more challenged, I believe going forward we're going to be positioned to continue the work that we've done from an operational standpoint that has been able to support the reinvestment that's going to give us confidence that from a top line standpoint we're going to be positioned to accelerate. We made great progress within our commercial excellence initiatives. And the most recent change with the step-up of the reinvestment is taking the confidence that we achieved during 2015 at the retail vertical and accelerating that across of the portfolio. And I can tell you, based on the E3 initiatives, getting additional productivity, longer term through our sales force and then with the continued investment in expanding our footprint and our total capability and then that's supported with the new products and new services, especially some of the enterprise software that we are launching, gives me a lot of confidence that we're going to be able to accelerate orders growth during 2016, and that will translate into increased revenue growth over the next couple of years."

And what I would say there is we did have a couple of soft spots, mainly additional softness in the heavy industrial space similar to what we've seen in oil and gas as well as, as I said earlier, in our Fire services, a little bit of a slowdown in the orders that we saw within that segment. Now when you look at our I&S businesses, we see continued activity across all of our end markets that we serve in North America. It's mainly driven by the commercial and market as well as some key institutional end markets like higher ed, government seems to be coming back, retail is strong. So in our Fire business, healthcare. So we're seeing pretty good activity. And from a service standpoint, we actually had very strong service growth in North America in the fourth quarter and now some of that was from recovery. But overall, very strong performance. But and then if you go to the Rest of World, in line with what we expected with oil and gas and some of the heavy industrial verticals, we've seen now that impact. And that was pretty much in line with what we expected. So my assessment would be that the overall environment is similar. It's playing out as we had expected. When I look at order activity so far in the first quarter, it's in line with what we had in the fourth quarter. Certainly, we have a couple of compare issues year-on-year. But I am confident with the investment that we are making in how we are expanding our capabilities, our footprint and we are enhancing the ability of our front and to be able to get closer to the customer and ultimately execute on the growth that we're going to see continued positive trends here during the course of 2016."

With me today are Tyco's Chief Executive Officer, George Oliver; our Chief Financial Officer, Arun Nayar; and Robert Olson, who will be succeeding Arun as CFO following the filing of our Form 10-K, which we expect to do later today.
I would like to remind you that during the course of today's call, we will be providing certain forward-looking information. We ask that you look at today's press release and read through the forward-looking cautionary informational statements that we've included there.
In addition, we will use certain non-GAAP measures in our discussions, and we ask that you read through the sections of our press release that address the use of these items. The press release issued this morning and all related tables as well as the conference call slides, which George and Arun will refer to, can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at tyco.com.
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, we changed the name of our North America Installation & Services and Rest of World Installation & Services segments to North America Integrated Solutions & Services and Rest of World Integrated Solutions & Services to better reflect our focus on providing technology-enabled solutions that are tailored to our customers' needs. There was no change in the underlying segment structure and no impact to previously disclosed segment information.
In discussing our segment operations, when we refer to changes in backlog and order activity, these figures exclude the impact of foreign currency and divestitures. Additionally, references to operating margins during the call exclude special items, and this metric is a non-GAAP measure and is reconciled in the schedules attached to our press release.
Also, I would like to remind everyone that beginning in fiscal 2016, we will be including restructuring and repositioning within our reported earnings per share before special items. As we are now 3 years out from the separation, we have completed the bulk of the restructuring and repositioning actions related to that transaction. Our view of a normal run rate for these charges is approximately $75 million on an annual basis. Given the current economic environment, our guidance for 2016 includes a range of $75 million to $100 million or $0.14 to $0.19 of restructuring and repositioning charges. These charges will be shown as a separate line item below segment operating income to allow greater visibility to the underlying segment results. We have recast the quarters of fiscal 2015 to include restructuring and repositioning charges as well as the related tax impact in the appendix to the slides.
Now let me quickly recap this quarter's results. Revenue in the quarter of $2.5 billion declined 7% year-over-year on a reported basis, driven by a 7% headwind from changes in foreign currency. The favorable impact of net acquisition and divestiture activity was offset by a 1% organic revenue decline. 
Earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Tyco ordinary shareholders was $0.19 and included net charges of $0.42 related to special items. These special items related primarily to restructuring and repositioning charges as well as the charge for the early retirement of debt. Earnings per share from continuing operations before special items was $0.61 compared to our guidance of $0.60 to $0.62 per share.
Now let me turn the call over to George."

This was a solid quarter of operational execution. Our continued focus on productivity and self-help initiatives across all of the businesses and global functions drove our operating results this quarter. Ove",1399,"Thanks, Antonella, and good morning, everyone. This was a solid quarter of operational execution. Our continued focus on productivity and self-help initiatives across all of the businesses and global functions drove our operating results this quarter. Overall, fiscal 2015 was a challenging year. Macro headwinds, coupled with the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar, has put significant pressure on our results this year. Our team stepped up to the challenge and aggressively executed cost actions and accelerated our pipeline of restructuring initiatives to help mitigate the pressure and drive strong earnings growth, both for the fourth quarter and for the year. I am very proud of how our teams came together and thank them for their leadership.
Starting on Slide 4. Let me spend a few minutes on what we are seeing in the macro economic environment and our expectations for fiscal 2016. Overall, the global industrial economy has come under increased pressure over the last few months. Although pockets of strength exist in certain verticals, many markets directly or indirectly exposed to commodity-linked resources continue to be sluggish.
Starting with North America. The U.S. market remains a relative bright spot with continued growth in nonresidential construction year-over-year. We continue to see increased activity over prior year levels with strength in the commercial, retail and institutional verticals. As expected, Western Canada remains weak as the market is very much tied to the petrochemical oil and gas industry. 
Overall, our North America Integrated Solutions & Services business performed very well in the quarter. Organic growth accelerated to 2%, and the operating margin continue to expand. When I reflect back on the last 3 years, this business has been through significant changes. Although the top line has remained relatively flat on an organic basis, the operating margin before special items improved by 480 basis points to an annual rate of 15.3%, and operating income increased 43% over this period. This far exceeded the expectations set 3 years ago to achieve an operating margin of 14 -- 13% to 14%. Even more importantly, our work is not done. We are investing in the business while continuing to improve the efficiency of our operations.
Moving to Rest of World. Let me start with Europe. In general, the environment remains sluggish. GDP estimates continue to be revised downward due to economic uncertainty. Overall, our European businesses have executed well despite softness in the top line. Our operating margins have been improving as the teams are executing productivity initiatives to reduce our cost structure and drive operational efficiencies. With that being said, we anticipate relatively flat revenue growth in Europe in 2016 on a year-over-year basis.
In Australia, the industrial and mining sector downturn continues to dampen overall industrial activity in the region. This macro environment has persisted throughout 2015, and we are planning for a similar environment in 2016.
In the growth markets, we continue to see growth in the mid-single-digit range and expect this to continue in fiscal 2016. Despite the economic conditions in Latin America, our business, which represents approximately 5% of sales, had solid performance with about 10% organic growth for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2015.
Given the impact the oil and gas vertical has had on our results this year, I'd like to take a minute to update you on our performance during the quarter and for the full year. In aggregate, our oil and gas businesses were down about 20% on a year-over-year basis in the fourth quarter and down 15% on a full year basis, both in line with our previous expectations. Despite representing only about 5% of sales, the mix impact associated with the decline in this vertical created a $0.06 EPS headwind in fiscal 2015.
As we continue to the next phase of our journey, we remain intently focused on disciplined growth and continuous operational improvement. Disciplined growth is focused on ensuring that we provide products and services that our customers value and are willing to pay a premium for, whether it's the products we sell through our distribution channels or the technology embedded in our integrated solutions and services that are delivered by our direct channel. We are a leader in many of the markets we serve as the combination of our brands, technology and reliability make us a premium player in the fire and security industry. Innovation is at the heart of everything we do. We live in a world where sensors and devices are gathering increased volumes of data, which creates opportunities for improved analytics that help our clients improve operations, keep customers safe, safeguard their facilities and comply with codes and standards. We no longer consider our total addressable market to be limited to the fire and security industry when developing new products and services. We are now looking at the total customer problem and how our resources, our devices and our factories in the field can help create solutions to solve these problems.
Every customer process, every customer building, every customer business needs data for continuous improvement. The right real-time data leads to the operational insights customers need to optimize performance. For example, the combination of our store performance solutions with our creative systems and FootFall acquisitions provides a full view of inventory, traffic and other analytics to fundamentally change the retailer's operations. Retailers can plan better around store hours, figure out when to restock their stores, lead customers directly to inventory on the shelves and up-sell them more effectively when they choose to try on clothes. 
The combination of our investments, along with the changes made to the sales team to better align to our strategy, has resulted in a mid-single-digit increase in our retail business in fiscal 2015. Although this is only a piece of our portfolio, it lays the path of what can be done across the enterprise. This requires making the right decisions around resource allocation as well as making smart investments in R&D and sales and marketing.
Over the past 3 years, we've been focused on streamlining operations. While we will continue doing so, we are shifting to driving commercial excellence across the portfolio. We are making incremental investments in 2016 to drive productivity within our sales force. We have just initiated a global program to create a commercial ecosystem using salesforce.com to align all Tyco employees around the customer and drive a superior customer experience. The program is called E3, which stands for everyone sells, everyone serves, everyone helps. E3 will allow 30,000 customer-facing team members to collaborate around a 360-degree view of our customers and for our customers to have a more seamless experience with Tyco. E3 is being rolled out in phases over the next 2 years. It will be the foundation for commercial excellence.
Shifting to continuous improvement. The combination of our productivity initiatives, along with the additional restructuring actions taken in fiscal 2015, position us to increase our expected growth savings to approximately $180 million to $210 million in 2016. These savings are expected to be somewhat offset by wage inflation costs of approximately $60 million. Additionally, we expect to increase our incremental investments for R&D and sales and marketing initiatives to a range of $70 million to $90 million. As the incremental gross savings will fund these increased investments, we still expect to deliver a $50 million to $60 million benefit to the bottom line. 
We will continue to supplement these internal growth initiatives with strategic acquisitions. During fiscal 2015, we committed about $575 million of capital for acquisitions, which we expect to yield approximately $300 million of revenue on an annualized basis. We continue to actively work a strong pipeline of M&A opportunities with a few transactions in the near term, which could total between $200 million and $500 million in purchase price.
In addition to acquisitions, we continue to review the portfolio. We recently made a decision to divest a business, which manufactures piping components within our Global Products segment. This business generated approximately $45 million in revenue in fiscal 2015.
Additionally, share repurchase remains an important component of our capital allocation strategy. We currently have a $1 billion authorization in place. Our current plan is to offset dilution at a minimum and potentially repurchase additional shares if cash builds up on the balance sheet and there is no acquisition activity.
Now let me turn it over to Arun to go through the details of our performance."

Beginning with our full year results, revenue of $9.9 billion grew 1% organically. The net impact of acquisitions and divestitures added an additional point to revenue growth, which more than offset -- which was more than offset by a 6% headwind from changes in foreign currency for an overall revenue decline of 4%.
In total, segment operating margin before special items expanded 50 basis points to 14.4%. The margin expansion was led by North America Integrated Solutions & Services, which expanded margins by 200 basis points, helping to offset the margin pressure in Rest of World and Global Products.
Earnings per share before special items increased 12% in 2015, led by strong operations, including aggressive cost actions, which, together, contributed $0.17 of incremental earnings year-over-year despite a tougher-than-expected macro environment.
Now focusing on the quarter, please turn to Slide 8. Revenue of $2.5 billion declined 7% year-over-year on a reported basis, including a 7% headwind from changes in foreign currency. In line with our expectation, organic revenue declined 1%. Acquisitions contributed 2 percentage points of revenue growth, which was partially offset by a 1% decline related to the impact of a divestiture. 
Excluding FX, service was up 3%, integrated solutions declined 3% and Global Products grew 5%. Before special items, segment operating income was $394 million, and the segment operating margin improved 150 basis points to 15.7%. The year-over-year operating margin expansion was driven by improved execution and the benefits from cost actions, restructuring and productivity initiatives. Overall, earnings per share before special items increased 9% year-over-year.
Turning to orders on Slide 9. As I've mentioned in previous quarterly calls, it is important to keep in mind that order growth, particularly in our integrated solutions business is lumpy and can be impacted by the timing of large projects. Overall, orders increased 3% year-over-year, with 10% growth in products, 2% growth in service and a 1% decline in integrated solutions. Total backlog of $4.6 billion increased 3% on a year-over-year basis and was flat on a quarter sequential basis.
Now let's get into the details of each of the segments, starting first with North America Integrated Solutions & Services on Slide 10. Revenue in the quarter of $1 billion was flat on a reported basis. Organic revenue growth of 2% was fully offset by the negative impact of the weaker Canadian dollar. We saw nice growth in service revenue, which increased close to 3% organically in the quarter. Additionally, integrated solutions grew 1% organically.
Before special items, operating income in the quarter was $180 million, and the operating margin was 17.8%. The operating margin improved 460 basis points year-over-year. The prior year included a $10 million legal charge, which resulted in a 100 basis point tailwind to the year-over-year operating margin expansion. Additionally, the current year benefited from discreet items, which favorably impacted the operating margin by approximately 120 basis points. Underlying margin expansion of 240 basis points was driven by increased revenue, improved execution and the benefits from restructuring and productivity initiatives. As George mentioned, we have made significant changes in our North American Integrated Solutions & Services business, and we are seeing the benefits of those changes in the margin expansion.
As I've discussed on last quarter's call, orders in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 benefited from several large orders, resulting in a difficult compare in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. As expected, overall orders decreased 4% year-over-year in North America Integrated Solutions & Services. Service orders increased 3%, and integrated solutions orders decreased 11%, off an 18% increase last year. Order activity this year was driven by the commercial, retail and government verticals. As we look to the first quarter, it's important to keep in mind that we have another tough compare in order activity as last year's Q1 integrated solutions orders increased 13%, driven by several large projects.
Total backlog of $2.5 billion increased 2% year-over-year and in line with normal seasonality, declined 1% on a quarter sequential basis.
Turning to Slide 11. Rest of World Integrated Solutions & Services revenue of $827 million decreased 18% year-over-year, driven by a 13% unfavorable impact from FX. Organic revenue declined 3%, driven by a 7% decline in integrated solutions, partly due to a tough compare of 7% growth in the prior year as well as pressure in the U.K. and the Asia Pacific regions mainly from the oil and gas vertical. Acquisitions contributed 2% to revenue growth, which was more than offset by the impact of a divestiture.
Before special items, operating income was $90 million. The segment operating margin declined 90 basis points year-over-year to 10.9% as the benefits of productivity and restructuring initiatives were more than offset by the volume deleverage and the mix of geographies contributing to operating income.
Turning to order activity in Rest of World, we saw a nice improvement in order intake. Year-over-year, total orders increased 6%, with 1% growth in service and an 11% increase in integrated solutions, which included several large orders in Latin America and Asia. Backlog of $1.9 billion grew 4% on a year-over-year basis and 2% on a quarter sequential basis.
Turning to Global Products on Slide 12. Revenue declined 2% on both a reported and organic basis to $666 million. A 7% benefit to revenue from acquisitions was fully offset by a 7% decrease in revenue from FX. The organic revenue decline resulted from a slowdown in the U.S. fire market as well as significant decrease in demand in the Middle East related to the oil and gas vertical, each of which negatively impacted our Life Safety business. Before special items, operating income was $124 million, and the operating margin declined 60 basis points to 18.6%. Productivity initiatives were more than offset by volume deleverage and mix as well as an 80 basis point impact from noncash purchase accounting. Product orders increased 10% year-over-year, primarily due to recent acquisitions.
Now let me touch on a few other items on Slide 13. First, corporate expense before special items was $45 million for the quarter. This is about $10 million lower than we had expected and was offset by a $10 million increase in other expense. Corporate expense for the full year was $201 million. Looking ahead to fiscal 2016, we expect corporate expense to be in the range of $205 million to $215 million.
Next, our effective tax rate before the impact of special items was 17.4% for the quarter and 16% for the year, driven by a onetime benefit recorded in the second quarter related to the realization of certain non-U.S. deferred tax assets. As we look forward to fiscal 2016, we expect the tax rate before special items to be in the range of 17% to 18%.
Moving to cash flow. We had a strong conversion quarter with adjusted free cash flow of $339 million, representing 130% conversion rate. We have made significant progress in the last 6 months converting our income to cash. However, the weaker-than-normal conversion in the first half of the year takes our full year adjusted free cash flow of $761 million to a conversion rate of 80%. As we look ahead to 2016, we fully expect to be back to the 90% to 100% conversion rate for adjusted free cash flow.
Moving to restructuring and repositioning activities. We incurred charges of $120 million for the quarter and $289 million for the year, of which $176 million related to restructuring actions. These actions, primarily related to severance and other employee-related charges with an expected payback within 2 years. These and past restructuring and repositioning actions, along with our strong productivity initiatives, have offset the weaker macro environment and have been a strong contributor to our double-digit EPS growth this year.
As Antonella mentioned, beginning in 2016, our EPS before special items will include restructuring and repositioning charges. Our expectation for restructuring and repositioning charges for 2016 based on our current outlook is $75 million to $100 million, with approximately $20 million expected to be included in our first quarter results.
Before I turn it back over to George, let me provide you a quick update on our recent debt refinancing, which is detailed on Slide 14. In September, we took advantage of the low interest rate environment and raised $1.5 billion of debt. Half was issued with a 10-year term and at an annual interest rate of 3.9%, and the other half has a 30-year term at an annual rate of 5.125%. All the proceeds were used to redeem several tranches of higher interest rate debt, paid make-whole payments for the early redemption and repaid debt that matured in October 2015.
During the course of the year and including the recent debt refinancing, we increased our long-term debt by $700 million to $2.2 billion with a weighted average interest rate of 3.7%. Despite a higher debt balance, we expect to reduce net interest expense in 2016 to approximately $80 million. Additionally, we expanded the capacity under our credit facility from $1 billion to $1.5 billion and extended the term 5 years out through 2020.
Now let me turn things back over to George."
107534,315311905,903363,"Tyco International plc, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Nov 13, 2015",2015-11-13,"Earnings Calls","Tyco International plc","Executives","Thanks, Arun. Let's turn now to Slide 15 for our earnings guidance for fiscal 2016.Let me begin by noting that the uncertainty created by the macroeconomic environment, particularly in our international markets, has resulted in a more cautious outlook f",934,"Thanks, Arun. Let's turn now to Slide 15 for our earnings guidance for fiscal 2016.
Let me begin by noting that the uncertainty created by the macroeconomic environment, particularly in our international markets, has resulted in a more cautious outlook for 2016. Additionally, the headwind created by lower oil prices has kept pressure on customer CapEx budgets and OpEx spend, including continued deferral of discretionary maintenance. Based on the timing of the decline in our results in 2015, which began at the tail end of our fiscal second quarter, we expect our fiscal 2016 results to reflect low double-digit declines in our oil and gas vertical on a year-over-year basis. Although underlying activity may still be subdued throughout fiscal 2016, our year-over-year comparisons ease significantly in the back half. 
With that in mind, let's get into the details of our fiscal 2016 guidance. We expect total revenue to be in the range of $9.65 billion to $9.85 billion, with organic revenue growth being flat to up 2% year-over-year. We expect to start the year with an organic revenue decline, given the compares with fiscal 2015, but we expect to see the growth rate pick up, particularly in the second half of the year.
Included in our full year revenue guidance is a $310 million or a 3% headwind related to FX and the net benefit of recent acquisitions and divestitures of approximately $30 million.
The overall segment margin before special items for 2016 is expected to expand 50 to 80 basis points year-over-year. As Arun mentioned, our EPS before special items guidance for fiscal 2016 includes a range of $75 million to $100 million for restructuring and repositioning charges. Based on these items and the specific guidance Arun provided for corporate expense and below-the-line items, we expect earnings per share from continuing operations before special items for the full year to be in the range of $2.05 to $2.20 based on a weighted average share count of 427 million shares. This compares to fiscal 2015 EPS before special items of $1.74, which has been recast to include restructuring and repositioning charges of $289 million.
Historically, our EPS before special items has been stronger in the second half of the year due to the seasonality of our businesses. We expect this to continue in 2016. However, given the oil and gas and FX comps we are facing in the first half, we expect our earnings to be a bit more skewed to the second half in fiscal 2016.
Now let's shift to our guidance for the first quarter. Based on the factors just outlined, we expect that the first quarter will be our most difficult comparison of the year from both a reported and organic revenue standpoint as well as a segment margin perspective.
Turning to Slide 16. Our first quarter fiscal 2015 recast EPS before special items was $0.38. Let me walk you to our year-over-year earnings growth. First, the prior year included $75 million of restructuring and repositioning charges, which, when tax-affected, equates to $0.11 of EPS versus our expectation of $20 million of charges or $0.04 of EPS in the first quarter of 2016. Year-over-year, this results in a tailwind of $0.07.
Next, the first quarter of last year did not reflect any negative impact in our oil and gas vertical. We expect this will be a $0.02 headwind year-over-year. 
Third, the U.S. dollar continued to strengthen throughout fiscal 2015, resulting in an FX headwind of $0.03 year-over-year in the first quarter. Additionally, a decline in volume and unfavorable mix is expected to be a $0.03 headwind year-over-year, which will be fully offset by the net savings in the quarter. Overall, we expect earnings per share from continuing operations before special items of approximately $0.40 in the first quarter of 2016.
Before the operator opens up the line for questions, I want to take a few minutes to thank Arun for his hard work and dedication over the last 8 years at Tyco. Arun has lead us through the separation and has been our Chief Financial Officer since 2012. Arun was integral in launching the new Tyco and taking us through many acquisitions, divestitures and capital market transactions all while leading the transformation of our finance function. Arun and I have worked closely together over the last 3 years, and I want to take this opportunity, with our shareholders and analysts, to say thank you. Thank you, Arun, for your commitment, candor and leadership, and I wish you all the best as you retire at the end of the year.
As many of you are aware, Arun is 65, and we have been planning a transition over the last year. While we will miss -- all miss Arun, I am happy to welcome Robert Olson, who will be succeeding Arun as our Chief Financial Officer. Previously, Robert was CFO of Dish Network, a provider of satellite video services and technology, where he served as the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer for 5 years. Robert also has vast experience in the commercial space, which he gained during his time as Chief Financial Officer of Trane Commercial Systems, the largest operating division of American Standard from 2006 to 2008. I am pleased to welcome such an accomplished financial executive to our senior leadership team. Rob's experience as a Chief Financial Officer, combined with his broad experience in service-oriented technology companies, will be especially valuable as we grow our services and solutions businesses.
Thanks for joining us on the conference call this morning. And with that, operator, please open the lines for questions."

That all being said, I would say that the orders that we're seeing today are very strong, and that's projecting to not only support the volume that we're committing in the first quarter, but beyond within the rest of the year."

As we went through a difficult 2015, we also recognized that we needed to free up additional resources to then put to work on the growth side of the company. And so as we accelerated the restructuring and repositioning, we were planning on now taking those strong fundamentals that we've delivered in the first 3 years and now leveraging those to a greater degree in the top line. Now let me give you an example. In retail, we've been working on retail, investing on the front end of our business while we've been accelerating the investments in technology and new solutions within our store performance solutions. And with that effort in 2015, we saw a nice mid-single-digit improvement in our retail orders, and that's playing through now. We've taken that same approach now across the enterprise. And with the incremental, roughly, $30 million, $35 million that we put to work in 2016, that gives us complete confidence that with the same discipline that we went about driving operational improvement, we're putting to work on the commercial side of our business and believe that with that, we'll be positioned very well to be able to create order growth, which will translate to accelerated revenue growth over the next couple of years."

It's mainly driven by the commercial end market as well as some key institutional end markets like higher ed. Government seems to be coming back. Retail is strong. So in our fire business, health care. So we're seeing pretty good activity. And from a service standpoint, we actually had very strong service growth in North America in the fourth quarter. Now some of that was a recovery. But overall, very strong performance. So -- and then if you go to Rest of World, in line with what we expected with oil and gas and some of the heavy industrial verticals, we've seen now that impact, and that was pretty much in line with what we expected. So my assessment would be that the overall environment is similar. It's playing out as we had expected. When I look at order activity so far in the first quarter, it's in line with what we had in the fourth quarter. Certainly, we have a couple of compare issues year-on-year. But I'm confident with the investment that we are making in how we're expanding our capabilities, our footprint and we're enhancing the ability of our front end to be able to get closer to the customer and ultimately, execute on the growth that we're going to see continued positive trends here during the course of 2016."

With me today are Tyco's Chief Executive Officer, George Oliver; our Chief Financial Officer, Arun Nayar; and Robert Olson, who will be succeeding Arun as CFO following the filing of our Form 10-K, which we expect to do later today.
I would like to remind you that during the course of today's call, we will be providing certain forward-looking information. We ask that you look at today's press release and read through the forward-looking cautionary informational statements that we've included there.
In addition, we will use certain non-GAAP measures in our discussion, and we ask that you read through the sections of our press release that address the use of these items. The press release issued this morning and all related tables as well as the conference call slides, which George and Arun will refer to, can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at tyco.com.
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, we changed the name of our North America Installation & Services and Rest of World Installation & Services segments to North America Integrated Solutions & Services and Rest of World Integrated Solutions & Services to better reflect our focus on providing technology-enabled solutions that are tailored to our customers' needs. There was no change in the underlying segment structure and no impact to previously disclosed segment information.
In discussing our segment operations, when we refer to changes in backlog and order activity, these figures exclude the impact of foreign currency and divestitures. Additionally, references to operating margins during the call exclude special items, and this metric is a non-GAAP measure and is reconciled in the schedules attached to our press release.
Also, I would like to remind everyone that beginning in fiscal 2016, we will be including restructuring and repositioning within our reported earnings per share before special items. As we are now 3 years out from the separation, we have completed the bulk of the restructuring and repositioning actions related to that transaction. Our view of a normal run rate for these charges is approximately $75 million on an annual basis. Given the current economic environment, our guidance for 2016 includes a range of $75 million to $100 million or $0.14 to $0.19 of restructuring and repositioning charges. These charges will be shown as a separate line item below segment operating income to allow greater visibility to the underlying segment results. We have recast the quarters of fiscal 2015 to include restructuring and repositioning charges as well as the related tax impact in the appendix to the slides.
Now let me quickly recap this quarter's results. Revenue in the quarter of $2.5 billion declined 7% year-over-year on a reported basis, driven by a 7% headwind from changes in foreign currency. The favorable impact of net acquisition and divestiture activity was offset by a 1% organic revenue decline. 
Earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Tyco ordinary shareholders was $0.19 and included net charges of $0.42 related to special items. These special items related primarily to restructuring and repositioning charges as well as a charge for the early retirement of debt. Earnings per share from continuing operations before special items was $0.61 compared to our guidance of $0.60 to $0.62 per share.
Now let me turn the call over to George."

This was a solid quarter of operational execution. Our continued focus on productivity and self-help initiatives across all of the businesses and global functions drove our operating results this quarter. Ove",1399,"Thanks, Antonella, and good morning, everyone. This was a solid quarter of operational execution. Our continued focus on productivity and self-help initiatives across all of the businesses and global functions drove our operating results this quarter. Overall, fiscal 2015 was a challenging year. Macro headwinds, coupled with the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar, has put significant pressure on our results this year. Our team stepped up to the challenge and aggressively executed cost actions and accelerated our pipeline of restructuring initiatives to help mitigate the pressure and drive stronger earnings growth, both for the fourth quarter and for the year. I am very proud of how our teams came together and thank them for their leadership.
Starting on Slide 4. Let me spend a few minutes on what we are seeing in the macro economic environment and our expectations for fiscal 2016. Overall, the global industrial economy has come under increased pressure over the last few months. Although pockets of strength exist in certain verticals, many markets directly or indirectly exposed to commodity-linked resources continue to be sluggish.
Starting with North America. The U.S. market remains a relative bright spot with continued growth in nonresidential construction year-over-year. We continue to see increased activity over prior year levels with strength in the commercial, retail and institutional verticals. As expected, Western Canada remains weak as the market is very much tied to the petrochemical oil and gas industry. 
Overall, our North America Integrated Solutions & Services business performed very well in the quarter. Organic growth accelerated to 2%, and the operating margin continued to expand. When I reflect back on the last 3 years, this business has been through significant changes. Although the top line has remained relatively flat on an organic basis, the operating margin before special items improved by 480 basis points to an annual rate of 15.3%, and operating income increased 43% over this period. This far exceeded the expectations set 3 years ago to achieve an operating margin of 14 -- 13% to 14%. Even more importantly, our work is not done. We are investing in the business while continuing to improve the efficiency of our operations.
Moving to Rest of World. Let me start with Europe. In general, the environment remains sluggish. GDP estimates continue to be revised downward due to economic uncertainty. Overall, our European businesses have executed well despite softness in the top line. Our operating margins have been improving as the teams are executing productivity initiatives to reduce our cost structure and drive operational efficiencies. With that being said, we anticipate relatively flat revenue growth in Europe in 2016 on a year-over-year basis.
In Australia, the industrial and mining sector downturn continues to dampen overall industrial activity in the region. This macro environment has persisted throughout 2015, and we are planning for a similar environment in 2016.
In the growth markets, we continue to see growth in the mid-single-digit range and expect this to continue in fiscal 2016. Despite the economic conditions in Latin America, our business, which represents approximately 5% of sales, had solid performance with about 10% organic growth for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2015.
Given the impact the oil and gas vertical has had on our results this year, I'd like to take a minute to update you on our performance during the quarter and for the full year. In aggregate, our oil and gas businesses were down about 20% on a year-over-year basis in the fourth quarter and down 15% on a full year basis, both in line with our previous expectations. Despite representing only about 5% of sales, the mix impact associated with the decline in this vertical created a $0.06 EPS headwind in fiscal 2015.
As we continue to the next phase of our journey, we remain intently focused on disciplined growth and continuous operational improvement. Disciplined growth is focused on ensuring that we provide products and services that our customers value and are willing to pay a premium for, whether it's the products we sell through our distribution channels or the technology embedded in our integrated solutions and services that are delivered by our direct channel. We are a leader in many of the markets we serve as the combination of our brands, technology and reliability make us a premium player in the fire and security industry. Innovation is at the heart of everything we do. We live in a world where sensors and devices are gathering increased volumes of data, which creates opportunities for improved analytics that help our clients improve operations, keep customers safe, safeguard their facilities and comply with codes and standards. We no longer consider our total addressable market to be limited to the fire and security industry when developing new products and services. We are now looking at the total customer problem and how our resources, our devices and our factories in the field can help create solutions to solve these problems.
Every customer process, every customer building, every customer business needs data for continuous improvement. The right real-time data leads to the operational insights customers need to optimize performance. For example, the combination of our store performance solutions with our creative systems and FootFall acquisitions provides a full view of inventory, traffic and other analytics to fundamentally change the retailer's operations. Retailers can plan better around store hours, figure out when to restock their stores, lead customers directly to inventory on the shelves and up-sell them more effectively when they choose to try on clothes. 
The combination of our investments, along with the changes made to the sales team to better align to our strategy, has resulted in a mid-single-digit increase in our retail business in fiscal 2015. Although this is only a piece of our portfolio, it lays the path of what can be done across the enterprise. This requires making the right decisions around resource allocation as well as making smart investments in R&D and sales and marketing.
Over the past 3 years, we've been focused on streamlining operations. While we will continue doing so, we are shifting to driving commercial excellence across the portfolio. We are making incremental investments in 2016 to drive productivity within our sales force. We have just initiated a global program to create a commercial ecosystem using salesforce.com to align all Tyco employees around the customer and drive a superior customer experience. The program is called E3, which stands for everyone sells, everyone serves, everyone helps. E3 will allow 30,000 customer-facing team members to collaborate around a 360-degree view of our customers and for our customers to have a more seamless experience with Tyco. E3 is being rolled out in phases over the next 2 years and will be the foundation for commercial excellence.
Shifting to continuous improvement. The combination of our productivity initiatives, along with the additional restructuring actions taken in fiscal 2015, position us to increase our expected gross savings to approximately $180 million to $210 million in 2016. These savings are expected to be somewhat offset by wage inflation costs of approximately $60 million. Additionally, we expect to increase our incremental investments for R&D and sales and marketing initiatives to a range of $70 million to $90 million. As the incremental gross savings will fund these increased investments, we still expect to deliver a $50 million to $60 million benefit to the bottom line. 
We will continue to supplement these internal growth initiatives with strategic acquisitions. During fiscal 2015, we committed about $575 million of capital for acquisitions, which we expect to yield approximately $300 million of revenue on an annualized basis. We continue to actively work a strong pipeline of M&A opportunities with a few transactions in the near term, which could total between $200 million and $500 million in purchase price.
In addition to acquisitions, we continued to review the portfolio. We recently made a decision to divest a business which manufactures piping components within our Global Products segment. This business generated approximately $45 million in revenue in fiscal 2015.
Additionally, share repurchase remains an important component of our capital allocation strategy. We currently have a $1 billion authorization in place. Our current plan is to offset dilution at a minimum and potentially repurchase additional shares if cash builds up on the balance sheet and there is no acquisition activity.
Now let me turn it over to Arun to go through the details of our performance."

Beginning with our full year results, revenue of $9.9 billion grew 1% organically. The net impact of acquisitions and divestitures added an additional point to revenue growth, which more than offset -- which was more than offset by a 6% headwind from changes in foreign currency for an overall revenue decline of 4%.
In total, segment operating margin before special items expanded 50 basis points to 14.4%. The margin expansion was led by North America Integrated Solutions & Services, which expanded margins by 200 basis points, helping to offset the margin pressure in Rest of World and Global Products.
Earnings per share before special items increased 12% in 2015, led by strong operations, including aggressive cost actions, which, together, contributed $0.17 of incremental earnings year-over-year despite the tougher-than-expected macro environment.
Now focusing on the quarter, please turn to Slide 8. Revenue of $2.5 billion declined 7% year-over-year on a reported basis, including a 7% headwind from changes in foreign currency. In line with our expectation, organic revenue declined 1%. Acquisitions contributed 2 percentage points of revenue growth, which was partially offset by a 1% decline related to the impact of a divestiture. 
Excluding FX, service was up 3%, integrated solutions declined 3% and Global Products grew 5%. Before special items, segment operating income was $394 million, and the segment operating margin improved 150 basis points to 15.7%. The year-over-year operating margin expansion was driven by improved execution and the benefits from cost actions, restructuring and productivity initiatives. Overall, earnings per share before special items increased 9% year-over-year.
Turning to orders on Slide 9. As I've mentioned in previous quarterly calls, it is important to keep in mind that order growth, particularly in our integrated solutions business is lumpy and can be impacted by the timing of large projects. Overall, orders increased 3% year-over-year, with 10% growth in products, 2% growth in service and a 1% decline in integrated solutions. Total backlog of $4.6 billion increased 3% on a year-over-year basis and was flat on a quarter sequential basis.
Now let's get into the details of each of the segments, starting first with North America Integrated Solutions & Services on Slide 10. Revenue in the quarter of $1 billion was flat on a reported basis. Organic revenue growth of 2% was fully offset by the negative impact of the weaker Canadian dollar. We saw nice growth in service revenue, which increased close to 3% organically in the quarter. Additionally, integrated solutions grew 1% organically.
Before special items, operating income in the quarter was $180 million, and the operating margin was 17.8%. The operating margin improved 460 basis points year-over-year. The prior year included a $10 million legal charge, which resulted in a 100 basis point tailwind to the year-over-year operating margin expansion. Additionally, the current year benefited from discreet items, which favorably impacted the operating margin by approximately 120 basis points. Underlying margin expansion of 240 basis points was driven by increased revenue, improved execution and the benefits from restructuring and productivity initiatives. As George mentioned, we have made significant changes in our North American Integrated Solutions & Services business, and we are seeing the benefits of those changes in the margin expansion.
As I've discussed on last quarter's call, orders in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 benefited from several large orders, resulting in a difficult compare in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. As expected, overall orders decreased 4% year-over-year in North America Integrated Solutions & Services. Service orders increased 3%, and integrated solutions orders decreased 11%, off an 18% increase last year. Order activity this year was driven by the commercial, retail and government verticals. As we look to the first quarter, it's important to keep in mind that we have another tough compare in order activity as last year's Q1 integrated solutions orders increased 13%, driven by several large projects.
Total backlog of $2.5 billion increased 2% year-over-year and in line with normal seasonality, declined 1% on a quarter sequential basis.
Turning to Slide 11. Rest of World Integrated Solutions & Services revenue of $827 million decreased 18% year-over-year, driven by a 13% unfavorable impact from FX. Organic revenue declined 3%, driven by a 7% decline in integrated solutions, partly due to a tough compare of 7% growth in the prior year as well as pressure in the U.K. and the Asia Pacific regions mainly from the oil and gas vertical. Acquisitions contributed 2% to revenue growth, which was more than offset by the impact of a divestiture.
Before special items, operating income was $90 million. The segment operating margin declined 90 basis points year-over-year to 10.9% as the benefits of productivity and restructuring initiatives were more than offset by the volume deleverage and the mix of geographies contributing to operating income.
Turning to order activity in Rest of World, we saw a nice improvement in order intake. Year-over-year, total orders increased 6%, with 1% growth in service and an 11% increase in integrated solutions, which included several large orders in Latin America and Asia. Backlog of $1.9 billion grew 4% on a year-over-year basis and 2% on a quarter sequential basis.
Turning to Global Products on Slide 12. Revenue declined 2% on both a reported and organic basis to $666 million. A 7% benefit to revenue from acquisitions was fully offset by a 7% decrease in revenue from FX. The organic revenue decline resulted from a slowdown in the U.S. fire market as well as significant decrease in demand in the Middle East related to the oil and gas vertical, each of which negatively impacted our Life Safety business. Before special items, operating income was $124 million, and the operating margin declined 60 basis points to 18.6%. Productivity initiatives were more than offset by volume deleverage and mix as well as an 80 basis point impact from noncash purchase accounting. Product orders increased 10% year-over-year, primarily due to recent acquisitions.
Now let me touch on a few other items on Slide 13. First, corporate expense before special items was $45 million for the quarter. This is about $10 million lower than we had expected and was offset by a $10 million increase in other expense. Corporate expense for the full year was $201 million. Looking ahead to fiscal 2016, we expect corporate expense to be in the range of $205 million to $215 million.
Next, our effective tax rate before the impact of special items was 17.4% for the quarter and 16% for the year, driven by a onetime benefit recorded in the second quarter related to the realization of certain non-U.S. deferred tax assets. As we look forward to fiscal 2016, we expect the tax rate before special items to be in the range of 17% to 18%.
Moving to cash flow. We had a strong conversion quarter with adjusted free cash flow of $339 million, representing 130% conversion rate. We have made significant progress in the last 6 months converting our income to cash. However, the weaker-than-normal conversion in the first half of the year takes our full year adjusted free cash flow of $761 million to a conversion rate of 80%. As we look ahead to 2016, we fully expect to be back to the 90% to 100% conversion rate for adjusted free cash flow.
Moving to restructuring and repositioning activities. We incurred charges of $120 million for the quarter and $289 million for the year, of which $176 million related to restructuring actions. These actions, primarily related to severance and other employee-related charges with an expected payback within 2 years. These and past restructuring and repositioning actions, along with our strong productivity initiatives, have offset the weaker macro environment and have been a strong contributor to our double-digit EPS growth this year.
As Antonella mentioned, beginning in 2016, our EPS before special items will include restructuring and repositioning charges. Our expectation for restructuring and repositioning charges for 2016 based on our current outlook is $75 million to $100 million, with approximately $20 million expected to be included in our first quarter results.
Before I turn it back over to George, let me provide you a quick update on our recent debt refinancing, which is detailed on Slide 14. In September, we took advantage of the low interest rate environment and raised $1.5 billion of debt. Half was issued with a 10-year term and at an annual interest rate of 3.9%, and the other half has a 30-year term at an annual rate of 5.125%. All the proceeds were used to redeem several tranches of higher interest rate debt, paid [ph] make-whole payments for the early redemption and repaid debt that matured in October 2015.
During the course of the year and including the recent debt refinancing, we increased our long-term debt by $700 million to $2.2 billion with a weighted average interest rate of 3.7%. Despite a higher debt balance, we expect to reduce net interest expense in 2016 to approximately $80 million. Additionally, we expanded the capacity under our credit facility from $1 billion to $1.5 billion and extended the term 5 years out through 2020.
Now let me turn things back over to George."
107534,315311905,903551,"Tyco International plc, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Nov 13, 2015",2015-11-13,"Earnings Calls","Tyco International plc","Executives","Thanks, Arun. Let's turn now to Slide 15 for our earnings guidance for fiscal 2016.Let me begin by noting that the uncertainty created by the macroeconomic environment, particularly in our international markets, has resulted in a more cautious outlook f",934,"Thanks, Arun. Let's turn now to Slide 15 for our earnings guidance for fiscal 2016.
Let me begin by noting that the uncertainty created by the macroeconomic environment, particularly in our international markets, has resulted in a more cautious outlook for 2016. Additionally, the headwind created by lower oil prices has kept pressure on customer CapEx budgets and OpEx spend, including continued deferral of discretionary maintenance. Based on the timing of the decline in our results in 2015, which began at the tail end of our fiscal second quarter, we expect our fiscal 2016 results to reflect low double-digit declines in our oil and gas vertical on a year-over-year basis. Although underlying activity may still be subdued throughout fiscal 2016, our year-over-year comparisons ease significantly in the back half. 
With that in mind, let's get into the details of our fiscal 2016 guidance. We expect total revenue to be in the range of $9.65 billion to $9.85 billion, with organic revenue growth being flat to up 2% year-over-year. We expect to start the year with an organic revenue decline, given the compares with fiscal 2015, but we expect to see the growth rate pick up, particularly in the second half of the year.
Included in our full year revenue guidance is a $310 million or a 3% headwind related to FX and the net benefit of recent acquisitions and divestitures of approximately $30 million.
The overall segment margin before special items for 2016 is expected to expand 50 to 80 basis points year-over-year. As Arun mentioned, our EPS before special items guidance for fiscal 2016 includes a range of $75 million to $100 million for restructuring and repositioning charges. Based on these items and the specific guidance Arun provided for corporate expense and below-the-line items, we expect earnings per share from continuing operations before special items for the full year to be in the range of $2.05 to $2.20 based on a weighted average share count of 427 million shares. This compares to fiscal 2015 EPS before special items of $1.74, which has been recast to include restructuring and repositioning charges of $289 million.
Historically, our EPS before special items has been stronger in the second half of the year due to the seasonality of our businesses. We expect this to continue in 2016. However, given the oil and gas and FX comps we are facing in the first half, we expect our earnings to be a bit more skewed to the second half in fiscal 2016.
Now let's shift to our guidance for the first quarter. Based on the factors just outlined, we expect that the first quarter will be our most difficult comparison of the year from both a reported and organic revenue standpoint as well as a segment margin perspective.
Turning to Slide 16. Our first quarter fiscal 2015 recast EPS before special items was $0.38. Let me walk you to our year-over-year earnings growth. First, the prior year included $75 million of restructuring and repositioning charges, which, when tax-affected, equates to $0.11 of EPS versus our expectation of $20 million of charges or $0.04 of EPS in the first quarter of 2016. Year-over-year, this results in a tailwind of $0.07.
Next, the first quarter of last year did not reflect any negative impact in our oil and gas vertical. We expect this will be a $0.02 headwind year-over-year. 
Third, the U.S. dollar continued to strengthen throughout fiscal 2015, resulting in an FX headwind of $0.03 year-over-year in the first quarter. Additionally, a decline in volume and unfavorable mix is expected to be a $0.03 headwind year-over-year, which will be fully offset by the net savings in the quarter. Overall, we expect earnings per share from continuing operations before special items of approximately $0.40 in the first quarter of 2016.
Before the operator opens up the line for questions, I want to take a few minutes to thank Arun for his hard work and dedication over the last 8 years at Tyco. Arun has lead us through the separation and has been our Chief Financial Officer since 2012. Arun was integral in launching the new Tyco and taking us through many acquisitions, divestitures and capital market transactions all while leading the transformation of our finance function. Arun and I have worked closely together over the last 3 years, and I want to take this opportunity, with our shareholders and analysts, to say thank you. Thank you, Arun, for your commitment, candor and leadership, and I wish you all the best as you retire at the end of the year.
As many of you are aware, Arun is 65, and we have been planning a transition over the last year. While we will miss -- all miss Arun, I am happy to welcome Robert Olson, who will be succeeding Arun as our Chief Financial Officer. Previously, Robert was CFO of Dish Network, a provider of satellite video services and technology, where he served as the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer for 5 years. Robert also has vast experience in the commercial space, which he gained during his time as Chief Financial Officer of Trane Commercial Systems, the largest operating division of American Standard from 2006 to 2008. I am pleased to welcome such an accomplished financial executive to our senior leadership team. Rob's experience as a Chief Financial Officer, combined with his broad experience in service-oriented technology companies, will be especially valuable as we grow our services and solutions businesses.
Thanks for joining us on the conference call this morning. And with that, operator, please open the lines for questions."

I'm just wondering how you can toggle that over the course of the year. It would seem to me that this year, you had weaker revenues, you were able -- you were still able to deliver on the margin and you didn't spend anywhere year-over-year near as much as you're spending this year.

So if you look at what we've done in the first 3 years, we've been very disciplined around creating the operating company and streamlining all of our processes, which has enabled us to be able to deliver very strong fundamentals, which is what has been driving the returns. As we went through a difficult 2015, we also recognized that we needed to free up additional resources to then put to work on the growth side of the company. And so as we accelerated the restructuring and repositioning, we were planning on now taking those strong fundamentals that we've delivered in the first 3 years and now leveraging those to a greater degree in the top line. Now let me give you an example. In retail, we've been working on retail, investing on the front end of our business while we've been accelerating the investments in technology and new solutions within our store performance solutions. And with that effort in 2015, we saw a nice mid-single-digit improvement in our retail orders, and that's playing through now. We've taken that same approach now across the enterprise. And with the incremental, roughly, $30 million, $35 million that we put to work in 2016, that gives us complete confidence that with the same discipline that we went about driving operational improvement, we're putting to work on the commercial side of our business and believe that with that, we'll be positioned very well to be able to create order growth, which will translate to accelerated revenue growth over the next couple of years."

That is clearly something new that we haven't historically done in the past. So that's part of the increase as well as the increase that we started last year with our sales force that we see coming through in this part of the year as well.

And what I would say there is we did have a couple of soft spots, mainly additional softness in the heavy industrial space similar to what we've seen in oil and gas as well as, as I said earlier, in our fire services, with a little bit of a slowdown in the orders that we saw within that segment. Now when you look at our I&S businesses, we see continued activity across all of our end markets that we serve in North America. It's mainly driven by the commercial end market as well as some key institutional end markets like higher ed. Government seems to be coming back. Retail is strong. So in our fire business, health care. So we're seeing pretty good activity. And from a service standpoint, we actually had very strong service growth in North America in the fourth quarter. Now some of that was a recovery. But overall, very strong performance. So -- and then if you go to Rest of World, in line with what we expected with oil and gas and some of the heavy industrial verticals, we've seen now that impact, and that was pretty much in line with what we expected. So my assessment would be that the overall environment is similar. It's playing out as we had expected. When I look at order activity so far in the first quarter, it's in line with what we had in the fourth quarter. Certainly, we have a couple of compare issues year-on-year. But I'm confident with the investment that we are making in how we're expanding our capabilities, our footprint and we're enhancing the ability of our front end to be able to get closer to the customer and ultimately, execute on the growth that we're going to see continued positive trends here during the course of 2016."

And what we do is stay very disciplined, not only in our product businesses, but in the service business, making sure that we're getting price for the value that we contribute. And so net of it all, we get price during the course of the year. So we work within that, that environment, to make sure that we're staying price-positive. But certainly, that does come into effect as it relates to the volume."

Certainly, depending on how the markets play out, will affect how we look at restructuring as well as our reinvestment in growth, and we'll balance the 2 as the year plays out."

The change from our Investor Day last November in laying out the 3-year plan, certainly, the economic environment has changed pretty significantly. Now assuming that type of environment, the $75 million that we spend every year to drive labor productivity -- mainly the labor productivity to support the reinvestment and margin expansion has had to increase, given the look that we have today relative to the global macro economic environment. And so what I would say is that while -- if the -- in a growing economy, global economy, we should be positioned to be able to maintain and deliver on those type of goals in a normal environment with $75 million of restructuring. With the changes that we've seen, then it's been prudent to make sure that we are managing the fundamentals in a changed environment so that we can make the investments and be positioned to capitalize on the growth that will occur going forward."

So there, as you look as it plays out during the year, our total margin rate in the first quarter will be down about 120 basis points in products. But then as you look out, as we play through the year, we get back to an average of about 19% to 19.5%. And a lot of that is -- when you look at the investments we're making, with the -- normalizing the volume that we'll achieve in the second, third and fourth quarter gives us a lot of confidence that we'll be able to deliver on those margin rates."
