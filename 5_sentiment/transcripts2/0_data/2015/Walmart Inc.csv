Thanks for joining us today. The date of this call is February 19, 2015. This call is the property of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and is intended for the use of Walmart shareholders and the investment community. It should not be reproduced in any way. [Operator Instructions]
This call will contain statements that Walmart believes are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 as amended and that are intended to enjoy the protection of the Safe Harbor for forward-looking statements provided by that act. Please note that a cautionary statement regarding the forward-looking statements will be made following Charles Holley's remarks in this call.
Before we get underway, we apologize for the delay in this morning's release. We normally release our earnings at 6 a.m. Central Time or 7:00 Eastern. However, because we wanted to share some exciting news about our U.S. associates with them first, we delayed the release until now. 
So this morning, we have several pieces of news to share with you. First, we have details on the fourth quarter and full year results for fiscal year 2015. Second, as we normally do, we provide guidance for the full year and the first quarter of fiscal 2016. Third, as I mentioned, we're announcing a new wage structure for hourly associates in Walmart U.S. stores and Sam's Clubs. This new initiative, including training and educational programs, will affect current and future hourly associates in the United States. And last, we're announcing our annual dividend for fiscal year 2016. You'll hear more from Doug and our leaders about each of these items.
All materials related to these announcements are available on our corporate website, stock.walmart.com. For earnings, please review together the earnings press release, the transcript of this call and the accompanying slide presentation. 
Unit count data, which is updated monthly, are posted separately on the Investors portion of the website under Financial Reporting. As indicated last quarter, it's important to note the definition of a Neighborhood Market. Traditional Neighborhood Markets are grocery stores that average 42,000 square feet. The smaller Neighborhood Markets range in size from 12,000 to 16,000 square feet and are still part of a test concept and not included in comp sales. 
As a reminder, for fiscal 2015 which ended January 31, 2015, we utilized a 52-week comp reporting calendar. In Q4, we reported a 13-week comp versus a 14-week comp period reported last year. Our Q4 reporting period began on November 1, 2014, and ran through January 30, 2015.
Consistent with industry practice, we did not adjust the reported fiscal 2015 comp. Comps were based upon 13- and 52-week periods, respectively, compared with 14-week and 53-week periods that we reported in fiscal 2014. We've posted a week-by-week comp reporting calendar under the comp sales link on the Investors portion of our website.
Now recall that last fiscal year's earnings per share were impacted by $0.26 of discrete items. This year, as you'll note in our earnings release and on this call, earnings per share were impacted also by $0.08 of discrete items. 
Additional information regarding underlying EPS and other terms used in today's release, including constant currency, gross profit and gross profit rate, are available on our website. 
Let's get on with today's call. Doug McMillon, President and CEO of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., will cover key results, an analysis of our successes and challenges and the news about our wage structure changes and training programs. Claire Babineaux-Fontenot, EVP and Treasurer, will provide context for the financial details not included in the accompanying slide presentation. 
Then we'll cover the 3 operating segments. Greg Foran, President and CEO of Walmart U.S., followed by Dave Cheesewright, President and CEO of Walmart International, and Rosalind Brewer, President and CEO of Sam's Club. Neil Ashe, President and CEO of Global eCommerce, is joining the call this quarter to provide an analysis of how we did for the year, along with insights on our strategic investments for fiscal year '16. And Charles Holley, Walmart's CFO, will wrap up with an analysis of fiscal year 2015 and guidance for fiscal year 2016.
Now I'm pleased to introduce our CEO, Doug McMillon, to share some exciting news with you today. Doug?"

Overall, we had a good fourth quarter to close out our fiscal year, with underlying earnings per share of $1.61. Walmart U.S. delivered better-than-expected comp sales. Sam's Club had its best performance of the",1740,"Thanks, Carol, and good morning, everyone. Overall, we had a good fourth quarter to close out our fiscal year, with underlying earnings per share of $1.61. Walmart U.S. delivered better-than-expected comp sales. Sam's Club had its best performance of the year, and Walmart International had solid sales and profitability. 
The dedication of our associates around the world to serve customers was evident again in this busy fourth quarter. Now clearly, our sales benefited from customers having more spending power due to lower gas prices in most of our large markets. In addition, product inflation and more favorable weather were a tailwind to U.S. comp sales.
But like many other global companies, we faced significant headwinds from currency exchange fluctuations. So I'm pleased that we delivered fiscal year revenue of nearly $486 billion. But we're not satisfied. We have work to do to grow the business. We know what customers want from a shopping experience, and we're investing strategically to exceed their expectations. Our priority is to run great stores, clubs and e-commerce everywhere we operate. And we'll continue integrating our stores with our e-commerce and mobile commerce business.
One of our most important priorities this year is improving the customer experience. Today, we announced a bold new initiative on pay and training to invest in our U.S. store and club hourly associates. For several months, our leadership teams have been developing and testing new ideas to reward associates for their service to our customers and give them clearer pathways for opportunity. 
We're pursuing a comprehensive approach to our hiring, training, compensation, scheduling programs and store management structure that is sustainable over the long term. Approximately 500,000 full-time and part-time associates at Walmart U.S. stores and Sam's Clubs will receive pay raises in the first half of the current fiscal year. Current and future associates will benefit from this initiative, which ensures that Walmart hourly associates earn at least $1.75 above today's federal minimum wage or $9 per hour in April. The following year, by February 1, 2016, current associates will earn at least $10 per hour. 
We're also realigning our store operational structure to give associates a closer relationship with their supervisors. Associates will have more ownership over their schedules. In addition, we'll provide them with more resources and training to enable merit-based career advancement and higher levels of pay. 
Of course, for a number of years, associates have had the opportunity for competitive health care and 401(k) benefits as well as access to bonus incentive opportunities, discounts and educational programs. These programs will continue to be available to current and future associates.
We're also launching an innovative program for future associates that will allow them to join Walmart at $9 per hour or more, receive skills-based training for 6 months and then be guaranteed at least $10 per hour upon successful completion of that program. 
Sam Walton used to say that our people make the difference. I share this same philosophy. Overall, these are strategic investments in our people to reignite the sense of ownership they have in our stores. As a result, we firmly believe that our customers will benefit from a better store experience, which can drive higher sales and returns for our shareholders over time.
Walmart has represented a ladder of opportunity since we started the business. And we want to make sure that's the case going forward everywhere we operate, including here in the United States. Globally, we have ongoing efforts in place to review our associates' compensation on a yearly basis in each of our markets. 
For example, in China, we recently launched the compensation structure for stores and clubs, and in this year, we are launching a new compensation structure for our distribution center associates to improve the overall competitiveness of our practices. Later this year, Walmart Mexico will launch training programs to give associates more ownership and accountability so they can react faster to customers' needs.
Included in today's announcement, Walmart and the Walmart Foundation also committed to $100 million over 5 years to help increase the economic mobility for entry-level workers by focusing on initiatives to better train and advance workers in the retail and other service industries throughout the United States. 
As we look at our business through the lens of the customer, our enterprise strategy is helping us to find where our additional investments are focused. While we're concentrating on running a good business today, we're also clear on how we should position it for the future. 
Value matters to everyone regardless of household income level, and digital access creates even more price transparency. Being the low-price leader has been a part of our customer proposition, and it will continue to be a priority in the future. 
We're also evaluating our assortment and our approach to service, both in stores and online to be relevant for today's customer. And we're testing various access points to provide convenience and allow customers to shop on their terms. This past quarter, we initiated a number of work streams that will deliver on these key initiatives. I'm excited about what we'll accomplish over this next year as we drive our enterprise strategy.
Now let's review Walmart's financial results in more detail. Walmart U.S. improved its sales and operating income trends each consecutive quarter during fiscal 2015. Fourth quarter comp sales were the strongest in more than 2 years, with positive traffic for the first time in 9 quarters. 
Our Neighborhood Markets have continued to deliver strong comps. Our emphasis remains on the quality of the stores that we open, not the quantity. I'm pleased with the strategy that Greg and his team are executing to raise the standard of customer experience in the U.S. business. They're taking steps to enhance store operations on various fronts, including inventory management, checkout and in-stock. 
For the holidays, Walmart U.S. implemented a Checkout Promise to keep more registers open during peak periods, and customer response has been positive enough that this has continued into the first quarter. I'm encouraged by the focus of the leadership team, and I look forward to seeing more progress in our stores this year toward a better experience for our customers.
Walmart International produced solid constant currency sales and operating income growth this year. Dave and his team have done a good job weathering a tough macro environment. Canada's sales gained momentum in the back half. In China, we made progress in store operations and in e-commerce. We continue to earn customers' trust with our commitments to food safety. There's so much potential for this market, and we're taking the right steps to solidify a foundation for long-term growth. 
The U.K. market remains very competitive, and Asda is committed to its GBP 5 billion 5-year investment to lower prices for customers. We're making progress in Mexico. There's still work to do in Brazil. 
Sam's Club had a solid year, with membership income up over 10%. Comp sales without fuel continued to improve throughout the year. And operating income with fuel grew at a greater rate than sales. Roz and the team made good progress on the ongoing merchandise transformation, embedding new on-trend and exciting merchandise into the clubs and online. Members are responding by driving sales in these categories. 
Members are also pleased with the new innovative services that were launched this year to increase the value of a Sam's Club membership. You'll hear more from Neil shortly about the strides that we're making in our e-commerce customer experience, assortment and supply chain. We're leveraging technology to strengthen our e-commerce and mobile capabilities and integrating these digital assets with our more than 11,000 stores globally. 
Overall, e-commerce sales grew approximately 22% in fiscal year 2015, solid but not quite as strong as we wanted. We're striving to balance sales growth and profitability. We're being thoughtful with our investments, ensuring we have the infrastructure in place to build this business for the long term. I'm excited about the possibilities that are in front of us. 
One of the headlines in e-commerce is the tremendous growth from mobile devices. In fact, nearly 70% of Walmart.com traffic in the U.S. came via mobile during the recent holiday period. Customers who previously shopped using their laptops are now using their phones and tablets. 
And this isn't just a U.S. trend. For example, traffic from the mobile app in Brazil nearly tripled on the Black Friday holiday. Around the world, we're well positioned to create a strong mobile experience for customers this year and beyond.
As I reflect back on my first year as CEO, I'm proud of the accomplishments of our associates and leadership team. It's been a period of change for the 2.2 million associates that make up the Walmart team, but it's been inspiring to see our associates rally around our company's purpose. 
Last week, more than 5,000 members of our U.S. store leadership gathered for our annual year beginning meeting. I heard directly from our store managers how we could help them run better stores. And similar meetings are occurring around the world. Regardless of our responsibility, we're in this together. Each of us has a role to play in making our customers' shopping experience a great one. Our secret to success continues to be that we're all working together.
We've made a lot of progress on bringing strategic clarity and in reinvigorating our commitment to run better businesses today. Retail is changing so quickly that we must move with greater urgency to stay out in front. 
I like the passion that I'm seeing from our leadership team as they work together to shape and deliver our enterprise strategy. We're thinking differently about retail and about the world. This drives our approach to global responsibility in areas like environmental sustainability, women's economic empowerment and offering healthy food choices. It's important work and it matters to our customers and shareholders. We remain steadfast in our commitment to compliance, ethics and doing the right thing. I'm pleased with the technology enhancements we've made to strengthen these organizations.
As I close my remarks, let me reiterate that I'm proud of what we accomplished this past year, but I'm more excited about what lies ahead. The deliberate strategic choices that we're making around investments in our associates and e-commerce capabilities will improve the customer experience. And we believe that shareholders will also benefit from these investments in the future. Now I'll turn it over to Claire. Claire?"

Further details are available in the accompanying presentation posted today with this transcript. Before I begin, let me remind you that last year, the company's fourth quarter and fiscal 2014 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Walmart EPS, were negatively impacted by certain discrete items totaling $0.26.
The company's fourth quarter and fiscal 2015 EPS were negatively impacted by discrete items totaling $0.08. A wage and hour litigation matter previously disclosed resulted in a charge of $0.05 per share, and store closures in Japan resulted in a charge of $0.03 per share. A reconciliation of the company's underlying EPS is included in our earnings press release issued prior to the call. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, underlying EPS was $1.61 compared to last year's underlying EPS of $1.60. Reported EPS was $1.53 compared to last year's EPS of $1.34.
As you can see on Slide 2, total revenue for the fourth quarter was $131.6 billion. Consolidated net sales increased $1.9 billion or 1.4%, and membership and other income declined 0.5%. Recall that during the fourth quarter of last year, membership and other income was positively impacted by a $24 million gain from the sale of certain U.S. real estate assets.
Total revenue for the year grew to $485.7 billion as consolidated net sales increased $9.2 billion or 1.9% and membership and other income grew 6.3%. Consolidated operating expenses increased 0.5% for the quarter and 2.3% for the full year. 
It is important to remember that operating expenses were negatively impacted in the fourth quarter and for the full year by the discrete items I mentioned earlier. Additionally, FCPA and compliance-related costs were $36 million in the fourth quarter, comprised of $26 million for the ongoing inquiries and investigation and $10 million for our global compliance program and organizational enhancements. 
For the full year, FCPA and compliance-related costs were $173 million, comprised of $121 million for the ongoing inquiries and investigations and $52 million for our global compliance program and organizational enhancements. Last year, total FCPA and compliance-related costs were $282 million.
The company's consolidated operating income increased 8.2% during the fourth quarter. Last year's fourth quarter operating income was negatively impacted by the discrete items I mentioned earlier. Fiscal year 2015 operating income increased 1%.
Net interest expense increased 5.8% for the quarter and 6% for the year. The increase for each period was primarily driven by a higher weighted average interest rate on net borrowings. 
From a balance sheet perspective, consolidated inventory increased 0.6%. Later in today's call, you'll hear more about inventory from our segment leaders. Payables as a percentage of inventory were 85.1%, which compares to 83.4% last year due primarily to the timing of payments. Improving inventory leverage is important and we are seeing progress as the company continues to focus on this priority. 
We ended the year with capital expenditures of $12.2 billion, slightly below our range of $12.5 billion to $13 billion. For the year, the company added approximately 33 million retail square feet through 511 net new expanded and relocated units. This was in line with the updated guidance we shared in October.
Finally, let's address returns. ROI for the trailing 12 months ended January 31, 2015, was 16.9%, relatively flat compared to 17% for the prior comparable period. The slight change in ROI was primarily due to continued investments in store growth and e-commerce initiatives, offset by currency exchange rate fluctuations. 
For the full year, the company returned $7.2 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. And we ended the year with free cash flow of $16.4 billion compared to $10.1 billion last year. Now I'll turn the call over to Greg. Greg?"

When I joined the Walmart U.S. team 6 months ago, we laid out specific objectives for the second half of fiscal 2015. We knew we needed to become better store managers to fix some of the basics in our stores. We spent the last several months focusing on core fundamentals such as inventory, merchandise returns, shrink, markdowns and wage management. 
By focusing on these urgent agenda items and using the tailwinds we've seen from an improving economy, we drove positive momentum in our business. We achieved what we set out to do in the short term, but we're not satisfied and recognize that we have more work to do to accomplish our longer-term goals.
Before discussing our results, I want to provide more detail on the exciting announcement we made this morning regarding associate pay and store structure. As Doug mentioned, we believe our people make the difference, and we're committed to this philosophy. At Walmart, we already provide an opportunity for jobs to become careers in retail. We want to continue to improve that opportunity and to provide it to more associates. The changes we are making are based on our core principles and will make Walmart a better place to work and shop. 
First, we believe associates equally value their hourly rate and hours worked. We're happy to announce improvements to both aspects of associates earnings opportunity. Current and future associates will benefit from this initiative, which ensures that Walmart hourly associates earn at least $1.75 above today's federal minimum wage or $9 per hour in April. And current associates will earn $10 per hour or higher by next February. 
Additionally, we are piloting a scheduling system that will create stability for associates who want predictable hours and the flexibility for those who prefer to select additional shifts to meet customers' needs each week. Starting in 2016, we will be one of the first retailers to offer some associates fixed hours each week. 
Next, we are realigning our store operational structure, adding back department managers to give associates a closer relationship with their supervisors to help improve communication, direction and recognition. 
And finally, we are making new commitments to train associates. They will engage in interactive learning programs to build skills, demonstrate proficiency and be rewarded for their efforts through pay raises and promotions into areas of greater responsibility. 
We will also offer opportunities to pursue further education, including a high school diploma or GED program, access to language training and free or low-cost college credits to reduce the time and cost of a college education. 
I want to say thank you to all our 1.2 million Walmart U.S. associates. Together, we're part of something bigger than ourselves and bigger than our company. What we do at Walmart extends beyond our stores to our own communities and across this country. I'm thankful to be a part of this organization.
Now let's move to this quarter's performance. Net sales grew $3.1 billion or 4.1% versus last year. For the 13-week period ended January 30, comparable store sales were up 1.5%, which exceeded our guidance. This represents an approximate 100 basis point improvement over Q3 and was largely driven by a 1.4% improvement in traffic. 
This quarter marks the first positive traffic comp since Q3 of fiscal year 2013 as customers saw increased purchasing power from lower gas prices. We also lapped the SNAP reductions and unfavorable weather seen last year. E-commerce contributed approximately 30 basis points to our comp performance.
During the 6-week holiday season, we experienced overall comp sales growth. We saw increased traffic to the store, aided by our broadcast and digital holiday hub marketing campaign. Strong sales of seasonal merchandise and toys, along with key brands and gifts in apparel and home, offset industry declines in entertainment. 
Customers also continued to refine how they prepared for the holidays, shopping earlier in November for holiday deals and looking for last-minute gift ideas all the way through Christmas Eve. We were ready when and where our customers needed us, completing almost 1 billion total transactions over the holiday season including our largest online day ever on Cyber Monday. 
Looking across the entire fourth quarter, our growth in comp sales was attributable to several key areas of the business. First, we remained pleased by our apparel and home businesses, which brought value to the customers through strong national brands, consistent quality across price points and relevant products at the right time of the season. 
Second, our health and wellness business, including optical, remained strong, with growth in script counts from higher penetration in Medicare and Medicaid plans, branded drug inflation and a strengthening over-the-counter business. 
Third, while our grocery performance was assisted primarily by inflation and lapping last year's SNAP reductions, we also saw progress from urgent agenda items, including a focus on adding days of freshness in produce. We still have a long way to go to improve our fresh business and remain focused on this goal.
And finally, we saw strong performance from our Neighborhood Market format. While all formats experienced positive sales comps, our traditional Neighborhood Markets continue to outperform Walmart Supercenters and discount stores, providing customers with the products and services they desire at locations that are convenient to them. Our traditional Neighborhood Markets delivered approximately a 7.7% comp for the quarter.
Yet while we saw a positive momentum in these categories, we remain challenged in others, specifically declines in our entertainment business persisted as we faced industry contraction and deflation across many categories. Lapping last year's gaming console releases, along with fewer video game titles available for new consoles and shifts from physical to digital media in movies and books drove high single-digit negative comps in this area. 
Additionally, although we launched wireless installment plans in November, we're still ramping up this service as we reacquaint customers with our ability to serve them in this category. Finally, softness in electronics also impacted our online business, particularly in the ship-to-home channel.
In e-commerce, we remain thoughtful about growth, striving to produce sustainable results through digital and physical access. Our focus on serving customers led to strong performance in Pick Up Today and Ship from Store capabilities, particularly during the holiday season. However, we recognize the significant opportunity we have to grow this area of our business as customers continue to reshape their shopping behaviors.
Now for the remainder of our financial results. In the fourth quarter, gross profit rate was relatively flat. Operating expenses increased 5.6%, driven primarily by changes in estimates associated with our incentive accrual versus last year. Additionally, we intensified our focus on improving customer experience in our stores. 
While these actions increased costs, we believe it was the right decision for the customer. In fact, our Checkout Promise program drove customer experience satisfaction scores to their highest level during the holiday season. Due to the success of this program, we are implementing it more broadly in fiscal 2016. Overall, operating income declined approximately 60 basis points for the quarter.
Inventory growth moderated from prior quarters, growing 3.9% and less than the rate of sales in Q4. This growth was primarily related to the significant number of new store openings in the quarter. In fact, we opened 178 stores in this quarter alone, including 10 Supercenters and 168 traditional and small format Neighborhood Markets. 
Comp store inventory improved in this quarter, driven by a strong holiday sell-through and better aligned seasonal markdowns in apparel. Inventory management is a key element to customer experience. And whilst we have room for improvement, we are also making progress to better manage working capital. 
Now let me cover our full year financial performance. For the year, net sales increased 3.1% or $8.6 billion to $288 billion. Comp sales improved 0.5% for the 52-week period ended January 30 while operating income declined 2.1% to $21.3 billion. Gross profit improved 2.6% for the year, with a 12 basis point decline in gross profit rate. This was primarily driven by price investments in meat and preferred Medicare prescription plans. 
Expenses were up 4.3%, deleveraging 24 basis points for the year and driven primarily by increased health care costs from higher enrollment rates and medical cost inflation. Expenses were further deleveraged by the initial ramp-up of 17 new medical care clinics, increased utility expenses from cold weather early in the year and higher rates throughout the year and declining rates in recyclable materials such as cardboard. Recall that we get a financial benefit from recycled materials.
Moving to real estate. We opened 353 net new stores, including relocations and expansions and added almost 21 million retail square feet. 1 year ago, we started to accelerate our Neighborhood Market format. This fiscal year, we opened 165 traditional format Neighborhood Markets and 68 smaller Neighborhood Markets. 
By continuing to drive this format, we're able to offer customers easy and convenient access to fresh foods, pharmacy and services at Walmart's Every Day Low Price guarantee. Supercenters remain the driver of our sales and growth in retail square footage. Customers continue to rely heavily on this format for their broader shopping needs. 
This year, we opened an additional 119 Supercenters including conversions and relocations. In FY '16, we expect to open approximately 60 to 70 Supercenters including relocations and expansions. Additionally, we'll open an estimated 180 to 200 Neighborhood Markets, including 10 to 15 smaller format locations as we complete our openings of this test program. We'll continue to monitor the progress of these test locations before making any further commitments to this format. We expect to add approximately 15 million to 16 million retail square feet this year.
Digital access is important to our customers now more than ever. They expect a seamless interaction whether it's in the store or online. We see many opportunities at Walmart to evolve with the customer in the digital and physical experiences. 
For example, this year, we developed a collaborative approach to the holiday season in toys with our store and Walmart.com teams working closely together to ensure our customers had the same experience with Walmart no matter where or when they shopped. We've been investing and expanding capabilities to allow customers to shop on their own terms and are moving sensibly towards this integration of digital and physical. 
This includes offering customers a variety of ways to interact with our brand, including picking up their Walmart.com orders at their local store, providing reminders and refill capabilities through our pharmacy app and our latest test concept, Walmart Grocery. 
This year, we expanded grocery delivery and pickup tests to include the entire Denver market and launched Walmart Grocery Pickup here in northwest Arkansas this past October. And just last week, we announced the expansion of Walmart Grocery online to select locations in the Phoenix, Arizona and Huntsville, Alabama markets. 
We have an advantage at Walmart by combining our store and distribution network with our e-commerce capabilities to allow our customers to interact with their brand in ways that are most convenient for them. Whether it's in a store, online or on our mobile app, we are focused on providing the best solutions for customers.
The upcoming fiscal year will be a time of change and further improvement to the business. Our focus on inventory management, in-stock levels and customer service is just the beginning. 
Recently, we made changes within our management team. These changes have allowed me to get closer to our merchandising teams, and the new leadership brings with them fresh ideas and an invigorating spirit. We've also just wrapped up our year beginning meeting, which is a time to gather our store managers to thank them for their hard work in the prior year and to discuss the focus areas for the upcoming year. 
The meeting was energizing and our store managers left excited for a fresh start to become better store managers, focusing on item merchandising and providing great service to the customer. 
We'll continue on the path towards hiring 100,000 veterans by 2018. We set this goal just under 2 years ago. And we're proud to say that we've already hired almost 80,000 veterans through this program. Furthermore, over 6,000 have been promoted to roles of greater responsibility since joining the Walmart team. 
But fiscal 2016 will not be without its challenges. Our bottom line will continue to be pressured primarily from the significant investments in associates that I covered earlier. In addition, we will see impact from the changing mix within merchandise categories, store formats and retail channels and the investments in digital and physical integration. While we expect to offset some of these headwinds by executing and delivering on our urgent agenda items and other initiatives, we know these investments are necessary to position ourselves to meet the rapidly changing needs of the customer.
We may see risk to import merchandise flows related to the upcoming spring and Easter seasons due to ongoing port congestion. We'll continue to take the appropriate steps using our diversified supply chain network to reduce the impact for our customers. 
In the first quarter, we expect a continuation of lower gas prices to provide a tailwind to our business. This could be somewhat offset by a shorter selling season, with Easter coming earlier than last year as well as potential impact from port congestion. For the 13-week period ending May 1, we anticipate a comp sales increase of 1% to 2%. Last year's 13-week comp ended May 2, 2014, was down 8 basis points. 
Now I'll turn it over to Dave for an update on Walmart International. Dave?"

I'm pleased with our performance in International as we've remained committed to the strategic priorities I outlined 1 year ago. We've been able to produce solid results and operating income growth despite operating in a very challenging competitive retail environment.
As one of our key priorities, we continue to accelerate our e-commerce business by offering multiple ways for our customers to shop. Whether in stores, online, pickup or mobile, we aim to give our customers the ability to shop in whichever way they want. 
We've also made progress in building a platform for sustainable growth in China and have experienced success in improving our overall price perception as well as the quality of our fresh offering. We also continued to make progress on our commitment of actively managing our existing portfolio. 
You've seen us make strategic decisions such as closing underperforming stores and divesting noncore parts of our business in order to strengthen our foundation. Our markets remain focused on key strategic priorities, and I'm optimistic about our position going forward into the new year.
Now for our financial results. In the fourth quarter, net sales grew 3% on a constant currency basis. However, with the U.S. dollar at historic highs, we faced significant currency headwinds of $2.6 billion, resulting in a 3.9% sales decline on a reported basis. 
Of our 5 largest countries, Mexico, Canada and Brazil delivered positive comp sales for the quarter. Comps declined in both the U.K. and China due primarily to food deflation and intense competition in the U.K. and government austerity measures and deflation in key categories in China. 
Comp sales growth was strong in all other markets as well. As Claire mentioned, there were certain discrete items disclosed in the previous year, which have a significant impact on our year-over-year operating income comparison. For financial year ending '15, our fourth quarter results were negatively impacted by Japan store closure costs of $148 million. 
Overall, operating income increased 79.6% on a constant currency basis and 66.4% on a reported basis. Excluding the previous and current years' discrete items, we grew operating income on a constant currency basis by 14.2%.
For the full year, sales grew 3.6% on a constant currency basis, while the strong U.S. dollar resulted in a full year sales decline of 0.3% on a reported basis, reflecting over a $5 billion currency impact. Full year operating income grew 24.1% on a constant currency basis and 19.8% on a reported basis. Excluding the items mentioned above, operating income grew 9.3% on a constant currency basis, outpacing full year sales growth. 
We made progress in reducing inventory levels during the quarter and dropped the growth rate over 250 basis points versus the previous quarter to a 4.6% growth on a constant currency basis. We had positive momentum on inventory management heading into the new year. 
Now let's discuss individual results for our largest markets. Comp sales and growth rates are presented on a constant currency basis only. In all countries except Brazil and China, results are inclusive of e-commerce. Slides 8 and 9 of the presentation summarize financial details.
The U.K. market remained very competitive during the quarter, with grocery inflation falling to a record low of negative 0.9% over the 12 weeks ended January 4, according to Kantar. Total market growth of 0.6% was a slight improvement over the previous quarter, boosted by Christmas sales and increased discretionary spending from lower fuel prices. However, overall market trends remain relatively weak. According to Kantar, Asda, along with other big grocers, lost share to hard discounters for the quarter.
U.K. sales declined 1.7% and comp sales declined 2.5%, excluding fuel. Several competitors held a Black Friday event for the first time, and others continued intense vouchering, which led to increased competition versus 1 year ago. Asda online sales remained strong, while George home continued to register double-digit growth. Despite the top line pressures, Asda was able to grow income ahead of sales.
Now turning to Canada, which had a very solid fourth quarter performance. Sales grew 4.1%, with comp sales increasing 1.8%, marking this the third consecutive quarter of positive comps. Price investments and increased consumer spending contributed to improved trends in sales. 
We reported strong comp sales in food, health and wellness and consumables. While general merchandise and apparel sales improved versus prior quarter results, they were still below the rate of growth in the market. 
Our fresh business also continues to accelerate, resulting in the highest comp sales for the year in quarter 4. Canada had a strong holiday season overall, with the online business up 38.5%. Walmart Canada grew 43 basis points of market share in food, consumables and health and wellness combined, as reported by Nielsen for the 12-week period ending January 24.
Canada completed a restructuring in the quarter to simplify home office operations. This, along with continued investments in e-commerce and pricing, resulted in a decline in operating income. Overall, we're pleased with the positive sales trend we've seen in our Canadian operations and we expect momentum to continue.
Next, we'll discuss Walmex, which released their quarterly results on February 17. Please note the Walmex release is under IFRS and the results here are under U.S. GAAP. Thus, some numbers will differ. 
Consolidated Walmex sales grew 3.4%, with positive comp sales in both Mexico and Central America. Walmex leveraged expenses for the quarter and grew operating income faster than sales. Mexico sales increased 3%, and the comp sales were up 0.1% for the quarter. 
According to ANTAD, the entire market experienced slower comp growth in the fourth quarter of 0.7% in self-service. Walmart Mexico comps, excluding Sam's Club, exceeded the market by 80 basis points. Performance was especially strong in our small format Bodega Aurrera Express, which outperformed the market by 750 basis points. 
Sam's Club growth lagged the market by approximately 330 basis points. However, we're encouraged by the improving top line trends at Sam's as December comp sales were the strongest of the year. Sam's Club remains a focus area, and we will continue to accelerate initiatives to improve the business.
Next, let's talk about Brazil. Brazil continued sales momentum in Q4, growing net sales and comp sales by 3.1%. Holiday sales were driven by strong performances in both food and consumables. Strategic and targeted pricing resulted in margin favorability for the quarter. Management also continued to drive labor productivity and control expenses. While we are seeing some positive results, there's still work to be done in our turnaround plan.
Moving to China. Ongoing headwinds from government austerity measures, reduction in gift card sales and continued deflation in key categories continued to pose challenges in the market. Walmart China's Q4 net sales declined 0.7%, and comp sales declined 2.3%, partially due to Chinese New Year falling nearly 3 weeks later than last year.
We increased market share in the hypermarket category for the eighth consecutive quarter according to Nielsen for the period ended December 31. We expect market headwinds to continue in the new year, but we're confident that we'll continue to accelerate growth in this important market.
Over the year, China has made great progress in strengthening the core business. Our portfolio is now more focused and stronger with the opening of 24 new hypermarket stores and 1 additional Sam's Club, in addition to completing the store closure program announced last year. The distribution center expansion project and the centralization of deliveries to DCs were finalized within the quarter, resulting in a distribution network for fresh that provides coverage for all of our stores in China for the first time.
These initiatives drive efficiency, reduce costs and shorten the lead time to get products on the shelf. Having control over our own distribution network allows us to better monitor the quality and the safety of our products. Additionally, the We Operate for Less and the We Buy for Less programs in China have saved over $150 million over the course of the year.
Finally, let's discuss e-commerce performance across the globe. We remain focused on innovating and providing solutions for our customers seeking convenience. This quarter, we made even more progress and I'm very excited about the impact we've made in online retail. 
In Japan, we automated the order picking process to fulfill Seiyu.com grocery orders more efficiently and sustainably. We're testing new offerings such as grab and go lockers in Canada. In India, we're continuing the rollout of online offering to business-to-business members and expect to reach all members by the end of next year. 
Yihaodian, our e-commerce business in China, benefited from investments in the supply chain and promotional events. Traffic increased more than 40% and average ticket improved as well. The fourth quarter was highlighted by a successful Singles Day promotion in November, generating strong sales and traffic growth, aided by an increase in orders from mobile devices.
In Brazil, e-commerce sales growth was strong again this quarter, driven by strong sales in large appliances and wireless, where low-cost smartphones helped drive sales growth of more than double the same period last year. Promotions fueled sales growth with the Black Friday and 72-hour events delivering strong comp sales. Traffic via our mobile app nearly tripled on Black Friday.
Looking ahead, we will continue to innovate and execute our strategic plan. I'm amazed by how similar our customers' needs are around the world. Value, assortment and convenience are paramount. We remain focused on saving our customers' money by expanding our private label offering, improving product sourcing and driving costs out of our operations so that we can invest it back into price. 
We know convenience means different things to customers at different times. It could mean shopping online, home grocery delivery, a one-stop shop experience or a drive-through pickup, and we're innovating to provide customers more shopping options than ever. No matter the shopper's preference, Walmart will continue to strive to be the destination of choice. 
Our objectives for this year will continue to build upon a foundation that's been established. In financial year ending '16, we're committed to: actively managing the existing portfolio; driving comp sales; accelerating e-commerce; delivering market priorities, including establishing a platform for sustainable growth in China; moving forward with the turnaround efforts in Brazil; and reenergizing the business in Mexico; and lastly, strengthening enablers, which means being the lowest-cost operator, building world-class talent and building trust.
Let me close by thanking our nearly 800,000 international associates around the world for delivering a strong performance in financial year ending '15. As I reflect on the past year, I'm humbled by what our team has accomplished and their relentless focus on saving customers' money. I look forward to updating you on our results in the coming months. Now I'll turn it over to Roz for the update on Sam's. Roz?"
313055,274781377,765977,"Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Q4 2015 Pre Recorded Earnings Call, Feb 19, 2015",2015-02-19,"Earnings Calls","Walmart Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Dave. I'd like to start by echoing our excitement at Sam's Club regarding the company's announcement today to boost the starting wage for our full-time and part-time hourly associates. We believe we provide our associates with an excellent opportu",1700,"Thanks, Dave. I'd like to start by echoing our excitement at Sam's Club regarding the company's announcement today to boost the starting wage for our full-time and part-time hourly associates. We believe we provide our associates with an excellent opportunity to pursue careers in retail. 
Because our business model at Sam's Club differs from Walmart stores, beginning in the first half of the fiscal year, we will offer a starting hourly wage of $9.50, which is above the federal minimum wage unless there is a higher state-mandated minimum wage. This will ensure all Sam's Club hourly associates are paid above the federal minimum wage. We believe this investment in our associates will help us to attract, retain and develop top-notch talent and will allow us to continue to deliver outstanding award-winning service to our members. 
Now on to Q4. I want to thank our Sam's Club associates for delivering the best performance of the year this quarter, providing momentum going into fiscal '16. Over the last 4 quarters, we saw meaningful acceleration, culminating in a comp sales increase without fuel of 2% for the 13-week period ended January 30. Strong holiday execution, combined with our strategic investments in member value, merchandise relevance and the integration of digital and physical, boosted our performance.
Our investments in membership value initiatives enabled us to grow membership income by over 8% this quarter. Our Plus penetration is at historic highs as Plus members are seeing the benefits from our Cash Rewards program. 
Across the club, all members are seeing the benefits of Instant Savings and the 5/3/1 MasterCard. We will anniversary the introduction of Plus Cash Rewards and the 5/3/1 MasterCard in June 2015, so we expect these programs to continue driving membership income moving forward. 
Sam's net sales including fuel were $14.9 billion, up 1.3% over last year. This was impacted by the approximately 25% decline in fuel prices, with gallons sold up approximately 8%. Our gross profit rate increased 23 basis points due to higher margin on fuel. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales decreased by 50 basis points. 
Operating income increased 29.1% to $510 million, which includes a $41 million increase in fuel profit. Our 500-plus fuel stations provided value to members through competitive pricing, and the 5/3/1 MasterCard holders benefit from an additional 5% off all gas purchases. 
Given the volatility in fuel prices, the remainder of this discussion will exclude fuel. Additionally, for comparisons, please recall that last year, we have certain items impacting our results which included: a $39 million charge to gross profit due to an adjustment to our product warranty liabilities; a $59 million charge to operating expenses for a new in-club staffing restructuring and the closure of 1 club; a $24 million gain in other income for the sale of 2 real estate properties.
In Q4, net sales grew 3.7% and we delivered comp sales of 2%, driven by traffic growth of 1.5% and ticket of 0.5%.
The Savings member continues to drive traffic. We have lapped last year's SNAP reductions and benefited from favorable weather this quarter. Retail inflation across the club has moderated slightly since the previous quarter. 
Our gross profit declined 32 basis points versus last year due to the planned impact of Plus Cash Rewards and pressure from merchandise mix, which were offset by last year's product warranty charge. Without the comparative benefit of the product warranty charge last year, gross profit declined 61 basis points. As discussed previously, the rollout of Plus Cash Rewards will pressure gross profit in the first half of fiscal year 2016. 
Operating expenses were well managed in the quarter and we leveraged 82 basis points. Even without the comparative benefit of last year's discrete items, we leveraged expenses. We had disciplined expense management in a number of areas, including the optimization of the club staffing model earlier this year. 
Membership and other income grew by 1.4% compared to last year, which factors in the real estate gain. Without the $24 million real estate gain last year, membership and other income was up 8.7%. 
Operating income was up 19.4% to $456 million. Without the comparative benefit of last year's items, our operating income was flat to last year. We're still very happy with our overall performance for the quarter, given the significant investments in membership value initiatives such as Plus Cash Rewards, and with good expense management and improvements in membership income, we believe we have great momentum for fiscal 2016.
I also want to highlight the team's efforts around working capital. We reduced total inventory by 3.5% while simultaneously growing our fleet by 16 clubs during the year. Moreover, I am confident in the quality of our inventory for this year.
At Sam's Club, relevant merchandise is a critical component in member engagement, and we continue to improve performance across the box. Our merchants are pushing hard to introduce newness and capture consumer trends while providing the price leadership and assortment that Sam's Club is known for. 
Sales of our fresh food business grew positive low single digits this quarter. Performance was led by meat due to inflation and a strong value proposition. A challenged area was produce, where weather created supply issues. Dry grocery and beverage delivered a positive low single-digit comp, with highlights in newness and healthy for you items. We doubled the organic portfolio since the previous quarter, and members are responding positively to new healthy beverage options.
Let's continue with health and wellness, which posted a positive mid-single-digit comp. Sam's Club is a destination for our members' health care needs, and we see that clearly in our pharmacy comps, which drove the category due to both script growth and branded prescription inflation. Our OTC business, especially our healthy assortment of nutrition bars and protein, also did well. 
We've seen an uptick in our consumables business, which posted a positive low single-digit comp. This is an area where members consistently see value through our private brand offerings, improved pack sizes and Instant Savings. For example, members love the quality of our private brand Member's Mark paper products. The disposable tabletop category continues to perform well, and we have introduced newness to improve the laundry and home care business. 
Home and apparel delivered a positive low single-digit comp. Our exciting assortment of toys was a highlight, drawing members into the club over the holidays. Apparel continues to show strength, driven by men's wear and children's clothing. 
Our underperforming category continues to be technology and entertainment, which posted a negative mid-single-digit comp. This is an improvement versus last quarter as a result of introducing the latest Ultra Hi-Def and 4K TV technologies, a strong value proposition on the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus and an expanded wearables assortment. However, we need to make larger, faster strides. This year, our merchants are rebalancing the portfolio, which involves reallocating resources towards higher growth, higher excitement categories.
Ancillary improved to a positive low single-digit comp, driven by growth in tobacco. We saw improved convenience store traffic trends as we executed strategic pricing initiatives and benefited from shifts in the competitive landscape.
Moving to e-commerce. This quarter, SamsClub.com was integral in supporting our in-club holiday events, becoming a Cyber Week destination and offering online-only promotions that drew members from our physical clubs to our digital platforms. Dotcom delivered double-digit comps in both direct-to-home and Club Pickup, contributing approximately 40 basis points to the segment comp.
We've rebranded Click 'n' Pull to Club Pickup and enhanced the service to appeal to both Savings and business members. Members have responded well to the relaunch of Club Pickup in all clubs, and we've seen accelerated performance compared to the previous quarter. 
The improvements we've made to our mobile and desktop platforms, along with enhancements in messaging, have boosted conversion rates across all platforms. This concludes our discussion on fourth quarter results. Let's continue with the financial results for the full year where we've seen meaningful sustainable acceleration every quarter.
With fuel, net sales were $58 billion, up 1.5% over last year. With fuel profit of $122 million, operating income for the year grew 7.2% to $2 billion. Net sales, excluding fuel, were $51.6 billion, up 2.1%. For the 52-week period ending January 30, 2015, comp sales increased 50 basis points, driven by traffic.
While our investments in Cash Rewards for Plus members led to a gross profit rate decline of 38 basis points, we managed expenses well and leveraged 24 basis points. Membership income increased 10.3%, driving operating income of $1.9 billion, a 2% increase over last year. 
Fiscal 2016 is well under way and Sam's Club is innovating the member experience through merchandise relevance and digital physical integration. These 2 priorities are the key to membership engagement. I am confident that our strategic investments will not only differentiate us from our competitors but more importantly continue enhancing our members' trust and loyalty. 
Merchandise relevance is a critical enabler. Our goal is to ensure that members are surprised and delighted by relevant merchandise every time they come into the club or visit our website in every category across the country. Combined with price leadership and newness, merchandise relevance will keep our members coming back for more. 
Our fiscal '16 investment strategy reflects the importance of offering a seamless digital physical club experience for members. I recently was at the grand opening of our new e-commerce facility in San Bruno, California where Jamie Iannone, who leads SamsClub.com, has invested in expanding his team of engineers and scientists. 
I am optimistic about our growth opportunities in both the digital and the physical, and that's why we plan to open 9 to 12 new and relocated clubs and remodel between 55 and 60 clubs this year while simultaneously investing in innovation at SamsClub.com. 
Knowing that our most engaged members want to shop with us both in our clubs and online, we will ensure a seamless set of access points for members. I am proud of how we finished out the year. For the 13-week period from January 31 through May 1, we expect comp sales to increase between 1% and 2%. 
Now I'll turn things over to Neil for the e-commerce update. Neil?"
313055,274781377,765977,"Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Q4 2015 Pre Recorded Earnings Call, Feb 19, 2015",2015-02-19,"Earnings Calls","Walmart Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Roz. Q4 was an important quarter for us, not just because it is the biggest quarter of the fiscal year but because our key investments started to play a major role in the business. Most notably, our global technology platform, Pangaea and our U.S.",1513,"Thanks, Roz. Q4 was an important quarter for us, not just because it is the biggest quarter of the fiscal year but because our key investments started to play a major role in the business. Most notably, our global technology platform, Pangaea and our U.S. fulfillment network, stood up under the holiday volumes of U.S. customers. 
At the same time, we saw good sales in markets around the world. For the full year and for Q4, we outgrew the e-commerce market globally. Overall, Walmart grew e-commerce sales by 22%, benefited by a 25% increase in gross merchandise value or GMV for the year. In Q4, we grew sales 18% on GMV growth of 20%. An increase in third-party marketplace volumes in the U.S., Brazil and in China contributed to the growth in GMV. 
Greg, Dave and Roz talked about the e-commerce successes in the quarter but it's worth recapping. In the U.S., we had record sales on Cyber Monday and Cyber Week and more than 1.5 billion page views over the 5 days between Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday. 
SamsClub.com had strong double-digit comps on Thanksgiving and on Black Friday. On Singles Day in China in November 11, Yihaodian's GMV growth was in the high double digits. And on December 21, we surpassed traffic from Singles Day. 
In the U.K., Asda continued to make Click & Collect easier for customers in stores and with new pick up points at petrol stations, tube stations and other locations. We now have Click & Collect in all Asda stores. In Brazil, we saw our strongest sales quarter, with high double-digit sales growth. 
What excites me most is the progress we've made in building out our ability to serve customers across digital and physical. We're investing in 4 areas: our global technology platform, our next-generation fulfillment network, our talent and on integrating digital and physical. 
Starting with our global technology platform. I refer to this as the operating system for commerce, because it is the foundation for serving customers digitally and enables the integration of digital and physical commerce. Building and deploying a new platform is one of the most challenging projects for an e-commerce business, particularly at our scale. 
We launched most key elements of our site and mobile shopping experience on the new platform before holiday on Walmart.com in the U.S. Despite all of our testing, with the sheer complexity of a complete platform rebuild, there is nothing like the real thing on the busiest day of the year, Cyber Monday. Pangaea hummed along all day, serving our customers at record volume.
While we were glued to our screens watching performance, a mom in Dallas was glued to her screen on Walmart.com, crossing items off her holiday shopping list. She was most likely shopping on a tablet and she was browsing pages about 30% faster, thanks to Pangaea. 
She was seeing a personalized shopping experience with a lot more recommendations for items that her kids might like. Hers was among a record number of orders. It was the first major test of our next-generation fulfillment network, which combined our first large-scale center in Texas with our existing fulfillment centers, distribution centers and stores to ship a record number of Walmart.com orders. 
Our team in Texas shipped twice as many orders as last year. She was able to get more things from us even faster. Starting in the second quarter, we have 4 more of these large-scale fulfillment centers coming online. While there will be some ramp-up time, they will significantly expand our fulfillment capacity and efficiency in the coming years.
We've talked about the importance of investing in talent and the fact that we are building a technology company inside the world's largest retailer. In the past year, we have been able to build up our team to the critical mass needed to be that technology company. And we did it in a very selective way, bringing in some of the best talent in Silicon Valley through organic hiring and targeted acquisitions. We also built a great team in Silicon Valley to serve Sam's Club across digital and physical. We'll be continuing to hire the best people, adding to the core team we've built to deliver on our priorities.
When we were together at the analyst meeting in October, I talked through the story of a family in Denver who can rely on Walmart to make their lives easier by being everywhere they need us to be. Echoing Greg, I'm really proud of how we brought together the digital and physical customer experience during the holidays. 
In the U.S., we created a series of moments that engaged customers with us, both online and in stores, starting with online deals Thanksgiving morning, leading to the Black Friday store events and through the new evening edition on Cyber Monday for people who worked during the day. 
Mobile continued to be a big investment and area of high growth. Nearly 70% of our Walmart.com traffic during the holidays was from mobile devices. Those people used the app in a lot of ways, to do their shopping online, to find a store or to use a new store search tool we added late last year. This search tool allows customers to find product details and the aisle location of a specific item. 
Sam's also offered a significantly enhanced shopping experience through its app and mobile website. In addition to Walmart, we focused on Sam's digital and physical integration with its Club Pickup experience, and it paid off as we saw nearly 30% growth in Club Pickup during holiday. 
We're also continuing to create a stronger relationship with new and existing customers with grocery pickup and delivery. We've continued to see great feedback from customers on our tests in San Jose and Denver. And last week, we started serving customers in Phoenix, Arizona and Huntsville, Alabama. 
To sum up, last year was a building year and that will continue this year. We ended up investing an incremental $0.08 per share during the fiscal year 2015, which was over our forecast of $0.05 to $0.07 as we continued to invest in fulfillment and other areas to serve our customers. 
As I mentioned, we saw global sales grow by 22%, benefited by a 25% increase in GMV for the fiscal year. Fiscal year 2016 will continue to be a building year, and we expect sales to grow worldwide in the mid-20s. 
In fiscal year 2016, we expect to invest incrementally between $0.06 and $0.09 per share for e-commerce initiatives. Our investments will continue to significantly enhance the customer experience and drive greater efficiency. 
This will include the continued rollout of our U.S. site based on Pangaea, which will make checkout faster and easier for our customers. It is also serving as the backbone to an integrated experience across online, stores and mobile. It will empower new ways to serve customers through mobile. 
That platform will also allow us to further expand our online assortment. We'll do that through a thoughtful balance of our own merchandise and marketplace sellers. We expect to double our assortment this year to well over 10 million SKUs. 
We'll also continue fulfilling our promise to deliver orders to customers when and where they want them. Our next-generation fulfillment network combines new large-scale fulfillment that combine with our DCs and stores all connected by Walmart's transportation network. 
Our data scientists have built algorithms that dictate the assortment that needs to be placed in our different nodes and to dictate from which node we ship and order. 4 new fulfillment centers will come online starting in the second quarter. When fully operational, these centers, along with our other nodes, will position us to serve the vast majority of the U.S. population fast and at a low cost. 
We're working closely with Greg's team to deliver a seamless experience for customers who use our stores to pick up or return orders. And we're working with Roz's team to continue enhancing Sam's Club Pickup and making reordering fast and simple. 
Sam's will also make signing up easier and make membership even more valuable with services and by helping members discover new products. Sam's will have the ability to leverage Walmart's investment in e-commerce. 
At the same time, we'll continue to invest in the major markets for e-commerce, most notably Brazil, China and the U.K. And we'll continue to expand our relationship with customers through online grocery pickup and delivery. All of these achievements from this quarter significantly improved our ability to serve customers however they want to shop with us. And many of our investments from last year will roll out this year. 
We have significant opportunities ahead, and I feel great about the progress we've made on our priorities, including our global technology platform, talent, next-generation fulfillment network and the integration of digital and physical. We are delivering Walmart where you are, whether you shop online, through mobile or in stores. No matter how you shop, we're helping you save money and live better.

I'll wrap up today's discussion by providing some thoughts on the company's performance. For the year, we delivered $486 billion in revenue. E-commerce sales grew approximately 22% to more than $12 billion. 
We delivered fourth quarter underlying earnings per share of $1.61 and reported earnings per share of $1.53. Recall that our underlying earnings per share reflects the performance of our business without the impact of discrete items. Now as a reminder, our fourth quarter guidance of $1.46 to $1.56 included the discrete item of the Japan restructure, which was approximately $0.03 per share. 
Walmart U.S. generated a very solid 1.5% comp in the fourth quarter. Although the strong U.S. dollar caused a negative impact of over $5 billion on revenue, Walmart International delivered very good sales growth of nearly 4% on a constant currency basis for the year. And Sam's Club continued to drive membership income again this year with growth of over 10%.
Now on the other hand, as I just mentioned, currency negatively impacted revenue by more than $5 billion. Although not as high as we anticipated, health care expenses were a headwind for Walmart U.S. during the year. And our reported earnings per share were negatively impacted by $0.08 due to the discrete items that Claire mentioned earlier.
Before turning our attention to guidance for the first quarter and for fiscal year 2016, I would like to remind you that our outlook for the future is based on the enterprise strategy we discussed at our October investor conference. 
Our clear focus on driving sales through price, assortment, access and experience will continue to guide the investments we make to better serve our customers. Our guidance today assumes several important factors, including the economic conditions in several of our largest markets and currency exchange rates remaining at current levels.
In October, we forecasted a 2% to 4% net sales increase for this new fiscal year. However, as a result of where currency rates are today, we expect a currency headwind of approximately $10 billion on net sales. Our new forecast for fiscal year 2016 net sales growth is between 1% and 2%.
Our capital expenditure guidance of $11.6 billion to $12.9 billion and our total net retail square footage growth of 26 million to 30 million square feet remain unchanged. Also in October, we shared that our capital expenditure range reflects that we will grow through a smaller number of large Supercenters in the U.S. And as previously announced, we are dedicating capital related to our digital and e-commerce businesses of $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion.
In fiscal 2016, we expect our FCPA-related expenses to range between $160 million and $180 million. Recall that these are included in our corporate and support expenses.
Our incremental investment in our Global eCommerce business in fiscal 2015 was approximately $0.08 per share, above the $0.05 to $0.07 per share we shared with you in November. We plan to step up our incremental investment again in fiscal 2016 for our e-commerce activities around the world.
This investment is expected to range between $0.06 and $0.09 per share over fiscal 2015. As I indicated at the October investor conference, the heaviest investment in e-commerce will come over the next 18 to 24 months as we further integrate the shopping experience, appealing to our customers' desire for convenience, access and assortment. We then expect to see operating losses start to moderate at the end of that period. We continue to seek the right balance between sales growth and profitability for e-commerce.
Doug shared the news about our people initiatives within our U.S. businesses, including a wage restructuring and training opportunities to help associates earn higher pay and advance their careers. These strategic investments, which will cost approximately $1 billion this year, are designed to ultimately benefit our customers and our businesses through a better store and club experience. 
However, they will impact our earnings per share this fiscal year. In the first quarter, we expect these investments to negatively impact earnings per share by approximately $0.02. The full year earnings per share impact is expected to be approximately $0.20. 
In addition to the impact from these 2 significant investments, operating income like sales will also be pressured by currency exchange rates of around $0.10 per share. Our earnings per share guidance is based on a fiscal 2016 estimated tax rate ranging between 32% and 34%. 
Our tax rate will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter and may be impacted by a number of factors, including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, valuation allowances, changes in law, outcomes of administrative audits, the impacts of discrete items and the mix of earnings among our U.S. and international operations. In any given quarter, our effective tax rate could be higher or lower than the full year range. As we have seen in the past, we expect our first quarter tax rate for fiscal 2016 to be the highest of the 4 quarters.
Taking all of this into account, we expect first quarter fiscal year 2016 earnings per share to range between $0.95 and $1.10. This compares to $1.10 last year. We expect full year earnings per share to range between $4.70 and $5.05. This compares to reported earnings per share of $4.99 in fiscal 2015, which included the discrete items we've discussed.
Now before we wrap up today's call, I would like to address a few additional items. After growth organically or by acquisition, our remaining cash flows provide shareholder returns in the form of dividends and share repurchases. 
Today, we announced an increase in our dividend from $1.92 to $1.96 per share for fiscal 2016 to be paid out quarterly. We've now increased our dividend each year for 42 years. We will continue to be opportunistic with share repurchase. 
Market conditions, general business trends, operating results and a goal of maintaining our AA credit rating, among other factors, influence our share repurchase activity. Working capital management remains a very high priority for us, and although we have made some improvements in fiscal 2015, we acknowledge we have more work to do. Our leadership teams are very committed to further improvement in fiscal year 2016.
Throughout Walmart, we remain focused on being disciplined in delivering for our associates, our customers and our shareholders. Thank you for listening today and for your continued interest in our company."

This call will contain statements that Walmart believes are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 as amended and that are intended to enjoy the protection of the Safe Harbor for forward-looking statements provided by that act. Please note that a cautionary statement regarding the forward-looking statements will be made following Charles Holley's remarks in this call.
Before we get underway, we apologize for the delay in this morning's release. We normally release our earnings at 6 a.m. Central Time or 7:00 Eastern. However, because we wanted to share some exciting news about our U.S. associates with them first, we delayed the release until now.
So this morning, we have several pieces of news to share with you. First, we have details on the fourth quarter and full year results for fiscal year 2015. Second, as we normally do, we provide guidance for the full year and the first quarter of fiscal 2016. Third, as I mentioned, we're announcing a new wage structure for hourly associates in Walmart U.S. stores and Sam's Clubs. This new initiative, including training and educational programs, will affect current and future hourly associates in the United States. And last, we're announcing our annual dividend for fiscal year 2016. You'll hear more from Doug and our leaders about each of these items.
All materials related to these announcements are available on our corporate website, stock.walmart.com. For earnings, please review together the earnings press release, the transcript of this call and the accompanying slide presentation.
Unit count data, which is updated monthly, are posted separately on the Investors portion of the website under Financial Reporting. As indicated last quarter, it's important to note the definition of a Neighborhood Market. Traditional Neighborhood Markets are grocery stores that average 42,000 square feet. The smaller Neighborhood Markets range in size from 12,000 to 16,000 square feet and are still part of a test concept and not included in comp sales.
As a reminder, for fiscal 2015, which ended January 31, 2015, we utilized a 52-week comp reporting calendar. In Q4, we reported a 13-week comp versus a 14-week comp period reported last year. Our Q4 reporting period began on November 1, 2014, and ran through January 30, 2015.
Consistent with industry practice, we did not adjust the reported fiscal 2015 comp. Comps were based upon 13- and 52-week periods, respectively, compared with 14-week and 53-week periods that we reported in fiscal 2014. We've posted a week-by-week comp reporting calendar under the comp sales link on the Investors portion of our website.
Now recall that last fiscal year's earnings per share were impacted by $0.26 of discrete items. This year, as you'll note in our earnings release and on this call, earnings per share were impacted also by $0.08 of discrete items.
Additional information regarding underlying EPS and other terms used in today's release, including constant currency, gross profit and gross profit rate, are available on our website.
Let's get on with today's call. Doug McMillon, President and CEO of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., will cover key results, an analysis of our successes and challenges and the news about our wage structure changes and training programs. Claire Babineaux-Fontenot, EVP and Treasurer, will provide context for the financial details not included in the accompanying slide presentation.
Then we'll cover the 3 operating segments. Greg Foran, President and CEO of Walmart U.S., followed by Dave Cheesewright, President and CEO of Walmart International, and Rosalind Brewer, President and CEO of Sam's Club. Neil Ashe, President and CEO of Global eCommerce, is joining the call this quarter to provide an analysis of how we did for the year, along with insights on our strategic investments for fiscal year '16. And Charles Holley, Walmart's CFO, will wrap up with an analysis of fiscal year 2015 and guidance for fiscal year 2016.
Now I'm pleased to introduce our CEO, Doug McMillon, to share some exciting news with you today. Doug?"

Overall, we had a good fourth quarter to close out our fiscal year, with underlying earnings per share of $1.61. Walmart U.S. delivered better-than-expected comp sales.

Overall, we had a good fourth quarter to close out our fiscal year, with underlying earnings per share of $1.61. Walmart U.S. delivered better-than-expected comp sales. Sam's Club had its best performance of the year, and Walmart International had solid sales and profitability.
The dedication of our associates around the world to serve customers was evident again in this busy fourth quarter. Now clearly, our sales benefited from customers having more spending power due to lower gas prices in most of our large markets. In addition, product inflation and more favorable weather were a tailwind to U.S. comp sales.
But like many other global companies, we faced significant headwinds from currency exchange fluctuations. So I'm pleased that we delivered fiscal year revenue of nearly $486 billion. But we're not satisfied. We have work to do to grow the business. We know what customers want from a shopping experience, and we're investing strategically to exceed their expectations. Our priority is to run great stores, clubs and e-commerce everywhere we operate. And we'll continue integrating our stores with our e-commerce and mobile commerce business.
One of our most important priorities this year is improving the customer experience. Today, we announced a bold new initiative on pay and training to invest in our U.S. store and club hourly associates. For several months, our leadership teams have been developing and testing new ideas to reward associates for their service to our customers and give them clearer pathways for opportunity.
We're pursuing a comprehensive approach to our hiring, training, compensation, scheduling programs and store management structure that is sustainable over the long term. Approximately 500,000 full-time and part-time associates at Walmart U.S. stores and Sam's Clubs will receive pay raises in the first half of the current fiscal year. Current and future associates will benefit from this initiative, which ensures that Walmart hourly associates earn at least $1.75 above today's federal minimum wage or $9 per hour in April. The following year, by February 1, 2016, current associates will earn at least $10 per hour.
We're also realigning our store operational structure to give associates a closer relationship with their supervisors. Associates will have more ownership over their schedules. In addition, we'll provide them with more resources and training to enable merit-based career advancement and higher levels of pay.
Of course, for a number of years, associates have had the opportunity for competitive health care and 401(k) benefits as well as access to bonus incentive opportunities, discounts and educational programs. These programs will continue to be available to current and future associates.
We're also launching an innovative program for future associates that will allow them to join Walmart at $9 per hour or more, receive skills-based training for 6 months and then be guaranteed at least $10 per hour upon successful completion of that program.
Sam Walton used to say that our people make the difference. I share this same philosophy. Overall, these are strategic investments in our people to reignite the sense of ownership they have in our stores. As a result, we firmly believe that our customers will benefit from a better store experience, which can drive higher sales and returns for our shareholders over time.
Walmart has represented a ladder of opportunity since we started the business. And we want to make sure that's the case going forward everywhere we operate, including here in the United States. Globally, we have ongoing efforts in place to review our associates' compensation on a yearly basis in each of our markets.
For example, in China, we recently launched the compensation structure for stores and clubs, and in this year, we are launching a new compensation structure for our distribution center associates to improve the overall competitiveness of our practices. Later this year, Walmart Mexico will launch training programs to give associates more ownership and accountability so they can react faster to customers' needs.
Included in today's announcement, Walmart and the Walmart Foundation also committed to $100 million over 5 years to help increase the economic mobility for entry-level workers by focusing on initiatives to better train and advance workers in the retail and other service industries throughout the United States.
As we look at our business through the lens of the customer, our enterprise strategy is helping us to find where our additional investments are focused. While we're concentrating on running a good business today, we're also clear on how we should position it for the future.
Value matters to everyone regardless of household income level, and digital access creates even more price transparency. Being the low-price leader has been a part of our customer proposition, and it will continue to be a priority in the future.
We're also evaluating our assortment and our approach to service, both in stores and online to be relevant for today's customer. And we're testing various access points to provide convenience and allow customers to shop on their terms. This past quarter, we initiated a number of work streams that will deliver on these key initiatives. I'm excited about what we'll accomplish over this next year as we drive our enterprise strategy.
Now let's review Walmart's financial results in more detail. Walmart U.S. improved its sales and operating income trends each consecutive quarter during fiscal 2015. Fourth quarter comp sales were the strongest in more than 2 years, with positive traffic for the first time in 9 quarters.
Our Neighborhood Markets have continued to deliver strong comps. Our emphasis remains on the quality of the stores that we open, not the quantity. I'm pleased with the strategy that Greg and his team are executing to raise the standard of customer experience in the U.S. business. They're taking steps to enhance store operations on various fronts, including inventory management, checkout and in-stock.
For the holidays, Walmart U.S. implemented a Checkout Promise to keep more registers open during peak periods, and customer response has been positive enough that this has continued into the first quarter. I'm encouraged by the focus of the leadership team, and I look forward to seeing more progress in our stores this year toward a better experience for our customers.
Walmart International produced solid constant currency sales and operating income growth this year. Dave and his team have done a good job weathering a tough macro environment. Canada's sales gained momentum in the back half. In China, we made progress in store operations and in e-commerce. We continue to earn customers' trust with our commitments to food safety. There's so much potential for this market, and we're taking the right steps to solidify a foundation for long-term growth.
The U.K. market remains very competitive, and Asda is committed to its GBP 5 billion 5-year investment to lower prices for customers. We're making progress in Mexico. There's still work to do in Brazil.
Sam's Club had a solid year, with membership income up over 10%. Comp sales without fuel continued to improve throughout the year. And operating income with fuel grew at a greater rate than sales. Roz and the team made good progress on the ongoing merchandise transformation, embedding new on-trend and exciting merchandise into the clubs and online. Members are responding by driving sales in these categories.
Members are also pleased with the new innovative services that were launched this year to increase the value of a Sam's Club membership. You'll hear more from Neil shortly about the strides that we're making in our e-commerce customer experience, assortment and supply chain. We're leveraging technology to strengthen our e-commerce and mobile capabilities and integrating these digital assets with our more than 11,000 stores globally.
Overall, e-commerce sales grew approximately 22% in fiscal year 2015, solid but not quite as strong as we wanted. We're striving to balance sales growth and profitability. We're being thoughtful with our investments, ensuring we have the infrastructure in place to build this business for the long term. I'm excited about the possibilities that are in front of us.
One of the headlines in e-commerce is the tremendous growth from mobile devices. In fact, nearly 70% of Walmart.com traffic in the U.S. came via mobile during the recent holiday period. Customers who previously shopped using their laptops are now using their phones and tablets.
And this isn't just a U.S. trend. For example, traffic from the mobile app in Brazil nearly tripled on the Black Friday holiday. Around the world, we're well positioned to create a strong mobile experience for customers this year and beyond.
As I reflect back on my first year as CEO, I'm proud of the accomplishments of our associates and leadership team. It's been a period of change for the 2.2 million associates that make up the Walmart team, but it's been inspiring to see our associates rally around our company's purpose.
Last week, more than 5,000 members of our U.S. store leadership gathered for our annual year beginning meeting. I heard directly from our store managers how we could help them run better stores. And similar meetings are occurring around the world. Regardless of our responsibility, we're in this together. Each of us has a role to play in making our customers' shopping experience a great one. Our secret to success continues to be that we're all working together.
We've made a lot of progress on bringing strategic clarity and in reinvigorating our commitment to run better businesses today. Retail is changing so quickly that we must move with greater urgency to stay out in front.
I like the passion that I'm seeing from our leadership team as they work together to shape and deliver our enterprise strategy. We're thinking differently about retail and about the world. This drives our approach to global responsibility in areas like environmental sustainability, women's economic empowerment and offering healthy food choices. It's important work and it matters to our customers and shareholders. We remain steadfast in our commitment to compliance, ethics and doing the right thing. I'm pleased with the technology enhancements we've made to strengthen these organizations.
As I close my remarks, let me reiterate that I'm proud of what we accomplished this past year, but I'm more excited about what lies ahead. The deliberate strategic choices that we're making around investments in our associates and e-commerce capabilities will improve the customer experience. And we believe that shareholders will also benefit from these investments in the future. Now I'll turn it over to Claire. Claire?"

Further details are available in the accompanying presentation posted today with this transcript. Before I begin, let me remind you that last year, the company's fourth quarter and fiscal 2014 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Walmart, EPS, were negatively impacted by certain discrete items totaling $0.26.
The company's fourth quarter and fiscal 2015 EPS were negatively impacted by discrete items totaling $0.08. A wage and hour litigation matter previously disclosed resulted in a charge of $0.05 per share, and store closures in Japan resulted in a charge of $0.03 per share. A reconciliation of the company's underlying EPS is included in our earnings press release issued prior to the call. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, underlying EPS was $1.61 compared to last year's underlying EPS of $1.60. Reported EPS was $1.53 compared to last year's EPS of $1.34.
As you can see on Slide 2, total revenue for the fourth quarter was $131.6 billion. Consolidated net sales increased $1.9 billion or 1.4%, and membership and other income declined 0.5%. Recall that during the fourth quarter of last year, membership and other income was positively impacted by a $24 million gain from the sale of certain U.S. real estate assets.
Total revenue for the year grew to $485.7 billion as consolidated net sales increased $9.2 billion or 1.9% and membership and other income grew 6.3%. Consolidated operating expenses increased 0.5% for the quarter and 2.3% for the full year.
It is important to remember that operating expenses were negatively impacted in the fourth quarter and for the full year by the discrete items I mentioned earlier. Additionally, FCPA and compliance-related costs were $36 million in the fourth quarter, comprised of $26 million for the ongoing inquiries and investigation and $10 million for our global compliance program and organizational enhancements.
For the full year, FCPA and compliance-related costs were $173 million, comprised of $121 million for the ongoing inquiries and investigations and $52 million for our global compliance program and organizational enhancements. Last year, total FCPA and compliance-related costs were $282 million.
The company's consolidated operating income increased 8.2% during the fourth quarter. Last year's fourth quarter operating income was negatively impacted by the discrete items I mentioned earlier. Fiscal year 2015 operating income increased 1%.
Net interest expense increased 5.8% for the quarter and 6% for the year. The increase for each period was primarily driven by a higher weighted average interest rate on net borrowings.
From a balance sheet perspective, consolidated inventory increased 0.6%. Later in today's call, you'll hear more about inventory from our segment leaders. Payables as a percentage of inventory were 85.1%, which compares to 83.4% last year due primarily to the timing of payments. Improving inventory leverage is important, and we are seeing progress as the company continues to focus on this priority.
We ended the year with capital expenditures of $12.2 billion, slightly below our range of $12.5 billion to $13 billion. For the year, the company added approximately 33 million retail square feet through 511 net new expanded and relocated units. This was in line with the updated guidance we shared in October.
Finally, let's address returns. ROI for the trailing 12 months ended January 31, 2015, was 16.9%, relatively flat compared to 17% for the prior comparable period. The slight change in ROI was primarily due to continued investments in store growth and e-commerce initiatives, offset by currency exchange rate fluctuations.
For the full year, the company returned $7.2 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. And we ended the year with free cash flow of $16.4 billion compared to $10.1 billion last year. Now I'll turn the call over to Greg. Greg?"

When I joined the Walmart U.S. team 6 months ago, we laid out specific objectives for the second half of fiscal 2015. We knew we needed to become better store managers to fix some of the basics in our stores. We spent the last several months focusing on core fundamentals such as inventory, merchandise returns, shrink, markdowns and wage management.
By focusing on these urgent agenda items and using the tailwinds we've seen from an improving economy, we drove positive momentum in our business. We achieved what we set out to do in the short term, but we're not satisfied and recognize that we have more work to do to accomplish our longer-term goals.
Before discussing our results, I want to provide more detail on the exciting announcement we made this morning regarding associate pay and store structure. As Doug mentioned, we believe our people make the difference, and we're committed to this philosophy. At Walmart, we already provide an opportunity for jobs to become careers in retail. We want to continue to improve that opportunity and to provide it to more associates. The changes we are making are based on our core principles and will make Walmart a better place to work and shop.
First, we believe associates equally value their hourly rate and hours worked. We're happy to announce improvements to both aspects of associates' earnings opportunity. Current and future associates will benefit from this initiative, which ensures that Walmart hourly associates earn at least $1.75 above today's federal minimum wage or $9 per hour in April. And current associates will earn $10 per hour or higher by next February.
Additionally, we are piloting a scheduling system that will create stability for associates who want predictable hours and the flexibility for those who prefer to select additional shifts to meet customers' needs each week. Starting in 2016, we will be one of the first retailers to offer some associates fixed hours each week.
Next, we are realigning our store operational structure, adding back department managers to give associates a closer relationship with their supervisors to help improve communication, direction and recognition.
And finally, we are making new commitments to train associates. They will engage in interactive learning programs to build skills, demonstrate proficiency and be rewarded for their efforts through pay raises and promotions into areas of greater responsibility.
We will also offer opportunities to pursue further education, including a high school diploma or GED program, access to language training and free or low-cost college credits to reduce the time and cost of a college education.
I want to say thank you to all our 1.2 million Walmart U.S. associates. Together, we're part of something bigger than ourselves and bigger than our company. What we do at Walmart extends beyond our stores to our own communities and across this country. I'm thankful to be a part of this organization.
Now let's move to this quarter's performance. Net sales grew $3.1 billion or 4.1% versus last year. For the 13-week period ended January 30, comparable store sales were up 1.5%, which exceeded our guidance. This represents an approximate 100 basis point improvement over Q3 and was largely driven by a 1.4% improvement in traffic.
This quarter marks the first positive traffic comp since Q3 of fiscal year 2013 as customers saw increased purchasing power from lower gas prices. We also lapped the SNAP reductions and unfavorable weather seen last year. E-commerce contributed approximately 30 basis points to our comp performance.
During the 6-week holiday season, we experienced overall comp sales growth. We saw increased traffic to the store, aided by our broadcast and digital holiday hub marketing campaign. Strong sales of seasonal merchandise and toys, along with key brands and gifts in apparel and home, offset industry declines in entertainment.
Customers also continued to refine how they prepared for the holidays, shopping earlier in November for holiday deals and looking for last-minute gift ideas all the way through Christmas Eve. We were ready when and where our customers needed us, completing almost 1 billion total transactions over the holiday season including our largest online day ever on Cyber Monday.
Looking across the entire fourth quarter, our growth in comp sales was attributable to several key areas of the business. First, we remained pleased by our apparel and home businesses, which brought value to the customers through strong national brands, consistent quality across price points and relevant products at the right time of the season.
Second, our health and wellness business, including optical, remained strong, with growth in script counts from higher penetration in Medicare and Medicaid plans, branded drug inflation and a strengthening over-the-counter business.
Third, while our grocery performance was assisted primarily by inflation and lapping last year's SNAP reductions, we also saw progress from urgent agenda items, including a focus on adding days of freshness in produce. We still have a long way to go to improve our fresh business and remain focused on this goal.
And finally, we saw strong performance from our Neighborhood Market format. While all formats experienced positive sales comps, our traditional Neighborhood Markets continue to outperform Walmart Supercenters and discount stores, providing customers with the products and services they desire at locations that are convenient to them. Our traditional Neighborhood Markets delivered approximately a 7.7% comp for the quarter.
Yet while we saw a positive momentum in these categories, we remain challenged in others, specifically declines in our entertainment business persisted as we faced industry contraction and deflation across many categories. Lapping last year's gaming console releases, along with fewer video game titles available for new consoles and shifts from physical to digital media in movies and books, drove high single-digit negative comps in this area.
Additionally, although we launched wireless installment plans in November, we're still ramping up this service as we reacquaint customers with our ability to serve them in this category. Finally, softness in electronics also impacted our online business, particularly in the ship-to-home channel.
In e-commerce, we remain thoughtful about growth, striving to produce sustainable results through digital and physical access. Our focus on serving customers lead to strong performance in Pick Up Today and Ship from Store capabilities, particularly during the holiday season. However, we recognize the significant opportunity we have to grow this area of our business as customers continue to reshape their shopping behaviors.
Now for the remainder of our financial results. In the fourth quarter, gross profit rate was relatively flat. Operating expenses increased 5.6%, driven primarily by changes in estimates associated with our incentive accrual versus last year. Additionally, we intensified our focus on improving customer experience in our stores.
While these actions increased costs, we believe it was the right decision for the customer. In fact, our Checkout Promise program drove customer experience satisfaction scores to their highest level during the holiday season. Due to the success of this program, we are implementing it more broadly in fiscal 2016. Overall, operating income declined approximately 60 basis points for the quarter.
Inventory growth moderated from prior quarters, growing 3.9% and less than the rate of sales in Q4. This growth was primarily related to the significant number of new store openings in the quarter. In fact, we opened 178 stores in this quarter alone, including 10 Supercenters and 168 traditional and small format Neighborhood Markets.
Comp store inventory improved in this quarter, driven by a strong holiday sell-through and better aligned seasonal markdowns in apparel. Inventory management is a key element to customer experience. And whilst we have room for improvement, we are also making progress to better manage working capital.
Now let me cover our full year financial performance. For the year, net sales increased 3.1% or $8.6 billion to $288 billion. Comp sales improved 0.5% for the 52-week period ended January 30, while operating income declined 2.1% to $21.3 billion. Gross profit improved 2.6% for the year, with a 12 basis point decline in gross profit rate. This was primarily driven by price investments in meat and preferred Medicare prescription plans. 
Expenses were up 4.3%, deleveraging 24 basis points for the year and driven primarily by increased health care costs from higher enrollment rates and medical cost inflation. Expenses were further deleveraged by the initial ramp-up of 17 new medical care clinics, increased utility expenses from cold weather early in the year and higher rates throughout the year and declining rates in recyclable materials such as cardboard. Recall that we get a financial benefit from recycled materials.
Moving to real estate. We opened 353 net new stores, including relocations and expansions and added almost 21 million retail square feet. 1 year ago, we started to accelerate our Neighborhood Market format. This fiscal year, we opened 165 traditional format Neighborhood Markets and 68 smaller Neighborhood Markets.
By continuing to drive this format, we're able to offer customers easy and convenient access to fresh foods, pharmacy and services at Walmart's Every Day Low Price guarantee. Supercenters remain the driver of our sales and growth in retail square footage. Customers continue to rely heavily on this format for their broader shopping needs.
This year, we opened an additional 119 Supercenters including conversions and relocations. In FY '16, we expect to open approximately 60 to 70 Supercenters including relocations and expansions. Additionally, we'll open an estimated 180 to 200 Neighborhood Markets, including 10 to 15 smaller format locations as we complete our openings of this test program. We'll continue to monitor the progress of these test locations before making any further commitments to this format. We expect to add approximately 15 million to 16 million retail square feet this year.
Digital access is important to our customers now more than ever. They expect a seamless interaction whether it's in the store or online. We see many opportunities at Walmart to evolve with the customer in their digital and physical experiences.
For example, this year, we developed a collaborative approach to the holiday season in toys with our store and Walmart.com teams working closely together to ensure our customers had the same experience with Walmart no matter where or when they shopped. We've been investing in expanding capabilities to allow customers to shop on their own terms and are moving sensibly towards this integration of digital and physical.
This includes offering customers a variety of ways to interact with our brand, including picking up their Walmart.com orders at their local store, providing reminders and refill capabilities through our pharmacy app and our latest test concept, Walmart Grocery.
This year, we expanded grocery delivery and pickup tests to include the entire Denver market and launched Walmart Grocery Pickup here in Northwest Arkansas this past October. And just last week, we announced the expansion of Walmart Grocery online to select locations in the Phoenix, Arizona and Huntsville, Alabama markets. 
We have an advantage at Walmart by combining our store and distribution network with our e-commerce capabilities to allow our customers to interact with our brand in ways that are most convenient for them. Whether it's in a store, online or on our mobile app, we are focused on providing the best solutions for customers.
The upcoming fiscal year will be a time of change and further improvement to the business. Our focus on inventory management, in-stock levels and customer service is just the beginning.
Recently, we made changes within our management team. These changes have allowed me to get closer to our merchandising teams, and the new leadership brings with them fresh ideas and an invigorating spirit. We've also just wrapped up our year beginning meeting, which is a time to gather our store managers to thank them for their hard work in the prior year and to discuss the focus areas for the upcoming year.
The meeting was energizing and our store managers left excited for a fresh start, to become better store managers, focusing on item merchandising and providing great service to the customer.
We'll continue on the path towards hiring 100,000 veterans by 2018. We set this goal just under 2 years ago. And we're proud to say that we've already hired almost 80,000 veterans through this program. Furthermore, over 6,000 have been promoted to roles of greater responsibility since joining the Walmart team.
But fiscal 2016 will not be without its challenges. Our bottom line will continue to be pressured primarily from the significant investments in associates that I covered earlier. In addition, we will see impact from the changing mix within merchandise categories, store formats and retail channels and the investments in digital and physical integration. While we expect to offset some of these headwinds by executing and delivering on our urgent agenda items and other initiatives, we know these investments are necessary to position ourselves to meet the rapidly changing needs of the customer.
We may see risk to import merchandise flows related to the upcoming spring and Easter seasons due to ongoing port congestion. We'll continue to take the appropriate steps using our diversified supply chain network to reduce the impact for our customers.
In the first quarter, we expect a continuation of lower gas prices to provide a tailwind to our business. This could be somewhat offset by a shorter selling season, with Easter coming earlier than last year, as well as potential impact from port congestion. For the 13-week period ending May 1, we anticipate a comp sales increase of 1% to 2%. Last year's 13-week comp ended May 2, 2014, was down 8 basis points.
Now I'll turn it over to Dave for an update on Walmart International. Dave?"

I'm pleased with our performance in International as we've remained committed to the strategic priorities I outlined 1 year ago. We've been able to produce solid results and operating income growth despite operating in a very challenging",1802,"Thank you, Greg. I'm pleased with our performance in International as we've remained committed to the strategic priorities I outlined 1 year ago. We've been able to produce solid results and operating income growth despite operating in a very challenging competitive retail environment.
As one of our key priorities, we continue to accelerate our e-commerce business by offering multiple ways for our customers to shop. Whether in stores, online, pickup or mobile, we aim to give our customers the ability to shop in whichever way they want.
We've also made progress in building a platform for sustainable growth in China and have experienced success in improving our overall price perception as well as the quality of our fresh offering. We also continued to make progress on our commitment of actively managing our existing portfolio.
You've seen us make strategic decisions such as closing underperforming stores and divesting noncore parts of our business in order to strengthen our foundation. Our markets remain focused on key strategic priorities, and I'm optimistic about our position going forward into the new year.
Now for our financial results. In the fourth quarter, net sales grew 3% on a constant currency basis. However, with the U.S. dollar at historic highs, we faced significant currency headwinds of $2.6 billion, resulting in a 3.9% sales decline on a reported basis.
Of our 5 largest countries, Mexico, Canada and Brazil delivered positive comp sales for the quarter. Comps declined in both the U.K. and China due primarily to food deflation and intense competition in the U.K. and government austerity measures and deflation in key categories in China.
Comp sales growth was strong in all other markets as well. As Claire mentioned, there were certain discrete items disclosed in the previous year, which have a significant impact on our year-over-year operating income comparison. For financial year ending '15, our fourth quarter results were negatively impacted by Japan store closure costs of $148 million.
Overall, operating income increased 79.6% on a constant currency basis and 66.4% on a reported basis. Excluding the previous and current years' discrete items, we grew operating income on a constant currency basis by 14.2%.
For the full year, sales grew 3.6% on a constant currency basis, while the strong U.S. dollar resulted in a full year sales decline of 0.3% on a reported basis, reflecting over a $5 billion currency impact. Full year operating income grew 24.1% on a constant currency basis and 19.8% on a reported basis. Excluding the items mentioned above, operating income grew 9.3% on a constant currency basis, outpacing full year sales growth.
We made progress in reducing inventory levels during the quarter and dropped the growth rate over 250 basis points versus the previous quarter to a 4.6% growth on a constant currency basis. We had positive momentum on inventory management heading into the new year. 
Now let's discuss individual results for our largest markets. Comp sales and growth rates are presented on a constant currency basis only. In all countries except Brazil and China, results are inclusive of e-commerce. Slides 8 and 9 of the presentation summarize financial details.
The U.K. market remained very competitive during the quarter, with grocery inflation falling to a record low of negative 0.9% over the 12 weeks ended January 4, according to Kantar. Total market growth of 0.6% was a slight improvement over the previous quarter, boosted by Christmas sales and increased discretionary spending from lower fuel prices. However, overall market trends remain relatively weak. According to Kantar, Asda, along with the other big grocers, lost share to hard discounters for the quarter.
U.K. sales declined 1.7% and comp sales declined 2.5%, excluding fuel. Several competitors held a Black Friday event for the first time, and others continued intense vouchering, which led to increased competition versus 1 year ago. Asda online sales remained strong, while George home continued to register double-digit growth. Despite the top line pressures, Asda was able to grow income ahead of sales.
Now turning to Canada, which had a very solid fourth quarter performance. Sales grew 4.1%, with comp sales increasing 1.8%, marking this the third consecutive quarter of positive comps. Price investments and increased consumer spending contributed to improved trends in sales.
We reported strong comp sales in food, health and wellness and consumables. While general merchandise and apparel sales improved versus prior quarter results, they were still below the rate of growth in the market.
Our fresh business also continues to accelerate, resulting in the highest comp sales for the year in quarter 4. Canada had a strong holiday season overall, with the online business up 38.5%. Walmart Canada grew 43 basis points of market share in food, consumables and health and wellness combined, as reported by Nielsen for the 12-week period ending January 24.
Canada completed a restructuring in the quarter to simplify home office operations. This, along with continued investments in e-commerce and pricing, resulted in a decline in operating income. Overall, we're pleased with the positive sales trend we've seen in our Canadian operations and we expect momentum to continue.
Next, we'll discuss Walmex, which released their quarterly results on February 17. Please note the Walmex release is under IFRS and the results here are under U.S. GAAP. Thus, some numbers will differ.
Consolidated Walmex sales grew 3.4%, with positive comp sales in both Mexico and Central America. Walmex leveraged expenses for the quarter and grew operating income faster than sales. Mexico sales increased 3%, and the comp sales were up 0.1% for the quarter.
According to ANTAD, the entire market experienced slower comp growth in the fourth quarter of 0.7% in self-service. Walmart Mexico comps, excluding Sam's Club, exceeded the market by 80 basis points. Performance was especially strong in our small format Bodega Aurrera Express, which outperformed the market by 750 basis points.
Sam's Club growth lagged the market by approximately 330 basis points. However, we're encouraged by the improving top line trends at Sam's as December comp sales were the strongest of the year. Sam's Club remains a focus area, and we will continue to accelerate initiatives to improve the business.
Next, let's talk about Brazil. Brazil continued sales momentum in Q4, growing net sales and comp sales by 3.1%. Holiday sales were driven by strong performances in both food and consumables. Strategic and targeted pricing resulted in margin favorability for the quarter. Management also continued to drive labor productivity and control expenses. While we are seeing some positive results, there's still work to be done in our turnaround plan.
Moving to China. Ongoing headwinds from government austerity measures, reduction in gift card sales and continued deflation in key categories continued to pose challenges in the market. Walmart China's Q4 net sales declined 0.7%, and comp sales declined 2.3%, partially due to Chinese New Year falling nearly 3 weeks later than last year.
We increased market share in the hypermarket category for the eighth consecutive quarter according to Nielsen for the period ended December 31. We expect market headwinds to continue in the new year, but we're confident that we'll continue to accelerate growth in this important market.
Over the year, China has made great progress in strengthening the core business. Our portfolio is now more focused and stronger with the opening of 24 new hypermarket stores and 1 additional Sam's Club, in addition to completing the store closure program announced last year. The distribution center expansion project and the centralization of deliveries to DCs were finalized within the quarter, resulting in a distribution network for fresh that provides coverage for all of our stores in China for the first time.
These initiatives drive efficiency, reduce costs and shorten the lead time to get products on the shelf. Having control over our own distribution network allows us to better monitor the quality and the safety of our products. Additionally, the We Operate for Less and the We Buy for Less programs in China have saved over $150 million over the course of the year.
Finally, let's discuss e-commerce performance across the globe. We remain focused on innovating and providing solutions for our customers seeking convenience. This quarter, we made even more progress and I'm very excited about the impact we've made in online retail.
In Japan, we automated the order picking process to fulfill Seiyu.com grocery orders more efficiently and sustainably. We're testing new offerings such as grab-and-go lockers in Canada. In India, we're continuing the rollout of online offering to business-to-business members and expect to reach all members by the end of next year.
Yihaodian, our e-commerce business in China, benefited from investments in the supply chain and promotional events. Traffic increased more than 40% and average ticket improved as well. The fourth quarter was highlighted by a successful Singles Day promotion in November, generating strong sales and traffic growth, aided by an increase in orders from mobile devices.
In Brazil, e-commerce sales growth was strong again this quarter, driven by strong sales in large appliances and wireless, where low-cost smartphones helped drive sales growth of more than double the same period last year. Promotions fueled sales growth, with the Black Friday and 72-hour events delivering strong comp sales. Traffic via our mobile app nearly tripled on Black Friday.
Looking ahead, we will continue to innovate and execute our strategic plan. I'm amazed by how similar our customers' needs are around the world. Value, assortment and convenience are paramount. We remain focused on saving our customers' money by expanding our private label offering, improving product sourcing and driving costs out of our operations so that we can invest it back into price.
We know convenience means different things to customers at different times. It could mean shopping online, home grocery delivery, a one-stop shop experience or a drive-through pickup, and we're innovating to provide customers more shopping options than ever. No matter the shopper's preference, Walmart will continue to strive to be the destination of choice.
Our objectives for this year will continue to build upon a foundation that's been established. In financial year ending '16, we're committed to: actively managing the existing portfolio; driving comp sales; accelerating e-commerce; delivering market priorities, including establishing a platform for sustainable growth in China; moving forward with the turnaround efforts in Brazil and reenergizing the business in Mexico; and lastly, strengthening enablers, which means being the lowest-cost operator, building world-class talent and building trust.
Let me close by thanking our nearly 800,000 international associates around the world for delivering a strong performance in financial year ending '15. As I reflect on the past year, I'm humbled by what our team has accomplished and their relentless focus on saving customers' money. I look forward to updating you on our results in the coming months. Now I'll turn it over to Roz for the update on Sam's. Roz?"
313055,274781377,766202,"Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Q4 2015 Pre Recorded Earnings Call, Feb 19, 2015",2015-02-19,"Earnings Calls","Walmart Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Dave.

I'd like to start by echoing our excitement at Sam's Club regarding the company's announcement today to boost the starting wage for our full-time and part-time hourly associates. We believe we provide our associates with an excellent opportunity to pursue careers in retail.
Because our business model at Sam's Club differs from Walmart stores, beginning in the first half of the fiscal year, we will offer a starting hourly wage of $9.50, which is above the federal minimum wage unless there is a higher state-mandated minimum wage. This will ensure all Sam's Club hourly associates are paid above the federal minimum wage. We believe this investment in our associates will help us to attract, retain and develop top-notch talent and will allow us to continue to deliver outstanding, award-winning service to our members.
Now on to Q4. I want to thank our Sam's Club associates for delivering the best performance of the year this quarter, providing momentum going into fiscal '16. Over the last 4 quarters, we saw meaningful acceleration, culminating in a comp sales increase, without fuel, of 2% for the 13-week period ended January 30. Strong holiday execution, combined with our strategic investments in member value, merchandise relevance and the integration of digital and physical, boosted our performance.
Our investments in membership value initiatives enabled us to grow our membership income by over 8% this quarter. Our Plus penetration is at historic highs as Plus members are seeing the benefits from our Cash Rewards program.
Across the club, all members are seeing the benefits of Instant Savings and the 5-3-1 MasterCard. We will anniversary the introduction of Plus Cash Rewards and the 5-3-1 MasterCard in June 2015, so we expect these programs to continue driving membership income moving forward.
Sam's net sales including fuel were $14.9 billion, up 1.3% over last year. This was impacted by the approximately 25% decline in fuel prices, with gallons sold up approximately 8%. Our gross profit rate increased 23 basis points due to higher margin on fuel. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales decreased by 50 basis points.
Operating income increased 29.1% to $510 million, which includes a $41 million increase in fuel profit. Our 500-plus fuel stations provided value to members through competitive pricing, and the 5-3-1 MasterCard holders benefit from an additional 5% off all gas purchases.
Given the volatility in fuel prices, the remainder of this discussion will exclude fuel. Additionally, for comparisons, please recall that last year, we have certain items impacting our results which included: a $39 million charge to gross profit due to an adjustment to our product warranty liabilities; a $59 million charge to operating expenses for a new in-club staffing restructuring and the closure of 1 club; a $24 million gain in other income for the sale of 2 real estate properties.
In Q4, net sales grew 3.7% and we delivered comp sales of 2%, driven by traffic growth of 1.5% and ticket of 0.5%.
The Savings member continues to drive traffic. We have lapped last year's SNAP reductions and benefited from favorable weather this quarter. Retail inflation across the club has moderated slightly since the previous quarter.
Our gross profit declined 32 basis points versus last year due to the planned impact of Plus Cash Rewards and pressure from merchandise mix, which were offset by last year's product warranty charge. Without the comparative benefit of the product warranty charge last year, gross profit declined 61 basis points. As discussed previously, the rollout of Plus Cash Rewards will pressure gross profit in the first half of fiscal year 2016. 
Operating expenses were well managed in the quarter and we leveraged 82 basis points. Even without the comparative benefit of last year's discrete items, we leveraged expenses. We had disciplined expense management in a number of areas, including the optimization of the club staffing model earlier this year.
Membership and other income grew by 1.4% compared to last year, which factors in the real estate gain. Without the $24 million real estate gain last year, membership and other income was up 8.7%.
Operating income was up 19.4% to $456 million. Without the comparative benefit of last year's items, our operating income was flat to last year. We are still very happy with our overall performance for the quarter, given the significant investments in membership value initiatives such as Plus Cash Rewards, and with good expense management and improvements in membership income, we believe we have great momentum for fiscal 2016.
I also want to highlight the team's efforts around working capital. We reduced total inventory by 3.5% while simultaneously growing our fleet by 16 clubs during the year. Moreover, I am confident in the quality of our inventory for this year.
At Sam's Club, relevant merchandise is a critical component in member engagement, and we continue to improve performance across the box. Our merchants are pushing hard to introduce newness and capture consumer trends while providing the price leadership and assortment that Sam's Club is known for.
Sales of our fresh food business grew positive low single digits this quarter. Performance was led by meat, due to inflation and a strong value proposition. A challenged area was produce, where weather created supply issues. Dry grocery and beverage delivered a positive low single-digit comp, with highlights in newness and healthy-for-you items. We doubled the organic portfolio since the previous quarter, and members are responding positively to new, healthy beverage options.
Let's continue with health and wellness, which posted a positive mid-single-digit comp. Sam's Club is a destination for our members' health care needs, and we see that clearly in our pharmacy comps, which drove the category due to both script growth and branded prescription inflation. Our OTC business, especially our healthy assortment of nutrition bars and protein, also did well.
We've seen an uptick in our consumables business, which posted a positive low single-digit comp. This is an area where members consistently see value through our private brand offerings, improved pack sizes and Instant Savings. For example, members love the quality of our private brand Member's Mark paper products. The disposable tabletop category continues to perform well, and we have introduced newness to improve the laundry and home care business.
Home and apparel delivered a positive low single-digit comp. Our exciting assortment of toys was a highlight, drawing members into the club over the holidays. Apparel continues to show strength, driven by men's wear and children's clothing.
Our underperforming category continues to be technology and entertainment, which posted a negative mid-single-digit comp. This is an improvement versus last quarter as a result of introducing the latest Ultra Hi-Def and 4K TV technologies, a strong value proposition on the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus and an expanded wearables assortment. However, we need to make larger, faster strides. This year, our merchants are rebalancing the portfolio, which involves reallocating resources towards higher growth, higher excitement categories.
Ancillary improved to a positive low single-digit comp, driven by growth in tobacco. We saw improved convenience store traffic trends as we executed strategic pricing initiatives and benefited from shifts in the competitive landscape.
Moving to e-commerce. This quarter, SamsClub.com was integral in supporting our in-club holiday events, becoming a Cyber Week destination and offering online-only promotions that drew members from our physical clubs to our digital platforms. Dotcom delivered double-digit comps in both direct-to-home and Club Pickup, contributing approximately 40 basis points to the segment comp.
We've rebranded Click 'n' Pull to Club Pickup and enhanced the service to appeal to both Savings and business members. Members have responded well to the relaunch of Club Pickup in all clubs, and we've seen accelerated performance compared to the previous quarter.
The improvements we've made to our mobile and desktop platforms, along with enhancements in messaging, have boosted conversion rates across all platforms. This concludes our discussion on fourth quarter results. Let's continue with the financial results for the full year where we've seen meaningful sustainable acceleration every quarter.
With fuel, net sales were $58 billion, up 1.5% over last year. With fuel profit of $122 million, operating income for the year grew 7.2% to $2 billion. Net sales, excluding fuel, were $51.6 billion, up 2.1%. For the 52-week period ending January 30, 2015, comp sales increased 50 basis points, driven by traffic.
While our investments in Cash Rewards for Plus members led to a gross profit rate decline of 38 basis points, we managed expenses well and leveraged 24 basis points. Membership income increased 10.3%, driving operating income of $1.9 billion, a 2% increase over last year.
Fiscal 2016 is well under way and Sam's Club is innovating the member experience through merchandise relevance and digital-physical integration. These 2 priorities are the key to membership engagement. I am confident that our strategic investments will not only differentiate us from our competitors but more importantly continue enhancing our members' trust and loyalty.
Merchandise relevance is a critical enabler. Our goal is to ensure that members are surprised and delighted by relevant merchandise every time they come into the club or visit our website in every category across the country. Combined with price leadership and newness, merchandise relevance will keep our members coming back for more.
Our fiscal '16 investment strategy reflects the importance of offering a seamless digital-physical club experience for members. I recently was at the grand opening of our new e-commerce facility in San Bruno, California where Jamie Iannone, who leads SamsClub.com, has invested in expanding his team of engineers and scientists.
I am optimistic about our growth opportunities in both the digital and the physical, and that's why we plan to open 9 to 12 new and relocated clubs and remodel between 55 and 60 clubs this year while simultaneously investing in innovation at SamsClub.com.
Knowing that our most engaged members want to shop with us both in our clubs and online, we will ensure a seamless set of access points for members. I am proud of how we finished out the year. For the 13-week period from January 31 through May 1, we expect comp sales to increase between 1% and 2%.
Now I'll turn things over to Neil for the e-commerce update. Neil?"

Q4 was an important quarter for us, not just because it is the biggest quarter of the fiscal year but because our key investments started to play a major role in the business. Most notably, our global technology platform, Pangaea, and our U.S. fulfillment network, stood up under the holiday volumes of U.S. customers.
At the same time, we saw good sales in markets around the world. For the full year and for Q4, we outgrew the e-commerce market globally. Overall, Walmart grew e-commerce sales by 22%, benefited by a 25% increase in gross merchandise value or GMV for the year. In Q4, we grew sales 18% on GMV growth of 20%. An increase in third-party marketplace volumes in the U.S., Brazil and in China contributed to the growth in GMV.
Greg, Dave and Roz talked about the e-commerce successes in the quarter but it's worth recapping. In the U.S., we had record sales on Cyber Monday and Cyber Week and more than 1.5 billion page views over the 5 days between Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday.
SamsClub.com had strong double-digit comps on Thanksgiving and on Black Friday. On Singles Day in China on November 11, Yihaodian's GMV growth was in the high double digits. And on December 21, we surpassed traffic from Singles Day.
In the U.K., Asda continued to make Click & Collect easier for customers in stores and with new pick up points at petrol stations, tube stations and other locations. We now have Click & Collect in all Asda stores. In Brazil, we saw our strongest sales quarter, with high double-digit sales growth.
What excites me most is the progress we've made in building out our ability to serve customers across digital and physical. We're investing in 4 areas: our global technology platform, our next-generation fulfillment network, our talent and on integrating digital and physical.
Starting with our global technology platform. I refer to this as the operating system for commerce because it is the foundation for serving customers digitally and enables the integration of digital and physical commerce. Building and deploying a new platform is one of the most challenging projects for an e-commerce business, particularly at our scale.
We launched most key elements of our site and mobile shopping experience on the new platform before holiday on Walmart.com in the U.S. Despite all of our testing, with the sheer complexity of a complete platform rebuild, there is nothing like the real thing on the busiest day of the year, Cyber Monday. Pangaea hummed along all day, serving our customers at record volume.
While we were glued to our screens watching performance, a mom in Dallas was glued to her screen on Walmart.com, crossing items off her holiday shopping list. She was most likely shopping on a tablet and she was browsing pages about 30% faster, thanks to Pangaea.
She was seeing a personalized shopping experience with a lot more recommendations for items that her kids might like. Hers was among a record number of orders. It was the first major test of our next-generation fulfillment network, which combined our first large-scale center in Texas with our existing fulfillment centers, distribution centers and stores to ship a record number of Walmart.com orders.
Our team in Texas shipped twice as many orders as last year. She was able to get more things from us even faster. Starting in the second quarter, we have 4 more of these large-scale fulfillment centers coming online. While there will be some ramp-up time, they will significantly expand our fulfillment capacity and efficiency in the coming years.
We've talked about the importance of investing in talent and the fact that we are building a technology company inside the world's largest retailer. In the past year, we have been able to build up our team to the critical mass needed to be that technology company. And we did it in a very selective way, bringing in some of the best talent in Silicon Valley through organic hiring and targeted acquisitions. We also built a great team in Silicon Valley to serve Sam's Club across digital and physical. We'll be continuing to hire the best people, adding to the core team we've built to deliver on our priorities.
When we were together at the analyst meeting in October, I talked through the story of a family in Denver who can rely on Walmart to make their lives easier by being everywhere they need us to be. Echoing Greg, I'm really proud of how we brought together the digital and physical customer experience during the holidays.
In the U.S., we created a series of moments that engaged customers with us, both online and in stores, starting with online deals Thanksgiving morning, leading to the Black Friday store events and through the new evening edition on Cyber Monday for people who worked during the day.
Mobile continued to be a big investment and area of high growth. Nearly 70% of our Walmart.com traffic during the holidays was from mobile devices. Those people used the app in a lot of ways, to do their shopping online, to find a store or to use the new store search tool we added late last year. This search tool allows customers to find product details and the aisle location of a specific item.
Sam's also offered a significantly enhanced shopping experience through its app and mobile website. In addition to Walmart, we focused on Sam's digital and physical integration with its Club Pickup experience, and it paid off as we saw nearly 30% growth in Club Pickup during holiday.
We're also continuing to create a stronger relationship with new and existing customers with grocery pickup and delivery. We've continued to see great feedback from customers on our tests in San Jose and Denver. And last week, we started serving customers in Phoenix, Arizona and Huntsville, Alabama.
To sum up, last year was a building year and that will continue this year. We ended up investing an incremental $0.08 per share during the fiscal year 2015, which was over our forecast of $0.05 to $0.07 as we continue to invest in fulfillment and other areas to serve our customers.
As I mentioned, we saw global sales grow by 22%, benefited by a 25% increase in GMV for the fiscal year. Fiscal year 2016 will continue to be a building year, and we expect sales to grow worldwide in the mid-20s.
In fiscal year 2016, we expect to invest incrementally between $0.06 and $0.09 per share for e-commerce initiatives. Our investments will continue to significantly enhance the customer experience and drive greater efficiency.
This will include the continued rollout of our U.S. site based on Pangaea, which will make checkout faster and easier for our customers. It is also serving as a backbone to an integrated experience across online, stores and mobile. It will empower new ways to serve customers through mobile.
That platform will also allow us to further expand our online assortment. We'll do that through a thoughtful balance of our own merchandise and marketplace sellers. We expect to double our assortment this year to well over 10 million SKUs.
We'll also continue fulfilling our promise to deliver orders to customers when and where they want them. Our next-generation fulfillment network combines new large-scale fulfillment centers that combine with our DCs and stores all connected by Walmart's transportation network.
Our data scientists have built algorithms that dictate the assortment that needs to be placed in our different nodes and to dictate from which node we ship and order. 4 new fulfillment centers will come online starting in the second quarter. When fully operational, these centers, along with our other nodes, will position us to serve the vast majority of the U.S. population fast and at a low cost.
We're working closely with Greg's team to deliver a seamless experience for customers who use our stores to pick up or return orders. And we're working with Roz's team to continue enhancing Sam's Club Pickup and making reordering fast and simple.
Sam's will also make signing up easier and make membership even more valuable with services and by helping members discover new products. Sam's will have the ability to leverage Walmart's investment in e-commerce.
At the same time, we'll continue to invest in the major markets for e-commerce, most notably Brazil, China and the U.K. And we'll continue to expand our relationship with customers through online grocery pickup and delivery. All of these achievements from this quarter significantly improved our ability to serve customers however they want to shop with us. And many of our investments from last year will roll out this year.
We have significant opportunities ahead, and I feel great about the progress we've made on our priorities, including our global technology platform, talent, next-generation fulfillment network and the integration of digital and physical. We are delivering Walmart where you are, whether you shop online, through mobile or in stores. No matter how you shop, we're helping you save money and live better.
Now I'll hand it over to Charles. Charles?"

I'll wrap up today's discussion by providing some thoughts on the company's performance. For the year, we delivered $486 billion in revenue. E-commerce sales grew approximately 22% to more than $12 billion.We delivered fourth quarter under",1061,"Thanks, Neil. I'll wrap up today's discussion by providing some thoughts on the company's performance. For the year, we delivered $486 billion in revenue. E-commerce sales grew approximately 22% to more than $12 billion.
We delivered fourth quarter underlying earnings per share of $1.61 and reported earnings per share of $1.53. Recall that our underlying earnings per share reflects the performance of our business without the impact of discrete items. Now as a reminder, our fourth quarter guidance of $1.46 to $1.56 included the discrete item of the Japan restructure, which was approximately $0.03 per share.
Walmart U.S. generated a very solid 1.5% comp in the fourth quarter. Although the strong U.S. dollar caused a negative impact of over $5 billion on revenue, Walmart International delivered very good sales growth of nearly 4% on a constant currency basis for the year. And Sam's Club continued to drive membership income again this year with growth of over 10%.
Now on the other hand, as I just mentioned, currency negatively impacted revenue by more than $5 billion. Although not as high as we anticipated, health care expenses were a headwind for Walmart U.S. during the year. And our reported earnings per share were negatively impacted by $0.08 due to the discrete items that Claire mentioned earlier.
Before turning our attention to guidance for the first quarter and for fiscal year 2016, I would like to remind you that our outlook for the future is based on the enterprise strategy we discussed at our October investor conference.
Our clear focus on driving sales through price, assortment, access and experience will continue to guide the investments we make to better serve our customers. Our guidance today assumes several important factors, including the economic conditions in several of our largest markets and currency exchange rates remaining at current levels.
In October, we forecasted a 2% to 4% net sales increase for this new fiscal year. However, as a result of where currency rates are today, we expect a currency headwind of approximately $10 billion on net sales. Our new forecast for fiscal year 2016 net sales growth is between 1% and 2%.
Our capital expenditure guidance of $11.6 billion to $12.9 billion and our total net retail square footage growth of 26 million to 30 million square feet remain unchanged. Also in October, we shared that our capital expenditure range reflects that we will grow through a smaller number of large Supercenters in the U.S. And as previously announced, we are dedicating capital related to our digital and e-commerce businesses of $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion.
In fiscal 2016, we expect our FCPA-related expenses to range between $160 million and $180 million. Recall that these are included in our corporate and support expenses.
Our incremental investment in our Global eCommerce business in fiscal 2015 was approximately $0.08 per share, above the $0.05 to $0.07 per share we shared with you in November. We plan to step up our incremental investment again in fiscal 2016 for our e-commerce activities around the world.
This investment is expected to range between $0.06 and $0.09 per share over fiscal 2015. As I indicated at the October investor conference, the heaviest investment in e-commerce will come over the next 18 to 24 months as we further integrate the shopping experience, appealing to our customers' desire for convenience, access and assortment. We then expect to see operating losses start to moderate at the end of that period. We continue to seek the right balance between sales growth and profitability for e-commerce.
Doug shared the news about our people initiatives within our U.S. businesses, including a wage restructuring and training opportunities to help associates earn higher pay and advance their careers. These strategic investments, which will cost approximately $1 billion this year, are designed to ultimately benefit our customers and our businesses through a better store and club experience.
However, they will impact our earnings per share this fiscal year. In the first quarter, we expect these investments to negatively impact earnings per share by approximately $0.02. The full year earnings per share impact is expected to be approximately $0.20.
In addition to the impact from these 2 significant investments, operating income, like sales, will also be pressured by currency exchange rates of around $0.10 per share. Our earnings per share guidance is based on a fiscal 2016 estimated tax rate ranging between 32% and 34%.
Our tax rate will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter and may be impacted by a number of factors, including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, valuation allowances, changes in law, outcomes of administrative audits, the impacts of discrete items and the mix of earnings among our U.S. and international operations. In any given quarter, our effective tax rate could be higher or lower than the full year range. As we have seen in the past, we expect our first quarter tax rate for fiscal 2016 to be the highest of the 4 quarters.
Taking all of this into account, we expect first quarter fiscal year 2016 earnings per share to range between $0.95 and $1.10. This compares to $1.10 last year. We expect full year earnings per share to range between $4.70 and $5.05. This compares to reported earnings per share of $4.99 in fiscal 2015, which included the discrete items we've discussed.
Now before we wrap up today's call, I would like to address a few additional items. After growth organically or by acquisition, our remaining cash flows provide shareholder returns in the form of dividends and share repurchases.
Today, we announced an increase in our dividend from $1.92 to $1.96 per share for fiscal 2016 to be paid out quarterly. We've now increased our dividend each year for 42 years. We will continue to be opportunistic with share repurchase.
Market conditions, general business trends, operating results and a goal of maintaining our AA credit rating, among other factors, influence our share repurchase activity. Working capital management remains a very high priority for us, and although we have made some improvements in fiscal 2015, we acknowledge we have more work to do. Our leadership teams are very committed to further improvement in fiscal year 2016.
Throughout Walmart, we remain focused on being disciplined in delivering for our associates, our customers and our shareholders. Thank you for listening today and for your continued interest in our company."

This call will contain statements that Walmart believes are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 as amended and that are intended to enjoy the protection of the Safe Harbor for forward-looking statements provided by that act. Please note that a cautionary statement regarding the forward-looking statements will be made following Charles Holley's remarks in this call.
Before we get underway, we apologize for the delay in this morning's release. We normally release our earnings at 6 a.m. Central Time or 7:00 Eastern. However, because we wanted to share some exciting news about our U.S. associates with them first, we delayed the release until now.
So this morning, we have several pieces of news to share with you. First, we have details on the fourth quarter and full year results for fiscal year 2015. Second, as we normally do, we provide guidance for the full year and the first quarter of fiscal 2016. Third, as I mentioned, we're announcing a new wage structure for hourly associates in Walmart U.S. stores and Sam's Clubs. This new initiative, including training and educational programs, will affect current and future hourly associates in the United States. And last, we're announcing our annual dividend for fiscal year 2016. You'll hear more from Doug and our leaders about each of these items.
All materials related to these announcements are available on our corporate website, stock.walmart.com. For earnings, please review together the earnings press release, the transcript of this call and the accompanying slide presentation.
Unit count data, which is updated monthly, are posted separately on the Investors portion of the website under Financial Reporting. As indicated last quarter, it's important to note the definition of a Neighborhood Market. Traditional Neighborhood Markets are grocery stores that average 42,000 square feet. The smaller Neighborhood Markets range in size from 12,000 to 16,000 square feet and are still part of a test concept and not included in comp sales.
As a reminder, for fiscal 2015, which ended January 31, 2015, we utilized a 52-week comp reporting calendar. In Q4, we reported a 13-week comp versus a 14-week comp period reported last year. Our Q4 reporting period began on November 1, 2014, and ran through January 30, 2015.
Consistent with industry practice, we did not adjust the reported fiscal 2015 comps. Comps were based upon 13- and 52-week periods, respectively, compared with 14-week and 53-week periods that we reported in fiscal 2014. We've posted a week-by-week comp reporting calendar under the comp sales link on the Investors portion of our website.
Now recall that last fiscal year's earnings per share were impacted by $0.26 of discrete items. This year, as you'll note in our earnings release and on this call, earnings per share were impacted also by $0.08 of discrete items.
Additional information regarding underlying EPS and other terms used in today's release, including constant currency, gross profit and gross profit rate, are available on our website.
Let's get on with today's call. Doug McMillon, President and CEO of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., will cover key results, an analysis of our successes and challenges and the news about our wage structure changes and training programs. Claire Babineaux-Fontenot, EVP and Treasurer, will provide context for the financial details not included in the accompanying slide presentation.
Then we'll cover the 3 operating segments. Greg Foran, President and CEO of Walmart U.S., followed by Dave Cheesewright, President and CEO of Walmart International, and Rosalind Brewer, President and CEO of Sam's Club. Neil Ashe, President and CEO of Global eCommerce, is joining the call this quarter to provide an analysis of how we did for the year, along with insights on our strategic investments for fiscal year '16. And Charles Holley, Walmart's CFO, will wrap up with an analysis of fiscal year 2015 and guidance for fiscal year 2016.
Now I'm pleased to introduce our CEO, Doug McMillon, to share some exciting news with you today. Doug?"

Overall, we had a good fourth quarter to close out our fiscal year, with underlying earnings per share of $1.61. Walmart U.S. delivered better-than-expected comp sales.

Overall, we had a good fourth quarter to close out our fiscal year, with underlying earnings per share of $1.61. Walmart U.S. delivered better-than-expected comp sales. Sam's Club had its best performance of the year, and Walmart International had solid sales and profitability.
The dedication of our associates around the world to serve customers was evident again in this busy fourth quarter. Now clearly, our sales benefited from customers having more spending power due to lower gas prices in most of our large markets. In addition, product inflation and more favorable weather were a tailwind to U.S. comp sales.
But like many other global companies, we faced significant headwinds from currency exchange fluctuations. So I'm pleased that we delivered fiscal year revenue of nearly $486 billion. But we're not satisfied. We have work to do to grow the business. We know what customers want from a shopping experience, and we're investing strategically to exceed their expectations. Our priority is to run great stores, clubs and e-commerce everywhere we operate. And we'll continue integrating our stores with our e-commerce and mobile commerce business.
One of our most important priorities this year is improving the customer experience. Today, we announced a bold new initiative on pay and training to invest in our U.S. store and club hourly associates. For several months, our leadership teams have been developing and testing new ideas to reward associates for their service to our customers and give them clearer pathways for opportunity.
We're pursuing a comprehensive approach to our hiring, training, compensation, scheduling programs and store management structure that is sustainable over the long term. Approximately 500,000 full-time and part-time associates at Walmart U.S. stores and Sam's Clubs will receive pay raises in the first half of the current fiscal year. Current and future associates will benefit from this initiative, which ensures that Walmart hourly associates earn at least $1.75 above today's federal minimum wage or $9 per hour in April. The following year, by February 1, 2016, current associates will earn at least $10 per hour.
We're also realigning our store operational structure to give associates a closer relationship with their supervisors. Associates will have more ownership over their schedules. In addition, we'll provide them with more resources and training to enable merit-based career advancement and higher levels of pay.
Of course, for a number of years, associates have had the opportunity for competitive health care and 401(k) benefits as well as access to bonus incentive opportunities, discounts and educational programs. These programs will continue to be available to current and future associates.
We're also launching an innovative program for future associates that will allow them to join Walmart at $9 per hour or more, receive skills-based training for 6 months and then be guaranteed at least $10 per hour upon successful completion of that program.
Sam Walton used to say that our people make the difference. I share this same philosophy. Overall, these are strategic investments in our people to reignite the sense of ownership they have in our stores. As a result, we firmly believe that our customers will benefit from a better store experience, which can drive higher sales and returns for our shareholders over time.
Walmart has represented a ladder of opportunity since we started the business. And we want to make sure that's the case going forward everywhere we operate, including here in the United States. Globally, we have ongoing efforts in place to review our associates' compensation on a yearly basis in each of our markets.
For example, in China, we recently launched the compensation structure for stores and clubs, and in this year, we are launching a new compensation structure for our distribution center associates to improve the overall competitiveness of our practices. Later this year, Walmart Mexico will launch training programs to give associates more ownership and accountability so they can react faster to customers' needs.
Included in today's announcement, Walmart and the Walmart Foundation also committed to $100 million over 5 years to help increase the economic mobility for entry-level workers by focusing on initiatives to better train and advance workers in the retail and other service industries throughout the United States.
As we look at our business through the lens of the customer, our enterprise strategy is helping us to find where our additional investments are focused. While we're concentrating on running a good business today, we're also clear on how we should position it for the future.
Value matters to everyone regardless of household income level, and digital access creates even more price transparency. Being the low-price leader has been a part of our customer proposition, and it will continue to be a priority in the future.
We're also evaluating our assortment and our approach to service, both in stores and online, to be relevant for today's customer. And we're testing various access points to provide convenience and allow customers to shop on their terms. This past quarter, we initiated a number of work streams that will deliver on these key initiatives. I'm excited about what we'll accomplish over this next year as we drive our enterprise strategy.
Now let's review Walmart's financial results in more detail. Walmart U.S. improved its sales and operating income trends each consecutive quarter during fiscal 2015. Fourth quarter comp sales were the strongest in more than 2 years, with positive traffic for the first time in 9 quarters.
Our Neighborhood Markets have continued to deliver strong comps. Our emphasis remains on the quality of the stores that we open, not the quantity. I'm pleased with the strategy that Greg and his team are executing to raise the standard of customer experience in the U.S. business. They're taking steps to enhance store operations on various fronts, including inventory management, checkout and in-stock.
For the holidays, Walmart U.S. implemented a Checkout Promise to keep more registers open during peak periods, and customer response has been positive enough that this has continued into the first quarter. I'm encouraged by the focus of the leadership team, and I look forward to seeing more progress in our stores this year toward a better experience for our customers.
Walmart International produced solid constant currency sales and operating income growth this year. Dave and his team have done a good job weathering a tough macro environment. Canada's sales gained momentum in the back half. In China, we made progress in store operations and in e-commerce. We continue to earn customers' trust with our commitments to food safety. There's so much potential for this market, and we're taking the right steps to solidify a foundation for long-term growth.
The U.K. market remains very competitive, and Asda is committed to its GBP 5 billion 5-year investment to lower prices for customers. We're making progress in Mexico. There's still work to do in Brazil.
Sam's Club had a solid year, with membership income up over 10%. Comp sales without fuel continued to improve throughout the year. And operating income with fuel grew at a greater rate than sales. Roz and the team made good progress on the ongoing merchandise transformation, embedding new on-trend and exciting merchandise into the clubs and online. Members are responding by driving sales in these categories.
Members are also pleased with the new innovative services that were launched this year to increase the value of a Sam's Club membership. You'll hear more from Neil shortly about the strides that we're making in our e-commerce customer experience, assortment and supply chain. We're leveraging technology to strengthen our e-commerce and mobile capabilities and integrating these digital assets with our more than 11,000 stores globally.
Overall, e-commerce sales grew approximately 22% in fiscal year 2015, solid but not quite as strong as we wanted. We're striving to balance sales growth and profitability. We're being thoughtful with our investments, ensuring we have the infrastructure in place to build this business for the long term. I'm excited about the possibilities that are in front of us.
One of the headlines in e-commerce is the tremendous growth from mobile devices. In fact, nearly 70% of Walmart.com traffic in the U.S. came via mobile during the recent holiday period. Customers who previously shopped using their laptops are now using their phones and tablets.
And this isn't just a U.S. trend. For example, traffic from the mobile app in Brazil nearly tripled on the Black Friday holiday. Around the world, we're well positioned to create a strong mobile experience for customers this year and beyond.
As I reflect back on my first year as CEO, I'm proud of the accomplishments of our associates and leadership team. It's been a period of change for the 2.2 million associates that make up the Walmart team, but it's been inspiring to see our associates rally around our company's purpose.
Last week, more than 5,000 members of our U.S. store leadership gathered for our annual year beginning meeting. I heard directly from our store managers how we could help them run better stores. And similar meetings are occurring around the world. Regardless of our responsibility, we're in this together. Each of us has a role to play in making our customers' shopping experience a great one. Our secret to success continues to be that we're all working together.
We've made a lot of progress on bringing strategic clarity and in reinvigorating our commitment to run better businesses today. Retail is changing so quickly that we must move with greater urgency to stay out in front.
I like the passion that I'm seeing from our leadership team as they work together to shape and deliver our enterprise strategy. We're thinking differently about retail and about the world. This drives our approach to global responsibility in areas like environmental sustainability, women's economic empowerment and offering healthy food choices. It's important work and it matters to our customers and shareholders. We remain steadfast in our commitment to compliance, ethics and doing the right thing. I'm pleased with the technology enhancements we've made to strengthen these organizations.
As I close my remarks, let me reiterate that I'm proud of what we accomplished this past year, but I'm more excited about what lies ahead. The deliberate strategic choices that we're making around investments in our associates and e-commerce capabilities will improve the customer experience. And we believe that shareholders will also benefit from these investments in the future. Now I'll turn it over to Claire. Claire?"

Today, I'll highlight some items in the company's consolidated financial statements. Further details are available in the accompanying presentation posted today with this transcript. Before I begin, let me remind you that last year, the comp",630,"Thanks, Doug. Today, I'll highlight some items in the company's consolidated financial statements. Further details are available in the accompanying presentation posted today with this transcript. Before I begin, let me remind you that last year, the company's fourth quarter and fiscal 2014 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Walmart EPS, were negatively impacted by certain discrete items totaling $0.26.
The company's fourth quarter and fiscal 2015 EPS were negatively impacted by discrete items totaling $0.08. A wage and hour litigation matter previously disclosed resulted in a charge of $0.05 per share, and store closures in Japan resulted in a charge of $0.03 per share. A reconciliation of the company's underlying EPS is included in our earnings press release issued prior to the call. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, underlying EPS was $1.61 compared to last year's underlying EPS of $1.60. Reported EPS was $1.53 compared to last year's EPS of $1.34.
As you can see on Slide 2, total revenue for the fourth quarter was $131.6 billion. Consolidated net sales increased $1.9 billion or 1.4%, and membership and other income declined 0.5%. Recall that during the fourth quarter of last year, membership and other income was positively impacted by a $24 million gain from the sale of certain U.S. real estate assets.
Total revenue for the year grew to $485.7 billion as consolidated net sales increased $9.2 billion or 1.9% and membership and other income grew 6.3%. Consolidated operating expenses increased 0.5% for the quarter and 2.3% for the full year.
It is important to remember that operating expenses were negatively impacted in the fourth quarter and for the full year by the discrete items I mentioned earlier. Additionally, FCPA and compliance-related costs were $36 million in the fourth quarter, comprised of $26 million for the ongoing inquiries and investigations and $10 million for our global compliance program and organizational enhancements.
For the full year, FCPA and compliance-related costs were $173 million, comprised of $121 million for the ongoing inquiries and investigations and $52 million for our global compliance program and organizational enhancements. Last year, total FCPA and compliance-related costs were $282 million.
The company's consolidated operating income increased 8.2% during the fourth quarter. Last year's fourth quarter operating income was negatively impacted by the discrete items I mentioned earlier. Fiscal year 2015 operating income increased 1%.
Net interest expense increased 5.8% for the quarter and 6% for the year. The increase for each period was primarily driven by a higher weighted average interest rate on net borrowings.
From a balance sheet perspective, consolidated inventory increased 0.6%. Later in today's call, you'll hear more about inventory from our segment leaders. Payables as a percentage of inventory were 85.1%, which compares to 83.4% last year due primarily to the timing of payments. Improving inventory leverage is important, and we are seeing progress as the company continues to focus on this priority.
We ended the year with capital expenditures of $12.2 billion, slightly below our range of $12.5 billion to $13 billion. For the year, the company added approximately 33 million retail square feet through 511 net new, expanded and relocated units. This was in line with the updated guidance we shared in October.
Finally, let's address returns. ROI for the trailing 12 months ended January 31, 2015, was 16.9%, relatively flat compared to 17% for the prior comparable period. The slight change in ROI was primarily due to continued investments in store growth and e-commerce initiatives, offset by currency exchange rate fluctuations.
For the full year, the company returned $7.2 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. And we ended the year with free cash flow of $16.4 billion compared to $10.1 billion last year. Now I'll turn the call over to Greg. Greg?"

When I joined the Walmart U.S. team 6 months ago, we laid out specific objectives for the second half of fiscal 2015. We knew we needed to become better store managers to fix some of the basics in our stores. We spent the last several months focusing on core fundamentals such as inventory, merchandise returns, shrink, markdowns and wage management.
By focusing on these urgent agenda items and using the tailwinds we've seen from an improving economy, we drove positive momentum in our business. We achieved what we set out to do in the short term, but we're not satisfied and recognize that we have more work to do to accomplish our longer-term goals.
Before discussing our results, I want to provide more detail on the exciting announcement we made this morning regarding associate pay and store structure. As Doug mentioned, we believe our people make the difference, and we're committed to this philosophy. At Walmart, we already provide an opportunity for jobs to become careers in retail. We want to continue to improve that opportunity and to provide it to more associates. The changes we are making are based on our core principles and will make Walmart a better place to work and shop.
First, we believe associates equally value their hourly rate and hours worked. We're happy to announce improvements to both aspects of associates' earnings opportunity. Current and future associates will benefit from this initiative, which ensures that Walmart hourly associates earn at least $1.75 above today's federal minimum wage or $9 per hour in April. And current associates will earn $10 per hour or higher by next February.
Additionally, we are piloting a scheduling system that will create stability for associates who want predictable hours and the flexibility for those who prefer to select additional shifts to meet customers' needs each week. Starting in 2016, we will be one of the first retailers to offer some associates fixed hours each week.
Next, we are realigning our store operational structure, adding back department managers to give associates a closer relationship with their supervisors to help improve communication, direction and recognition.
And finally, we are making new commitments to train associates. They will engage in interactive learning programs to build skills, demonstrate proficiency and be rewarded for their efforts through pay raises and promotions into areas of greater responsibility.
We will also offer opportunities to pursue further education, including a high school diploma or GED program, access to language training and free or low-cost college credits to reduce the time and cost of a college education.
I want to say thank you to all our 1.2 million Walmart U.S. associates. Together, we're part of something bigger than ourselves and bigger than our company. What we do at Walmart extends beyond our stores to our own communities and across this country. I'm thankful to be a part of this organization.
Now let's move to this quarter's performance. Net sales grew $3.1 billion or 4.1% versus last year. For the 13-week period ended January 30, comparable store sales were up 1.5%, which exceeded our guidance. This represents an approximate 100-basis-point improvement over Q3 and was largely driven by a 1.4% improvement in traffic.
This quarter marks the first positive traffic comp since Q3 of fiscal year 2013 as customers saw increased purchasing power from lower gas prices. We also lapped the SNAP reductions and unfavorable weather seen last year. E-commerce contributed approximately 30 basis points to our comp performance.
During the 6-week holiday season, we experienced overall comp sales growth. We saw increased traffic to the store, aided by our broadcast and digital holiday hub marketing campaign. Strong sales of seasonal merchandise and toys, along with key brands in gifts and apparel and home, offset industry declines in entertainment.
Customers also continued to refine how they prepared for the holidays, shopping earlier in November for holiday deals and looking for last-minute gift ideas all the way through Christmas Eve. We were ready when and where our customers needed us, completing almost 1 billion total transactions over the holiday season including our largest online day ever on Cyber Monday.
Looking across the entire fourth quarter, our growth in comp sales was attributable to several key areas of the business. First, we remained pleased by our apparel and home businesses, which brought value to the customers through strong national brands, consistent quality across price points and relevant products at the right time of the season.
Second, our health and wellness business, including optical, remained strong, with growth in script counts from higher penetration in Medicare and Medicaid plans, branded drug inflation and a strengthening over-the-counter business.
Third, while our grocery performance was assisted primarily by inflation and lapping last year's SNAP reductions, we also saw progress from urgent agenda items, including a focus on adding days of freshness in produce. We still have a long way to go to improve our fresh business and remain focused on this goal.
And finally, we saw strong performance from our Neighborhood Market format. While all formats experienced positive sales comps, our traditional Neighborhood Markets continue to outperform Walmart Supercenters and discount stores, providing customers with the products and services they desire at locations that are convenient to them. Our traditional Neighborhood Markets delivered approximately a 7.7% comp for the quarter.
Yet while we saw a positive momentum in these categories, we remain challenged in others. Specifically, declines in our entertainment business persisted as we faced industry contraction and deflation across many categories. Lapping last year's gaming console releases, along with fewer video game titles available for new consoles and shifts from physical to digital media in movies and books, drove high single-digit negative comps in this area.
Additionally, although we launched wireless installment plans in November, we're still ramping up this service as we reacquaint customers with our ability to serve them in this category. Finally, softness in electronics also impacted our online business, particularly in the ship-to-home channel.
In e-commerce, we remain thoughtful about growth, striving to produce sustainable results through digital and physical access. Our focus on serving customers led to strong performance in Pick Up Today and Ship from Store capabilities, particularly during the holiday season. However, we recognize the significant opportunity we have to grow this area of our business as customers continue to reshape their shopping behaviors.
Now for the remainder of our financial results. In the fourth quarter, gross profit rate was relatively flat. Operating expenses increased 5.6%, driven primarily by changes in estimates associated with our incentive accrual versus last year. Additionally, we intensified our focus on improving customer experience in our stores.
While these actions increased costs, we believe it was the right decision for the customer. In fact, our Checkout Promise program drove customer experience satisfaction scores to their highest level during the holiday season. Due to the success of this program, we are implementing it more broadly in fiscal 2016. Overall, operating income declined approximately 60 basis points for the quarter.
Inventory growth moderated from prior quarters, growing 3.9% and less than the rate of sales in Q4. This growth was primarily related to the significant number of new store openings in the quarter. In fact, we opened 178 stores in this quarter alone, including 10 Supercenters and 168 traditional and small-format Neighborhood Markets.
Comp store inventory improved in this quarter, driven by a strong holiday sell-through and better aligned seasonal markdowns in apparel. Inventory management is a key element to customer experience. And whilst we have room for improvement, we are also making progress to better manage working capital.
Now let me cover our full year financial performance. For the year, net sales increased 3.1% or $8.6 billion to $288 billion. Comp sales improved 0.5% for the 52-week period ended January 30, while operating income declined 2.1% to $21.3 billion. Gross profit improved 2.6% for the year, with a 12-basis-point decline in gross profit rate. This was primarily driven by price investments in meat and preferred Medicare prescription plans. 
Expenses were up 4.3%, deleveraging 24 basis points for the year and driven primarily by increased health care costs from higher enrollment rates and medical cost inflation. Expenses were further deleveraged by the initial ramp-up of 17 new medical care clinics, increased utility expenses from cold weather early in the year and higher rates throughout the year and declining rates in recyclable materials such as cardboard. Recall that we get a financial benefit from recycled materials.
Moving to real estate. We opened 353 net new stores, including relocations and expansions and added almost 21 million retail square feet. 1 year ago, we started to accelerate our Neighborhood Market format. This fiscal year, we opened 165 traditional-format Neighborhood Markets and 68 smaller Neighborhood Markets.
By continuing to drive this format, we're able to offer customers easy and convenient access to fresh foods, pharmacy and services at Walmart's Every Day Low Price guarantee. Supercenters remain the driver of our sales and growth in retail square footage. Customers continue to rely heavily on this format for their broader shopping needs.
This year, we opened an additional 119 Supercenters including conversions and relocations. In FY '16, we expect to open approximately 60 to 70 Supercenters, including relocations and expansions. Additionally, we'll open an estimated 180 to 200 Neighborhood Markets, including 10 to 15 smaller-format locations as we complete our openings of this test program. We'll continue to monitor the progress of these test locations before making any further commitments to this format. We expect to add approximately 15 million to 16 million retail square feet this year.
Digital access is important to our customers now more than ever. They expect a seamless interaction whether it's in the store or online. We see many opportunities at Walmart to evolve with the customer in their digital and physical experiences.
For example, this year, we developed a collaborative approach to the holiday season in toys, with our store and Walmart.com teams working closely together to ensure our customers had the same experience with Walmart no matter where or when they shopped. We've been investing in expanding capabilities to allow customers to shop on their own terms and are moving sensibly towards this integration of digital and physical.
This includes offering customers a variety of ways to interact with our brand, including picking up their Walmart.com orders at their local store, providing reminders and refill capabilities through our pharmacy app and our latest test concept, Walmart Grocery.
This year, we expanded grocery delivery and pickup tests to include the entire Denver market and launched Walmart Grocery Pickup here in Northwest Arkansas this past October. And just last week, we announced the expansion of Walmart Grocery online to select locations in the Phoenix, Arizona and Huntsville, Alabama markets. 
We have an advantage at Walmart by combining our store and distribution network with our e-commerce capabilities to allow our customers to interact with our brand in ways that are most convenient for them. Whether it's in a store, online or on our mobile app, we are focused on providing the best solutions for customers.
The upcoming fiscal year will be a time of change and further improvement to the business. Our focus on inventory management, in-stock levels and customer service is just the beginning.
Recently, we made changes within our management team. These changes have allowed me to get closer to our merchandising teams, and the new leadership brings with them fresh ideas and an invigorating spirit. We've also just wrapped up our year beginning meeting, which is a time to gather our store managers to thank them for their hard work in the prior year and to discuss the focus areas for the upcoming year.
The meeting was energizing, and our store managers left excited for a fresh start to become better store managers, focusing on item merchandising and providing great service to the customer.
We'll continue on the path towards hiring 100,000 veterans by 2018. We set this goal just under 2 years ago. And we're proud to say that we've already hired almost 80,000 veterans through this program. Furthermore, over 6,000 have been promoted to roles of greater responsibility since joining the Walmart team.
But fiscal 2016 will not be without its challenges. Our bottom line will continue to be pressured, primarily from the significant investments in associates that I covered earlier. In addition, we will see impact from the changing mix within merchandise categories, store formats and retail channels and the investments in digital and physical integration. While we expect to offset some of these headwinds by executing and delivering on our urgent agenda items and other initiatives, we know these investments are necessary to position ourselves to meet the rapidly changing needs of the customer.
We may see risk to import merchandise flows related to the upcoming spring and Easter seasons due to ongoing port congestion. We'll continue to take the appropriate steps using our diversified supply chain network to reduce the impact for our customers.
In the first quarter, we expect a continuation of lower gas prices to provide a tailwind to our business. This could be somewhat offset by a shorter selling season, with Easter coming earlier than last year, as well as potential impact from port congestion. For the 13-week period ending May 1, we anticipate a comp sales increase of 1% to 2%. Last year's 13-week comp ended May 2, 2014, was down 8 basis points.
Now I'll turn it over to Dave for an update on Walmart International. Dave?"

I'm pleased with our performance in International as we've remained committed to the strategic priorities I outlined 1 year ago. We've been able to produce solid results and operating income growth despite operating in a very challenging competitive retail environment.
As one of our key priorities, we continue to accelerate our e-commerce business by offering multiple ways for our customers to shop. Whether in stores, online, pickup or mobile, we aim to give our customers the ability to shop in whichever way they want.
We've also made progress in building a platform for sustainable growth in China and have experienced success in improving our overall price perception as well as the quality of our fresh offering. We also continued to make progress on our commitment of actively managing our existing portfolio.
You've seen us make strategic decisions such as closing underperforming stores and divesting noncore parts of our business in order to strengthen our foundation. Our markets remain focused on key strategic priorities, and I'm optimistic about our position going forward into the new year.
Now for our financial results. In the fourth quarter, net sales grew 3% on a constant currency basis. However, with the U.S. dollar at historic highs, we faced significant currency headwinds of $2.6 billion, resulting in a 3.9% sales decline on a reported basis.
Of our 5 largest countries, Mexico, Canada and Brazil delivered positive comp sales for the quarter. Comps declined in both the U.K. and China due primarily to food deflation and intense competition in the U.K. and government austerity measures and deflation in key categories in China.
Comp sales growth was strong in all other markets as well. As Claire mentioned, there were certain discrete items disclosed in the previous year, which have a significant impact on our year-over-year operating income comparison. For financial year ending '15, our fourth quarter results were negatively impacted by Japan store closure costs of $148 million.
Overall, operating income increased 79.6% on a constant currency basis and 66.4% on a reported basis. Excluding the previous and current years' discrete items, we grew operating income on a constant currency basis by 14.2%.
For the full year, sales grew 3.6% on a constant currency basis, while the strong U.S. dollar resulted in a full year sales decline of 0.3% on a reported basis, reflecting over a $5 billion currency impact. Full year operating income grew 24.1% on a constant currency basis and 19.8% on a reported basis. Excluding the items mentioned above, operating income grew 9.3% on a constant currency basis, outpacing full year sales growth.
We made progress in reducing inventory levels during the quarter and dropped the growth rate over 250 basis points versus the previous quarter to a 4.6% growth on a constant currency basis. We had positive momentum on inventory management heading into the new year. 
Now let's discuss individual results for our largest markets. Comp sales and growth rates are presented on a constant currency basis only. In all countries except Brazil and China, results are inclusive of e-commerce. Slides 8 and 9 of the presentation summarize financial details.
The U.K. market remained very competitive during the quarter, with grocery inflation falling to a record low of negative 0.9% over the 12 weeks ended January 4, according to Kantar. Total market growth of 0.6% was a slight improvement over the previous quarter, boosted by Christmas sales and increased discretionary spending from lower fuel prices. However, overall market trends remain relatively weak. According to Kantar, Asda, along with the other big grocers, lost share to hard discounters for the quarter.
U.K. sales declined 1.7% and comp sales declined 2.5%, excluding fuel. Several competitors held a Black Friday event for the first time, and others continued intense vouchering, which led to increased competition versus 1 year ago. Asda online sales remained strong, while George home continued to register double-digit growth. Despite the top line pressures, Asda was able to grow income ahead of sales.
Now turning to Canada, which had a very solid fourth quarter performance. Sales grew 4.1%, with comp sales increasing 1.8%, marking this the third consecutive quarter of positive comps. Price investments and increased consumer spending contributed to improved trends in sales.
We reported strong comp sales in food, health and wellness and consumables. While general merchandise and apparel sales improved versus prior quarter results, they were still below the rate of growth in the market.
Our fresh business also continues to accelerate, resulting in the highest comp sales for the year in quarter 4. Canada had a strong holiday season overall, with the online business up 38.5%. Walmart Canada grew 43 basis points of market share in food, consumables and health and wellness combined, as reported by Nielsen for the 12-week period ending January 24.
Canada completed a restructuring in the quarter to simplify home office operations. This, along with continued investments in e-commerce and pricing, resulted in a decline in operating income. Overall, we're pleased with the positive sales trend we've seen in our Canadian operations, and we expect momentum to continue.
Next, we'll discuss Walmex, which released their quarterly results on February 17. Please note the Walmex release is under IFRS and the results here are under U.S. GAAP. Thus, some numbers will differ.
Consolidated Walmex sales grew 3.4%, with positive comp sales in both Mexico and Central America. Walmex leveraged expenses for the quarter and grew operating income faster than sales. Mexico sales increased 3%, and the comp sales were up 0.1% for the quarter.
According to ANTAD, the entire market experienced slower comp growth in the fourth quarter of 0.7% in self-service. Walmart Mexico comps, excluding Sam's Club, exceeded the market by 80 basis points. Performance was especially strong in our small-format Bodega Aurrera Express, which outperformed the market by 750 basis points.
Sam's Club growth lagged the market by approximately 330 basis points. However, we're encouraged by the improving top line trends at Sam's as December comp sales were the strongest of the year. Sam's Club remains a focus area, and we will continue to accelerate initiatives to improve the business.
Next, let's talk about Brazil. Brazil continued sales momentum in Q4, growing net sales and comp sales by 3.1%. Holiday sales were driven by strong performances in both food and consumables. Strategic and targeted pricing resulted in margin favorability for the quarter. Management also continued to drive labor productivity and control expenses. While we are seeing some positive results, there's still work to be done in our turnaround plan.
Moving to China. Ongoing headwinds from government austerity measures, reduction in gift card sales and continued deflation in key categories continued to pose challenges in the market. Walmart China's Q4 net sales declined 0.7%, and comp sales declined 2.3%, partially due to Chinese New Year falling nearly 3 weeks later than last year.
We increased market share in the hypermarket category for the eighth consecutive quarter, according to Nielsen, for the period ended December 31. We expect market headwinds to continue in the new year, but we're confident that we'll continue to accelerate growth in this important market.
Over the year, China has made great progress in strengthening the core business. Our portfolio is now more focused and stronger with the opening of 24 new hypermarket stores and 1 additional Sam's Club, in addition to completing the store closure program announced last year. The distribution center expansion project and the centralization of deliveries to DCs were finalized within the quarter, resulting in a distribution network for fresh that provides coverage for all of our stores in China for the first time.
These initiatives drive efficiency, reduce costs and shorten the lead time to get products on the shelf. Having control over our own distribution network allows us to better monitor the quality and the safety of our products. Additionally, the We Operate for Less and the We Buy for Less programs in China have saved over $150 million over the course of the year.
Finally, let's discuss e-commerce performance across the globe. We remain focused on innovating and providing solutions for our customers seeking convenience. This quarter, we made even more progress, and I'm very excited about the impact we've made in online retail.
In Japan, we automated the order picking process to fulfill Seiyu.com grocery orders more efficiently and sustainably. We're testing new offerings such as grab-and-go lockers in Canada. In India, we're continuing the rollout of online offering to business-to-business members and expect to reach all members by the end of next year.
Yihaodian, our e-commerce business in China, benefited from investments in the supply chain and promotional events. Traffic increased more than 40% and average ticket improved as well. The fourth quarter was highlighted by a successful Singles Day promotion in November, generating strong sales and traffic growth, aided by an increase in orders from mobile devices.
In Brazil, e-commerce sales growth was strong again this quarter, driven by strong sales in large appliances and wireless, where low-cost smartphones helped drive sales growth of more than double the same period last year. Promotions fueled sales growth, with the Black Friday and 72-hour events delivering strong comp sales. Traffic via our mobile app nearly tripled on Black Friday.
Looking ahead, we will continue to innovate and execute our strategic plan. I'm amazed by how similar our customers' needs are around the world. Value, assortment and convenience are paramount. We remain focused on saving our customers money by expanding our private-label offering, improving product sourcing and driving costs out of our operations so that we can invest it back into price.
We know convenience means different things to customers at different times. It could mean shopping online, home grocery delivery, a one-stop shop experience or a drive-through pickup, and we're innovating to provide customers more shopping options than ever. No matter the shopper's preference, Walmart will continue to strive to be the destination of choice.
Our objectives for this year will continue to build upon a foundation that's been established. In financial year ending '16, we're committed to: actively managing the existing portfolio; driving comp sales; accelerating e-commerce; delivering market priorities, including establishing a platform for sustainable growth in China; moving forward with the turnaround efforts in Brazil and reenergizing the business in Mexico; and lastly, strengthening enablers, which means being the lowest-cost operator, building world-class talent and building trust.
Let me close by thanking our nearly 800,000 international associates around the world for delivering a strong performance in financial year ending '15. As I reflect on the past year, I'm humbled by what our team has accomplished and their relentless focus on saving customers money. I look forward to updating you on our results in the coming months. Now I'll turn it over to Roz for the update on Sam's. Roz?"

I'd like to start by echoing our excitement at Sam's Club regarding the company's announcement today to boost the starting wage for our full-time and part-time hourly associates. We believe we provide our associates with an excellent opportunity to pursue careers in retail.
Because our business model at Sam's Club differs from Walmart stores, beginning in the first half of the fiscal year, we will offer a starting hourly wage of $9.50, which is above the federal minimum wage, unless there is a higher state-mandated minimum wage. This will ensure all Sam's Club hourly associates are paid above the federal minimum wage. We believe this investment in our associates will help us to attract, retain and develop top-notch talent and will allow us to continue to deliver outstanding, award-winning service to our members.
Now on to Q4. I want to thank our Sam's Club associates for delivering the best performance of the year this quarter, providing momentum going into fiscal '16. Over the last 4 quarters, we saw meaningful acceleration, culminating in a comp sales increase, without fuel, of 2% for the 13-week period ended January 30. Strong holiday execution, combined with our strategic investments in member value, merchandise relevance and the integration of digital and physical, boosted our performance.
Our investments in membership value initiatives enabled us to grow our membership income by over 8% this quarter. Our Plus penetration is at historic highs as Plus members are seeing the benefits from our Cash Rewards program.
Across the club, all members are seeing the benefits of Instant Savings and the 5-3-1 MasterCard. We will anniversary the introduction of Plus Cash Rewards and the 5-3-1 MasterCard in June 2015, so we expect these programs to continue driving membership income moving forward.
Sam's net sales including fuel were $14.9 billion, up 1.3% over last year. This was impacted by the approximately 25% decline in fuel prices, with gallons sold up approximately 8%. Our gross profit rate increased 23 basis points due to higher margin on fuel. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales decreased by 50 basis points.
Operating income increased 29.1% to $510 million, which includes a $41 million increase in fuel profit. Our 500-plus fuel stations provided value to members through competitive pricing, and the 5-3-1 MasterCard holders benefit from an additional 5% off all gas purchases.
Given the volatility in fuel prices, the remainder of this discussion will exclude fuel. Additionally, for comparisons, please recall that last year, we had certain items impacting our results which included: a $39 million charge to gross profit due to an adjustment to our product warranty liabilities; a $59 million charge to operating expenses for a new in-club staffing restructuring and the closure of 1 club; a $24 million gain in other income for the sale of 2 real estate properties.
In Q4, net sales grew 3.7% and we delivered comp sales of 2%, driven by traffic growth of 1.5% and ticket of 0.5%.
The Savings member continues to drive traffic. We have lapped last year's SNAP reductions and benefited from favorable weather this quarter. Retail inflation across the club has moderated slightly since the previous quarter.
Our gross profit declined 32 basis points versus last year due to the planned impact of Plus Cash Rewards and pressure from merchandise mix, which were offset by last year's product warranty charge. Without the comparative benefit of the product warranty charge last year, gross profit declined 61 basis points. As discussed previously, the rollout of Plus Cash Rewards will pressure gross profit in the first half of fiscal year 2016. 
Operating expenses were well managed in the quarter and we leveraged 82 basis points. Even without the comparative benefit of last year's discrete items, we leveraged expenses. We had disciplined expense management in a number of areas, including the optimization of the club staffing model earlier this year.
Membership and other income grew by 1.4% compared to last year, which factors in the real estate gain. Without the $24 million real estate gain last year, membership and other income was up 8.7%.
Operating income was up 19.4% to $456 million. Without the comparative benefit of last year's items, our operating income was flat to last year. We are still very happy with our overall performance for the quarter, given the significant investments in membership value initiatives such as Plus Cash Rewards, and with good expense management and improvements in membership income, we believe we have great momentum for fiscal 2016.
I also want to highlight the team's efforts around working capital. We reduced total inventory by 3.5% while simultaneously growing our fleet by 16 clubs during the year. Moreover, I am confident in the quality of our inventory for this year.
At Sam's Club, relevant merchandise is a critical component in member engagement, and we continue to improve performance across the box. Our merchants are pushing hard to introduce newness and capture consumer trends while providing the price leadership and assortment that Sam's Club is known for.
Sales of our fresh food business grew positive low-single digits this quarter. Performance was led by meat, due to inflation and a strong value proposition. A challenged area was produce, where weather created supply issues. Dry grocery and beverage delivered a positive low-single-digit comp, with highlights in newness and healthy-for-you items. We doubled the organic portfolio since the previous quarter, and members are responding positively to new, healthy beverage options.
Let's continue with health and wellness, which posted a positive mid-single-digit comp. Sam's Club is a destination for our members' health care needs, and we see that clearly in our pharmacy comps, which drove the category due to both script growth and branded prescription inflation. Our OTC business, especially our healthy assortment of nutrition bars and protein, also did well.
We've seen an uptick in our consumables business, which posted a positive low-single-digit comp. This is an area where members consistently see value through our private brand offerings, improved pack sizes and Instant Savings. For example, members love the quality of our private brand Member's Mark paper products. The disposable tabletop category continues to perform well, and we have introduced newness to improve the laundry and home care business.
Home and apparel delivered a positive low-single-digit comp. Our exciting assortment of toys was a highlight, drawing members into the club over the holidays. Apparel continues to show strength, driven by men's wear and children's clothing.
Our underperforming category continues to be technology and entertainment, which posted a negative mid-single-digit comp. This is an improvement versus last quarter as a result of introducing the latest Ultra Hi-Def and 4K TV technologies, a strong value proposition on the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus and an expanded wearables assortment. However, we need to make larger, faster strides. This year, our merchants are rebalancing the portfolio, which involves reallocating resources towards higher-growth, higher-excitement categories.
Ancillary improved to a positive low-single-digit comp, driven by growth in tobacco. We saw improved convenience store traffic trends as we executed strategic pricing initiatives and benefited from shifts in the competitive landscape.
Moving to e-commerce. This quarter, SamsClub.com was integral in supporting our in-club holiday events, becoming a Cyber Week destination and offering online-only promotions that drew members from our physical clubs to our digital platforms. Dotcom delivered double-digit comps in both direct-to-home and Club Pickup, contributing approximately 40 basis points to the segment comp.
We've rebranded Click 'n' Pull to Club Pickup and enhanced the service to appeal to both Savings and Business members. Members have responded well to the relaunch of Club Pickup in all clubs, and we've seen accelerated performance compared to the previous quarter.
The improvements we've made to our mobile and desktop platforms, along with enhancements in messaging, have boosted conversion rates across all platforms. This concludes our discussion on fourth quarter results. Let's continue with the financial results for the full year, where we've seen meaningful, sustainable acceleration every quarter.
With fuel, net sales were $58 billion, up 1.5% over last year. With fuel profit of $122 million, operating income for the year grew 7.2% to $2 billion. Net sales, excluding fuel, were $51.6 billion, up 2.1%. For the 52-week period ending January 30, 2015, comp sales increased 50 basis points, driven by traffic.
While our investments in Cash Rewards for Plus members led to a gross profit rate decline of 38 basis points, we managed expenses well and leveraged 24 basis points. Membership income increased 10.3%, driving operating income of $1.9 billion, a 2% increase over last year.
Fiscal 2016 is well under way and Sam's Club is innovating the member experience through merchandise relevance and digital-physical integration. These 2 priorities are the key to membership engagement. I am confident that our strategic investments will not only differentiate us from our competitors but more importantly, continue enhancing our members' trust and loyalty.
Merchandise relevance is a critical enabler. Our goal is to ensure that members are surprised and delighted by relevant merchandise every time they come into the club or visit our website in every category across the country. Combined with price leadership and newness, merchandise relevance will keep our members coming back for more.
Our fiscal '16 investment strategy reflects the importance of offering a seamless digital-physical club experience for members. I recently was at the grand opening of our new e-commerce facility in San Bruno, California where Jamie Iannone, who leads SamsClub.com, has invested in expanding his team of engineers and scientists.
I am optimistic about our growth opportunities in both the digital and the physical, and that's why we plan to open 9 to 12 new and relocated clubs and remodel between 55 and 60 clubs this year, while simultaneously investing in innovation at SamsClub.com.
Knowing that our most engaged members want to shop with us both in our clubs and online, we will ensure a seamless set of access points for members. I am proud of how we finished out the year. For the 13-week period from January 31 through May 1, we expect comp sales to increase between 1% and 2%.
Now I'll turn things over to Neil for the e-commerce update. Neil?"

Q4 was an important quarter for us, not just because it is the biggest quarter of the fiscal year but because our key investments started to play a major role in the business. Most notably, our global technology platform, Pangaea, and our U.S",1512,"Thanks, Roz. Q4 was an important quarter for us, not just because it is the biggest quarter of the fiscal year but because our key investments started to play a major role in the business. Most notably, our global technology platform, Pangaea, and our U.S. fulfillment network, stood up under the holiday volumes of U.S. customers.
At the same time, we saw good sales in markets around the world. For the full year and for Q4, we outgrew the e-commerce market globally. Overall, Walmart grew e-commerce sales by 22%, benefited by a 25% increase in gross merchandise value or GMV for the year. In Q4, we grew sales 18% on GMV growth of 20%. An increase in third-party marketplace volumes in the U.S., Brazil and in China contributed to the growth in GMV.
Greg, Dave and Roz talked about the e-commerce successes in the quarter, but it's worth recapping. In the U.S., we had record sales on Cyber Monday and Cyber Week and more than 1.5 billion page views over the 5 days between Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday.
SamsClub.com had strong double-digit comps on Thanksgiving and on Black Friday. On Singles Day in China on November 11, Yihaodian's GMV growth was in the high-double digits. And on December 21, we surpassed traffic from Singles Day.
In the U.K., Asda continued to make Click & Collect easier for customers in stores and with new pick up points at petrol stations, tube stations and other locations. We now have Click & Collect in all Asda stores. In Brazil, we saw our strongest sales quarter, with high-double-digit sales growth.
What excites me most is the progress we've made in building out our ability to serve customers across digital and physical. We're investing in 4 areas: our global technology platform, our next-generation fulfillment network, our talent and on integrating digital and physical.
Starting with our global technology platform. I refer to this as the operating system for commerce because it is the foundation for serving customers digitally and enables the integration of digital and physical commerce. Building and deploying a new platform is one of the most challenging projects for an e-commerce business, particularly at our scale.
We launched most key elements of our site and mobile shopping experience on the new platform before holiday on Walmart.com in the U.S. Despite all of our testing, with the sheer complexity of a complete platform rebuild, there is nothing like the real thing on the busiest day of the year, Cyber Monday. Pangaea hummed along all day, serving our customers at record volume.
While we were glued to our screens watching performance, a mom in Dallas was glued to her screen on Walmart.com, crossing items off her holiday shopping list. She was most likely shopping on a tablet and she was browsing pages about 30% faster, thanks to Pangaea.
She was seeing a personalized shopping experience with a lot more recommendations for items that her kids might like. Hers was among a record number of orders. It was the first major test of our next-generation fulfillment network, which combined our first large-scale center in Texas with our existing fulfillment centers, distribution centers and stores to ship a record number of Walmart.com orders.
Our team in Texas shipped twice as many orders as last year. She was able to get more things from us even faster. Starting in the second quarter, we have 4 more of these large-scale fulfillment centers coming online. While there will be some ramp-up time, they will significantly expand our fulfillment capacity and efficiency in the coming years.
We've talked about the importance of investing in talent and the fact that we are building a technology company inside the world's largest retailer. In the past year, we have been able to build up our team to the critical mass needed to be that technology company. And we did it in a very selective way, bringing in some of the best talent in Silicon Valley through organic hiring and targeted acquisitions. We also built a great team in Silicon Valley to serve Sam's Club across digital and physical. We'll be continuing to hire the best people, adding to the core team we've built to deliver on our priorities.
When we were together at the analyst meeting in October, I talked through the story of a family in Denver who can rely on Walmart to make their lives easier by being everywhere they need us to be. Echoing Greg, I'm really proud of how we brought together the digital and physical customer experience during the holidays.
In the U.S., we created a series of moments that engaged customers with us, both online and in stores, starting with online deals Thanksgiving morning, leading to the Black Friday store events and through the new evening edition on Cyber Monday for people who worked during the day.
Mobile continued to be a big investment and area of high growth. Nearly 70% of our Walmart.com traffic during the holidays was from mobile devices. Those people used the app in a lot of ways, to do their shopping online, to find a store or to use the new store search tool we added late last year. This search tool allows customers to find product details and the aisle location of a specific item.
Sam's also offered a significantly enhanced shopping experience through its app and mobile website. In addition to Walmart, we focused on Sam's digital and physical integration with its Club Pickup experience, and it paid off as we saw nearly 30% growth in Club Pickup during holiday.
We're also continuing to create a stronger relationship with new and existing customers with grocery pickup and delivery. We've continued to see great feedback from customers on our tests in San Jose and Denver. And last week, we started serving customers in Phoenix, Arizona and Huntsville, Alabama.
To sum up, last year was a building year and that will continue this year. We ended up investing an incremental $0.08 per share during the fiscal year 2015, which was over our forecast of $0.05 to $0.07 as we continue to invest in fulfillment and other areas to serve our customers.
As I mentioned, we saw global sales grow by 22%, benefited by a 25% increase in GMV for the fiscal year. Fiscal year 2016 will continue to be a building year, and we expect sales to grow worldwide in the mid-20s.
In fiscal year 2016, we expect to invest incrementally between $0.06 and $0.09 per share for e-commerce initiatives. Our investments will continue to significantly enhance the customer experience and drive greater efficiency.
This will include the continued rollout of our U.S. site based on Pangaea, which will make checkout faster and easier for our customers. It is also serving as a backbone to an integrated experience across online, stores and mobile. It will empower new ways to serve customers through mobile.
That platform will also allow us to further expand our online assortment. We'll do that through a thoughtful balance of our own merchandise and marketplace sellers. We expect to double our assortment this year to well over 10 million SKUs.
We'll also continue fulfilling our promise to deliver orders to customers when and where they want them. Our next-generation fulfillment network combines new large-scale fulfillment centers that combine with our DCs and stores, all connected by Walmart's transportation network.
Our data scientists have built algorithms that dictate the assortment that needs to be placed in our different nodes and to dictate from which node we ship and order. 4 new fulfillment centers will come online starting in the second quarter. When fully operational, these centers, along with our other nodes, will position us to serve the vast majority of the U.S. population fast and at a low cost.
We're working closely with Greg's team to deliver a seamless experience for customers who use our stores to pick up or return orders. And we're working with Roz's team to continue enhancing Sam's Club Pickup and making reordering fast and simple.
Sam's will also make signing up easier and make membership even more valuable with services and by helping members discover new products. Sam's will have the ability to leverage Walmart's investment in e-commerce.
At the same time, we'll continue to invest in the major markets for e-commerce, most notably Brazil, China and the U.K. And we'll continue to expand our relationship with customers through online grocery pickup and delivery. All of these achievements from this quarter significantly improved our ability to serve customers however they want to shop with us. And many of our investments from last year will roll out this year.
We have significant opportunities ahead, and I feel great about the progress we've made on our priorities, including our global technology platform, talent, next-generation fulfillment network and the integration of digital and physical. We are delivering Walmart where you are, whether you shop online, through mobile or in stores. No matter how you shop, we're helping you save money and live better.
Now I'll hand it over to Charles. Charles?"

I'll wrap up today's discussion by providing some thoughts on the company's performance. For the year, we delivered $486 billion in revenue. E-commerce sales grew approximately 22% to more than $12 billion.We delivered fourth quarter under",1061,"Thanks, Neil. I'll wrap up today's discussion by providing some thoughts on the company's performance. For the year, we delivered $486 billion in revenue. E-commerce sales grew approximately 22% to more than $12 billion.
We delivered fourth quarter underlying earnings per share of $1.61 and reported earnings per share of $1.53. Recall that our underlying earnings per share reflects the performance of our business without the impact of discrete items. Now as a reminder, our fourth quarter guidance of $1.46 to $1.56 included the discrete item of the Japan restructure, which was approximately $0.03 per share.
Walmart U.S. generated a very solid 1.5% comp in the fourth quarter. Although the strong U.S. dollar caused a negative impact of over $5 billion on revenue, Walmart International delivered very good sales growth of nearly 4% on a constant currency basis for the year. And Sam's Club continued to drive membership income again this year with growth of over 10%.
Now on the other hand, as I just mentioned, currency negatively impacted revenue by more than $5 billion. Although not as high as we anticipated, health care expenses were a headwind for Walmart U.S. during the year. And our reported earnings per share were negatively impacted by $0.08 due to the discrete items that Claire mentioned earlier.
Before turning our attention to guidance for the first quarter and for fiscal year 2016, I would like to remind you that our outlook for the future is based on the enterprise strategy we discussed at our October investor conference.
Our clear focus on driving sales through price, assortment, access and experience will continue to guide the investments we make to better serve our customers. Our guidance today assumes several important factors, including the economic conditions in several of our largest markets and currency exchange rates remaining at current levels.
In October, we forecasted a 2% to 4% net sales increase for this new fiscal year. However, as a result of where currency rates are today, we expect a currency headwind of approximately $10 billion on net sales. Our new forecast for fiscal year 2016 net sales growth is between 1% and 2%.
Our capital expenditure guidance of $11.6 billion to $12.9 billion and our total net retail square footage growth of 26 million to 30 million square feet remain unchanged. Also in October, we shared that our capital expenditure range reflects that we will grow through a smaller number of large Supercenters in the U.S. And as previously announced, we are dedicating capital related to our digital and e-commerce businesses of $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion.
In fiscal 2016, we expect our FCPA-related expenses to range between $160 million and $180 million. Recall that these are included in our corporate and support expenses.
Our incremental investment in our Global eCommerce business in fiscal 2015 was approximately $0.08 per share, above the $0.05 to $0.07 per share we shared with you in November. We plan to step up our incremental investment again in fiscal 2016 for our e-commerce activities around the world.
This investment is expected to range between $0.06 and $0.09 per share over fiscal 2015. As I indicated at the October investor conference, the heaviest investment in e-commerce will come over the next 18 to 24 months as we further integrate the shopping experience, appealing to our customers' desire for convenience, access and assortment. We then expect to see operating losses start to moderate at the end of that period. We continue to seek the right balance between sales growth and profitability for e-commerce.
Doug shared the news about our people initiatives within our U.S. businesses, including a wage restructuring and training opportunities to help associates earn higher pay and advance their careers. These strategic investments, which will cost approximately $1 billion this year, are designed to ultimately benefit our customers and our businesses through a better store and club experience.
However, they will impact our earnings per share this fiscal year. In the first quarter, we expect these investments to negatively impact earnings per share by approximately $0.02. The full year earnings per share impact is expected to be approximately $0.20.
In addition to the impact from these 2 significant investments, operating income, like sales, will also be pressured by currency exchange rates of around $0.10 per share. Our earnings per share guidance is based on a fiscal 2016 estimated tax rate ranging between 32% and 34%.
Our tax rate will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter and may be impacted by a number of factors, including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, valuation allowances, changes in law, outcomes of administrative audits, the impacts of discrete items and the mix of earnings among our U.S. and international operations. In any given quarter, our effective tax rate could be higher or lower than the full year range. As we have seen in the past, we expect our first quarter tax rate for fiscal 2016 to be the highest of the 4 quarters.
Taking all of this into account, we expect first quarter fiscal year 2016 earnings per share to range between $0.95 and $1.10. This compares to $1.10 last year. We expect full year earnings per share to range between $4.70 and $5.05. This compares to reported earnings per share of $4.99 in fiscal 2015, which included the discrete items we've discussed.
Now before we wrap up today's call, I would like to address a few additional items. After growth organically or by acquisition, our remaining cash flows provide shareholder returns in the form of dividends and share repurchases.
Today, we announced an increase in our dividend from $1.92 to $1.96 per share for fiscal 2016 to be paid out quarterly. We've now increased our dividend each year for 42 years. We will continue to be opportunistic with share repurchase.
Market conditions, general business trends, operating results and a goal of maintaining our AA credit rating, among other factors, influence our share repurchase activity. Working capital management remains a very high priority for us, and although we have made some improvements in fiscal 2015, we acknowledge we have more work to do. Our leadership teams are very committed to further improvement in fiscal year 2016.
Throughout Walmart, we remain focused on being disciplined in delivering for our associates, our customers and our shareholders. Thank you for listening today and for your continued interest in our company."

Before we get underway, we apologize for the delay in this morning's release. We normally release our earnings at 6 a.m. Central Time or 7:00 Eastern. However, because we wanted to share some exciting news about our U.S. associates with them first, we delayed the release until now.
So this morning, we have several pieces of news to share with you. First, we have details on the fourth quarter and full year results for fiscal year 2015. Second, as we normally do, we provide guidance for the full year and the first quarter of fiscal 2016. Third, as I mentioned, we're announcing a new wage structure for hourly associates in Walmart U.S. stores and Sam's Clubs.

The smaller Neighborhood Markets range in size from 12,000 to 16,000 square feet and are still part of a test concept and not included in comp sales.
As a reminder, for fiscal 2015, which ended January 31, 2015, we utilized a 52-week comp reporting calendar. In Q4, we reported a 13-week comp versus a 14-week comp period reported last year. Our Q4 reporting period began on November 1, 2014, and ran through January 30, 2015.
Consistent with industry practice, we did not adjust the reported fiscal 2015 comps. Comps were based upon 13- and 52-week periods, respectively, compared with 14-week and 53-week periods that we reported in fiscal 2014. We've posted a week-by-week comp reporting calendar under the comp sales link on the Investors portion of our website.
Now recall that last fiscal year's earnings per share were impacted by $0.26 of discrete items. This year, as you'll note in our earnings release and on this call, earnings per share were impacted also by $0.08 of discrete items.
Additional information regarding underlying EPS and other terms used in today's release, including constant currency, gross profit and gross profit rate, are available on our website.
Let's get on with today's call. Doug McMillon, President and CEO of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., will cover key results, an analysis of our successes and challenges and the news about our wage structure changes and training programs. Claire Babineaux-Fontenot, EVP and Treasurer, will provide context for the financial details not included in the accompanying slide presentation.
Then we'll cover the 3 operating segments. Greg Foran, President and CEO of Walmart U.S., followed by Dave Cheesewright, President and CEO of Walmart International, and Rosalind Brewer, President and CEO of Sam's Club. Neil Ashe, President and CEO of Global eCommerce, is joining the call this quarter to provide an analysis of how we did for the year, along with insights on our strategic investments for fiscal year '16. And Charles Holley, Walmart's CFO, will wrap up with an analysis of fiscal year 2015 and guidance for fiscal year 2016.
Now I'm pleased to introduce our CEO, Doug McMillon, to share some exciting news with you today. Doug?"

Overall, we had a good fourth quarter to close out our fiscal year, with underlying earnings per share of $1.61. Walmart U.S. delivered better-than-expected comp sales. Sam's Club had its best performance of the year, and Walmart International had solid sales and profitability.
The dedication of our associates around the world to serve customers was evident again in this busy fourth quarter. Now clearly, our sales benefited from customers having more spending power due to lower gas prices in most of our large markets. In addition, product inflation and more favorable weather were a tailwind to U.S. comp sales.
But like many other global companies, we faced significant headwinds from currency exchange fluctuations. So I'm pleased that we delivered fiscal year revenue of nearly $486 billion. But we're not satisfied. We have work to do to grow the business. We know what customers want from a shopping experience, and we're investing strategically to exceed their expectations. Our priority is to run great stores, clubs and e-commerce everywhere we operate. And we'll continue integrating our stores with our e-commerce and mobile commerce business.
One of our most important priorities this year is improving the customer experience. Today, we announced a bold new initiative on pay and training to invest in our U.S. store and club hourly associates. For several months, our leadership teams have been developing and testing new ideas to reward associates for their service to our customers and give them clearer pathways for opportunity.
We're pursuing a comprehensive approach to our hiring, training, compensation, scheduling programs and store management structure that is sustainable over the long term. Approximately 500,000 full-time and part-time associates at Walmart U.S. stores and Sam's Clubs will receive pay raises in the first half of the current fiscal year. Current and future associates will benefit from this initiative, which ensures that Walmart hourly associates earn at least $1.75 above today's federal minimum wage or $9 per hour in April. The following year, by February 1, 2016, current associates will earn at least $10 per hour.
We're also realigning our store operational structure to give associates a closer relationship with their supervisors. Associates will have more ownership over their schedules. In addition, we'll provide them with more resources and training to enable merit-based career advancement and higher levels of pay.
Of course, for a number of years, associates have had the opportunity for competitive health care and 401(k) benefits as well as access to bonus incentive opportunities, discounts and educational programs. These programs will continue to be available to current and future associates.
We're also launching an innovative program for future associates that will allow them to join Walmart at $9 per hour or more, receive skills-based training for 6 months and then be guaranteed at least $10 per hour upon successful completion of that program.
Sam Walton used to say that our people make the difference. I share this same philosophy. Overall, these are strategic investments in our people to reignite the sense of ownership they have in our stores. As a result, we firmly believe that our customers will benefit from a better store experience, which can drive higher sales and returns for our shareholders over time.
Walmart has represented a ladder of opportunity since we started the business. And we want to make sure that's the case going forward everywhere we operate, including here in the United States. Globally, we have ongoing efforts in place to review our associates' compensation on a yearly basis in each of our markets.
For example, in China, we recently launched the compensation structure for stores and clubs, and in this year, we are launching a new compensation structure for our distribution center associates to improve the overall competitiveness of our practices. Later this year, Walmart Mexico will launch training programs to give associates more ownership and accountability so they can react faster to customers' needs.
Included in today's announcement, Walmart and the Walmart Foundation also committed to $100 million over 5 years to help increase the economic mobility for entry-level workers by focusing on initiatives to better train and advance workers in the retail and other service industries throughout the United States.
As we look at our business through the lens of the customer, our enterprise strategy is helping us to find where our additional investments are focused. While we're concentrating on running a good business today, we're also clear on how we should position it for the future.
Value matters to everyone regardless of household income level, and digital access creates even more price transparency. Being the low-price leader has been a part of our customer proposition, and it will continue to be a priority in the future.
We're also evaluating our assortment and our approach to service, both in stores and online, to be relevant for today's customer. And we're testing various access points to provide convenience and allow customers to shop on their terms. This past quarter, we initiated a number of work streams that will deliver on these key initiatives. I'm excited about what we'll accomplish over this next year as we drive our enterprise strategy.
Now let's review Walmart's financial results in more detail. Walmart U.S. improved its sales and operating income trends each consecutive quarter during fiscal 2015. Fourth quarter comp sales were the strongest in more than 2 years, with positive traffic for the first time in 9 quarters.
Our Neighborhood Markets have continued to deliver strong comps. Our emphasis remains on the quality of the stores that we open, not the quantity. I'm pleased with the strategy that Greg and his team are executing to raise the standard of customer experience in the U.S. business. They're taking steps to enhance store operations on various fronts, including inventory management, checkout and in-stock.
For the holidays, Walmart U.S. implemented a Checkout Promise to keep more registers open during peak periods, and customer response has been positive enough that this has continued into the first quarter. I'm encouraged by the focus of the leadership team, and I look forward to seeing more progress in our stores this year toward a better experience for our customers.
Walmart International produced solid constant currency sales and operating income growth this year. Dave and his team have done a good job weathering a tough macro environment. Canada's sales gained momentum in the back half. In China, we made progress in store operations and in e-commerce. We continue to earn customers' trust with our commitments to food safety. There's so much potential for this market, and we're taking the right steps to solidify a foundation for long-term growth.
The U.K. market remains very competitive, and Asda is committed to its GBP 5 billion 5-year investment to lower prices for customers. We're making progress in Mexico. There's still work to do in Brazil.
Sam's Club had a solid year, with membership income up over 10%. Comp sales without fuel continued to improve throughout the year. And operating income with fuel grew at a greater rate than sales. Roz and the team made good progress on the ongoing merchandise transformation, embedding new on-trend and exciting merchandise into the clubs and online. Members are responding by driving sales in these categories.
Members are also pleased with the new innovative services that were launched this year to increase the value of a Sam's Club membership. You'll hear more from Neil shortly about the strides that we're making in our e-commerce customer experience, assortment and supply chain. We're leveraging technology to strengthen our e-commerce and mobile capabilities and integrating these digital assets with our more than 11,000 stores globally.
Overall, e-commerce sales grew approximately 22% in fiscal year 2015, solid but not quite as strong as we wanted. We're striving to balance sales growth and profitability. We're being thoughtful with our investments, ensuring we have the infrastructure in place to build this business for the long term. I'm excited about the possibilities that are in front of us.
One of the headlines in e-commerce is the tremendous growth from mobile devices. In fact, nearly 70% of Walmart.com traffic in the U.S. came via mobile during the recent holiday period. Customers who previously shopped using their laptops are now using their phones and tablets.
And this isn't just a U.S. trend. For example, traffic from the mobile app in Brazil nearly tripled on the Black Friday holiday. Around the world, we're well positioned to create a strong mobile experience for customers this year and beyond.
As I reflect back on my first year as CEO, I'm proud of the accomplishments of our associates and leadership team. It's been a period of change for the 2.2 million associates that make up the Walmart team, but it's been inspiring to see our associates rally around our company's purpose.
Last week, more than 5,000 members of our U.S. store leadership gathered for our annual year beginning meeting. I heard directly from our store managers how we could help them run better stores. And similar meetings are occurring around the world. Regardless of our responsibility, we're in this together. Each of us has a role to play in making our customers' shopping experience a great one. Our secret to success continues to be that we're all working together.
We've made a lot of progress on bringing strategic clarity and in reinvigorating our commitment to run better businesses today. Retail is changing so quickly that we must move with greater urgency to stay out in front.
I like the passion that I'm seeing from our leadership team as they work together to shape and deliver our enterprise strategy. We're thinking differently about retail and about the world. This drives our approach to global responsibility in areas like environmental sustainability, women's economic empowerment and offering healthy food choices. It's important work and it matters to our customers and shareholders. We remain steadfast in our commitment to compliance, ethics and doing the right thing. I'm pleased with the technology enhancements we've made to strengthen these organizations.
As I close my remarks, let me reiterate that I'm proud of what we accomplished this past year, but I'm more excited about what lies ahead. The deliberate strategic choices that we're making around investments in our associates and e-commerce capabilities will improve the customer experience. And we believe that shareholders will also benefit from these investments in the future. Now I'll turn it over to Claire. Claire?"

Further details are available in the accompanying presentation posted today with this transcript. Before I begin, let me remind you that last year, the company's fourth quarter and fiscal 2014 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Walmart EPS, were negatively impacted by certain discrete items totaling $0.26.
The company's fourth quarter and fiscal 2015 EPS were negatively impacted by discrete items totaling $0.08. A wage and hour litigation matter previously disclosed resulted in a charge of $0.05 per share, and store closures in Japan resulted in a charge of $0.03 per share. A reconciliation of the company's underlying EPS is included in our earnings press release issued prior to the call. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, underlying EPS was $1.61 compared to last year's underlying EPS of $1.60. Reported EPS was $1.53 compared to last year's EPS of $1.34.
As you can see on Slide 2, total revenue for the fourth quarter was $131.6 billion. Consolidated net sales increased $1.9 billion or 1.4%, and membership and other income declined 0.5%. Recall that during the fourth quarter of last year, membership and other income was positively impacted by a $24 million gain from the sale of certain U.S. real estate assets.
Total revenue for the year grew to $485.7 billion as consolidated net sales increased $9.2 billion or 1.9% and membership and other income grew 6.3%. Consolidated operating expenses increased 0.5% for the quarter and 2.3% for the full year.
It is important to remember that operating expenses were negatively impacted in the fourth quarter and for the full year by the discrete items I mentioned earlier. Additionally, FCPA and compliance-related costs were $36 million in the fourth quarter, comprised of $26 million for the ongoing inquiries and investigations and $10 million for our global compliance program and organizational enhancements.
For the full year, FCPA and compliance-related costs were $173 million, comprised of $121 million for the ongoing inquiries and investigations and $52 million for our global compliance program and organizational enhancements. Last year, total FCPA and compliance-related costs were $282 million.
The company's consolidated operating income increased 8.2% during the fourth quarter. Last year's fourth quarter operating income was negatively impacted by the discrete items I mentioned earlier. Fiscal year 2015 operating income increased 1%.
Net interest expense increased 5.8% for the quarter and 6% for the year. The increase for each period was primarily driven by a higher weighted average interest rate on net borrowings.
From a balance sheet perspective, consolidated inventory increased 0.6%. Later in today's call, you'll hear more about inventory from our segment leaders. Payables as a percentage of inventory were 85.1%, which compares to 83.4% last year due primarily to the timing of payments. Improving inventory leverage is important, and we are seeing progress as the company continues to focus on this priority.
We ended the year with capital expenditures of $12.2 billion, slightly below our range of $12.5 billion to $13 billion. For the year, the company added approximately 33 million retail square feet through 511 net new, expanded and relocated units. This was in line with the updated guidance we shared in October.
Finally, let's address returns. ROI for the trailing 12 months ended January 31, 2015, was 16.9%, relatively flat compared to 17% for the prior comparable period. The slight change in ROI was primarily due to continued investments in store growth and e-commerce initiatives, offset by currency exchange rate fluctuations.
For the full year, the company returned $7.2 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. And we ended the year with free cash flow of $16.4 billion compared to $10.1 billion last year. Now I'll turn the call over to Greg. Greg?"

When I joined the Walmart U.S. team 6 months ago, we laid out specific objectives for the second half of fiscal 2015. We knew we needed to become better store managers to fix some of the basics in our stores. We spent the last several months focusing on core fundamentals such as inventory, merchandise returns, shrink, markdowns and wage management.
By focusing on these urgent agenda items and using the tailwinds we've seen from an improving economy, we drove positive momentum in our business. We achieved what we set out to do in the short term, but we're not satisfied and recognize that we have more work to do to accomplish our longer-term goals.
Before discussing our results, I want to provide more detail on the exciting announcement we made this morning regarding associate pay and store structure. As Doug mentioned, we believe our people make the difference, and we're committed to this philosophy. At Walmart, we already provide an opportunity for jobs to become careers in retail. We want to continue to improve that opportunity and to provide it to more associates. The changes we are making are based on our core principles and will make Walmart a better place to work and shop.
First, we believe associates equally value their hourly rate and hours worked. We're happy to announce improvements to both aspects of associates' earnings opportunity. Current and future associates will benefit from this initiative, which ensures that Walmart hourly associates earn at least $1.75 above today's federal minimum wage or $9 per hour in April. And current associates will earn $10 per hour or higher by next February.
Additionally, we are piloting a scheduling system that will create stability for associates who want predictable hours and the flexibility for those who prefer to select additional shifts to meet customers' needs each week. Starting in 2016, we will be one of the first retailers to offer some associates fixed hours each week.
Next, we are realigning our store operational structure, adding back department managers to give associates a closer relationship with their supervisors to help improve communication, direction and recognition.
And finally, we are making new commitments to train associates. They will engage in interactive learning programs to build skills, demonstrate proficiency and be rewarded for their efforts through pay raises and promotions into areas of greater responsibility.
We will also offer opportunities to pursue further education, including a high school diploma or GED program, access to language training and free or low-cost college credits to reduce the time and cost of a college education.
I want to say thank you to all our 1.2 million Walmart U.S. associates. Together, we're part of something bigger than ourselves and bigger than our company. What we do at Walmart extends beyond our stores to our own communities and across this country. I'm thankful to be a part of this organization.
Now let's move to this quarter's performance. Net sales grew $3.1 billion or 4.1% versus last year. For the 13-week period ended January 30, comparable store sales were up 1.5%, which exceeded our guidance. This represents an approximate 100 basis point improvement over Q3 and was largely driven by a 1.4% improvement in traffic.
This quarter marks the first positive traffic comp since Q3 of fiscal year 2013 as customers saw increased purchasing power from lower gas prices. We also lapped the SNAP reductions and unfavorable weather seen last year. E-commerce contributed approximately 30 basis points to our comp performance.
During the 6-week holiday season, we experienced overall comp sales growth. We saw increased traffic to the store, aided by our broadcast and digital holiday hub marketing campaign. Strong sales of seasonal merchandise and toys, along with key brands in gifts and apparel and home, offset industry declines in entertainment.
Customers also continued to refine how they prepared for the holidays, shopping earlier in November for holiday deals and looking for last-minute gift ideas all the way through Christmas Eve. We were ready when and where our customers needed us, completing almost 1 billion total transactions over the holiday season including our largest online day ever on Cyber Monday.
Looking across the entire fourth quarter, our growth in comp sales was attributable to several key areas of the business. First, we remained pleased by our apparel and home businesses, which brought value to the customers through strong national brands, consistent quality across price points and relevant products at the right time of the season.
Second, our health and wellness business, including optical, remained strong, with growth in script counts from higher penetration in Medicare and Medicaid plans, branded drug inflation and a strengthening over-the-counter business.
Third, while our grocery performance was assisted primarily by inflation and lapping last year's SNAP reductions, we also saw progress from urgent agenda items, including a focus on adding days of freshness in produce. We still have a long way to go to improve our fresh business and remain focused on this goal.
And finally, we saw strong performance from our Neighborhood Market format. While all formats experienced positive sales comps, our traditional Neighborhood Markets continue to outperform Walmart Supercenters and discount stores, providing customers with the products and services they desire at locations that are convenient to them. Our traditional Neighborhood Markets delivered approximately a 7.7% comp for the quarter.
Yet while we saw a positive momentum in these categories, we remain challenged in others. Specifically, declines in our entertainment business persisted as we faced industry contraction and deflation across many categories. Lapping last year's gaming console releases, along with fewer video game titles available for new consoles and shifts from physical to digital media in movies and books, drove high single-digit negative comps in this area.
Additionally, although we launched wireless installment plans in November, we're still ramping up this service as we reacquaint customers with our ability to serve them in this category. Finally, softness in electronics also impacted our online business, particularly in the ship-to-home channel.
In e-commerce, we remain thoughtful about growth, striving to produce sustainable results through digital and physical access. Our focus on serving customers led to strong performance in Pick Up Today and Ship from Store capabilities, particularly during the holiday season. However, we recognize the significant opportunity we have to grow this area of our business as customers continue to reshape their shopping behaviors.
Now for the remainder of our financial results. In the fourth quarter, gross profit rate was relatively flat. Operating expenses increased 5.6%, driven primarily by changes in estimates associated with our incentive accrual versus last year. Additionally, we intensified our focus on improving customer experience in our stores.
While these actions increased costs, we believe it was the right decision for the customer. In fact, our Checkout Promise program drove customer experience satisfaction scores to their highest level during the holiday season. Due to the success of this program, we are implementing it more broadly in fiscal 2016. Overall, operating income declined approximately 60 basis points for the quarter.
Inventory growth moderated from prior quarters, growing 3.9% and less than the rate of sales in Q4. This growth was primarily related to the significant number of new store openings in the quarter. In fact, we opened 178 stores in this quarter alone, including 10 Supercenters and 168 traditional and small-format Neighborhood Markets.
Comp store inventory improved in this quarter, driven by a strong holiday sell-through and better aligned seasonal markdowns in apparel. Inventory management is a key element to customer experience. And whilst we have room for improvement, we are also making progress to better manage working capital.
Now let me cover our full year financial performance. For the year, net sales increased 3.1% or $8.6 billion to $288 billion. Comp sales improved 0.5% for the 52-week period ended January 30, while operating income declined 2.1% to $21.3 billion. Gross profit improved 2.6% for the year, with a 12 basis point decline in gross profit rate. This was primarily driven by price investments in meat and preferred Medicare prescription plans. 
Expenses were up 4.3%, deleveraging 24 basis points for the year and driven primarily by increased health care costs from higher enrollment rates and medical cost inflation. Expenses were further deleveraged by the initial ramp-up of 17 new medical care clinics, increased utility expenses from cold weather early in the year and higher rates throughout the year and declining rates in recyclable materials such as cardboard. Recall that we get a financial benefit from recycled materials.
Moving to real estate. We opened 353 net new stores, including relocations and expansions and added almost 21 million retail square feet. 1 year ago, we started to accelerate our Neighborhood Market format. This fiscal year, we opened 165 traditional-format Neighborhood Markets and 68 smaller Neighborhood Markets.
By continuing to drive this format, we're able to offer customers easy and convenient access to fresh foods, pharmacy and services at Walmart's Every Day Low Price guarantee. Supercenters remain the driver of our sales and growth in retail square footage. Customers continue to rely heavily on this format for their broader shopping needs.
This year, we opened an additional 119 Supercenters including conversions and relocations. In FY '16, we expect to open approximately 60 to 70 Supercenters, including relocations and expansions. Additionally, we'll open an estimated 180 to 200 Neighborhood Markets, including 10 to 15 smaller-format locations as we complete our openings of this test program. We'll continue to monitor the progress of these test locations before making any further commitments to this format. We expect to add approximately 15 million to 16 million retail square feet this year.
Digital access is important to our customers now more than ever. They expect a seamless interaction whether it's in the store or online. We see many opportunities at Walmart to evolve with the customer in their digital and physical experiences.
For example, this year, we developed a collaborative approach to the holiday season in toys, with our store and Walmart.com teams working closely together to ensure our customers had the same experience with Walmart no matter where or when they shopped. We've been investing in expanding capabilities to allow customers to shop on their own terms and are moving sensibly towards this integration of digital and physical.
This includes offering customers a variety of ways to interact with our brand, including picking up their Walmart.com orders at their local store, providing reminders and refill capabilities through our pharmacy app and our latest test concept, Walmart Grocery.
This year, we expanded grocery delivery and pickup tests to include the entire Denver market and launched Walmart Grocery Pickup here in Northwest Arkansas this past October. And just last week, we announced the expansion of Walmart Grocery online to select locations in the Phoenix, Arizona and Huntsville, Alabama markets. 
We have an advantage at Walmart by combining our store and distribution network with our e-commerce capabilities to allow our customers to interact with our brand in ways that are most convenient for them. Whether it's in a store, online or on our mobile app, we are focused on providing the best solutions for customers.
The upcoming fiscal year will be a time of change and further improvement to the business. Our focus on inventory management, in-stock levels and customer service is just the beginning.
Recently, we made changes within our management team. These changes have allowed me to get closer to our merchandising teams, and the new leadership brings with them fresh ideas and an invigorating spirit. We've also just wrapped up our year beginning meeting, which is a time to gather our store managers to thank them for their hard work in the prior year and to discuss the focus areas for the upcoming year.
The meeting was energizing, and our store managers left excited for a fresh start to become better store managers, focusing on item merchandising and providing great service to the customer.
We'll continue on the path towards hiring 100,000 veterans by 2018. We set this goal just under 2 years ago. And we're proud to say that we've already hired almost 80,000 veterans through this program. Furthermore, over 6,000 have been promoted to roles of greater responsibility since joining the Walmart team.
But fiscal 2016 will not be without its challenges. Our bottom line will continue to be pressured, primarily from the significant investments in associates that I covered earlier. In addition, we will see impact from the changing mix within merchandise categories, store formats and retail channels and the investments in digital and physical integration. While we expect to offset some of these headwinds by executing and delivering on our urgent agenda items and other initiatives, we know these investments are necessary to position ourselves to meet the rapidly changing needs of the customer.
We may see risk to import merchandise flows related to the upcoming spring and Easter seasons due to ongoing port congestion. We'll continue to take the appropriate steps using our diversified supply chain network to reduce the impact for our customers.
In the first quarter, we expect a continuation of lower gas prices to provide a tailwind to our business. This could be somewhat offset by a shorter selling season, with Easter coming earlier than last year, as well as potential impact from port congestion. For the 13-week period ending May 1, we anticipate a comp sales increase of 1% to 2%. Last year's 13-week comp ended May 2, 2014, was down 8 basis points.
Now I'll turn it over to Dave for an update on Walmart International. Dave?"

I'm pleased with our performance in International as we've remained committed to the strategic priorities I outlined 1 year ago. We've been able to produce solid results and operating income growth despite operating in a very challenging competitive retail environment.
As one of our key priorities, we continue to accelerate our e-commerce business by offering multiple ways for our customers to shop. Whether in stores, online, pickup or mobile, we aim to give our customers the ability to shop in whichever way they want.
We've also made progress in building a platform for sustainable growth in China and have experienced success in improving our overall price perception as well as the quality of our fresh offering. We also continued to make progress on our commitment of actively managing our existing portfolio.
You've seen us make strategic decisions such as closing underperforming stores and divesting noncore parts of our business in order to strengthen our foundation. Our markets remain focused on key strategic priorities, and I'm optimistic about our position going forward into the new year.
Now for our financial results. In the fourth quarter, net sales grew 3% on a constant currency basis. However, with the U.S. dollar at historic highs, we faced significant currency headwinds of $2.6 billion, resulting in a 3.9% sales decline on a reported basis.
Of our 5 largest countries, Mexico, Canada and Brazil delivered positive comp sales for the quarter. Comps declined in both the U.K. and China due primarily to food deflation and intense competition in the U.K. and government austerity measures and deflation in key categories in China.
Comp sales growth was strong in all other markets as well. As Claire mentioned, there were certain discrete items disclosed in the previous year, which have a significant impact on our year-over-year operating income comparison. For financial year ending '15, our fourth quarter results were negatively impacted by Japan store closure costs of $148 million.
Overall, operating income increased 79.6% on a constant currency basis and 66.4% on a reported basis. Excluding the previous and current years' discrete items, we grew operating income on a constant currency basis by 14.2%.
For the full year, sales grew 3.6% on a constant currency basis, while the strong U.S. dollar resulted in a full year sales decline of 0.3% on a reported basis, reflecting over a $5 billion currency impact. Full year operating income grew 24.1% on a constant currency basis and 19.8% on a reported basis. Excluding the items mentioned above, operating income grew 9.3% on a constant currency basis, outpacing full year sales growth.
We made progress in reducing inventory levels during the quarter and dropped the growth rate over 250 basis points versus the previous quarter to a 4.6% growth on a constant currency basis. We had positive momentum on inventory management heading into the new year. 
Now let's discuss individual results for our largest markets. Comp sales and growth rates are presented on a constant currency basis only. In all countries except Brazil and China, results are inclusive of e-commerce. Slides 8 and 9 of the presentation summarize financial details.
The U.K. market remained very competitive during the quarter, with grocery inflation falling to a record low of negative 0.9% over the 12 weeks ended January 4, according to Kantar. Total market growth of 0.6% was a slight improvement over the previous quarter, boosted by Christmas sales and increased discretionary spending from lower fuel prices. However, overall market trends remain relatively weak. According to Kantar, Asda, along with the other big grocers, lost share to hard discounters for the quarter.
U.K. sales declined 1.7% and comp sales declined 2.5%, excluding fuel. Several competitors held a Black Friday event for the first time, and others continued intense vouchering, which led to increased competition versus 1 year ago. Asda online sales remained strong, while George home continued to register double-digit growth. Despite the top line pressures, Asda was able to grow income ahead of sales.
Now turning to Canada, which had a very solid fourth quarter performance. Sales grew 4.1%, with comp sales increasing 1.8%, marking this the third consecutive quarter of positive comps. Price investments and increased consumer spending contributed to improved trends in sales.
We reported strong comp sales in food, health and wellness and consumables. While general merchandise and apparel sales improved versus prior quarter results, they were still below the rate of growth in the market.
Our fresh business also continues to accelerate, resulting in the highest comp sales for the year in quarter 4. Canada had a strong holiday season overall, with the online business up 38.5%. Walmart Canada grew 43 basis points of market share in food, consumables and health and wellness combined, as reported by Nielsen for the 12-week period ending January 24.
Canada completed a restructuring in the quarter to simplify home office operations. This, along with continued investments in e-commerce and pricing, resulted in a decline in operating income. Overall, we're pleased with the positive sales trend we've seen in our Canadian operations, and we expect momentum to continue.
Next, we'll discuss Walmex, which released their quarterly results on February 17. Please note the Walmex release is under IFRS and the results here are under U.S. GAAP. Thus, some numbers will differ.
Consolidated Walmex sales grew 3.4%, with positive comp sales in both Mexico and Central America. Walmex leveraged expenses for the quarter and grew operating income faster than sales. Mexico sales increased 3%, and the comp sales were up 0.1% for the quarter.
According to ANTAD, the entire market experienced slower comp growth in the fourth quarter of 0.7% in self-service. Walmart Mexico comps, excluding Sam's Club, exceeded the market by 80 basis points. Performance was especially strong in our small-format Bodega Aurrera Express, which outperformed the market by 750 basis points.
Sam's Club growth lagged the market by approximately 330 basis points. However, we're encouraged by the improving top line trends at Sam's as December comp sales were the strongest of the year. Sam's Club remains a focus area, and we will continue to accelerate initiatives to improve the business.
Next, let's talk about Brazil. Brazil continued sales momentum in Q4, growing net sales and comp sales by 3.1%. Holiday sales were driven by strong performances in both food and consumables. Strategic and targeted pricing resulted in margin favorability for the quarter. Management also continued to drive labor productivity and control expenses. While we are seeing some positive results, there's still work to be done in our turnaround plan.
Moving to China. Ongoing headwinds from government austerity measures, reduction in gift card sales and continued deflation in key categories continued to pose challenges in the market. Walmart China's Q4 net sales declined 0.7%, and comp sales declined 2.3%, partially due to Chinese New Year falling nearly 3 weeks later than last year.
We increased market share in the hypermarket category for the eighth consecutive quarter, according to Nielsen, for the period ended December 31. We expect market headwinds to continue in the new year, but we're confident that we'll continue to accelerate growth in this important market.
Over the year, China has made great progress in strengthening the core business. Our portfolio is now more focused and stronger with the opening of 24 new hypermarket stores and 1 additional Sam's Club, in addition to completing the store closure program announced last year. The distribution center expansion project and the centralization of deliveries to DCs were finalized within the quarter, resulting in a distribution network for fresh that provides coverage for all of our stores in China for the first time.
These initiatives drive efficiency, reduce costs and shorten the lead time to get products on the shelf. Having control over our own distribution network allows us to better monitor the quality and the safety of our products. Additionally, the We Operate for Less and the We Buy for Less programs in China have saved over $150 million over the course of the year.
Finally, let's discuss e-commerce performance across the globe. We remain focused on innovating and providing solutions for our customers seeking convenience. This quarter, we made even more progress, and I'm very excited about the impact we've made in online retail.
In Japan, we automated the order picking process to fulfill Seiyu.com grocery orders more efficiently and sustainably. We're testing new offerings such as grab-and-go lockers in Canada. In India, we're continuing the rollout of online offering to business-to-business members and expect to reach all members by the end of next year.
Yihaodian, our e-commerce business in China, benefited from investments in the supply chain and promotional events. Traffic increased more than 40% and average ticket improved as well. The fourth quarter was highlighted by a successful Singles Day promotion in November, generating strong sales and traffic growth, aided by an increase in orders from mobile devices.
In Brazil, e-commerce sales growth was strong again this quarter, driven by strong sales in large appliances and wireless, where low-cost smartphones helped drive sales growth of more than double the same period last year. Promotions fueled sales growth, with the Black Friday and 72-hour events delivering strong comp sales. Traffic via our mobile app nearly tripled on Black Friday.
Looking ahead, we will continue to innovate and execute our strategic plan. I'm amazed by how similar our customers' needs are around the world. Value, assortment and convenience are paramount. We remain focused on saving our customers money by expanding our private label offering, improving product sourcing and driving costs out of our operations so that we can invest it back into price.
We know convenience means different things to customers at different times. It could mean shopping online, home grocery delivery, a one-stop shop experience or a drive-through pickup, and we're innovating to provide customers more shopping options than ever. No matter the shopper's preference, Walmart will continue to strive to be the destination of choice.
Our objectives for this year will continue to build upon a foundation that's been established. In financial year ending '16, we're committed to: actively managing the existing portfolio; driving comp sales; accelerating e-commerce; delivering market priorities, including establishing a platform for sustainable growth in China; moving forward with the turnaround efforts in Brazil and reenergizing the business in Mexico; and lastly, strengthening enablers, which means being the lowest-cost operator, building world-class talent and building trust.
Let me close by thanking our nearly 800,000 international associates around the world for delivering a strong performance in financial year ending '15. As I reflect on the past year, I'm humbled by what our team has accomplished and their relentless focus on saving customers money. I look forward to updating you on our results in the coming months. Now I'll turn it over to Roz for the update on Sam's. Roz?"

I'd like to start by echoing our excitement at Sam's Club regarding the company's announcement today to boost the starting wage for our full-time and part-time hourly associates. We believe we provide our associates with an excellent opportu",1695,"Thanks, Dave. I'd like to start by echoing our excitement at Sam's Club regarding the company's announcement today to boost the starting wage for our full-time and part-time hourly associates. We believe we provide our associates with an excellent opportunity to pursue careers in retail.
Because our business model at Sam's Club differs from Walmart stores, beginning in the first half of the fiscal year, we will offer a starting hourly wage of $9.50, which is above the federal minimum wage, unless there is a higher state-mandated minimum wage. This will ensure all Sam's Club hourly associates are paid above the federal minimum wage. We believe this investment in our associates will help us to attract, retain and develop top-notch talent and will allow us to continue to deliver outstanding, award-winning service to our members.
Now on to Q4. I want to thank our Sam's Club associates for delivering the best performance of the year this quarter, providing momentum going into fiscal '16. Over the last 4 quarters, we saw meaningful acceleration, culminating in a comp sales increase, without fuel, of 2% for the 13-week period ended January 30. Strong holiday execution, combined with our strategic investments in member value, merchandise relevance and the integration of digital and physical, boosted our performance.
Our investments in membership value initiatives enabled us to grow our membership income by over 8% this quarter. Our Plus penetration is at historic highs as Plus members are seeing the benefits from our Cash Rewards program.
Across the club, all members are seeing the benefits of Instant Savings and the 5-3-1 MasterCard. We will anniversary the introduction of Plus Cash Rewards and the 5-3-1 MasterCard in June 2015, so we expect these programs to continue driving membership income moving forward.
Sam's net sales including fuel were $14.9 billion, up 1.3% over last year. This was impacted by the approximately 25% decline in fuel prices, with gallons sold up approximately 8%. Our gross profit rate increased 23 basis points due to higher margin on fuel. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales decreased by 50 basis points.
Operating income increased 29.1% to $510 million, which includes a $41 million increase in fuel profit. Our 500-plus fuel stations provided value to members through competitive pricing, and the 5-3-1 MasterCard holders benefit from an additional 5% off all gas purchases.
Given the volatility in fuel prices, the remainder of this discussion will exclude fuel. Additionally, for comparisons, please recall that last year, we had certain items impacting our results which included: a $39 million charge to gross profit due to an adjustment to our product warranty liabilities; a $59 million charge to operating expenses for a new in-club staffing restructuring and the closure of 1 club; a $24 million gain in other income for the sale of 2 real estate properties.
In Q4, net sales grew 3.7% and we delivered comp sales of 2%, driven by traffic growth of 1.5% and ticket of 0.5%.
The Savings member continues to drive traffic. We have lapped last year's SNAP reductions and benefited from favorable weather this quarter. Retail inflation across the club has moderated slightly since the previous quarter.
Our gross profit declined 32 basis points versus last year due to the planned impact of Plus Cash Rewards and pressure from merchandise mix, which were offset by last year's product warranty charge. Without the comparative benefit of the product warranty charge last year, gross profit declined 61 basis points. As discussed previously, the rollout of Plus Cash Rewards will pressure gross profit in the first half of fiscal year 2016. 
Operating expenses were well managed in the quarter and we leveraged 82 basis points. Even without the comparative benefit of last year's discrete items, we leveraged expenses. We had disciplined expense management in a number of areas, including the optimization of the club staffing model earlier this year.
Membership and other income grew by 1.4% compared to last year, which factors in the real estate gain. Without the $24 million real estate gain last year, membership and other income was up 8.7%.
Operating income was up 19.4% to $456 million. Without the comparative benefit of last year's items, our operating income was flat to last year. We are still very happy with our overall performance for the quarter, given the significant investments in membership value initiatives such as Plus Cash Rewards, and with good expense management and improvements in membership income, we believe we have great momentum for fiscal 2016.
I also want to highlight the team's efforts around working capital. We reduced total inventory by 3.5% while simultaneously growing our fleet by 16 clubs during the year. Moreover, I am confident in the quality of our inventory for this year.
At Sam's Club, relevant merchandise is a critical component in member engagement, and we continue to improve performance across the box. Our merchants are pushing hard to introduce newness and capture consumer trends while providing the price leadership and assortment that Sam's Club is known for.
Sales of our fresh food business grew positive low single digits this quarter. Performance was led by meat, due to inflation and a strong value proposition. A challenged area was produce, where weather created supply issues. Dry grocery and beverage delivered a positive low single-digit comp, with highlights in newness and healthy-for-you items. We doubled the organic portfolio since the previous quarter, and members are responding positively to new, healthy beverage options.
Let's continue with health and wellness, which posted a positive mid-single-digit comp. Sam's Club is a destination for our members' health care needs, and we see that clearly in our pharmacy comps, which drove the category due to both script growth and branded prescription inflation. Our OTC business, especially our healthy assortment of nutrition bars and protein, also did well.
We've seen an uptick in our consumables business, which posted a positive low single-digit comp. This is an area where members consistently see value through our private brand offerings, improved pack sizes and Instant Savings. For example, members love the quality of our private brand Member's Mark paper products. The disposable tabletop category continues to perform well, and we have introduced newness to improve the laundry and home care business.
Home and apparel delivered a positive low single-digit comp. Our exciting assortment of toys was a highlight, drawing members into the club over the holidays. Apparel continues to show strength, driven by men's wear and children's clothing.
Our underperforming category continues to be technology and entertainment, which posted a negative mid-single-digit comp. This is an improvement versus last quarter as a result of introducing the latest Ultra Hi-Def and 4K TV technologies, a strong value proposition on the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus and an expanded wearables assortment. However, we need to make larger, faster strides. This year, our merchants are rebalancing the portfolio, which involves reallocating resources towards higher-growth, higher-excitement categories.
Ancillary improved to a positive low-single-digit comp, driven by growth in tobacco. We saw improved convenience store traffic trends as we executed strategic pricing initiatives and benefited from shifts in the competitive landscape.
Moving to e-commerce. This quarter, SamsClub.com was integral in supporting our in-club holiday events, becoming a Cyber Week destination and offering online-only promotions that drew members from our physical clubs to our digital platforms. Dotcom delivered double-digit comps in both direct-to-home and Club Pickup, contributing approximately 40 basis points to the segment comp.
We've rebranded Click 'n' Pull to Club Pickup and enhanced the service to appeal to both Savings and Business members. Members have responded well to the relaunch of Club Pickup in all clubs, and we've seen accelerated performance compared to the previous quarter.
The improvements we've made to our mobile and desktop platforms, along with enhancements in messaging, have boosted conversion rates across all platforms. This concludes our discussion on fourth quarter results. Let's continue with the financial results for the full year, where we've seen meaningful, sustainable acceleration every quarter.
With fuel, net sales were $58 billion, up 1.5% over last year. With fuel profit of $122 million, operating income for the year grew 7.2% to $2 billion. Net sales, excluding fuel, were $51.6 billion, up 2.1%. For the 52-week period ending January 30, 2015, comp sales increased 50 basis points, driven by traffic.
While our investments in Cash Rewards for Plus members led to a gross profit rate decline of 38 basis points, we managed expenses well and leveraged 24 basis points. Membership income increased 10.3%, driving operating income of $1.9 billion, a 2% increase over last year.
Fiscal 2016 is well under way and Sam's Club is innovating the member experience through merchandise relevance and digital-physical integration. These 2 priorities are the key to membership engagement. I am confident that our strategic investments will not only differentiate us from our competitors but more importantly, continue enhancing our members' trust and loyalty.
Merchandise relevance is a critical enabler. Our goal is to ensure that members are surprised and delighted by relevant merchandise every time they come into the club or visit our website in every category across the country. Combined with price leadership and newness, merchandise relevance will keep our members coming back for more.
Our fiscal '16 investment strategy reflects the importance of offering a seamless digital-physical club experience for members. I recently was at the grand opening of our new e-commerce facility in San Bruno, California where Jamie Iannone, who leads SamsClub.com, has invested in expanding his team of engineers and scientists.
I am optimistic about our growth opportunities in both the digital and the physical, and that's why we plan to open 9 to 12 new and relocated clubs and remodel between 55 and 60 clubs this year, while simultaneously investing in innovation at SamsClub.com.
Knowing that our most engaged members want to shop with us both in our clubs and online, we will ensure a seamless set of access points for members. I am proud of how we finished out the year. For the 13-week period from January 31 through May 1, we expect comp sales to increase between 1% and 2%.
Now I'll turn things over to Neil for the e-commerce update. Neil?"
313055,274781377,766845,"Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Q4 2015 Pre Recorded Earnings Call, Feb 19, 2015",2015-02-19,"Earnings Calls","Walmart Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Roz. Q4 was an important quarter for us, not just because it is the biggest quarter of the fiscal year but because our key investments started to play a major role in the business.

Q4 was an important quarter for us, not just because it is the biggest quarter of the fiscal year but because our key investments started to play a major role in the business. Most notably, our global technology platform, Pangaea, and our U.S. fulfillment network, stood up under the holiday volumes of U.S. customers.
At the same time, we saw good sales in markets around the world. For the full year and for Q4, we outgrew the e-commerce market globally. Overall, Walmart grew e-commerce sales by 22%, benefited by a 25% increase in gross merchandise value or GMV for the year. In Q4, we grew sales 18% on GMV growth of 20%. An increase in third-party marketplace volumes in the U.S., Brazil and in China contributed to the growth in GMV.
Greg, Dave and Roz talked about the e-commerce successes in the quarter, but it's worth recapping. In the U.S., we had record sales on Cyber Monday and Cyber Week and more than 1.5 billion page views over the 5 days between Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday.
SamsClub.com had strong double-digit comps on Thanksgiving and on Black Friday. On Singles Day in China on November 11, Yihaodian's GMV growth was in the high double digits. And on December 21, we surpassed traffic from Singles Day.
In the U.K., Asda continued to make Click & Collect easier for customers in stores and with new pick up points at petrol stations, tube stations and other locations. We now have Click & Collect in all Asda stores. In Brazil, we saw our strongest sales quarter, with high double-digit sales growth.
What excites me most is the progress we've made in building out our ability to serve customers across digital and physical. We're investing in 4 areas: our global technology platform, our next-generation fulfillment network, our talent and on integrating digital and physical.
Starting with our global technology platform. I refer to this as the operating system for commerce because it is the foundation for serving customers digitally and enables the integration of digital and physical commerce. Building and deploying a new platform is one of the most challenging projects for an e-commerce business, particularly at our scale.
We launched most key elements of our site and mobile shopping experience on the new platform before holiday on Walmart.com in the U.S. Despite all of our testing, with the sheer complexity of a complete platform rebuild, there is nothing like the real thing on the busiest day of the year, Cyber Monday. Pangaea hummed along all day, serving our customers at record volume.
While we were glued to our screens watching performance, a mom in Dallas was glued to her screen on Walmart.com, crossing items off her holiday shopping list. She was most likely shopping on a tablet and she was browsing pages about 30% faster, thanks to Pangaea.
She was seeing a personalized shopping experience with a lot more recommendations for items that her kids might like. Hers was among a record number of orders. It was the first major test of our next-generation fulfillment network, which combined our first large-scale center in Texas with our existing fulfillment centers, distribution centers and stores to ship a record number of Walmart.com orders.
Our team in Texas shipped twice as many orders as last year. She was able to get more things from us even faster. Starting in the second quarter, we have 4 more of these large-scale fulfillment centers coming online. While there will be some ramp-up time, they will significantly expand our fulfillment capacity and efficiency in the coming years.
We've talked about the importance of investing in talent and the fact that we are building a technology company inside the world's largest retailer. In the past year, we have been able to build up our team to the critical mass needed to be that technology company. And we did it in a very selective way, bringing in some of the best talent in Silicon Valley through organic hiring and targeted acquisitions. We also built a great team in Silicon Valley to serve Sam's Club across digital and physical. We'll be continuing to hire the best people, adding to the core team we've built to deliver on our priorities.
When we were together at the analyst meeting in October, I talked through the story of a family in Denver who can rely on Walmart to make their lives easier by being everywhere they need us to be. Echoing Greg, I'm really proud of how we brought together the digital and physical customer experience during the holidays.
In the U.S., we created a series of moments that engaged customers with us, both online and in stores, starting with online deals Thanksgiving morning, leading to the Black Friday store events and through the new evening edition on Cyber Monday for people who worked during the day.
Mobile continued to be a big investment and area of high growth. Nearly 70% of our Walmart.com traffic during the holidays was from mobile devices. Those people used the app in a lot of ways, to do their shopping online, to find a store or to use the new store search tool we added late last year. This search tool allows customers to find product details and the aisle location of a specific item.
Sam's also offered a significantly enhanced shopping experience through its app and mobile website. In addition to Walmart, we focused on Sam's digital and physical integration with its Club Pickup experience, and it paid off as we saw nearly 30% growth in Club Pickup during holiday.
We're also continuing to create a stronger relationship with new and existing customers with grocery pickup and delivery. We've continued to see great feedback from customers on our tests in San Jose and Denver. And last week, we started serving customers in Phoenix, Arizona and Huntsville, Alabama.
To sum up, last year was a building year and that will continue this year. We ended up investing an incremental $0.08 per share during the fiscal year 2015, which was over our forecast of $0.05 to $0.07 as we continue to invest in fulfillment and other areas to serve our customers.
As I mentioned, we saw global sales grow by 22%, benefited by a 25% increase in GMV for the fiscal year. Fiscal year 2016 will continue to be a building year, and we expect sales to grow worldwide in the mid-20s.
In fiscal year 2016, we expect to invest incrementally between $0.06 and $0.09 per share for e-commerce initiatives. Our investments will continue to significantly enhance the customer experience and drive greater efficiency.
This will include the continued rollout of our U.S. site based on Pangaea, which will make checkout faster and easier for our customers. It is also serving as a backbone to an integrated experience across online, stores and mobile. It will empower new ways to serve customers through mobile.
That platform will also allow us to further expand our online assortment. We'll do that through a thoughtful balance of our own merchandise and marketplace sellers. We expect to double our assortment this year to well over 10 million SKUs.
We'll also continue fulfilling our promise to deliver orders to customers when and where they want them. Our next-generation fulfillment network combines new large-scale fulfillment centers that combine with our DCs and stores, all connected by Walmart's transportation network.
Our data scientists have built algorithms that dictate the assortment that needs to be placed in our different nodes and to dictate from which node we ship and order. 4 new fulfillment centers will come online starting in the second quarter. When fully operational, these centers, along with our other nodes, will position us to serve the vast majority of the U.S. population fast and at a low cost.
We're working closely with Greg's team to deliver a seamless experience for customers who use our stores to pick up or return orders. And we're working with Roz's team to continue enhancing Sam's Club Pickup and making reordering fast and simple.
Sam's will also make signing up easier and make membership even more valuable with services and by helping members discover new products. Sam's will have the ability to leverage Walmart's investment in e-commerce.
At the same time, we'll continue to invest in the major markets for e-commerce, most notably Brazil, China and the U.K. And we'll continue to expand our relationship with customers through online grocery pickup and delivery. All of these achievements from this quarter significantly improved our ability to serve customers however they want to shop with us. And many of our investments from last year will roll out this year.
We have significant opportunities ahead, and I feel great about the progress we've made on our priorities, including our global technology platform, talent, next-generation fulfillment network and the integration of digital and physical. We are delivering Walmart where you are, whether you shop online, through mobile or in stores. No matter how you shop, we're helping you save money and live better.
Now I'll hand it over to Charles. Charles?"
313055,274781377,766845,"Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Q4 2015 Pre Recorded Earnings Call, Feb 19, 2015",2015-02-19,"Earnings Calls","Walmart Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Neil. I'll wrap up today's discussion by providing some thoughts on the company's performance. For the year, we delivered $486 billion in revenue. E-commerce sales grew approximately 22% to more than $12 billion.We delivered fourth quarter under",1061,"Thanks, Neil. I'll wrap up today's discussion by providing some thoughts on the company's performance. For the year, we delivered $486 billion in revenue. E-commerce sales grew approximately 22% to more than $12 billion.
We delivered fourth quarter underlying earnings per share of $1.61 and reported earnings per share of $1.53. Recall that our underlying earnings per share reflects the performance of our business without the impact of discrete items. Now as a reminder, our fourth quarter guidance of $1.46 to $1.56 included the discrete item of the Japan restructure, which was approximately $0.03 per share.
Walmart U.S. generated a very solid 1.5% comp in the fourth quarter. Although the strong U.S. dollar caused a negative impact of over $5 billion on revenue, Walmart International delivered very good sales growth of nearly 4% on a constant currency basis for the year. And Sam's Club continued to drive membership income again this year with growth of over 10%.
Now on the other hand, as I just mentioned, currency negatively impacted revenue by more than $5 billion. Although not as high as we anticipated, health care expenses were a headwind for Walmart U.S. during the year. And our reported earnings per share were negatively impacted by $0.08 due to the discrete items that Claire mentioned earlier.
Before turning our attention to guidance for the first quarter and for fiscal year 2016, I would like to remind you that our outlook for the future is based on the enterprise strategy we discussed at our October investor conference.
Our clear focus on driving sales through price, assortment, access and experience will continue to guide the investments we make to better serve our customers. Our guidance today assumes several important factors, including the economic conditions in several of our largest markets and currency exchange rates remaining at current levels.
In October, we forecasted a 2% to 4% net sales increase for this new fiscal year. However, as a result of where currency rates are today, we expect a currency headwind of approximately $10 billion on net sales. Our new forecast for fiscal year 2016 net sales growth is between 1% and 2%.
Our capital expenditure guidance of $11.6 billion to $12.9 billion and our total net retail square footage growth of 26 million to 30 million square feet remain unchanged. Also in October, we shared that our capital expenditure range reflects that we will grow through a smaller number of large Supercenters in the U.S. And as previously announced, we are dedicating capital related to our digital and e-commerce businesses of $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion.
In fiscal 2016, we expect our FCPA-related expenses to range between $160 million and $180 million. Recall that these are included in our corporate and support expenses.
Our incremental investment in our Global eCommerce business in fiscal 2015 was approximately $0.08 per share, above the $0.05 to $0.07 per share we shared with you in November. We plan to step up our incremental investment again in fiscal 2016 for our e-commerce activities around the world.
This investment is expected to range between $0.06 and $0.09 per share over fiscal 2015. As I indicated at the October investor conference, the heaviest investment in e-commerce will come over the next 18 to 24 months as we further integrate the shopping experience, appealing to our customers' desire for convenience, access and assortment. We then expect to see operating losses start to moderate at the end of that period. We continue to seek the right balance between sales growth and profitability for e-commerce.
Doug shared the news about our people initiatives within our U.S. businesses, including a wage restructuring and training opportunities to help associates earn higher pay and advance their careers. These strategic investments, which will cost approximately $1 billion this year, are designed to ultimately benefit our customers and our businesses through a better store and club experience.
However, they will impact our earnings per share this fiscal year. In the first quarter, we expect these investments to negatively impact earnings per share by approximately $0.02. The full year earnings per share impact is expected to be approximately $0.20.
In addition to the impact from these 2 significant investments, operating income, like sales, will also be pressured by currency exchange rates of around $0.10 per share. Our earnings per share guidance is based on a fiscal 2016 estimated tax rate ranging between 32% and 34%.
Our tax rate will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter and may be impacted by a number of factors, including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, valuation allowances, changes in law, outcomes of administrative audits, the impacts of discrete items and the mix of earnings among our U.S. and international operations. In any given quarter, our effective tax rate could be higher or lower than the full year range. As we have seen in the past, we expect our first quarter tax rate for fiscal 2016 to be the highest of the 4 quarters.
Taking all of this into account, we expect first quarter fiscal year 2016 earnings per share to range between $0.95 and $1.10. This compares to $1.10 last year. We expect full year earnings per share to range between $4.70 and $5.05. This compares to reported earnings per share of $4.99 in fiscal 2015, which included the discrete items we've discussed.
Now before we wrap up today's call, I would like to address a few additional items. After growth organically or by acquisition, our remaining cash flows provide shareholder returns in the form of dividends and share repurchases.
Today, we announced an increase in our dividend from $1.92 to $1.96 per share for fiscal 2016 to be paid out quarterly. We've now increased our dividend each year for 42 years. We will continue to be opportunistic with share repurchase.
Market conditions, general business trends, operating results and a goal of maintaining our AA credit rating, among other factors, influence our share repurchase activity. Working capital management remains a very high priority for us, and although we have made some improvements in fiscal 2015, we acknowledge we have more work to do. Our leadership teams are very committed to further improvement in fiscal year 2016.
Throughout Walmart, we remain focused on being disciplined in delivering for our associates, our customers and our shareholders. Thank you for listening today and for your continued interest in our company."

Walmart generated nearly $115 billion in revenue and delivered earnings per share within our guidance range at $1.03. I'll cover the results for the quarter in just a minute, but I'd like to start with an update on some of our largest strategic choices and the progress we've made to bring them to life. Our objective is to make changes to improve our short-to-midterm performance while, at the same time, position the company for the long-term. By position, I'm referring to how we set ourselves up to serve customers for years to come and the strategic choice we're making are in 2 critical areas: people and technology. 
In April, we launched a comprehensive set of store and club initiatives that I discussed in last quarter's call. These are intended to improve our short-to-midterm performance in the United States. As you'll remember, we're investing in our starting wage rates and improved store structure, including adding department managers and wage increases for most positions within our stores and clubs in the U.S. We have pilots underway that will improve our scheduling process and improve our training. These set of initiatives is designed to improve the customer experience and translate into higher comp store sales over time. The rollout of these changes happens throughout this year. We know that we won't see it overnight, but we're confident these are the right things to do for our business and our team. 
I recently visited stores and clubs in the Detroit and Seattle markets and I'm encouraged with our associates level of ownership in the business and understanding of the plan. As we improve the experience in our stores, we continue to invest to deliver a stronger mobile and e-commerce experience. In the U.S., we're rolling out a more simplified checkout process on walmart.com, which is based on our global technology platform, JI. An important part of this platform is that it delivers a better experience on mobile devices. Mobile is increasingly the driver of our e-commerce business. 
A few weeks ago, I visited stores and clubs in Beijing and Shanghai. I really enjoyed listening to our and customer focus group and following one of our associates around as we delivered orders to apartments in Shanghai. There are new, exciting developments happening in retail and I'm encouraged that we're in the thick of it. But I was also reminded that the same basic tenets of our business, like value for money, a great assortment and customer service, our what they're after. Those customers we delivered to in Shanghai were quick to praise our associates in the service during deliveries. They like our prices but asked for items that we don't yet carry. I was pleased to hear from them that we didn't need to open the cases of merchandise because they trusted our delivery associate. That's a big deal. 
The week before being in China, I walked stores in Mexico and saw our growing business in grocery home shopping there too. The associates I visited within Mexico were sensing a momentum in their business and it was good to see them leaning forward. So we'll make these investments in our people. We'll give them the opportunity to move up so that they're engaged in our business and happy to serve customers. At the same time, we'll continue making progress with digital, mobile and e-commerce. And we'll bring it all together in a seamless way that delivers value for customers. We're moving on a lot of fronts and picking up some speed. Around the world, our associates are focused on running great stores, empowering their teams, developing technological solutions to solve customer problems and integrating it all together. 
Now let's get into our first quarter results in more detail. Walmart U.S. again delivered positive comp sales and I'm encouraged by the customer traffic trends. I'm particularly pleased by the customer response to our Neighborhood Markets, driving strong comps again this quarter. Based on recent surveys, we know that many of our U.S. customers are using their tax refunds and the extra money from lower gas prices to pay down debt or put it into savings. They're also using these funds for everyday expenses like utilities and groceries. That's where we can be their destination of choice. We're not where we want to be in every store, but I'm pleased with the progress that I'm seeing. 
Walmart International produced solid constant-currency sales growth this quarter. Mexico and Canada had really good sales results. In Mexico, the Sam's Club business is where we've seen our most dramatic improvement due to improved merchandise and stronger in-club operations. And one of the more encouraging signs for me is that this execution is happening over multiple store formats in Mexico, including Bodega. 
In China, we're doing a better job of managing inventory and building customer's trust with the quality of our fresh offering. Sam's Club had lower comp sales and profit than expected. Membership income was up more than 7%, indicating the emphasis on winning over more members to plus status is progressing. Sam's recently launched new services that have promise for improved member acquisition and retention and investments in Club Pickup and e-commerce are starting to pay off. However, we need more consistent progress. And I'm confident that the strategic plan the Sam's Club team is working on will lead to longer-term improvements in our club business. 
We're investing to win the future of retail. And I'm excited about the possibilities that are improved e-commerce capabilities will provide. As I mentioned earlier, we're making progress on rolling out our global technology platform to make e-commerce and mobile shopping easier for customers. Walmarts worldwide e-commerce sales grew approximately 17% in the first quarter, as this grocery home shopping continues to drive double-digit growth and we're sharing this expertise around the world to test delivery and pickup services in more locations. 
To meet our growth projections, we recently announced a new fulfillment center in Brazil, which will be our second 1 there dedicated solely to e-commerce. We will open 2 new mechanized fulfillment centers this quarter in the U.S. and 2 others will follow later this year. 
At Walmart, we operate our business in a way that adds value to communities. We recently published our Annual Global Responsibility Report, I'd love for you to take a look at our ongoing initiatives to create economic opportunity for our associates and others in the retail industry, to enhance the sustainability of our operations and product supply chain and to strengthen communities in places where we operate. It's real and meaningful work and something we're really proud of. 
On Friday, June 5, we'll hold our Annual Shareholders Meeting. It's always a great opportunity to hear from our shareholders and interact with so many of our more than 5,000 associates who come from our markets around the world. I always leave this meeting energized after spending time with our associates. 
Looking ahead, I'm encouraged by the progress we're making and the plans in place for the future. Our priority is to drive growth across the enterprise. Globally, we're working to exceed customer expectations by helping them save time and money and have a great experience as they interact with us in store, online or on their phone. We made progress, but we still have a lot of work to do. We are pushing to change faster as we continued down the right path to deliver long-term value to both customers and shareholders. Now I'll turn it over to Claire. Claire?"
313055,280452550,819162,"Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Q1 2016 Pre Recorded Earnings Call, May 19, 2015",2015-05-19,"Earnings Calls","Walmart Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Doug. Today, I'll highlight some items in the company's consolidated financial statements. Further details are available in the accompanying presentation posted today with this transcript. For the first quarter of fiscal '16, diluted earnings per",602,"Thanks, Doug. Today, I'll highlight some items in the company's consolidated financial statements. Further details are available in the accompanying presentation posted today with this transcript. For the first quarter of fiscal '16, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Walmarts EPS were $1.03. This compares to last year's EPS of $1.10, which was negatively impacted by approximately $0.03 from severe weather. Currency exchange rate fluctuations had a greater-than-anticipated impact on this year's first quarter results. Fluctuations and currency negatively impacted net sales by approximately $3.3 billion and similarly impacted EPS by $0.03. As a reminder, our incremental investment in e-commerce was approximately $0.02 per share and the investment in the U.S. associates impacted EPS by approximately $0.02. These investments were also the primary contributor to the 2.8% increase in consolidated operating expenses. 
Additionally, FCPA and compliance-related costs were approximately $33 million, comprised of $25 million for the ongoing inquiries and investigations and $8 million for our global compliance program and organizational enhancements. Last year, FCPA and compliance-related costs were $53 million in the first quarter. 
The company's consolidated operating income decreased 8.3%. Excluding the impact from currency, operating income decreased 6.1%. The company's continued investments in e-commerce, as well as wages and training for our U.S. associates, were headwinds on our operating income during the quarter. 
As you will see on Slide 2, net interest expense increased 45.1%, primarily due to the cumulative impact of an immaterial accounting correction that I will explain in a moment. Without this cumulative adjustment, interest expense would have been flat. We consolidate a number of entities into our financial statement for which there are a minority or noncontrolling interest. In one of these entities in Canada, we determined that certain historical sales of properties did not qualify for sale accounting due to the company's continuing involvement in the sold properties. As a result, under U.S. GAAP, these properties should have remained in our financial statement as assets, with the corresponding financial obligation recorded equal to the property sales proceeds. The assets and financial obligations are amortized over time. During the first quarter, we recorded the correction to our balance sheet to increase assets by $1.1 billion and liabilities by $1.4 billion. With respect to the income statement, the correction included $254 million of cumulative interest expense, offset by related tax benefit of $53 million and $173 million attributable to noncontrolling interest. The correction had a de minimis impact on our operating income and on earnings per share as EPS is based on income attributable to Walmart. 
From the balance sheet perspective, consolidated inventory increased 2.2%. Later in today's call, you'll hear more about inventory from our segment leaders. Payables as a percentage of inventory were 80.4%, which compares to 80.2% last year. 
Return on investment for the trailing 12 months ended April 30, 2015, was 16.6%, which compares to 16.7% last year. The slight change in ROI was primarily due to continued investments in store growth and e-commerce initiatives, offset by currency exchange rate fluctuations. 
The decrease in free cash flow was due to lower income from continuing operations and the impact of timing of payments for inventory, as well as timing of income tax payments. The last item I'll leave you with today is share repurchases. The company repurchased approximately 3.5 million shares for $280 million during the quarter. Market conditions, general business trends and a focus on maintaining our AA credit rating, among other factors, influenced our share repurchase activity. We have approximately $10 billion remaining on our existing share repurchase authorization. Now I'll turn the call over to Greg. Greg?"

Back on April 1 in New York, we provided an update on the Walmart U.S. business. We discussed what was working well and what needed improvement in order to meet both the expectations of customers and the goals of the company. We laid out a multiyear plan that includes several large and specific projects, all of which fit within our broader strategic focus on assortment, price, access and customer experience. 
As we discussed, we're not only interested in reaching our goals, but reaching them in a way which is sustainable for the long term. This requires a steady execution, a pace that is fast but calculated, and one that allows us to get it right. 
This quarter, we began executing this plan. We took the initial steps in April towards a stronger investment in our associates by raising the minimum starting wage for all hourly associates to $9 per hour. As part of our $1 billion investment in our associates, we also raised the floor and ceiling on pay bands in our stores, creating raises for many 
full and part-time hourly associates at every level. 
More than 500,000 associates benefited from this change. We're also restructuring the management teams in the stores, adding back almost 8,000 department managers. These department managers will have responsibility for a smaller area of the store, ensuring that they have the knowledge and the time to engage with both the customers and store associates, driving an overall better experience. 
The $1 billion investment in our associates this year includes training programs as well. 
Also included in our wage investments, we've continued our Checkout Promise initiative we began over the holidays, ensuring more registers are open during peak times to drive a fast and friendly experience as customers are completing their shopping trips. Finally, we continued to make steady progress against the other initiatives we have discussed, including our urgent agenda items, assortment discipline, pricing, and in-stock goals. These actions require a significant investment, which is included in our financial plan for the year. It's an investment we believe is imperative to providing customers with the unparalleled shopping experience they expect and deserve, and our associates with more opportunities to build a successful career at Walmart. 
With these tips in mind, let's move on to our first quarter results. Net sales grew $2.4 billion or 3.5% versus last year. For the 13-week period ended May 1, comparable stores were up 1.1%, which was within our guidance. Comp sales were driven by solid growth in traffic, which was up 1%. Customers continue to see the benefit of lower gas prices versus last year and are responding favorably to some of our new assortments for the spring and summer selling seasons. 
All formats had positive comps for the quarter, including our traditional format, Neighborhood Markets, which posted approximately a 7.9% comp. A focus on customer service and in-stock position drove strong traffic in this format. Customers continue to see the benefit of Neighborhood Markets to meet their everyday needs, including convenient access to services such as drive-through pharmacies and fuel stations. 
Merchandise comp performance was similar to last quarter. Customers responded to the new spring and summer assortments in apparel and continued growth in active wear and strong brands across the category helped to meet customers assortment needs and to our home categories, with key items and investments and opening price points, drove momentum. 
We also saw customers transition outside, driving sales in outdoor, lawn and garden, and toys. Last, health and wellness posted strong comp sales with momentum in both OTC and optical driven by recent product launches, as well as continued growth in pharmacy scripts. Within general merchandise, we continue to feel pressure in media and electronics, resulting from industry contraction, the shift from physical to digital media and lapping last year's release of the movie, Frozen. Additionally, in-stock positions in categories such as TVs suffered as a result of the port congestion on the West Coast. That said, we now believe the majority of this disruption is behind us. 
Moving to grocery. We were pleased by the operational improvement we saw in fresh. As we mentioned in April, this is a key area of focus and getting fresh right is critical to the customer experience. We're taking the right steps towards reducing the time to bring fresh product to our customers and training associates to ensure the best offering is on the shelf. We still have a lot more to do in this area. But we're steadily improving. 
One key headwind we faced in grocery during the first quarter was moderating inflation in meat and deflation in both dairy and produce. While partially offset by inflationary trends in dry and frozen foods, we estimate the moderation on fresh foods impacted our overall comp performance by almost 70 basis points this quarter. Overall, net food inflation negatively impacted our comp by approximately 20 basis points. 
Finally, e-commerce, driven by strong traffic and price leadership, saw double-digit comp growth across many departments. E-commerce plays a key role in our focus on access for the customer, which is fundamentally around convenience. We're launching the final phase of our new platform related to cart and online checkout capabilities. Our customers are using their mobile devices to access our site on the go. Mobile traffic was up over 100% for the quarter, and we saw higher conversion rates as well. We continue to learn from our grocery home shopping tests where we recently added another location to the Huntsville, Alabama market. And we're working towards a better customer experience in our Walmart pick a program, formerly called Site to Store. The program includes improved e-mail communication, a new signage package that makes it easier for customers to understand the program, and a focus on a faster pick-up experience in the stores. It will roll out to all stores by October 1. 
For the quarter, e-commerce sales contributed approximately 20 basis points to our overall comp performance. 
Moving on to the remainder of our financial results. In the first quarter, gross profit rate declined 13 basis points, driven primarily by a headwind from shrink, half of which was in food. We are addressing this increase immediately, bringing a high level of focus and visibility to this concern by adding it as a key urgent agenda item this year. In addition to shrink, the ongoing mix shift in pharmacy, incremental expenses related to the West Coast port congestion, and cost inflation in consumables contributed to the decline. Somewhat offsetting this was a continued focus on the urgent agenda items laid out last year, including managing throwaways in fresh and reducing inventory that is no longer active in the stores. 
As expected, operating expenses increased 6.6% versus last year. This was driven by changes in estimates associated with our incentive accrual versus last year and the investments we're making in our associates, including the increase in minimum starting pay rates, the restructure of store management roles and the continuation of our Checkout Promise initiative. 
Finally, ongoing investments in e-commerce and technology were a headwind for the quarter. Given these investments, along with the reduction in gross profit rate, operating income declined 6.8%, or $336 million for the quarter. Inventory grew 5.4% in the first quarter. Almost half of this growth was related to the significant number of new stores added in the past several months. The remainder of the growth was related to congestion clearing in the West Coast ports and some conscious replenishment decisions we made to drive improvements in our in-stock position. We continue to make strides against our goals of strong working capital management. We grew inventory in comp stores below the rate of sales and our in-stock position continue to improve throughout the quarter. 
This quarter, we opened 20 Supercenters, including relocations and expansions. Additionally, we opened 15 traditional format Neighborhood Markets and 9 smaller format locations, including 1 campus store location. We spent a lot of time over the past several months truly understanding what it will take to succeed over time in a rapidly changing retail environment. This quarter, we made some improvements, taking the right steps at a steady pace, ensuring we stay on track towards the long-term goals of the business. We continue to monitor our fast, friendly, clean performance in the stores and based on customer feedback, we are making good progress. I'm out walking our stores every week, visiting our associates and talking to our customers in markets across the country. Additionally, Judith McKenna, our Chief Operating Officer, has visited with over 750 store managers in recent weeks, gathering their thoughts on how we can improve. 
We are pleased that our customer service scores have steadily increased this quarter, with all geographic areas and formats showing positive results. We know, though, that we're not where we want to be yet. It will take time to achieve our goals. But we're fully committed to providing our customers with the shopping experience they can love and associates who see their efforts leading to broader and better careers. 
For the second quarter, we expect traffic to remain strong, supported by sustained low gas prices and our efforts to improve customer service in our stores. This will be offset, in part, by a continued decline in food inflation rates. For the 13-week period ending July 31, we anticipate a comp sales increase of around 1%. Last year, our comp sales for the period were flat. Now I'll turn it over to Dave for an update on the Walmart International. Dave?"

As a reminder, these key priorities include: actively managing the existing portfolio; driving comp sales; accelerating e-commerce; delivering market priorities, particularly in China, Brazil and Mexico; and finally, strengthening key enablers, such as being the lowest cost operator, building world-class talent, and building trust. 
Before we discuss the financials, here are a few highlights from the first quarter. First, I'm particularly pleased with our overall performance in Mexico, which not only had its strongest net quarterly sales growth in over 2 years, but also grew operating income faster than sales. Our results in Mexico were due to better comps in all key formats, including Sam's Club. 
Also, I want to call out our performance in Canada, which had a positive comp for the fourth consecutive quarter. In addition to Canada or Mexico, we achieved comp growth in most of our other markets, as we remain committed to delivering positive comp sales across the board. I'm energized by the execution I've seen from our teams. 
In addition, I'm excited about our efforts in accelerating e-commerce. In the U.K., grocery home shopping continues to report double-digit comps and we're leveraging our U.K. experience in other markets across the globe. Earlier, Doug mentioned some of our change initiatives that we're working on across the enterprise. One of these initiatives is built around this experience in grocery home shopping. We have a newly created international acceleration team based in the U.K. that is building close partnerships with our markets to speed up the adoption of grocery home shopping processes and technologies. We're now working towards a common technology platform to better position us for the expansion of grocery home shopping. 
Now let's take a look at our first quarter results. In the first quarter, net sales grew 3.4% on a constant-currency basis, partially benefiting by the timing of Chinese New Year and Easter. The U.S. dollar has remained at historically high levels, leading to a considerable currency impact of $3.3 billion, which led to a 6.6% sales decline on a reported basis. Comp sales were favorable across 4 of our 5 top markets, with the U.K., driven by continued deflation in food and aggressive competition being the exception. 
We also had negative comps in Japan, lapping last year's benefit of accelerated consumer spending ahead of the April 2014 consumption tax hike. We grew comp sales in our remaining markets. 
As expected, operating income grew slower than sales at 0.1% on a constant-currency basis, impacted by planned strategic investments in our e-commerce businesses and ongoing economic and competitive pressures in certain markets. With the currency exchange impact, operating income decreased 11% on a reported basis. On a constant-currency basis, inventory grew faster than sales at 8.2%, driven by slower sales in the U.K. and inventory buildup leading up to the Easter holiday. 
On a reported basis, inventory declined 5.4%. 
Now let's discuss individual results for our largest markets. Comp sales and changes in various metrics are presented on a constant-currency basis only. In all countries, except Brazil and China, financial results are inclusive of e-commerce. Slides 8 and 9 of the presentation summarize financial details. 
Let's start with the U.K. The market remained highly competitive and promotional. Hard discounters continued to gain share, though at a slowing rate, and all major supermarkets stepped up aggressive investments in price. As a result, grocery deflation persisted at record levels, leading to low market growth. Grocery prices were down 2% versus last year for the 12 weeks ended March 29, according to counter. U.K. sales declined 2.9% and comp sales declined 3.3%, excluding fuel, primarily driven by deflation in fresh. Operating income declined, negatively impacted by lower sales and margin. 
Heading into Q2, the team is focused on improving sales and operating performance through price investments in branded goods, maintaining aggressive price points on key items and continuing to invest in the highest quality fresh offering as this 5-year strategy of investing GBP 1 billion in lowering prices remains on track this year, our second year of the program. 
In Canada, we maintain solid growth amid a dynamic, competitive environment. Sales were up 3.7% and comps were up 1.8%, driven by solid Easter sales, strong performance in seasonal and improving strength in our overall food business, including fresh. We continue to enhance our value and price offering, especially with private brands, where we saw significant growth. Market share increased in food, health and wellness, consumables and infant categories for the 12 weeks ended April 18, according to Nielsen. 
Operating income grew faster than sales for the quarter. We remain focused on our low-cost operating model and continue to seek out opportunities to drive efficiencies to reduce expenses. I'm pleased with performance overall and expect the positive trend to continue, as the competitive landscape evolves. 
On May 8, we announced acquisition of 13 stores, 12 leased and 1 owned, and 1 distribution center from a former competitor. While these transactions are subject to bankruptcy court approval, we look forward to bringing additional Supercenters to more provinces in Canada. These stores are in addition to the 29 Supercenters we announced as part of our current fiscal year expansion program. 
Next, let's turn to Mexico, which released their earnings on April 21. Please note that the Walmex release is under IFRS and the results here are under U.S. GAAP. Therefore, some numbers may differ. Consolidated Walmex net sales increased 7.3%, with strong comp sales in both Mexico and Central America. Operating income growth was also favorable, up 10.4% year-over-year. Mexico net sales grew 7.1% and comp sales increased 4.9%. Self-service gained 80 basis points of market share during the quarter according  to ANTAD. Performance was strong in food and consumables, the largest contributor to the comp sales momentum. Sam's Club comp sales grew 6.8% in the quarter, benefited by improved merchandise assortment and initiatives to grow the membership base. I'm excited about the momentum and outlook, as the team to continues to launch initiatives and price investments that will resonate with the customer. 
In addition to top-line performance, Mexico did a good job managing expenses, delivering over 30 basis points of leverage compared to last year, driven by lower utility, supplies and advertising expenses. Now onto Brazil. Market conditions worsened this quarter due to continued inflationary cost pressures. In addition, the retail grocery sector had its worst first quarter growth in the last 6 years at 2.2% according to Serasa Experian, global information services company. Despite the continuing economic slowdown, I was pleased to see another quarter of steady growth in Brazil. Both net sales and comp sales were up 3%. Sam's Club and Maxxi formats outpaced retail market growth, with double-digit comp sales increases. Brazil continues to invest in price, particularly in general merchandise, in an effort to improve sales trends in retail formats. 
Brazil did not leverage expenses for the quarter, largely due to the inflationary pressures that I've just mentioned. Management remains focused on turnaround initiatives to deliver profitability in the back half of the year. 
Moving on to China. Walmart China's Q1 net sales grew 1.9% and comp sales grew 0.4% as sales for Chinese New Year improved year-over-year. Recall that Chinese New Year was January 31 last year and February 19 this year, so some sales shifted from Q4 into Q1 this year. According to China UnionPay data, our gift card loading outperformed the market in the high-volume months of January and February. Nielsen also showed that Walmart increased market share in fast-moving consumer goods in the hypermarket channel and maintained share in the modern trade channel, which includes smaller format stores, for the 12 weeks ended March 29. 
While there are ongoing market headwinds from government austerity and slightly slower economic growth, we're confident we'll continue to deliver growth in China. Part of this growth will come from the planned opening of 33 stores and clubs this year, with expansion focused in the southern regions where we have a strong market presence. 
Additionally, we aim to provide better services and widen our customer reach through greater expansion of our omni-channel platforms, including online and mobile. We're focused on driving efficiency, cost reductions and strengthening our portfolio in China. Operating income grew 23.5%, up due to expense leverage and gross margin improvement from higher sell-through with Chinese New Year. We leveraged expenses this quarter in our core business through We Operate For Less and We Buy For Less initiatives and we'll continue to pass the savings onto customers. 
Finally, let's discuss e-commerce performance. Accelerating e-commerce is one of our strategic objectives this year, and we're making significant strides in providing convenient access for shoppers as we continue to invest globally in eCommerce capabilities. In Mexico, we're launching an improved Sam's Club website in the second quarter, and an app in the third quarter. In China, we'll launch the new app later this quarter for our stores that will enable customers to shop from their local Walmart store and choose to pick up their order in store or have it delivered at home. And in Canada, our e-commerce business continues to perform strongly, with the comp of greater than 40%. 
Yihaodian, our e-commerce business in China, benefited from the Spring Festival promotion to support Chinese New Year, with strong sales of imported items in milk products, shampoo and other categories. Orders drove most of our growth and our conversion rate improved nearly 100 basis points compared to the same quarter last year. Mobile contributed more than 40% of orders. 
Brazil e-commerce had another strong performance this quarter, with comps up double digits and outpaced the Brazilian total e-commerce market growth rate. Phones, auto and tires, and baby categories helped drive this growth. Above average summer temperatures drove strong sales in fans and air-conditioners. On Consumer Day, an actual event in March that's similar to the Black Friday event in the U.S., we also delivered strong sales growth. 
In addition to our solid financial performance, I'm pleased with the progress we've made in strengthening our key enablers of being lowest-cost operator, building world-class talent and building trust. One way we deliver on being the lowest-cost operator is by reducing our total energy required to power our buildings. 
For example, in the U.K., we're migrating to a new energy monitoring system that provides daily energy alliance, analytic capabilities and reporting. In addition, we remain committed to programs that develop talent. We began providing retail training to women in emerging markets last year and have now trained the men in several countries, including Argentina, Chile, Mexico, South Africa, and India and our focus on scaling projects throughout this year. By the end of next year, we plan to have trained 200,000 women for their first jobs in retail in our emerging markets. 
As we look forward to the rest of the year for the international business, we anticipate some headwinds. Particularly in Latin America, we're in the second quarter, we lap last year's World Cup. We also expect similar trends in the U.K. to continue, given market conditions and anticipate ongoing currency pressure with the strength of the U.S. dollar. 
At the same time though, we have strong momentum in markets like Mexico and Canada and expect to see solid growth continue in these markets. The global landscape remains challenging and the retail industry is highly competitive. However, I believe we're headed in the right direction and are making progress towards our strategic objectives, which is setting us up for long-term growth and success. Now I'll turn over to Roz for the update on Sam's. Roz?"

Our first quarter results were disappointing, as comp sales missed guidance, and we delivered software net sales and profit last year. We continue to invest in our initiatives to drive growth and while we made progress in some areas, we still have upside opportunity in others. This year is one of investment in testing, and we're very focused on strengthening our foundation for business improvement in the longer term. We've been focused on 4 initiatives designed to improve our foundation. 
The first initiative is improving our merchandise assortment, where we are driving newness and differentiation. For example, we increased our organic offering by 20% since the beginning of the year, and these are important to various demographic groups, including millennials. 
Our second initiative is focused on membership and decision sciences. We created a new Chief Member Officer, reporting to me, that will own membership data and analytics. This role, which was put in place at the beginning of the quarter, oversees a new team of data scientists, marketing and insights professionals. I'm pleased that the team's recent new targeted membership efforts give us optimism for the rest of the year. 
Our third initiative is launching new programs to enhance member value. One example is a groundbreaking new pharmacy program called  Free/4/10, which provides Plus Members with free or discounted prescriptions for 5 costly diseases, including Alzheimer's, diabetes, mental health, vitamin D deficiency and prostate health. This program contributed to a number of plus upgrades since its rollout. 
Our fourth initiative is a significant long-term investment in our e-commerce business. We relaunched Club Pickup in every club in the country, resulting in a 37% sales increase in the Club Pickup program. Members love the convenience benefits of online ordering and easy pick up at the club. I'm encouraged that our investments will pay off in the near future. 
Now onto the numbers. With fuel, operating income declined 10.9% to $427 million. The fuel business has experienced significant pricing volatility within the quarter and as a result, our fuel business lost $9 million this quarter. For additional results with fuel, please reference the accompanying presentation. 
In Q1, net sales, without fuel, grew 1.2% to $12.4 billion. Comp sales were 0.4%, driven by ticket increases of 60 basis points and by a traffic decline of 20 basis points. Savings member traffic was positive, offset by a decline in Business member traffic. E-commerce contributed 40 basis points to the comp for the 13-week period. 
Our gross profit rate declined 15 basis points compared to last year, attributable to our investment in Plus Cash Rewards. We will continue to invest in Cash Rewards as Plus penetration grows. Operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, increased 33 basis points, due to investments in new clubs, e-commerce and technology. Membership and other income grew 4.9%, with membership income up 7.4%. Operating income declined 8.6% to $436 million. 
Our merchant team continue to work on bringing newness and trend right merchandise into the clubs. We still have opportunities for improvement and we continue to invest in price to drive value for our members. Comp sales and fresh/freezer/cooler were up in the low single digits. Meat and deli categories performed well. But our overall food comps, including dairy and produce were impacted by deflation in these fresh categories. We grew comp sales and dry groceries. This is an area in which we will continue to invest to improve both assortment and member value. 
Consumables were led by private brand tabletop programs, offset by ongoing supply issues within baby care. Overall, home and apparel comps were up in the low single digits. Women and children's apparel was strong, delivering double-digit comp performance. Patio and seasonal items were down, due to the slow start to spring in key geographies, but mattress and houseware categories grew double digits in comp sales. 
In our technology and entertainment business, comp sales were down. TV sales were challenged due to the West Coast port delays, but did pick up later in the quarter once the delays decreased. Our audio sales were strong due to new headphones and sound bars. This category has been part of our initiative to streamline our offering to provide the latest advancement in the technologies that matter and to improve our offerings online. Our health and wellness category benefited from our pharmacy's introduction of the newly launched Free/4/10 program that I mentioned earlier. This program is being merchandise at our pharmacies and contributed to a number of plus upgrades since its rollout. We are optimistic about its ability to continue to drive membership growth. As we continue to enhance and improve our offerings, we are managing our inventory appropriately. Inventory, without fuel, grew 1.9%, primarily attributable to new clubs. 
Beyond these merchandise areas, membership growth is our number 1 priority and we see opportunities to better serve both the business and the Savings member. 
Turning to membership. We were encouraged by the momentum in April in both acquisition and renewal counts. This will be a constant focus for us. We see consistent growth in our Plus membership, driven by our national rollout of Cash Rewards last year. We have added over 1.6 million new Plus Members since 1 year ago. Members that have upgraded to a Plus membership are highly engaged, both in-clubs and online, and their spending is up over the previous year in the mid-to-high single digit range. In addition, the 531 MasterCard program we launched last year continues to receive industry accolades, but more importantly, receives tremendously positive feedback from our members. 
When I'm out walking in the clubs and talking with members, they consistently tell me how much they enjoy the benefits of our Cash Rewards program and our 531 MasterCard. This is especially true for our small-business members as the rewards really add up. Together, these 2 initiatives continue to meet our expectations in providing membership value. 
For the long term, we continue to see success in some key strategic areas and will build on these. The integration of digital and physical is a key enabler for our growth. E-commerce delivered a double-digit comp this quarter, contributing 40 basis points to the segment comp. Growth in traffic, ticket and conversion was driven by strong double-digit Club Pickup comps. 
We are also leveraging our digital capabilities to drive targeted member growth and renewal. Utilizing our data analytics, we used digital media to reach current and prospective members, but can now align it with system enhancements and better visibility of members shopping behaviors. For example, our recent Groupon offer clearly communicated the value of the Sam's Club membership card and generated more than 220,000 new members in less than 2 weeks. Ultimately, we know we will attract and retain members by creating irresistible value in our membership. While our business member numbers continue to be challenged, we're maintaining our focus on turning that trend around. To help them grow, we've expanded the value we provide to small business members with the addition in the first quarter of 5 new or enhanced services through third parties, identity theft protection, accounting, business lending, payment processing and online marketing. With these new services, we broaden the portfolio of new business services we launched in the fall and we will continue to do so throughout the year. The primary purpose of these services is to help our small business members be successful and create additional membership value from their Sam's Club card. 
Although it's still early, we've had positive feedback on our new services. We are intensely focused on addressing top-line sales and membership. We expect comp sales for the 13-week period ending July 31 to be between flat and up 2%. Now I'll pass it over to Charles. Charles?"
313055,280452550,819162,"Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Q1 2016 Pre Recorded Earnings Call, May 19, 2015",2015-05-19,"Earnings Calls","Walmart Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Roz. I will wrap up today's discussion by providing some thoughts on our performance.

I will wrap up today's discussion by providing some thoughts on our performance. As you heard, currency exchange negatively impacted our sales by $3.3 billion and earnings per share by $0.03, which was more than we anticipated. Even though our Walmart U.S. comp sales were around the bottom of our guidance, we are pleased with our earnings per share coming in at $1.03 in the middle of our range. 
Before I move on to our second quarter guidance, it's important to reiterate that we continue to execute our Enterprise Strategy, which we feel is creating a stronger foundation for the future. It's still early days here but it's important to note, we are managing our capital in a very disciplined way, seeking the right balance between sales growth and profitability as we integrate digital and physical. Based on our views of the global macro economic environment, and assuming currency exchange rates remain at current levels, we expect second quarter fiscal 2016 earnings per share to range between $1.06 and $1.18. 
Our second quarter guidance includes the impact of approximately $0.04 per share from our previously announced investments in both associate wages and training, as well as $0.04 per share from currency. 
Now as a reminder, our full year earnings per share guidance assumes the impact of approximately $0.20 per share from our strategic investments in both associate wages and training, as well as an incremental $0.06 to $0.09 per share in e-commerce investment. In our first quarter, we incurred approximately $0.02 per share from our investment in associate wages and training and an incremental $0.02 per share from our e-commerce investments. 
In addition to the impact from these 2 significant investments, we expect currency to remain a significant headwind for the year. Assuming exchange rates remain where they are today, the impact on full year net sales would be approximately $14 billion. Now this compares to our guidance in February of approximately $10 billion. Again, assuming exchange rates remain where they are today, the impact on our earnings per share this year would be approximately $0.13 per share, compared to our prior guidance of $0.10 per share. 
We continue to expect our effective tax rate to range between 32% and 34% for this fiscal year. Our tax rate will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter and may be impacted by a number of factors, including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, valuation allowances, changes in law, outcomes of administrative audits, the impact of discrete items and the mix of earnings among our U.S. and international operations. And in any given quarter, our effective tax rate could be higher or lower than the full year range. In February, we indicated that we expected our first quarter effective tax rate to be the highest of all 4 quarters this year. However, given the fluctuations that I just mentioned, we were below that initial forecast. 
Before we wrap up today's call, I would like to address a few additional items. You're familiar with how we prioritize our capital and the first is organic growth. In this fiscal year, we added approximately 4.1 million additional square feet of retail space around the world. Additionally, when there are opportunities that can increase our ability to serve customers and add shareholder value, we will invest beyond our capital plan that we shared in October. Our recent announcement in Canada regarding the acquisition and renovation of specific real estate locations from a competitor for approximately $290 million is a great example of such an opportunity. 
Our remaining cash flows provide shareholder returns in the form of dividends and share repurchases. It's important to remind you that we remain committed to returning value to our shareholders and we will continue to be opportunistic with share repurchases throughout the year. Before I close, I would like to reiterate that working capital and management remains a very high priority for us. We acknowledge there's more work to grow across our business but our leadership teams are committed to further improvement throughout this year. With that, thank you for your support of our company. We hope to see all of you as shareholders this year."

Walmart generated nearly $115 billion in revenue and delivered earnings per share within our guidance range at $1.03. I'll cover the results for the quarter in just a minute, but I'd like to start with an update on some of our larger strategic choices and the progress we've made to bring them to life.
Our objective is to make changes to improve our short to midterm performance while, at the same time, position the company for the long term. By position, I'm referring to how we set ourselves up to serve customers for years to come and the strategic choices we're making are in 2 critical areas: people and technology. 
In April, we launched a comprehensive set of store and club initiatives that I discussed in last quarter's call. These are intended to improve our short to midterm performance in the United States. As you'll remember, we're investing in our starting wage rates; an improved store structure, including adding department managers; and wage increases for most positions within our stores and clubs in the U.S. We have pilots underway that will improve our scheduling process and improve our training. These set of initiatives is designed to improve the customer experience and translate into higher comp store sales over time. The rollout of these changes happens throughout this year. We know that we won't see it overnight, but we're confident these are the right things to do for our business and our team.
I've recently visited stores and clubs in the Detroit and Seattle markets, and I'm encouraged with our associates' level of ownership in the business and understanding of the plan.
As we improve the experience in our stores, we continue to invest to deliver a stronger mobile and e-commerce experience. In the U.S., we're rolling out a more simplified checkout process on walmart.com, which is based on our global technology platform, Pangaea. An important part of this platform is that it delivers a better experience on mobile devices. Mobile is increasingly the driver of our e-commerce business.
A few weeks ago, I visited stores and clubs in Beijing and Shanghai. I really enjoyed listening to our Yihaodian customer focus group and following one of our associates around as we delivered orders to apartments in Shanghai. There are new, exciting developments happening in retail, and I'm encouraged that we're in the thick of it. But I was also reminded that the same basic tenets of our business, like value for money, a great assortment and customer service, are what they're after. Those customers we delivered to in Shanghai were quick to praise our associate in his service during deliveries. They liked our prices but asked for items that we don't yet carry. I was pleased to hear from them that we didn't need to open the cases of merchandise because they trusted our delivery associate. That's a big deal.
The week before being in China, I walked stores in Mexico and saw a growing business in grocery home shopping there, too. The associates I visited within Mexico were sensing a momentum in their business, and it was good to see them leaning forward. So we'll make these investments in our people. We'll give them the opportunity to move up so that they're engaged in our business and happy to serve customers. At the same time, we'll continue making progress with digital, mobile and e-commerce. And we'll bring it all together in a seamless way that delivers value for customers. We're moving on a lot of fronts and picking up some speed. Around the world, our associates are focused on running great stores, empowering their teams, developing technological solutions to solve customer problems and integrating it all together.
Now let's get into our first quarter results in more detail. Walmart U.S. again delivered positive comp sales, and I'm encouraged by the customer traffic trends. I'm particularly pleased by the customer response to our Neighborhood Markets, driving strong comps again this quarter. Based on recent surveys, we know that many of our U.S. customers are using their tax refunds and the extra money from lower gas prices to pay down debt or put it into savings. They're also using these funds for everyday expenses like utilities and groceries. That's where we can be their destination of choice. We're not where we want to be in every store, but I'm pleased with the progress that I'm seeing.
Walmart International produced solid constant currency sales growth this quarter. Mexico and Canada had really good sales results. In Mexico, the Sam's Club business is where we've seen our most dramatic improvement due to improved merchandise and stronger in-club operations. And one of the more encouraging signs for me is that this execution is happening over multiple store formats in Mexico, including Bodega. 
In China, we're doing a better job of managing inventory and building customers' trust with the quality of our fresh offering.
Sam's Club had lower comp sales and profit than expected. Membership income was up more than 7%, indicating the emphasis on winning over more members to Plus status is progressing. Sam's recently launched new services that have promise for improved member acquisition and retention and investments in Club Pickup and e-commerce are starting to pay off. However, we need more consistent progress, and I'm confident that the strategic plan the Sam's Club team is working on will lead to longer-term improvements in our club business.
We're investing to win the future of retail, and I'm excited about the possibilities that our improved e-commerce capabilities will provide. As I mentioned earlier, we're making progress on rolling out our global technology platform to make e-commerce and mobile shopping easier for customers. Walmart's worldwide e-commerce sales grew approximately 17% in the first quarter, as this grocery home shopping continues to drive double-digit growth and we're sharing this expertise around the world to test delivery and pickup services in more locations.
To meet our growth projections, we recently announced a new fulfillment center in Brazil, which will be our second one there dedicated solely to e-commerce. We will open 2 new mechanized fulfillment centers this quarter in the U.S. and 2 others will follow later this year.
At Walmart, we operate our business in a way that adds value to communities. We recently published our Annual Global Responsibility Report. I'd love for you to take a look at our ongoing initiatives to create economic opportunity for our associates and others in the retail industry, to enhance the sustainability of our operations and product supply chain and to strengthen communities in places where we operate. It's real and meaningful work and something we're really proud of.
On Friday, June 5, we'll hold our Annual Shareholders' Meeting. It's always a great opportunity to hear from our shareholders and interact with so many of our more than 5,000 associates who come from our markets around the world. I always leave this meeting energized after spending time with our associates. 
Looking ahead, I'm encouraged by the progress we're making and the plans in place for the future. Our priority is to drive growth across the enterprise. Globally, we're working to exceed customer expectations by helping them save time and money and have a great experience as they interact with us in store, online or on their phone. We've made progress, but we still have a lot of work to do. We're pushing to change faster as we continue down the right path to deliver long-term value to both customers and shareholders.
Now I'll turn it over to Claire. Claire?"
313055,280452550,819262,"Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Q1 2016 Pre Recorded Earnings Call, May 19, 2015",2015-05-19,"Earnings Calls","Walmart Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Doug. Today, I'll highlight some items in the company's consolidated financial statements. Further details are available in the accompanying presentation posted today with this transcript. For the first quarter of fiscal '16, diluted earnings per",603,"Thanks, Doug. Today, I'll highlight some items in the company's consolidated financial statements. Further details are available in the accompanying presentation posted today with this transcript. For the first quarter of fiscal '16, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Walmart EPS were $1.03. This compares to last year's EPS of $1.10, which was negatively impacted by approximately $0.03 from severe weather. Currency exchange rate fluctuations had a greater-than-anticipated impact on this year's first quarter results. Fluctuations in currency negatively impacted net sales by approximately $3.3 billion and similarly impacted EPS by $0.03. As a reminder, our incremental investment in e-commerce was approximately $0.02 per share and the investment in the U.S. associates impacted EPS by approximately $0.02.
These investments were also the primary contributor to the 2.8% increase in consolidated operating expenses.
Additionally, FCPA and compliance-related costs were approximately $33 million, comprised of $25 million for the ongoing inquiries and investigations and $8 million for our global compliance program and organizational enhancements. Last year, FCPA and compliance-related costs were $53 million in the first quarter. 
The company's consolidated operating income decreased 8.3%. Excluding the impact from currency, operating income decreased 6.1%. The company's continued investments in e-commerce as well as wages and training for our U.S. associates were headwinds on our operating income during the quarter.
As you will see on Slide 2, net interest expense increased 45.1%, primarily due to the cumulative impact of an immaterial accounting correction that I will explain in a moment. Without this cumulative adjustment, interest expense would have been flat. We consolidate a number of entities into our financial statements for which there are a minority or noncontrolling interests. In one of these entities in Canada, we determined that certain historical sales of properties did not qualify for sale accounting due to the company's continuing involvement in the sold properties. As a result, under U.S. GAAP, these properties should have remained in our financial statement as assets, with the corresponding financial obligation recorded equal to the properties' sales proceeds. The assets and financial obligation are amortized over time. During the first quarter, we recorded the correction to our balance sheet to increase assets by $1.1 billion and liabilities by $1.4 billion. With respect to the income statement, the correction included $254 million of cumulative interest expense, offset by a related tax benefit of $53 million and $173 million attributable to noncontrolling interest. The correction had a de minimis impact on our operating income and on earnings per share as EPS is based on income attributable to Walmart.
From the balance sheet perspective, consolidated inventory increased 2.2%. Later in today's call, you'll hear more about inventory from our segment leaders. Payables as a percentage of inventory were 80.4%, which compares to 80.2% last year. 
Return on investment for the trailing 12 months ended April 30, 2015, was 16.6%, which compares to 16.7% last year. The slight change in ROI was primarily due to continued investments in store growth and e-commerce initiatives, offset by currency exchange rate fluctuations.
The decrease in free cash flow was due to lower income from continuing operations and the impact of timing of payments for inventory as well as timing of income tax payments.
The last item I'll leave you with today is share repurchases. The company repurchased approximately 3.5 million shares for $280 million during the quarter. Market conditions, general business trends and a focus on maintaining our AA credit rating, among other factors, influenced our share repurchase activity. We have approximately $10 billion remaining on our existing share repurchase authorization.

Back on April 1 in New York, we provided an update on the Walmart U.S. business. We discussed what was working well and what needed improvement in order to meet both the expectations of customers and the goals of the company. We laid out a multiyear plan that includes several large and specific projects, all of which fit within our broader strategic focus on assortment, price, access and customer experience.
As we discussed, we're not only interested in reaching our goals, but reaching them in a way which is sustainable for the long term. This requires a steady execution, a pace that is fast but calculated and one that allows us to get it right.
This quarter, we began executing this plan. We took the initial steps in April towards a stronger investment in our associates by raising the minimum starting wage for all hourly associates to $9 per hour. As part of our $1 billion investment in our associates, we also raised the floor and ceiling on pay bands in our stores, creating raises for many 
full and part-time hourly associates at every level. 
More than 500,000 associates benefited from this change. We're also restructuring the management teams in the stores, adding back almost 8,000 department managers. These department managers will have responsibility for a smaller area of the store, ensuring that they have the knowledge and the time to engage with both the customers and store associates, driving an overall better experience.
The $1 billion investment in our associates this year includes training programs as well.
Also included in our wage investments, we've continued our Checkout Promise initiative we began over the holidays, ensuring more registers are open during peak times to drive a fast and friendly experience as customers are completing their shopping trips. Finally, we continued to make steady progress against the other initiatives we have discussed, including our urgent agenda items, assortment discipline, pricing and in-stock goals. These actions require a significant investment, which is included in our financial plan for the year. It's an investment we believe is imperative to providing customers with the unparalleled shopping experience they expect and deserve and our associates with more opportunities to build a successful career at Walmart.
With these steps in mind, let's move on to our first quarter results. Net sales grew $2.4 billion or 3.5% versus last year. For the 13-week period ended May 1, comparable stores were up 1.1%, which was within our guidance. Comp sales were driven by solid growth in traffic, which was up 1%. Customers continue to see the benefit of lower gas prices versus last year and are responding favorably to some of our new assortments for the spring and summer selling seasons.
All formats had positive comps for the quarter, including our traditional format, Neighborhood Markets, which posted approximately a 7.9% comp. A focus on customer service and in-stock position drove strong traffic in this format. Customers continue to see the benefit of Neighborhood Markets to meet their everyday needs, including convenient access to services such as drive-thru pharmacies and fuel stations. 
Merchandise comp performance was similar to last quarter. Customers responded to the new spring and summer assortments in apparel and continued growth in active wear and strong brands across the category helped meet customers' assortment needs. Indoor home categories with key items and investments in opening price points drove momentum.
We also saw customers transition outside, driving sales in outdoor, lawn and garden and toys. Last, health and wellness posted strong comp sales with momentum in both OTC and optical, driven by recent product launches as well as continued growth in pharmacy scripts.
Within general merchandise, we continued to feel pressure in media and electronics, resulting from industry contraction, the shift from physical to digital media and lapping last year's release of the movie Frozen. Additionally, in-stock positions in categories such as TVs suffered as a result of the port congestion on the West Coast. That said, we now believe the majority of this disruption is behind us.
Moving to grocery. We were pleased by the operational improvement we saw in fresh. As we mentioned in April, this is a key area of focus, and getting fresh right is critical to the customer experience. We're taking the right steps towards reducing the time to bring fresh product to our customers and training associates to ensure the best offering is on the shelf. We still have a lot more to do in this area but we're steadily improving. 
One key headwind we faced in grocery during the first quarter was moderating inflation in meat and deflation in both dairy and produce. While partially offset by inflationary trends in dry and frozen foods, we estimate the moderation in fresh foods impacted our overall comp performance by almost 70 basis points this quarter. Overall, net food inflation negatively impacted our comp by approximately 20 basis points.
Finally, e-commerce, driven by strong traffic and price leadership, saw double-digit comp growth across many departments. E-commerce plays a key role in our focus on access for the customer, which is fundamentally around convenience. We're launching the final phase of our new platform related to cart and online checkout capabilities. Our customers are using their mobile devices to access our site on the go. Mobile traffic was up over 100% for the quarter, and we saw higher conversion rates as well. We continue to learn from our grocery home shopping tests, where we recently added another location to the Huntsville, Alabama market. And we're working towards a better customer experience in our Walmart Pickup program, formerly called Site to Store. The program includes improved email communication, a new signage package that makes it easier for customers to understand the program and a focus on a faster pickup experience in the stores. It will roll out to all stores by October 1.
For the quarter, e-commerce sales contributed approximately 20 basis points to our overall comp performance.
Moving on to the remainder of our financial results. In the first quarter, gross profit rate declined 13 basis points, driven primarily by a headwind from shrink, half of which was in food. We are addressing this increase immediately, bringing a high level of focus and visibility to this concern by adding it as a key urgent agenda item this year. In addition to shrink, the ongoing mix shift in pharmacy, incremental expenses related to the West Coast port congestion and cost inflation in consumables contributed to the decline. Somewhat offsetting this was a continued focus on the urgent agenda items laid out last year, including managing throwaways in fresh and reducing inventory that is no longer active in the stores.
As expected, operating expenses increased 6.6% versus last year. This was driven by changes in estimates associated with our incentive accrual versus last year and the investments we're making in our associates, including the increase in minimum starting pay rates, the restructure of store management roles and the continuation of our Checkout Promise initiative.
Finally, ongoing investments in e-commerce and technology were a headwind for the quarter. Given these investments, along with the reduction in gross profit rate, operating income declined 6.8% or $336 million for the quarter. Inventory grew 5.4% in the first quarter. Almost half of this growth was related to the significant number of new stores added in the past several months. The remainder of the growth was related to congestion clearing in the West Coast ports and some conscious replenishment decisions we made to drive improvements in our in-stock position. We continue to make strides against our goal of strong working capital management. We grew inventory in comp stores below the rate of sales, and our in-stock position continue to improve throughout the quarter.
This quarter, we opened 20 supercenters, including relocations and expansions. Additionally, we opened 15 traditional format Neighborhood Markets and 9 smaller format locations, including 1 campus store location.
We've spent a lot of time over the past several months truly understanding what it will take to succeed over time in a rapidly changing retail environment. This quarter, we made some improvements, taking the right steps at a steady pace, ensuring we stay on track towards the long-term goals of the business. We continue to monitor our fast, friendly and clean performance in the stores. And based on customer feedback, we are making good progress. I'm out walking our stores every week, visiting our associates and talking to our customers in markets across the country. Additionally, Judith McKenna, our Chief Operating Officer, has visited with over 750 store managers in recent weeks, gathering their thoughts on how we can improve.
We are pleased that our customer service scores have steadily increased this quarter, with all geographic areas and formats showing positive results. We know, though, that we're not where we want to be yet. It will take time to achieve our goals. But we're fully committed to providing our customers with the shopping experience they can love and associates who see their efforts leading to broader and better careers.
For the second quarter, we expect traffic to remain strong, supported by sustained low gas prices and our efforts to improve customer service in our stores. This will be offset, in part, by a continued decline in food inflation rates. For the 13-week period ending July 31, we anticipate a comp sales increase of around 1%. Last year, our comp sales for the period were flat.
Now I'll turn it over to Dave for an update on the Walmart International. Dave?"

Over the past few months, I've had the opportunity to visit the majority of our markets, and I continue to be pleased with the progress I see. Overall, we've had a solid start to the fiscal year financially and continue to make progress on our key strategic priorities. As a reminder, these key priorities include: actively managing the existing portfolio; driving comp sales; accelerating e-commerce; delivering market priorities, particularly in China, Brazil and Mexico; and finally, strengthening key enablers, such as being the lowest-cost operator, building world-class talent, and building trust. 
Before we discuss the financials, here are a few highlights from the first quarter. First, I'm particularly pleased with our overall performance in Mexico, which not only had its strongest net quarterly sales growth in over 2 years, but also grew operating income faster than sales. Our results in Mexico were due to better comps in all key formats, including Sam's Club.
Also, I want to call out our performance in Canada, which had a positive comp for the fourth consecutive quarter. In addition to Canada and Mexico, we achieved comp growth in most of our other markets, as we remain committed to delivering positive comp sales across the board. I'm energized by the execution I've seen from our teams.
In addition, I'm excited about our efforts in accelerating e-commerce. In the U.K., grocery home shopping continues to report double-digit comps, and we're leveraging our U.K. experience in other markets across the globe. Earlier, Doug mentioned some of our change initiatives that we're working on across the enterprise. One of these initiatives is built around this experience in grocery home shopping. We have a newly created international acceleration team based in the U.K. that is building close partnerships with our markets to speed up the adoption of grocery home shopping processes and technologies. We're now working towards a common technology platform to better position us for the expansion of grocery home shopping.
Now let's take a look at our first quarter results. In the first quarter, net sales grew 3.4% on a constant currency basis, partially benefiting by the timing of Chinese New Year and Easter. The U.S. dollar has remained at historically high levels, leading to a considerable currency impact of $3.3 billion, which led to a 6.6% sales decline on a reported basis. Comp sales were favorable across 4 of our 5 top markets, with the U.K., driven by continued deflation in food, and aggressive competition being the exception. 
We also had negative comps in Japan, lapping last year's benefit of accelerated consumer spending ahead of the April 2014 consumption tax hike. We grew comp sales in our remaining markets.
As expected, operating income grew slower than sales at 0.1% on a constant currency basis, impacted by planned strategic investments in our e-commerce businesses and ongoing economic and competitive pressures in certain markets. With the currency exchange impact, operating income decreased 11% on a reported basis. On a constant currency basis, inventory grew faster than sales at 8.2%, driven by slower sales in the U.K. and inventory buildup leading up to the Easter holiday.
On a reported basis, inventory declined 5.4%. 
Now let's discuss individual results for our largest markets. Comp sales and changes in various metrics are presented on a constant currency basis only. In all countries, except Brazil and China, financial results are inclusive of e-commerce. Slides 8 and 9 of the presentation summarize financial details.
Let's start with the U.K. The market remained highly competitive and promotional. Hard discounters continued to gain share, though at a slowing rate, and all major supermarkets stepped up aggressive investments in price. As a result, grocery deflation persisted at record levels, leading to low market growth. Grocery prices were down 2% versus last year for the 12 weeks ended March 29, according to Kantar. U.K. sales declined 2.9% and comp sales declined 3.3%, excluding fuel, primarily driven by deflation in fresh. Operating income declined, negatively impacted by lower sales and margin.
Heading into Q2, the team is focused on improving sales and operating performance through price investments in branded goods, maintaining aggressive price points on key items and continuing to invest in the highest quality fresh offering. Asda's 5-year strategy of investing GBP 1 billion in lowering prices remains on track this year, our second year of the program.
In Canada, we maintained solid growth amid a dynamic, competitive environment. Sales were up 3.7% and comps were up 1.8%, driven by solid Easter sales, strong performance in seasonal and improving strength in our overall food business, including fresh. We continue to enhance our value and price offering, especially with private brands, where we saw significant growth. Market share increased in food, health and wellness, consumables and infant categories for the 12 weeks ended April 18, according to Nielsen.
Operating income grew faster than sales for the quarter. We remain focused on our low-cost operating model and continue to seek out opportunities to drive efficiencies to reduce expenses. I'm pleased with performance overall and expect the positive trend to continue as the competitive landscape evolves.
On May 8, we announced acquisition of 13 stores, 12 leased and 1 owned; and 1 distribution center from a former competitor. While these transactions are subject to bankruptcy court approval, we look forward to bringing additional supercenters to more provinces in Canada. These stores are in addition to the 29 supercenters we announced as part of our current fiscal year expansion program.
Next, let's turn to Mexico, which released their earnings on April 21. Please note that the Walmex release is under IFRS and the results here are under U.S. GAAP. Therefore, some numbers may differ. Consolidated Walmex net sales increased 7.3%, with strong comp sales in both Mexico and Central America. Operating income growth was also favorable, up 10.4% year-over-year. Mexico net sales grew 7.1% and comp sales increased 4.9%. Self-service gained 80 basis points of market share during the quarter according  to ANTAD. Performance was strong in food and consumables, the largest contributor to the comp sales momentum. Sam's Club comp sales grew 6.8% in the quarter, benefited by improved merchandise assortment and initiatives to grow the membership base. I'm excited about the momentum and outlook, as the team continues to launch initiatives and price investments that will resonate with the customer.
In addition to top line performance, Mexico did a good job managing expenses, delivering over 30 basis points of leverage compared to last year, driven by lower utility, supplies and advertising expenses.
Now on to Brazil. Market conditions worsened this quarter due to continued inflationary cost pressures. In addition, the retail grocery sector had its worst first quarter growth in the last 6 years at 2.2% according to Serasa Experian, a global information services company. Despite the continuing economic slowdown, I was pleased to see another quarter of steady growth in Brazil. Both net sales and comp sales were up 3%. Sam's Club and Maxxi formats outpaced retail market growth, with double-digit comp sales increases. Brazil continues to invest in price, particularly in general merchandise, in an effort to improve sales trends in retail formats.
Brazil did not leverage expenses for the quarter, largely due to the inflationary pressures that I've just mentioned. Management remains focused on turnaround initiatives to deliver profitability in the back half of the year.
Moving on to China. Walmart China's Q1 net sales grew 1.9% and comp sales grew 0.4% as sales for Chinese New Year improved year-over-year. Recall that Chinese New Year was January 31 last year and February 19 this year, so some sales shifted from Q4 into Q1 this year. According to China UnionPay Data, our gift card loading outperformed the market in the high volume months of January and February. Nielsen also showed that Walmart increased market share in fast-moving consumer goods in the hypermarket channel and maintained share in the modern trade channel, which includes smaller format stores, for the 12 weeks ended March 29.
While there are ongoing market headwinds from government austerity and slightly slower economic growth, we're confident we'll continue to deliver growth in China. Part of this growth will come from the planned opening of 33 stores and clubs this year, with expansion focused in the southern regions where we have a strong market presence.
Additionally, we aim to provide better services and widen our customer reach through greater expansion of our omni-channel platforms, including online and mobile.
We're focused on driving efficiency, cost reductions and strengthening our portfolio in China. Operating income grew 23.5%, up due to expense leverage and gross margin improvement from higher sell-through with Chinese New Year. We leveraged expenses this quarter in our core business through We Operate For Less and We Buy For Less initiatives and will continue to pass those savings onto customers.
Finally, let's discuss e-commerce performance. Accelerating e-commerce is one of our strategic objectives this year, and we're making significant strides in providing convenient access for shoppers as we continue to invest globally in e-commerce capabilities. In Mexico, we're launching an improved Sam's Club website in the second quarter and an app in the third quarter. In China, we'll launch a new app later this quarter for our stores that will enable customers to shop from their local Walmart store and choose to pick up their order in store or have it delivered at home. And in Canada, our e-commerce business continues to perform strongly, with a comp of greater than 40%. 
Yihaodian, our e-commerce business in China, benefited from the Spring Festival promotion to support Chinese New Year, with strong sales of imported items in milk products, shampoo and other categories. Orders drove most of our growth and our conversion rate improved nearly 100 basis points compared to the same quarter last year. Mobile contributed more than 40% of orders. 
Brazil e-commerce had another strong performance this quarter, with comps up double digits and outpaced the Brazilian total e-commerce market growth rate. Phones, auto and tires and baby categories helped drive this growth. Above average summer temperatures drove strong sales in fans and air-conditioners. On Consumer Day, a national event in March that's similar to a Black Friday event in the U.S., we also delivered strong sales growth. 
In addition to our solid financial performance, I'm pleased with the progress we've made in strengthening our key enablers of being the lowest-cost operator, building world-class talent and building trust. One way we deliver on being the lowest-cost operator is by reducing our total energy required to power our buildings.
For example, in the U.K., we're migrating to a new energy monitoring system that provides daily energy alarms, analytic capabilities and reporting. In addition, we remain committed to programs that develop talent. We began providing retail training to women in emerging markets last year and have now trained women in several countries, including Argentina, Chile, Mexico, South Africa and India, and are focused on scaling projects throughout this year. By the end of next year, we plan to have trained 200,000 women for their first jobs in retail in our emerging markets.
As we look forward to the rest of the year for the International business, we anticipate some headwinds, particularly in Latin America, where in the second quarter, we lap last year's World Cup. We also expect similar trends in the U.K. to continue, given market conditions and anticipate ongoing currency pressure with the strength of the U.S. dollar.
At the same time though, we have strong momentum in markets like Mexico and Canada and expect to see solid growth continue in these markets.
The global landscape remains challenging and the retail industry is highly competitive. However, I believe we're headed in the right direction and are making progress towards our strategic objectives, which is setting us up for long-term growth and success.

This year is one of investment and testing, and we're very focused on strengthening our foundation for business improvement in the longer term.
We've been focused on 4 initiatives designed to improve our foundation.
The first initiative is improving our merchandise assortment, where we are driving newness and differentiation. For example, we increased our organic offering by 20% since the beginning of the year, and these are important to various demographic groups, including millennials.
Our second initiative is focused on membership and decision sciences. We created a new Chief Member Officer, reporting to me, that will own membership data and analytics. This role, which was put in place at the beginning of the quarter, oversees a new team of data scientists, marketing and insights professionals. I'm pleased that the team's recent new targeted membership efforts give us optimism for the rest of the year.
Our third initiative is launching new programs to enhance member value. One example is a groundbreaking new pharmacy program called  Free/4/10, which provides Plus members with free or discounted prescriptions for 5 costly diseases, including Alzheimer's, diabetes, mental health, vitamin D deficiency and prostate health. This program contributed to a number of Plus upgrades since its rollout. 
Our fourth initiative is a significant long-term investment in our e-commerce business. We relaunched Club Pickup in every club in the country, resulting in a 37% sales increase in the Club Pickup program. Members love the convenience benefits of online ordering and easy pickup at the club. I'm encouraged that our investments will pay off in the near future.
Now on to the numbers. With fuel, operating income declined 10.9% to $427 million. The fuel business has experienced significant pricing volatility within the quarter. And as a result, our fuel business lost $9 million this quarter. For additional results with fuel, please reference the accompanying presentation.
In Q1, net sales, without fuel, grew 1.2% to $12.4 billion. Comp sales were 0.4%, driven by ticket increases of 60 basis points and by a traffic decline of 20 basis points. Savings member traffic was positive, offset by a decline in Business member traffic. E-commerce contributed 40 basis points to the comp for the 13-week period.
Our gross profit rate declined 15 basis points compared to last year, attributable to our investment in Plus Cash Rewards. We will continue to invest in Cash Rewards as Plus penetration grows.
Operating expenses as a percentage of sales increased 33 basis points, due to investments in new clubs, e-commerce and technology. Membership and other income grew 4.9%, with membership income up 7.4%. Operating income declined 8.6% to $436 million.
Our merchant teams continue to work on bringing newness and trend-right merchandise into the clubs. We still have opportunities for improvement, and we continue to invest in price to drive value for our members. 
Comp sales in fresh/freezer/cooler were up in the low single digits. Meat and deli categories performed well. But our overall food comps, including dairy and produce, were impacted by deflation in these fresh categories. We grew comp sales in dry groceries. This is an area in which we will continue to invest to improve both assortment and member value.
Consumables were led by private-brand tabletop programs, offset by ongoing supply issues within baby care.
Overall, home and apparel comps were up in the low single digits. Women and children's apparel was strong, delivering double-digit comp performance. Patio and seasonal items were down, due to the slow start to spring in key geographies, but mattress and houseware categories grew double digits in comp sales.
In our technology and entertainment business, comp sales were down. TV sales were challenged due to the West Coast port delays, but did pick up later in the quarter once the delays decreased. Our audio sales were strong due to new headphones and sound bars. This category has been part of our initiative to streamline our offering to provide the latest advancement in the technologies that matter and to improve our offerings online.
Our health and wellness category benefited from our pharmacy's introduction of the newly launched Free/4/10 program that I mentioned earlier. This program is being merchandised at our pharmacies and contributed to a number of Plus upgrades since its rollout. We are optimistic about its ability to continue to drive membership growth. As we continue to enhance and improve our offerings, we are managing our inventory appropriately. Inventory, without fuel, grew 1.9%, primarily attributable to new clubs.
Beyond these merchandise areas, membership growth is our #1 priority, and we see opportunities to better serve both the Business and the Savings member. 
Turning to membership. We were encouraged by the momentum in April in both acquisition and renewal counts. This will be a constant focus for us. We see consistent growth in our Plus membership, driven by our national rollout of Cash Rewards last year. We have added over 1.6 million new Plus Members since a year ago. Members that have upgraded to a Plus membership are highly engaged, both in clubs and online, and their spending is up over the previous year in the mid to high single-digit range. In addition, the 5-3-1 MasterCard program we launched last year continues to receive industry accolades, but more importantly, receives tremendously positive feedback from our members. 
When I'm out walking in the clubs and talking with members, they consistently tell me how much they enjoy the benefits of our Cash Rewards program and our 5-3-1 MasterCard. This is especially true for our small business members as the rewards really add up. Together, these 2 initiatives continue to meet our expectations in providing membership value.
For the long term, we continue to see success in some key strategic areas and will build on these. The integration of digital and physical is a key enabler for our growth. E-commerce delivered a double-digit comp this quarter, contributing 40 basis points to the segment comp. Growth in traffic, ticket and conversion was driven by strong double-digit Club Pickup comps.
We are also leveraging our digital capabilities to drive targeted member growth and renewal. Utilizing our data analytics, we used digital media to reach current and prospective members, but can now align it with system enhancements and better visibility of members' shopping behaviors. For example, our recent Groupon offer clearly communicated the value of the Sam's Club membership card and generated more than 220,000 new members in less than 2 weeks. Ultimately, we know we will attract and retain members by creating irresistible value in our membership. While our Business member numbers continue to be challenged, we're maintaining our focus on turning that trend around. To help them grow, we've expanded the value we provide to small business members with the addition in the first quarter of 5 new or enhanced services through third parties: identity theft protection, accounting, business lending, payment processing and online marketing. With these new services, we've broadened the portfolio of new business services we launched in the fall, and we will continue to do so throughout the year. The primary purpose of these services is to help our small business members be successful and create additional membership value from their Sam's Club card.
Although it's still early, we've had positive feedback on our new services. We are intensely focused on addressing top line sales and membership. We expect comp sales for the 13-week period ending July 31 to be between flat and up 2%.
Now I'll pass it over to Charles. Charles?"
313055,280452550,819262,"Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Q1 2016 Pre Recorded Earnings Call, May 19, 2015",2015-05-19,"Earnings Calls","Walmart Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Roz. I will wrap up today's discussion by providing some thoughts on our performance.

I will wrap up today's discussion by providing some thoughts on our performance. As you heard, currency exchange negatively impacted our sales by $3.3 billion and earnings per share by $0.03, which was more than we anticipated. Even though our Walmart U.S. comp sales were around the bottom of our guidance, we are pleased with our earnings per share coming in at $1.03, in the middle of our range.
Before I move on to our second quarter guidance, it's important to reiterate that we continue to execute our enterprise strategy, which we feel is creating a stronger foundation for the future. It's still early days. But it's important to note, we are managing our capital in a very disciplined way, seeking the right balance between sales growth and profitability as we integrate digital and physical. Based on our views of the global macroeconomic environment and assuming currency exchange rates remain at current levels, we expect second quarter fiscal 2016 earnings per share to range between $1.06 and $1.18.
Our second quarter guidance includes the impact of approximately $0.04 per share from our previously announced investments in both associate wages and training as well as $0.04 per share from currency.
Now as a reminder, our full year earnings per share guidance assumes the impact of approximately $0.20 per share from our strategic investments in both associate wages and training as well as an incremental $0.06 to $0.09 per share in e-commerce investment.
In our first quarter, we incurred approximately $0.02 per share from our investment in associate wages and training and an incremental $0.02 per share from our e-commerce investments.
In addition to the impact from these 2 significant investments, we expect currency to remain a significant headwind for the year. Assuming exchange rates remain where they are today, the impact on full year net sales would be approximately $14 billion. Now this compares to our guidance in February of approximately $10 billion. Again, assuming exchange rates remain where they are today, the impact on our earnings per share this year would be approximately $0.13 per share compared to our prior guidance of $0.10 per share.
We continue to expect our effective tax rate to range between 32% and 34% for this fiscal year. Our tax rate will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter and may be impacted by a number of factors, including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, valuation allowances, changes in law, outcomes of administrative audits, the impacts of discrete items and the mix of earnings among our U.S. and international operations. And in any given quarter, our effective tax rate could be higher or lower than the full year range. In February, we indicated that we expected our first quarter effective tax rate to be the highest of all 4 quarters this year. However, given the fluctuations that I just mentioned, we were below that initial forecast.
Before we wrap up today's call, I would like to address a few additional items. You're familiar with how we prioritize our capital, and the first is organic growth. In this fiscal year, we added approximately 4.1 million additional square feet of retail space around the world. Additionally, when there are opportunities that can increase our ability to serve customers and add shareholder value, we will invest beyond our capital plan that we shared in October. Our recent announcement in Canada regarding the acquisition and renovation of specific real estate locations from a competitor for approximately $290 million is a great example of such an opportunity.
Our remaining cash flows provide shareholder returns in the form of dividends and share repurchases. It's important to remind you that we remain committed to returning value to our shareholders and we will continue to be opportunistic with share repurchases throughout the year.
Before I close, I would like to reiterate that working capital management remains a very high priority for us. We acknowledge there's more work to do across our business, but our leadership teams are committed to further improvement throughout this year.
With that, thank you for your support of our company. We hope to see all of you at Shareholders this year."

Walmart generated nearly $115 billion in revenue and delivered earnings per share within our guidance range at $1.03. I'll cover the results for the quarter in just a minute, but I'd like to start with an update on some of our larger strategic choices and the progress we've made to bring them to life.
Our objective is to make changes to improve our short to midterm performance while, at the same time, position the company for the long term. By position, I'm referring to how we set ourselves up to serve customers for years to come and the strategic choices we're making are in 2 critical areas: people and technology. 
In April, we launched a comprehensive set of store and club initiatives that I discussed in last quarter's call. These are intended to improve our short to midterm performance in the United States. As you'll remember, we're investing in our starting wage rates; an improved store structure, including adding department managers; and wage increases for most positions within our stores and clubs in the U.S. We have pilots underway that will improve our scheduling process and improve our training. This set of initiatives is designed to improve the customer experience and translate into higher comp store sales over time. The rollout of these changes happens throughout this year. We know that we won't see it overnight, but we're confident these are the right things to do for our business and our team.
I've recently visited stores and clubs in the Detroit and Seattle markets, and I'm encouraged with our associates' level of ownership in the business and understanding of the plan.
As we improve the experience in our stores, we continue to invest to deliver a stronger mobile and e-commerce experience. In the U.S., we're rolling out a more simplified checkout process on walmart.com, which is based on our global technology platform, Pangaea. An important part of this platform is that it delivers a better experience on mobile devices. Mobile is increasingly the driver of our e-commerce business.
A few weeks ago, I visited stores and clubs in Beijing and Shanghai. I really enjoyed listening to our Yihaodian customer focus group and following one of our associates around as we delivered orders to apartments in Shanghai. There are new, exciting developments happening in retail, and I'm encouraged that we're in the thick of it. But I was also reminded that the same basic tenets of our business, like value for money, a great assortment and customer service, are what they're after. Those customers we delivered to in Shanghai were quick to praise our associate in his service during deliveries. They liked our prices but asked for items that we don't yet carry. I was pleased to hear from them that we didn't need to open the cases of merchandise because they trusted our delivery associate. That's a big deal.
The week before being in China, I walked stores in Mexico and saw a growing business in grocery home shopping there, too. The associates I visited within Mexico were sensing a momentum in their business, and it was good to see them leaning forward. So we'll make these investments in our people. We'll give them the opportunity to move up so that they're engaged in our business and happy to serve customers. At the same time, we'll continue making progress with digital, mobile and e-commerce. And we'll bring it all together in a seamless way that delivers value for customers. We're moving on a lot of fronts and picking up some speed. Around the world, our associates are focused on running great stores, empowering their teams, developing technological solutions to solve customer problems and integrating it all together.
Now let's get into our first quarter results in more detail. Walmart U.S. again delivered positive comp sales, and I'm encouraged by the customer traffic trends. I'm particularly pleased by the customer response to our Neighborhood Markets, driving strong comps again this quarter. Based on recent surveys, we know that many of our U.S. customers are using their tax refunds and the extra money from lower gas prices to pay down debt or put it into savings. They're also using these funds for everyday expenses like utilities and groceries. That's where we can be their destination of choice. We're not where we want to be in every store, but I'm pleased with the progress that I'm seeing.
Walmart International produced solid constant currency sales growth this quarter. Mexico and Canada had really good sales results. In Mexico, the Sam's Club business is where we've seen our most dramatic improvement due to improved merchandise and stronger in-club operations. And one of the more encouraging signs for me is that this execution is happening over multiple store formats in Mexico, including Bodega. 
In China, we're doing a better job of managing inventory and building customers' trust with the quality of our fresh offering.
Sam's Club had lower comp sales and profit than expected. Membership income was up more than 7%, indicating the emphasis on winning over more members to Plus status is progressing. Sam's recently launched new services that have promise for improved member acquisition and retention and investments in Club Pickup and e-commerce are starting to pay off. However, we need more consistent progress, and I'm confident that the strategic plan the Sam's Club team is working on will lead to longer-term improvements in our club business.
We're investing to win the future of retail, and I'm excited about the possibilities that our improved e-commerce capabilities will provide. As I mentioned earlier, we're making progress on rolling out our global technology platform to make e-commerce and mobile shopping easier for customers. Walmart's worldwide e-commerce sales grew approximately 17% in the first quarter, as this grocery home shopping continues to drive double-digit growth and we're sharing this expertise around the world to test delivery and pickup services in more locations.
To meet our growth projections, we recently announced a new fulfillment center in Brazil, which will be our second one there dedicated solely to e-commerce. We will open 2 new mechanized fulfillment centers this quarter in the U.S. and 2 others will follow later this year.
At Walmart, we operate our business in a way that adds value to communities. We recently published our Annual Global Responsibility Report. I'd love for you to take a look at our ongoing initiatives to create economic opportunity for our associates and others in the retail industry, to enhance the sustainability of our operations and product supply chain and to strengthen communities in places where we operate. It's real and meaningful work and something we're really proud of.
On Friday, June 5, we'll hold our Annual Shareholders' Meeting. It's always a great opportunity to hear from our shareholders and interact with so many of our more than 5,000 associates who come from our markets around the world. I always leave this meeting energized after spending time with our associates. 
Looking ahead, I'm encouraged by the progress we're making and the plans in place for the future. Our priority is to drive growth across the enterprise. Globally, we're working to exceed customer expectations by helping them save time and money and have a great experience as they interact with us in store, online or on their phone. We've made progress, but we still have a lot of work to do. We're pushing to change faster as we continue down the right path to deliver long-term value to both customers and shareholders.

313055,280452550,819310,"Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Q1 2016 Pre Recorded Earnings Call, May 19, 2015",2015-05-19,"Earnings Calls","Walmart Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Doug. Today, I'll highlight some items in the company's consolidated financial statements. Further details are available in the accompanying presentation posted today with this transcript. For the first quarter of fiscal '16, diluted earnings per",602,"Thanks, Doug. Today, I'll highlight some items in the company's consolidated financial statements. Further details are available in the accompanying presentation posted today with this transcript. For the first quarter of fiscal '16, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Walmart EPS were $1.03. This compares to last year's EPS of $1.10, which was negatively impacted by approximately $0.03 from severe weather. Currency exchange rate fluctuations had a greater-than-anticipated impact on this year's first quarter results. Fluctuations in currency negatively impacted net sales by approximately $3.3 billion and similarly impacted EPS by $0.03. As a reminder, our incremental investment in e-commerce was approximately $0.02 per share and the investment in the U.S. associates impacted EPS by approximately $0.02.
These investments were also the primary contributor to the 2.8% increase in consolidated operating expenses.
Additionally, FCPA and compliance-related costs were approximately $33 million, comprised of $25 million for the ongoing inquiries and investigations and $8 million for our global compliance program and organizational enhancements. Last year, FCPA and compliance-related costs were $53 million in the first quarter. 
The company's consolidated operating income decreased 8.3%. Excluding the impact from currency, operating income decreased 6.1%. The company's continued investments in e-commerce as well as wages and training for our U.S. associates were headwinds on our operating income during the quarter.
As you will see on Slide 2, net interest expense increased 45.1%, primarily due to the cumulative impact of an immaterial accounting correction that I will explain in a moment. Without this cumulative adjustment, interest expense would have been flat. We consolidate a number of entities into our financial statements for which there are minority or noncontrolling interests. In one of these entities in Canada, we determined that certain historical sales of properties did not qualify for sale accounting due to the company's continuing involvement in the sold properties. As a result, under U.S. GAAP, these properties should have remained in our financial statement as assets, with the corresponding financial obligation recorded equal to the properties' sales proceeds. The assets and financial obligation are amortized over time. During the first quarter, we recorded the correction to our balance sheet to increase assets by $1.1 billion and liabilities by $1.4 billion. With respect to the income statement, the correction included $254 million of cumulative interest expense, offset by a related tax benefit of $53 million and $173 million attributable to noncontrolling interest. The correction had a de minimis impact on our operating income and on earnings per share as EPS is based on income attributable to Walmart.
From the balance sheet perspective, consolidated inventory increased 2.2%. Later in today's call, you'll hear more about inventory from our segment leaders. Payables as a percentage of inventory were 80.4%, which compares to 80.2% last year. 
Return on investment for the trailing 12 months ended April 30, 2015, was 16.6%, which compares to 16.7% last year. The slight change in ROI was primarily due to continued investments in store growth and e-commerce initiatives, offset by currency exchange rate fluctuations.
The decrease in free cash flow was due to lower income from continuing operations and the impact of timing of payments for inventory as well as timing of income tax payments.
The last item I'll leave you with today is share repurchases. The company repurchased approximately 3.5 million shares for $280 million during the quarter. Market conditions, general business trends and a focus on maintaining our AA credit rating, among other factors, influenced our share repurchase activity. We have approximately $10 billion remaining on our existing share repurchase authorization.

Back on April 1 in New York, we provided an update on the Walmart U.S. business. We discussed what was working well and what needed improvement in order to meet both the expectations of customers and the goals of the company. We laid out a multiyear plan that includes several large and specific projects, all of which fit within our broader strategic focus on assortment, price, access and customer experience.
As we discussed, we're not only interested in reaching our goals, but reaching them in a way which is sustainable for the long term. This requires a steady execution, a pace that is fast but calculated and one that allows us to get it right.
This quarter, we began executing this plan. We took the initial steps in April towards a stronger investment in our associates by raising the minimum starting wage for all hourly associates to $9 per hour. As part of our $1 billion investment in our associates, we also raised the floor and ceiling on pay bands in our stores, creating raises for many 
full and part-time hourly associates at every level. 
More than 500,000 associates benefited from this change. We're also restructuring the management teams in the stores, adding back almost 8,000 department managers. These department managers will have responsibility for a smaller area of the store, ensuring that they have the knowledge and the time to engage with both the customers and store associates, driving an overall better experience.
The $1 billion investment in our associates this year includes training programs as well.
Also included in our wage investments, we've continued our Checkout Promise initiative we began over the holidays, ensuring more registers are open during peak times to drive a fast and friendly experience as customers are completing their shopping trips. Finally, we continued to make steady progress against the other initiatives we have discussed, including our urgent agenda items, assortment discipline, pricing and in-stock goals. These actions require a significant investment, which is included in our financial plan for the year. It's an investment we believe is imperative to providing customers with the unparalleled shopping experience they expect and deserve and our associates with more opportunities to build a successful career at Walmart.
With these steps in mind, let's move on to our first quarter results. Net sales grew $2.4 billion or 3.5% versus last year. For the 13-week period ended May 1, comparable stores were up 1.1%, which was within our guidance. Comp sales were driven by solid growth in traffic, which was up 1%. Customers continue to see the benefit of lower gas prices versus last year and are responding favorably to some of our new assortments for the spring and summer selling seasons.
All formats had positive comps for the quarter, including our traditional format, Neighborhood Markets, which posted approximately a 7.9% comp. A focus on customer service and in-stock position drove strong traffic in this format. Customers continue to see the benefit of Neighborhood Markets to meet their everyday needs, including convenient access to services such as drive-thru pharmacies and fuel stations. 
Merchandise comp performance was similar to last quarter. Customers responded to the new spring and summer assortments in apparel and continued growth in active wear and strong brands across the category helped meet customers' assortment needs. Indoor home categories with key items and investments in opening price points drove momentum.
We also saw customers transition outside, driving sales in outdoor, lawn and garden and toys. Last, health and wellness posted strong comp sales with momentum in both OTC and optical, driven by recent product launches as well as continued growth in pharmacy scripts.
Within general merchandise, we continued to feel pressure in media and electronics, resulting from industry contraction, the shift from physical to digital media and lapping last year's release of the movie Frozen. Additionally, in-stock positions in categories such as TVs suffered as a result of the port congestion on the West Coast. That said, we now believe the majority of this disruption is behind us.
Moving to grocery. We were pleased by the operational improvement we saw in fresh. As we mentioned in April, this is a key area of focus, and getting fresh right is critical to the customer experience. We're taking the right steps towards reducing the time to bring fresh product to our customers and training associates to ensure the best offering is on the shelf. We still have a lot more to do in this area but we're steadily improving. 
One key headwind we faced in grocery during the first quarter was moderating inflation in meat and deflation in both dairy and produce. While partially offset by inflationary trends in dry and frozen foods, we estimate the moderation in fresh foods impacted our overall comp performance by almost 70 basis points this quarter. Overall, net food inflation negatively impacted our comp by approximately 20 basis points.
Finally, e-commerce, driven by strong traffic and price leadership, saw double-digit comp growth across many departments. E-commerce plays a key role in our focus on access for the customer, which is fundamentally around convenience. We're launching the final phase of our new platform related to cart and online checkout capabilities. Our customers are using their mobile devices to access our site on the go. Mobile traffic was up over 100% for the quarter, and we saw higher conversion rates as well. We continue to learn from our grocery home shopping tests, where we recently added another location to the Huntsville, Alabama market. And we're working towards a better customer experience in our Walmart Pickup program, formerly called Site to Store. The program includes improved email communication, a new signage package that makes it easier for customers to understand the program and a focus on a faster pickup experience in the stores. It will roll out to all stores by October 1.
For the quarter, e-commerce sales contributed approximately 20 basis points to our overall comp performance.
Moving on to the remainder of our financial results. In the first quarter, gross profit rate declined 13 basis points, driven primarily by a headwind from shrink, half of which was in food. We are addressing this increase immediately, bringing a high level of focus and visibility to this concern by adding it as a key urgent agenda item this year. In addition to shrink, the ongoing mix shift in pharmacy, incremental expenses related to the West Coast port congestion and cost inflation in consumables contributed to the decline. Somewhat offsetting this was a continued focus on the urgent agenda items laid out last year, including managing throwaways in fresh and reducing inventory that is no longer active in the stores.
As expected, operating expenses increased 6.6% versus last year. This was driven by changes in estimates associated with our incentive accrual versus last year and the investments we're making in our associates, including the increase in minimum starting pay rates, the restructure of store management roles and the continuation of our Checkout Promise initiative.
Finally, ongoing investments in e-commerce and technology were a headwind for the quarter. Given these investments, along with the reduction in gross profit rate, operating income declined 6.8% or $336 million for the quarter. Inventory grew 5.4% in the first quarter. Almost half of this growth was related to the significant number of new stores added in the past several months. The remainder of the growth was related to congestion clearing in the West Coast ports and some conscious replenishment decisions we made to drive improvements in our in-stock position. We continue to make strides against our goal of strong working capital management. We grew inventory in comp stores below the rate of sales, and our in-stock position continue to improve throughout the quarter.
This quarter, we opened 20 supercenters, including relocations and expansions. Additionally, we opened 15 traditional format Neighborhood Markets and 9 smaller format locations, including 1 campus store location.
We've spent a lot of time over the past several months truly understanding what it will take to succeed over time in a rapidly changing retail environment. This quarter, we made some improvements, taking the right steps at a steady pace, ensuring we stay on track towards the long-term goals of the business. We continue to monitor our fast, friendly and clean performance in the stores. And based on customer feedback, we are making good progress. I'm out walking our stores every week, visiting our associates and talking to our customers in markets across the country. Additionally, Judith McKenna, our Chief Operating Officer, has visited with over 750 store managers in recent weeks, gathering their thoughts on how we can improve.
We are pleased that our customer service scores have steadily increased this quarter, with all geographic areas and formats showing positive results. We know, though, that we're not where we want to be yet. It will take time to achieve our goals. But we're fully committed to providing our customers with the shopping experience they can love and associates who see their efforts leading to broader and better careers.
For the second quarter, we expect traffic to remain strong, supported by sustained low gas prices and our efforts to improve customer service in our stores. This will be offset, in part, by a continued decline in food inflation rates. For the 13-week period ending July 31, we anticipate a comp sales increase of around 1%. Last year, our comp sales for the period were flat.
Now I'll turn it over to Dave for an update on the Walmart International. Dave?"

Over the past few months, I've had the opportunity to visit the majority of our markets, and I continue to be pleased with the progress I see.

Over the past few months, I've had the opportunity to visit the majority of our markets, and I continue to be pleased with the progress I see. Overall, we've had a solid start to the fiscal year financially and continue to make progress on our key strategic priorities. As a reminder, these key priorities include: actively managing the existing portfolio; driving comp sales; accelerating e-commerce; delivering market priorities, particularly in China, Brazil and Mexico; and finally, strengthening key enablers, such as being the lowest-cost operator, building world-class talent, and building trust. 
Before we discuss the financials, here are a few highlights from the first quarter. First, I'm particularly pleased with our overall performance in Mexico, which not only had its strongest net quarterly sales growth in over 2 years, but also grew operating income faster than sales. Our results in Mexico were due to better comps in all key formats, including Sam's Club.
Also, I want to call out our performance in Canada, which had a positive comp for the fourth consecutive quarter. In addition to Canada and Mexico, we achieved comp growth in most of our other markets, as we remain committed to delivering positive comp sales across the board. I'm energized by the execution I've seen from our teams.
In addition, I'm excited about our efforts in accelerating e-commerce. In the U.K., grocery home shopping continues to report double-digit comps, and we're leveraging our U.K. experience in other markets across the globe. Earlier, Doug mentioned some of our change initiatives that we're working on across the enterprise. One of these initiatives is built around this experience in grocery home shopping. We have a newly created international acceleration team based in the U.K. that is building close partnerships with our markets to speed up the adoption of grocery home shopping processes and technologies. We're now working towards a common technology platform to better position us for the expansion of grocery home shopping.
Now let's take a look at our first quarter results. In the first quarter, net sales grew 3.4% on a constant currency basis, partially benefiting by the timing of Chinese New Year and Easter. The U.S. dollar has remained at historically high levels, leading to a considerable currency impact of $3.3 billion, which led to a 6.6% sales decline on a reported basis. Comp sales were favorable across 4 of our 5 top markets, with the U.K., driven by continued deflation in food, and aggressive competition being the exception. 
We also had negative comps in Japan, lapping last year's benefit of accelerated consumer spending ahead of the April 2014 consumption tax hike. We grew comp sales in our remaining markets.
As expected, operating income grew slower than sales at 0.1% on a constant currency basis, impacted by planned strategic investments in our e-commerce businesses and ongoing economic and competitive pressures in certain markets. With the currency exchange impact, operating income decreased 11% on a reported basis. On a constant currency basis, inventory grew faster than sales at 8.2%, driven by slower sales in the U.K. and inventory buildup leading up to the Easter holiday.
On a reported basis, inventory declined 5.4%. 
Now let's discuss individual results for our largest markets. Comp sales and changes in various metrics are presented on a constant currency basis only. In all countries, except Brazil and China, financial results are inclusive of e-commerce. Slides 8 and 9 of the presentation summarize financial details.
Let's start with the U.K. The market remained highly competitive and promotional. Hard discounters continued to gain share, though at a slowing rate, and all major supermarkets stepped up aggressive investments in price. As a result, grocery deflation persisted at record levels, leading to low market growth. Grocery prices were down 2% versus last year for the 12 weeks ended March 29, according to Kantar. U.K. sales declined 2.9% and comp sales declined 3.3%, excluding fuel, primarily driven by deflation in fresh. Operating income declined, negatively impacted by lower sales and margin.
Heading into Q2, the team is focused on improving sales and operating performance through price investments in branded goods, maintaining aggressive price points on key items and continuing to invest in the highest quality fresh offering. Asda's 5-year strategy of investing GBP 1 billion in lowering prices remains on track this year, our second year of the program.
In Canada, we maintained solid growth amid a dynamic, competitive environment. Sales were up 3.7% and comps were up 1.8%, driven by solid Easter sales, strong performance in seasonal and improving strength in our overall food business, including fresh. We continue to enhance our value and price offering, especially with private brands, where we saw significant growth. Market share increased in food, health and wellness, consumables and infant categories for the 12 weeks ended April 18, according to Nielsen.
Operating income grew faster than sales for the quarter. We remain focused on our low-cost operating model and continue to seek out opportunities to drive efficiencies to reduce expenses. I'm pleased with performance overall and expect the positive trend to continue as the competitive landscape evolves.
On May 8, we announced acquisition of 13 stores, 12 leased and 1 owned; and 1 distribution center from a former competitor. While these transactions are subject to bankruptcy court approval, we look forward to bringing additional supercenters to more provinces in Canada. These stores are in addition to the 29 supercenters we announced as part of our current fiscal year expansion program.
Next, let's turn to Mexico, which released their earnings on April 21. Please note that the Walmex release is under IFRS and the results here are under U.S. GAAP. Therefore, some numbers may differ. Consolidated Walmex net sales increased 7.3%, with strong comp sales in both Mexico and Central America. Operating income growth was also favorable, up 10.4% year-over-year. Mexico net sales grew 7.1% and comp sales increased 4.9%. Self-service gained 80 basis points of market share during the quarter according  to ANTAD. Performance was strong in food and consumables, the largest contributor to the comp sales momentum. Sam's Club comp sales grew 6.8% in the quarter, benefited by improved merchandise assortment and initiatives to grow the membership base. I'm excited about the momentum and outlook, as the team continues to launch initiatives and price investments that will resonate with the customer.
In addition to top line performance, Mexico did a good job managing expenses, delivering over 30 basis points of leverage compared to last year, driven by lower utility, supplies and advertising expenses.
Now on to Brazil. Market conditions worsened this quarter due to continued inflationary cost pressures. In addition, the retail grocery sector had its worst first quarter growth in the last 6 years at 2.2% according to Serasa Experian, a global information services company. Despite the continuing economic slowdown, I was pleased to see another quarter of steady growth in Brazil. Both net sales and comp sales were up 3%. Sam's Club and Maxxi formats outpaced retail market growth, with double-digit comp sales increases. Brazil continues to invest in price, particularly in general merchandise, in an effort to improve sales trends in retail formats.
Brazil did not leverage expenses for the quarter, largely due to the inflationary pressures that I've just mentioned. Management remains focused on turnaround initiatives to deliver profitability in the back half of the year.
Moving on to China. Walmart China's Q1 net sales grew 1.9% and comp sales grew 0.4% as sales for Chinese New Year improved year-over-year. Recall that Chinese New Year was January 31 last year and February 19 this year, so some sales shifted from Q4 into Q1 this year. According to China UnionPay Data, our gift card loading outperformed the market in the high volume months of January and February. Nielsen also showed that Walmart increased market share in fast-moving consumer goods in the hypermarket channel and maintained share in the modern trade channel, which includes smaller format stores, for the 12 weeks ended March 29.
While there are ongoing market headwinds from government austerity and slightly slower economic growth, we're confident we'll continue to deliver growth in China. Part of this growth will come from the planned opening of 33 stores and clubs this year, with expansion focused in the southern regions where we have a strong market presence.
Additionally, we aim to provide better services and widen our customer reach through greater expansion of our omni-channel platforms, including online and mobile.
We're focused on driving efficiency, cost reductions and strengthening our portfolio in China. Operating income grew 23.5%, up due to expense leverage and gross margin improvement from higher sell-through with Chinese New Year. We leveraged expenses this quarter in our core business through We Operate For Less and We Buy For Less initiatives and will continue to pass those savings onto customers.
Finally, let's discuss e-commerce performance. Accelerating e-commerce is one of our strategic objectives this year, and we're making significant strides in providing convenient access for shoppers as we continue to invest globally in e-commerce capabilities. In Mexico, we're launching an improved Sam's Club website in the second quarter and an app in the third quarter. In China, we'll launch a new app later this quarter for our stores that will enable customers to shop from their local Walmart store and choose to pick up their order in store or have it delivered at home. And in Canada, our e-commerce business continues to perform strongly, with a comp of greater than 40%. 
Yihaodian, our e-commerce business in China, benefited from the Spring Festival promotion to support Chinese New Year, with strong sales of imported items in milk products, shampoo and other categories. Orders drove most of our growth and our conversion rate improved nearly 100 basis points compared to the same quarter last year. Mobile contributed more than 40% of orders. 
Brazil e-commerce had another strong performance this quarter, with comps up double digits and outpaced the Brazilian total e-commerce market growth rate. Phones, auto and tires and baby categories helped drive this growth. Above average summer temperatures drove strong sales in fans and air-conditioners. On Consumer Day, a national event in March that's similar to a Black Friday event in the U.S., we also delivered strong sales growth. 
In addition to our solid financial performance, I'm pleased with the progress we've made in strengthening our key enablers of being the lowest-cost operator, building world-class talent and building trust. One way we deliver on being the lowest-cost operator is by reducing our total energy required to power our buildings.
For example, in the U.K., we're migrating to a new energy monitoring system that provides daily energy alarms, analytic capabilities and reporting. In addition, we remain committed to programs that develop talent. We began providing retail training to women in emerging markets last year and have now trained women in several countries, including Argentina, Chile, Mexico, South Africa and India, and are focused on scaling projects throughout this year. By the end of next year, we plan to have trained 200,000 women for their first jobs in retail in our emerging markets.
As we look forward to the rest of the year for the International business, we anticipate some headwinds, particularly in Latin America, where in the second quarter, we lap last year's World Cup. We also expect similar trends in the U.K. to continue, given market conditions and anticipate ongoing currency pressure with the strength of the U.S. dollar.
At the same time though, we have strong momentum in markets like Mexico and Canada and expect to see solid growth continue in these markets.
The global landscape remains challenging and the retail industry is highly competitive. However, I believe we're headed in the right direction and are making progress towards our strategic objectives, which is setting us up for long-term growth and success.
Now I'll turn over to Roz for the update on Sam's. Roz?"

And while we made progress in some areas,",1293,"Thank you, Dave. Our first quarter results were disappointing, as comp sales missed guidance and we delivered softer net sales and profit than last year. We continued to invest in our initiatives to drive growth. And while we made progress in some areas, we still have upside opportunity in others. This year is one of investment and testing, and we're very focused on strengthening our foundation for business improvement in the longer term.
We've been focused on 4 initiatives designed to improve our foundation.
The first initiative is improving our merchandise assortment, where we are driving newness and differentiation. For example, we increased our organic offerings by 20% since the beginning of the year, and these are important to various demographic groups, including millennials.
Our second initiative is focused on membership and decision sciences. We created a new Chief Member Officer, reporting to me, that will own membership data and analytics. This role, which was put in place at the beginning of the quarter, oversees a new team of data scientists, marketing and insights professionals. I'm pleased that the team's recent new targeted membership efforts give us optimism for the rest of the year.
Our third initiative is launching new programs to enhance member value. One example is a groundbreaking new pharmacy program called  Free/4/10, which provides Plus members with free or discounted prescriptions for 5 costly diseases, including Alzheimer's, diabetes, mental health, vitamin D deficiency and prostate health. This program contributed to a number of Plus upgrades since its rollout. 
Our fourth initiative is a significant long-term investment in our e-commerce business. We relaunched Club Pickup in every club in the country, resulting in a 37% sales increase in the Club Pickup program. Members love the convenience benefits of online ordering and easy pickup at the club. I'm encouraged that our investments will pay off in the near future.
Now on to the numbers. With fuel, operating income declined 10.9% to $427 million. The fuel business has experienced significant pricing volatility within the quarter. And as a result, our fuel business lost $9 million this quarter. For additional results with fuel, please reference the accompanying presentation.
In Q1, net sales, without fuel, grew 1.2% to $12.4 billion. Comp sales were 0.4%, driven by ticket increases of 60 basis points and by a traffic decline of 20 basis points. Savings member traffic was positive, offset by a decline in Business member traffic. E-commerce contributed 40 basis points to the comp for the 13-week period.
Our gross profit rate declined 15 basis points compared to last year, attributable to our investment in Plus Cash Rewards. We will continue to invest in Cash Rewards as Plus penetration grows.
Operating expenses as a percentage of sales increased 33 basis points, due to investments in new clubs, e-commerce and technology. Membership and other income grew 4.9%, with membership income up 7.4%. Operating income declined 8.6% to $436 million.
Our merchant teams continue to work on bringing newness and trend-right merchandise into the clubs. We still have opportunities for improvement, and we continue to invest in price to drive value for our members. 
Comp sales in fresh/freezer/cooler were up in the low single digits. Meat and deli categories performed well. But our overall food comps, including dairy and produce, were impacted by deflation in these fresh categories. We grew comp sales in dry groceries. This is an area in which we will continue to invest to improve both assortment and member value.
Consumables were led by private-brand tabletop programs, offset by ongoing supply issues within baby care.
Overall, home and apparel comps were up in the low single digits. Women and children's apparel was strong, delivering double-digit comp performance. Patio and seasonal items were down, due to the slow start to spring in key geographies, but mattress and houseware categories grew double digits in comp sales.
In our technology and entertainment business, comp sales were down. TV sales were challenged due to the West Coast port delays, but did pick up later in the quarter once the delays decreased. Our audio sales were strong due to new headphones and sound bars. This category has been part of our initiative to streamline our offering to provide the latest advancement in the technologies that matter and to improve our offerings online.
Our health and wellness category benefited from our pharmacy's introduction of the newly launched Free/4/10 program that I mentioned earlier. This program is being merchandised at our pharmacies and contributed to a number of Plus upgrades since its rollout. We are optimistic about its ability to continue to drive membership growth. As we continue to enhance and improve our offerings, we are managing our inventory appropriately. Inventory, without fuel, grew 1.9%, primarily attributable to new clubs.
Beyond these merchandise areas, membership growth is our #1 priority, and we see opportunities to better serve both the Business and the Savings member. 
Turning to membership. We were encouraged by the momentum in April in both acquisition and renewal counts. This will be a constant focus for us. We see consistent growth in our Plus membership, driven by our national rollout of Cash Rewards last year. We have added over 1.6 million new Plus Members since a year ago. Members that have upgraded to a Plus membership are highly engaged, both in clubs and online, and their spending is up over the previous year in the mid to high single-digit range. In addition, the 5-3-1 MasterCard program we launched last year continues to receive industry accolades, but more importantly, receives tremendously positive feedback from our members. 
When I'm out walking in the clubs and talking with members, they consistently tell me how much they enjoy the benefits of our Cash Rewards program and our 5-3-1 MasterCard. This is especially true for our small business members as the rewards really add up. Together, these 2 initiatives continue to meet our expectations in providing membership value.
For the long term, we continue to see success in some key strategic areas and will build on these. The integration of digital and physical is a key enabler for our growth. E-commerce delivered a double-digit comp this quarter, contributing 40 basis points to the segment comp. Growth in traffic, ticket and conversion was driven by strong double-digit Club Pickup comps.
We are also leveraging our digital capabilities to drive targeted member growth and renewal. Utilizing our data analytics, we used digital media to reach current and prospective members, but can now align it with system enhancements and better visibility of members' shopping behaviors. For example, our recent Groupon offer clearly communicated the value of the Sam's Club membership card and generated more than 220,000 new members in less than 2 weeks. Ultimately, we know we will attract and retain members by creating irresistible value in our membership. While our Business member numbers continue to be challenged, we're maintaining our focus on turning that trend around. To help them grow, we've expanded the value we provide to small business members with the addition in the first quarter of 5 new or enhanced services through third parties: identity theft protection, accounting, business lending, payment processing and online marketing. With these new services, we've broadened the portfolio of new business services we launched in the fall, and we will continue to do so throughout the year. The primary purpose of these services is to help our small business members be successful and create additional membership value from their Sam's Club card.
Although it's still early, we've had positive feedback on our new services. We are intensely focused on addressing top line sales and membership. We expect comp sales for the 13-week period ending July 31 to be between flat and up 2%.
Now I'll pass it over to Charles. Charles?"
313055,280452550,819310,"Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Q1 2016 Pre Recorded Earnings Call, May 19, 2015",2015-05-19,"Earnings Calls","Walmart Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Roz.

I will wrap up today's discussion by providing some thoughts on our performance. As you heard, currency exchange negatively impacted our sales by $3.3 billion and earnings per share by $0.03, which was more than we anticipated. Even though our Walmart U.S. comp sales were around the bottom of our guidance, we are pleased with our earnings per share coming in at $1.03, in the middle of our range.
Before I move on to our second quarter guidance, it's important to reiterate that we continue to execute our enterprise strategy, which we feel is creating a stronger foundation for the future. It's still early days. But it's important to note, we are managing our capital in a very disciplined way, seeking the right balance between sales growth and profitability as we integrate digital and physical. Based on our views of the global macroeconomic environment and assuming currency exchange rates remain at current levels, we expect second quarter fiscal 2016 earnings per share to range between $1.06 and $1.18.
Our second quarter guidance includes the impact of approximately $0.04 per share from our previously announced investments in both associate wages and training as well as $0.04 per share from currency.
Now as a reminder, our full year earnings per share guidance assumes the impact of approximately $0.20 per share from our strategic investments in both associate wages and training as well as an incremental $0.06 to $0.09 per share in e-commerce investment.
In our first quarter, we incurred approximately $0.02 per share from our investment in associate wages and training and an incremental $0.02 per share from our e-commerce investments.
In addition to the impact from these 2 significant investments, we expect currency to remain a significant headwind for the year. Assuming exchange rates remain where they are today, the impact on full year net sales would be approximately $14 billion. Now this compares to our guidance in February of approximately $10 billion. Again, assuming exchange rates remain where they are today, the impact on our earnings per share this year would be approximately $0.13 per share compared to our prior guidance of $0.10 per share.
We continue to expect our effective tax rate to range between 32% and 34% for this fiscal year. Our tax rate will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter and may be impacted by a number of factors, including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, valuation allowances, changes in law, outcomes of administrative audits, the impacts of discrete items and the mix of earnings among our U.S. and international operations. And in any given quarter, our effective tax rate could be higher or lower than the full year range. In February, we indicated that we expected our first quarter effective tax rate to be the highest of all 4 quarters this year. However, given the fluctuations that I just mentioned, we were below that initial forecast.
Before we wrap up today's call, I would like to address a few additional items. You're familiar with how we prioritize our capital, and the first is organic growth. In this fiscal year, we added approximately 4.1 million additional square feet of retail space around the world. Additionally, when there are opportunities that can increase our ability to serve customers and add shareholder value, we will invest beyond our capital plan that we shared in October. Our recent announcement in Canada regarding the acquisition and renovation of specific real estate locations from a competitor for approximately $290 million is a great example of such an opportunity.
Our remaining cash flows provide shareholder returns in the form of dividends and share repurchases. It's important to remind you that we remain committed to returning value to our shareholders and we will continue to be opportunistic with share repurchases throughout the year.
Before I close, I would like to reiterate that working capital management remains a very high priority for us. We acknowledge there's more work to do across our business, but our leadership teams are committed to further improvement throughout this year.
With that, thank you for your support of our company. We hope to see all of you at Shareholders this year."

Thank you for joining us to hear more about our second quarter earnings and get an update on how things are progressing relative to our strategy. We just returned from our Walmart U.S. holiday meeting in Denver.",1627,"Thanks, Carol, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us to hear more about our second quarter earnings and get an update on how things are progressing relative to our strategy. We just returned from our Walmart U.S. holiday meeting in Denver. As you may know, we gather all of our store managers and market managers to talk about the plan for the holiday season and take stock of where we are as a business. I can tell you that the feeling in the room was as good as it's been in years. Our stores in the U.S. are getting better, our associates are happier, and our managers are leading it. I talked with our managers about how our company has always changed to serve customers, and we're in another period of change right now. I shared an article from Fortune Magazine that I keep in my office titled, ""Can Walmart get back the magic?"" It's a pretty strong indictment of our future, and the fun fact is that it was written in 1996. Just as it was in 1996, we will win the future of retail if we make the right choices as a business. We have a strong point of view on what that future will look like. Through technology, data and mobile, we have incredible new ways to serve customers today and the opportunities are only growing. We believe that winners in retail will be those who can bring together the best of the off-line world with the best of online to serve customers however they want to shop. And we believe Walmart has unique competitive advantages in this race. We're moving forward in our enterprise strategy to position ourselves to win, playing offense, which is the only way to play in retail. This is true around the world. It's not just a U.S. opportunity. The changes we need to make require investment, and we're pleased with the steps we've taken. We made continued progress towards our plan this quarter. Even if it's not as fast as we'd like, the fundamentals of serving our customers are consistently improving and it's reflected in our comps and revenue growth. Our strategy starts with running great stores and clubs. In Denver, we talked about the choices we're making as a business. As you know, in the first quarter, we initiated a comprehensive multiyear plan to increase starting wages and training for associates in our U.S. stores and clubs. During the second quarter, we implemented the next phase of changes to our Walmart U.S. store structure, including adding department managers. Our focus on running better stores that are clean and well stocked, have friendly associates and an efficient checkout is resonating with customers. They've always counted on Walmart to have great prices, now we're building their trust with better in-stock and delivering an enjoyable shopping experience. As a result, Walmart U.S. delivered its fourth consecutive quarter of positive comp sales as overall net sales grew nearly 5%. Customer traffic was strong again this quarter. Lower gas prices has helped. I continue to be encouraged by the sales momentum that we're seeing, especially in general merchandise, and I'm confident that customers are benefiting from the investments we're making in our stores and associates. Obviously, we'd like to see it ramp higher and faster. We also recognize it won't be a linear path up and to the right but we like the trend line. 
Although we grew top line sales, we did fall short on managing the bottom line. During the quarter, operating expenses were higher than expected and our gross margin was lower than planned. We are not pleased or satisfied. For the back half of the year, we will manage these items closely with a continued commitment to efficiency, cutting costs where appropriate even in a period of investment. 
Similar to the first quarter, Walmart International constant currency sales growth was solid this quarter, with Mexico and Canada delivering strong comps. We're also excited about the opportunities we see in China, despite slower economic growth and currency pressures. Our position is improving, we're gaining market share in the hypermarket category, Sam's Club continues to perform well, and we have great opportunities in e-commerce. 
Brazil and U.K. remain challenging markets but for different reasons. I'm pleased that our U.S. Sam's Club comp sales improved this quarter, and membership income was up close to 6%. Members are recognizing the enhanced value in our Plus memberships, which drove continued growth this quarter, both in club and online. 
Another piece of our plan to win is to build and run great e-commerce. We've made a lot of progress improving our mobile and e-commerce capabilities this year with several important milestones in the second quarter. You'll hear more details from Neil shortly about the investments that we've made in Pangaea, our global technology platform, and the progress on opening our 4 new fulfillment centers in the United States. These investments are designed to give customers the ability to find what they want more easily and get what they want faster while enabling us to fulfill orders in a more cost-effective manner. 
Another important milestone in the quarter was our acquisition of the remaining stake of Yihaodian, our e-commerce business in China. We're extremely excited about the growth potential of Yihaodian and the opportunity it presents over time to deliver for customers in a seamless manner. 
In the second quarter, Walmart's worldwide e-commerce sales grew approximately 16% on a constant currency basis, led by solid results in both of our U.S. businesses, Walmart and Sam's Club. 
The third leg of our strategy is to innovate the future of retail by bringing online and offline together. Here, we can see the pieces starting to come together. In the U.S., the response to our grocery home shopping offering has been strong. I'm particularly pleased with the number of repeat customers we have and the strength of our average ticket. Anecdotally, I can share that customers have told us it's changing their perception of the shopping experience at Walmart. In stores, we've been aggressively pursuing store pickup options, and pick-up, while in a very small base in Walmart terms, is growing very quickly. 
At samsclub.com, we're also seeing stronger sales as members appreciate the convenience of our Club Pickup. We're also focused on leveraging data to bring exciting, member-relevant merchandise to our clubs and online with an eye towards growing our shared members from the higher income household demographic. 
Internationally, one of the encouraging signs we're seeing in the Mexico and Canada is that customers are not only purchasing more in our stores but also driving sales through e-commerce and mobile commerce. In China, we're expanding our omnichannel offerings with the new test of in-store pickup of online orders in a number of our Shenzhen stores. Chinese customers increasingly value the choice of both picking up their online orders in a local store and having it shipped to their homes. And we've started integrating our digital and physical offering for these customers. 
Winning in the future requires change. Change, in this case, requires investment, and investment pressures short-term earnings. Our strategy is decide to create robust and sustainable growth that will deliver returns to shareholders. We obviously want to do that in a short and long-term, and it all starts by winning with customers. The good news is that our short-term investments help build the bridge to the mid-and long-term. In the second quarter, Walmart generated more than $120 billion in revenue and delivered earnings per share of $1.08. I'm encouraged by the improvement in our constant currency sales and recognize that our bottom line results should have been better. We have margin pressure from pharmacy reimbursements and higher shrink than we expected during the quarter. These impacts, coupled with higher wage investments, impacted EPS. 
Walmart U.S. is the driver of our bottom line results. With the headwinds I just mentioned continuing the rest of the year and the level of investments we have, our operating income will continue to be pressured. We have a strong balance sheet, one that allowed us the opportunity to invest significantly in our business and the acquisitions like Yihaodian. 
You'll hear more about on the impact of these investments from Charles when he updates EPS guidance. 
In the short-term, we expect Walmart U.S. comps to accelerate as the service from our associates gains even more traction with our customer experience. When all of our e-commerce fulfillment investments come online, we expect them to lower our distribution cost in the midterm starting in the fourth quarter and having a larger positive impact next year. Over the longer term, we believe we'll continue to grow in key markets around the world and further integrate our store and e-commerce offerings. We know that to deliver for our shareholders in a sustainable way, we must first win with our customers and associates. So I'm confident that these are the right decisions to position Walmart for the future. 
Finally, I want to mention an important moment we'll observe these week. Nearly 10 years ago, our customers and associates on the Gulf Coast were impacted by Hurricane Katrina. Throughout the devastation that the residents of this region faced, the Walmart associates demonstrated extraordinary courage and passion for these communities. I often think how simple acts of kindness can have a dramatic impact. Our people really do make the difference at Walmart, not only for our customers but also for the communities we serve. I look forward to joining our associates and community leaders in New Orleans later this week to look back at this event and to discuss how to get better at disaster resiliency and response. 
Now I will turn it over to Neil. Neil?"

We delivered a lot during the quarter at Walmart U.S., at Sam's Club and in our key markets around the world, all possible because of the groundwork we laid over the last few years. As a quick recap, we've re-platformed both our technology and physical distribution network for e-commerce. The technology platform, Pangaea, is consistently improving the customer experience and conversion for walmart.com, which has led a solid sales growth. We've created a U.S. grocery home shopping business that is getting great reviews from our customers. And we developed e-commerce at Sam's Club and in key markets around the world, notably in Brazil and in China. 
All of this was made possible because we have built a talent-dense Internet technology company inside of Walmart. We're now able to create new experience for customers across digital and physical. Overall, Global eCommerce constant currency sales grew approximately 16%. GMV, or gross merchandise value, grew approximately 18% on a constant currency basis. The highlight was solid growth in the walmart.com and samsclub.com U.S. businesses, while International was soft due to economic challenges in several of our key markets. Because of the softness in International, we are resetting our Global eCommerce sales growth forecast for this fiscal year from the mid 20s to a range in the mid- to high teens. As I mentioned,, both businesses in the U.S. are going very well. A great example of how everything came to life was our walmart.com ""Dare to Compare"" event that we kicked off in July. This event created a perfect opportunity to highlight that customers can trust us to offer them the assortment they want at low prices everyday, not just during a 1-day sale. We were able to use our technology platform and sophisticated pricing algorithms to help us track and deliver lower pricing than competitors. 
Given that we've tripled our assortment in the past 3 years, we have more items for customers to shop. Customers could then choose how to get their purchases in the most convenient way for them. We offer customers the option to get orders shipped to their door or to a store with same-day pickup. In fact, it led to our biggest day of the year so far for same-day pickup. The flexibility of our new platform allowed us to move very quickly, and the new site delivered a better, faster shopping experience to customers. And those customers who were shopping on mobile devices had an improved experience, thanks to the responsive design we rolled out in the quarter. 
We are using e-commerce to bring both new customers to Walmart as well as to deepen our relationship with our existing customers. On the largest day of our ""dare to compare"" event, we saw more than double the number of new customers to walmart.com than a typical day. 
During the second quarter, we had a number of milestones for Walmart U.S. We migrated 100% of customers to the new cart and checkout based on our new technology platform. We delivered responsive design to dynamically adjust the site to whatever device was being used. We started rolling out a significantly enhanced store search capability on mobile. We opened 2 new automated online fulfillment centers, each bigger than 20 football fields, and we have 2 more coming this quarter. These fulfillment centers are strategically located across geographies and will begin to serve our customers this holiday. They will be cornerstones of our fulfillment network going forward. We also started a targeted test of an unlimited free shipping program priced at $50 for 1 year. 
I'm also pleased with the expansion in progress on grocery home shopping in the U.S. We're in 5 markets and sales continued to grow because customers, especially moms with children, love the convenience of ordering online and having their car loaded at a pickup location. 
In addition to expanding pick-up in stores, we are offering customers remote pick up points that are convenient to them, including their corporate campuses. In fact, we launched 1 here at our campus in San Bruno. 
We've also made great progress at Sam's Club, where we  have been tightly aligned with clubs to deliver a better member experience, which has helped deliver high-growth on samsclub.com. Sam's delivered new Club Pickup options to make it easier and more convenient for members to shop online and pick up at the club. Prepaid Club Pickup rolled out across the country and we started testing mobile check-in and drive-through in several clubs. We've also improved the assortment and pricing online. Knowing that members love the Treasure Hunt, we launched Shocking Values on samsclub.com that gives members access to special items at outstanding prices for a very limited time. 
Our enhancements to mobile have also built on our member experience, and we've seen double-digit growth in mobile. 
As I mentioned, earlier, sales in our International markets were softer during the second quarter than we've seen previously. While still growing, grocery home shopping in the U.K. has slowed down, commensurate with the market. As to opened 14 petrol stations during the second quarter and these were enabled with click and collect lockers for both grocery and general merchandise items. 
In Brazil, the overall economic environment is very challenging, but we have continued to take share in this down market. We are growing sales faster than the market and we are continuing to see growth in GMV. Our team has used this opportunity to build a lean and nimble operating model that could succeed in any market condition. 
As Doug mentioned, we acquired the remaining shares of Yihaodian in China. In 2012, we became 51% owners, and we have seen strong growth since that time. Yihaodian now has about 100 million registered customers, more than twice as many as when we first invested. Our primary goal is to continue to accelerate Yihaodian's core e-commerce business and maintain strong local Chinese expertise.  Now that we are the sole owners, we will be expanding our leadership team from within the Yihaodian business, from within Walmart and from the e-commerce industry in China. We will also leverage Walmart's global reach and scale to better benefit Yihaodian, including global sourcing. 
Long Lou, who joined us earlier this year to lead Global eCommerce in Asia, is overseeing Yihaodian. He brings us strong background in developing digital business in China. China is an exciting, dynamic, large and competitive market. We are excited about our long-term opportunity in China. 
We're delivering important e-commerce capabilities around the world. And ultimately, these capabilities are enabling experiences that impact the stores and clubs as well as e-commerce. Customers see us as Walmart and Sam's Club, not a collection of shopping channels. We are delivering experiences on apps and sites and in stores and clubs that come together to differentiate us in the eyes of our customers and members. To remain in leadership position, we must continue to invest in technology and people to deliver the customer and member experiences.

As Doug mentioned, we are encouraged by our top line growth, particularly traffic. Our bottom line came in substantially below what was planned. 3 major factors contributed to our underperformance: A decline in gross margin, primarily due to lower-than-expected pharmacy reimbursements and accelerating pressures in shrink; as well as a higher-than-planned investment in store hours, which was essential to improving the customer experience. 
I want to be straightforward. These issues will present continuing profit challenges for the remainder of the year. We are certainly disappointed, but we are not standing still. We know we can do better, and we will. .
For the Walmart U.S. business, doing better means staying focused on an aggressive strategic plan to improve the customer experience in our stores and deliver sustainable top and bottom line growth for the long term. This strategic plan includes a number of large, specific projects that fit within our broader focus on assortment, price, access and customer experience. This plan requires significant investments, and we are confident we are making the right decisions for our customers and our business. 
Amid the investment, we are focused on growing sales and controlling costs, as you would expect from Walmart. We are staying true to our roots. However, we are committed to improving the customer experience, and we will protect the investments necessary to achieve this goal. 
Let me dig in a bit on details. I'm pleased to report that we're seeing progress on our top line, and as net sales for the second quarter were up 4.8% and comp sales increased 1.5%. We also improved inventory, making our goal to grow inventory less than sales growth. Additionally, we have seen improvements in traffic and customer experience from these actions. Each decision was in line with the strategy we laid out and progress has been steady and consistent. 
Let me share with you some of our accomplishments in the first half of this fiscal year, many of which occurred during the second quarter. First, across all our formats, we're focused on improving the shopping experience for our customers. We've continued our Checkout Promise initiative, ensuring more registers are open during peak shopping hours. We've invested in providing customers with a cleaner, better maintained shopping environment. And we've added approximately 1,708 items, primarily in grocery to warehouse stock, driving faster replenishment times to the stores and ensuring the product is available for our customers. Second, we are investing in our associates. This April, we raised the minimum starting wage in our stores to $9 per hour, resulting in over 500,000 associates receiving a raise. This new wage structure is expanding our applicant pool. We're also introducing 8,000 new department manager positions, a more focused role that allows the associate to be trained and become more knowledgeable with the areas they support, providing our customers with a better experience in the store. Additionally, we are continuing to focus on career development for all our associates. Finally, we've increased the amount an associate will receive upon being promoted into higher levels of responsibility. These changes gave pay raises to an additional 150,000 associates who are critical to improving the in-store experience. 
Alongside wage improvement and to support career development, we're rolling out new training programs designed to help associates grow their careers at Walmart and provide a better experience for our customers. These programs, which will be rolled out this fall,  are hands-on, instructor-led and tailored specifically to a position, ensuring the training is relevant to an associate's current role or to a future role they aspire to achieve. And we're piloting a new scheduling tool that allow associates to select shifts that work best for them, while ensuring the store's staffed appropriately for customer demand. This program is reducing associate absences and turnover in the pilot stores and providing managers with better visibility to coverage gaps.  Lastly, we're investing in operational improvements. In the second quarter, we began an overhaul of our inventory management systems, routines and schedules. The Customer Availability Program, or CAP, will supply decade-old processes with modern technology and new routines that keep associates on the sales floor rather than in the stock room. Processes for truck deliveries at peak times and for stocking shelves have been significantly simplified, freeing more associates to be on the floor during peak customer traffic. We've also began rolling out MC-40 technology to all department managers. This smaller, more intuitive hand-held tool allows us to replace the current devices with one that can provide enhanced technology. This will simplify how our associates work in a way that was not possible before. 
Additionally, this month, store managers are receiving mobile tablets that will help them stay connected to the business while keeping them on the sales floor to help our customers and associates. 
As part of our focus on EDLC, we've reduced supplier marketing funds that have traditionally offset a portion of our advertising expenses as we work towards better product costs. This will translate into lower prices for our customers. As a result of this reduction, we've lowered our second quarter print advertising count from 20 pieces last year to just 4 pieces this year. Moreover, since June, we've been working on amending terms and allowance agreements with our suppliers, driving consistency and simplification across our business. We've also reinstated our shrink training program for our asset protection and store management teams as part of our efforts to improve in this area. And finally, we've reduced feature and modular changes across the store, ensuring there is space for each feature and associate hours to make these changes. Along with this reduction, we've moved some feature and modular decisions back to the stores, allowing them to set features that best align to their local customer needs and preferences. 
Whilst there are numerous initiatives being landed across our business, these are being executed in a coordinated and systematic fashion to allow us to achieve our full potential. 
We're pleased with our progress in the first half of the year, but we recognize that we still have a lot to do to meet our long-term goals, and that it will take time to get where we want to be. I recognize these actions have, and will continue to, pressure our bottom line, but they are already driving meaningful improvements. Over the past year, we have seen growth in store traffic and comp sales. Additionally, our customer satisfaction scores continue to improve. Everyday, a sample of customers in every store rate us across a number of metrics, including providing a fast checkout, friendly service and a clean store environment. Based on the ratings from these surveys, we consider that our stores are making significant improvement from their baseline, and we expect that trend to continue.  Improving the customer experience is fundamental to our success. 
Finally, we're proud of the impact these decisions have had in our associates. Nearly 80% of our 1.2 million U.S. store associates are participated in our annual associate survey administered during this quarter. Our associate's engagement has increased approximately 100 basis points this year after remaining static for the prior 2 years. 
We've remained committed to the strategy we laid out for you earlier this year, ensuring we're making the right decisions to benefit both our customers and our associates and to drive long-term, sustainable growth.  We know we will continue to face considerable challenges, but our goal for the back half of this year is to build on the improvements in top line and customer experience, and our list of things to accomplish is even longer. 
Now let's cover the details on our financial performance for the second quarter. Net sales increased $3.4 billion or 4.8% versus last year. Comparable store sales were up 1.5% and driven by strength in traffic, which increased 1.3%. Traffic was particularly strong on the general merchandise and softlines side of the box. Seasonal categories resonated well with customers, and changes in replenishment strategies ensured product was on the shelves when and where customers needed it. Finally, e-commerce sales contributed approximately 20 basis points to our overall comp. Neil will share the details on our progress on technology infrastructure and fulfillment for walmart.com orders. 
We are pleased that these efforts will position us even more competitively for the back half of the year. 
Our grocery home shopping pilots remain underway in 5 key markets, and we're happy with increased customer counts in these areas. 
All formats delivered positive comp sales growth this quarter, in particular, comps in Neighborhood Markets were up approximately 7.3%. We remain encouraged by the performance of this format. As mentioned, the general merchandise and softlines side of the Supercenter performed well this quarter, driving strong traffic and sales growth through relevant offerings and better in-stock positions. While warm weather, particularly in July, helped propel sales in seasonal categories, our ongoing focus on the basics across Apparel, indoor home and the hardlines drove momentum throughout the quarter. Additionally, while we saw our shift to back-to-school sales in August as several states adjusted the timing of their tax-free weekends, early indications are positive. 
Health & Wellness benefited from continued growth in pharmacy scripts, along with new brands in optical and a focus and better in-stock positions in OTC. And while we saw improved trends in our entertainment business from better in stocks and stronger online sales, comps continue to run negative, pressured by ongoing industry declines and the shift from postpaid to installment wireless plans. 
On the grocery side of the box, consumables had positive comps, driven by a strong base business. New products, particularly in chemicals, drove additional momentum. More notably, continued pressure in food from declining inflation negatively impacted our total box comp by approximately 60 basis points. 
Moving on to the remainder of our financials. Gross profit rate declined 41 basis points this quarter. As I said before, this was driven by a handful of key issues. Let's talk about pharmacy. Reflecting industry-wide trends, we are seeing reduced reimbursement rates from pharmacy benefit managers, which is negatively impacting gross margin. We're also seeing a lower mix of higher margin cash transactions, reflecting a marketplace shift in which more customers are now benefiting from greater drug insurance coverage. While we are taking a number of actions to lessen the impact, we expect to have pressure on pharmacy for the rest of the fiscal year. Additionally, inventory shrinkage was meaningfully higher-than-planned for the quarter. We are reviewing the end-to-end inventory management process with a special focus on shrinkage and working to close gaps. Investments are being made in training programs for store and asset protection associates as well as investments in staffing in height shrink areas of the story. But it will take time to see results, so this will impact us versus planned for the rest of the year. 
Operating expenses deleveraged 50 basis points to last year, primarily due to our higher-than-planned investments in customer experience. These investments included the plan to wage rate increases and structural changes I'd mentioned earlier as well as additional associate hours needed to improve customer service. This quarter, we saw thoughtfully added back hours to specific areas of the store, such as the front-end and stocking positions. This was a strategic decision to invest where we can drive the most benefit for our customers. These adds were significant and more than we had planned, but we felt it was the right decision to meet the goals we have set, and we've started to see the investment translate into better top line performance.  The focus on customer experience, along with ongoing investments in e-commerce and the reduction in gross profit rate, led to an operating income decline of approximately 8.2% versus last year. 
Moving on. In the second quarter, total inventory grew slower than the rate of sales at 2.2%. Comp store inventory declined by 2.4% versus last year. The majority of these improvement came from decisions we made regarding replenishment strategies, whereby we strategically move inventory for certain items upstream from our store backrooms to our distribution centers. Additionally, we continued our focus on clearing our backrooms of excess inventory, improving operational efficiency in the stores. These actions, along with better management of seasonal inventory and reducing modular changes and feature shipments to the stores, allowed us to reduce comp store inventory while improving both in stock levels and sales. Inventory management will continue to be an ongoing focus for us. 
This quarter, we opened 16 supercenters, including relocations and expansions. Additionally, we opened 22 traditional-format Neighborhood Markets, and the final 6 of our smaller-format neighborhood market to test locations. 
As we think about future store openings, we'll continue to focus on quantity versus quantity. Having opened more than 350 Neighborhood Markets in the past 2 years, we have a better understanding of what customers value most, from the choice of location to the size of the box to the product offerings. Based on these learnings, we've decided not to pursue a number of potential locations as they would not provide the type of quality experience customers expect from a Neighborhood Market. We now expect to open a total of 160 to 170 Neighborhood Markets in fiscal 2016, including the 51 locations already opened. Our previous forecast was to open between 180 and 200 Neighborhood Markets. We're still on track to build approximately 60 to 70 Supercenters this year, which was our original forecast. We know that we still have a lot of work to do to achieve the long-term goals we have set for our business. Investments we're making, along with the headwinds we have mentioned, will weigh more heavily on operating income than initially forecasted. 
Amid the pressures, we are thoughtfully evaluating every decision and use of company resources as we go through the back half the year. But we are confident in the direction we are headed. We are seeing improvements everyday from sales and traffic growth to increased customer satisfaction to more engaged associates. 
For the third quarter, we expect our ongoing investments in stores and customer experience to drive further sales momentum, offset partially by continued deflationary pressures in food, especially in meat and dairy. For the 13-week period ending October 30, we anticipate a comp sales increase of approximately 1% to 2%. Last year, our comp sales for the period were up 0.5%. 
Now I'll turn it over to Dave for an update on Walmart International. Dave?"

International business had a fairly solid quarter given tough economic environments in certain markets and ongoing currency impacts. In Q2, we saw accelerating sales growth in Mexico and Canada, offsetting ongoing challenges in the U.K., Bra",1692,"Thanks, Greg. International business had a fairly solid quarter given tough economic environments in certain markets and ongoing currency impacts. In Q2, we saw accelerating sales growth in Mexico and Canada, offsetting ongoing challenges in the U.K., Brazil and China. Overall, I continued to be enthusiastic about our long-term prospects to profitably grow our International business in a controlled and disciplined manner. 
Similar to last quarter, the performance in Mexico and Canada continued to be solid. Our Mexico team has done an excellent job reenergizing that business, driving strong performance across all formats. We continue to see significant growth opportunities in Mexico, along with the improving core business.  In Canada, we continue to gain market share, driven by our fifth consecutive quarter of positive comps. These 2 markets will continue to play a key role in our back half performance. I'll provide more details on key market performance in a few minutes. 
Now let's jump to our overall results. In the second quarter, net sales grew 2.8% on a constant currency basis despite headwinds in Latin America from lapping last year's World Cup and the timing shift of Easter. The U.S. dollar remains strong, which led to a currency impact of $4.2 billion, resulting in a 9.6% sales decline on a reported basis. Comp sales were positive in Mexico and Canada, while the U.K., Brazil and China posted negative comps. All other markets had positive comp sales. 
Operating income declined 1.5% on a constant currency basis, negatively impacted by increased employment claim contingencies and higher-than-expected utility rates in Brazil as well as continued investments in Global eCommerce. This was partially offset by gains from the sale of the bank operations in Mexico and certain properties in Canada. Excluding the impact of these items, operating income would have grown faster than sales. With the currency exchange impact, operating income decreased 14.2%. On a constant currency basis, inventory grew faster than sales at 4.2%, driven primarily by slower sales in the U.K. On a reported basis, inventory declined 10.5%. 
Now let's discuss market results, presented on a constant currency basis for our largest markets. In all countries except Brazil and China, financial results are inclusive of e-commerce. 
Let's start with the U.K. The market remained highly competitive during the second quarter, with significant ongoing vouchering from Asda's competitors. Grocery deflation remained at near record levels as prices decreased 1.7% versus last year for the 12 weeks ended June 21 according to Kantar. The total market declined 0.1%, a reversal from a slight growth in Q1 in part due to the timing of Easter. 
U.K. sales declined 4.1%, and comp sales, excluding fuel, were down 5.2%, driven by declining traffic, especially in fresh food categories. Grocery home shopping sales continue to grow, and we remain focused on driving improvements to our customer metrics. Operating income increased year-over-year, mostly driven by the timing of Easter and margin improvement in nonfood categories from a favorable mixed shift. 
For the rest of the year, we're focused on strengthening the assortment in private label and improving pricing on national brands. We will continue to drive aggressive cost-reduction initiatives supporting our GBP 1 billion 5-year price investment strategy. We're investing to improve store standards and on-shelf availability and to maintain recent improvements in grocery home shopping service metrics. In addition, we launched our new branding and marketing campaign based around adoption of the Walmart Save Money, Live Better mission to help build brand and quality perception. Collectively, these actions are designed to address some of the challenges we face in store traffic and fresh food. 
Let's now discuss Mexico, which released their earnings on July 21. Please note that Walmex release is under IFRS and the results here are under U.S. GAAP, therefore, some numbers may differ. 
Consolidated Walmex net sales increased 7.2% with solid comp sales in both Mexico and Central America. Mexico sales grew 7.4% and comp sales increased 5.4%. We continue to see strong comps across all formats, including Sam's Club, which delivered 4.6% comp growth. Self-service continues to gain share and delivered 190 basis point improvement in market share, according to ANTAD. General merchandise performed very well at 4.9% comp growth despite a tough year-over-year comparison from last year's World Cup. Operating income grew faster than sales. 
The sale of our banking unit in the second quarter, along with the Vips restaurant divestiture last fiscal year, helps us focus on our core business, which is our strength. We are intent on being the most relevant retailer of our customers through excellent price, great assortment and consistent execution. We remain confident that the steps we have in place to improve Walmex are working, and will serve as a catalyst for our business over the long term. 
In Canada, sales grew 5.4% and comps grew 3.9% in a low growth economic environment, driven by strong performance in food, health and wellness, home and toys. We're investing in price and value as we look for opportunities to lower costs in our business. We continued to gain share in our core categories of food, health and wellness and infant categories, as per Nielsen data for the 12 weeks ended July 18. Additionally, our Canadian e-commerce business grew sales at more than 40%, albeit on a small base. In July, we successfully launched our online grocery business, starting with 11 store pickup locations in the Ottawa area. In addition to top line performance, we remain focused on our low cost operating model. Operating income grew significantly faster than sales. 
In the quarter, we finalized the acquisition of 13 stores and 1 distribution center from a former competitor. 7 of the stores are planned to open by the end of this fiscal year and the remainder will open next year. In May, we also closed the sale of a portfolio of properties under development with our shopping center joint venture partner, which generated the previously mentioned gain. Overall, I'm pleased with our results in Canada and expect consistent, profitable growth to continue. 
In Brazil, the country is facing a prolonged recession and the highest inflation rate in 12 years, driven in part by electricity rate increases of more than 50% versus last year, which is driving a cautious approach to consumption. For Walmart Brazil, net sales declined 0.9% and comp sales were down 1%, largely impacted by the World Cup event held during the same period last year and the timing of the Easter holiday. We experienced a decline in the hypermarket format, driven by electronics, but are pleased with the double-digit comp sales increases in the wholesale business. 
Brazil operating income declined for the quarter, driven by the previously mentioned employment claims and rapidly rising utility rates compared to last year. The management team is making progress on the operational, people and legal fronts to address ongoing employment claims as they work through a challenging business environment. In addition, they are focused on key leverage initiatives to increase store productivity and help offset inflationary pressure. 
We continue to make progress on converting stores and distribution centers to standardized systems, which provides better visibility to business results, leverages costs and reduces compliance risk. Last year, we integrated all of our stores in the south region. This year, we're focused on converting the south dry DC network as well as approximately 100 stores in the northeast. Next year, we plan to convert the remaining northeast stores and dry DCs to this unified platform. 
Despite challenging market conditions, the e-commerce business in Brazil continues to perform well. Sales grew double digits and outpaced the Brazilian e-commerce market. Market share rose from 8% to 8.5% in Q2, according to eBit, an e-commerce research firm, with share gains in several categories, including babies, toys and games and auto parts.  Marketplace sales growth was also strong. 
Last, let's discuss China. Walmart China sales grew 1.2% while comp sales declined 1.4%. Walmart increased market share in fast moving consumer goods in the hypermarket channel and maintain share in the modern trade channel, which includes smaller-format stores for the 12 weeks ended June 28 according to Nielsen. 
While there are ongoing market headwinds from slower economic growth, we're confident we will continue to deliver sustainable growth in China. Walmart continues to outperform the market and gain market share in hypermarkets for the 10th quarter in a row. We're focused on driving efficiency, reducing expenses and strengthening our portfolio through We Operate For Less and We Buy for Less initiatives. These actions contributed to operating income growing significantly faster than sales. The team continues to set the foundation for our business, positioning for increased growth and profitability in the future. 
Throughout the quarter, we made significant progress in our omnichannel efforts. Walmart China launched Walmart To Go in 23 stores in Shenzhen, bringing customers the convenience of ordering through the Walmart app and the choice of pick up in store or delivery to their own. We're also testing ways to bring added payment choices and the convenience of mobile payment to our customers in our stores. 
In addition, as Doug and Neil mentioned, we increased our ownership of Yihaodian, our China e-commerce platform, to 100%. We're excited about the opportunities to delivering new experiences to customers in China and further leveraging Yihaodian and Walmart's global and local assets. 
In the second quarter, Yihaodian grew sales double digits, driven by strong growth in orders and continued improvement in conversion rates. Mobile contributed more than 55% of orders. 
As I wrap up the International portion of today's call, I'd like to Express how pleased I am with our associates around the globe and their efforts in driving consistent and solid performance in the first half. We're growing comp sales across the majority of our portfolio and stepping up investments in e-commerce while setting our business up for long-term success. We expect continued economic challenges in the U.K. and Brazil, but also expect continued strong performance in Mexico and Canada. We're optimistic about our growth prospects in China despite a softening economy and we'll continue to invest in that market. Now I'll turn it over to Roz for an update on Sam's. Roz?"
313055,280452627,860434,"Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Q2 2016 Pre Recorded Earnings Call, Aug 18, 2015",2015-08-18,"Earnings Calls","Walmart Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Dave. We were pleased that our investments are contributing to the improvements in Sam's Club. In the second quarter, we grew comp sales without fuel 1.3% and net sales 2.8%. Our square footage also grew due to 3 new clubs opening during the quart",910,"Thanks, Dave. We were pleased that our investments are contributing to the improvements in Sam's Club. In the second quarter, we grew comp sales without fuel 1.3% and net sales 2.8%. Our square footage also grew due to 3 new clubs opening during the quarter. We are accelerating our efforts to strengthen the Sam's Club member value proposition. 
Since last year, our investments have been targeted to better merchandise assortment, membership acquisition, engagement and retention, new programs to enhance member value and our investment in e-commerce. By staying on a consistent path and driving these priorities, we continue to simplify our business. We saw the benefits and improved membership trends in higher traffic during the second quarter. What is most important is the overwhelmingly positive feedback we're hearing from our members, not just about our clubs but also about improvement in the e-commerce experience. I'll provide some examples shortly. 
Now on to the numbers. With fuel, operating income declined by 13.4% to $428 million. Fuel profitability improved from Q1 but is still below planned levels and below last year's dollars. For additional results with fuel, please reference the accompanying presentation. 
Net sales without fuel grew 2.8%. Comp sales without fuel were up 1.3%, with ticket contributing 80 basis points and traffic 50 basis points. Savings member traffic was positive, partially offset by a decline in business member traffic. Our gross profit rate declined 38 basis points versus last year, driven in part by our ongoing Cash Rewards investment, increased seasonal markdowns and industry headwinds in pharmacy prescriptions similar to those referenced in the Walmart U.S. business. 
Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased by 13 basis points due to continued investment in new clubs, technology and e-commerce. Membership in other income grew 6.1% with membership income up 5.8% driven in large part by plus upgrades. As a result of both of these factors, operating income declined 9.7% versus last year. 
We continue to manage our inventory appropriately. Inventory without fuel grew by 3.4% driven in part by new clubs. 
In our merchandising areas, let me start by highlighting 2 of our stronger categories: Home and Apparel and Health & Wellness. Home and Apparel delivered long low-single digit comp sales with strength in Apparel offset by softness in kitchen, electrics, domestics and furniture. Health & Wellness posted mid-single-digit comps, driven by generics and by increased member adoption of our Free/4/10 prescription program. Since the launch of this program last quarter for Plus Members, we see that those who utilize the program transfer, on average, 2/3 of their scripts to Sam's Club. We are optimistic that these trends will continue to drive traffic. 
Our fresh freezer cooler business was softer than expected due to deflation in key dairy commodities such as milk and cheese along with higher costs in areas such as meat. Grocery and beverages delivered low single-digit comps, with dry grocery delivering solid comp sales. The consumables business also delivered low single-digit comps, driven by laundry and tabletop categories. Our technology, entertainment and office businesses, albeit posting negative comps, saw improvement from Q1 levels. We saw acceleration in certain key categories such as tablets. That was offset, in part, by our wireless business, which has been negatively impacted by the industry shift in installment plans. We continue to make progress in e-commerce to build the most convenient club in the industry. We're pleased with our ongoing integration of digital and physical. E-commerce contributed approximately 60 basis points to our club comp performance during the period, and traffic to our site was up just over 20%. We delivered new Club Pickup options that make it easier and more convenient for members to shop online and pick up at the club. 
Prepaid Club Pickup rolled out across the country, and we started testing mobile check-in and drive-through in several clubs. The number of members trying it for the first time during the quarter exceeded our expectations, and we expect ongoing acceptance of this service. We have also improved the assortment and pricing online. Knowing that members love the treasure hunt, we launched Shocking Values that gives members access to special items at outstanding prices for very limited times. Shocking Values products are carefully chosen based on members interest, top trends and items from the company's most popular shopping categories. In addition, our enhancements to mobile have also built on our member experience and drove double-digit growth in traffic. 
Membership income was up versus last year, with growth driven by social media campaigns as well as strong Plus renewals and upgrades due to the benefits of Cash Rewards. We also continue to emphasize our award-winning Sam's Club 5-3-1 MasterCard, which allows members to save inside and outside the club. We've received very positive feedback from our members on this program. 
We've recently hosted our Annual Supplier Summit here in Bentonville, and we were pleased with the excellent attendance and engagement. Our suppliers are very interested in the work we've done to ensure their great items are getting in front of our member base. They are supportive of the innovation and merchandising transformation we have in place. we have great items coming for the holidays. We are focused on further progress in the Sam's Club business for the back half of the year. For the 13-week period ending October 30, 2015, we expect comp sales without fuel to be between flat end up 2%. 
Now I'll turn things over to Charles. Charles?"
313055,280452627,860434,"Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Q2 2016 Pre Recorded Earnings Call, Aug 18, 2015",2015-08-18,"Earnings Calls","Walmart Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Roz. I'll start with the top line. We're pleased with the sales increases we saw in the U.S. as well as in our International businesses when considering constant currency. We believe traffic and comp sales increases for Walmart U.S. show we are on",1032,"Thanks, Roz. I'll start with the top line. We're pleased with the sales increases we saw in the U.S. as well as in our International businesses when considering constant currency. We believe traffic and comp sales increases for Walmart U.S. show we are on the right track with our investments. Walmart U.S. now has had positive comps for 4 straight quarters. As expected, these investments impacted both operating expenses and profits. In addition, Walmart U.S. experienced gross margin pressure from pharmacy and shrink that we had not expected. 
Looking forward at the rest of the year, operating profit will be pressured more than we originally planned. This is primarily driven by the headwinds to Walmart U.S. gross margins that I'd just mentioned. We will continue to scrutinize and evaluate how we manage our capital in order to optimize both the customer experience and returns. 
Before I turn to guidance, let me cover some other items. You may have read in our earnings release that we are reviewing leases across all of our segments. This is part of a comprehensive ongoing lease review. One item that we are focusing on and may need to be corrected relates to leases where our payment of certain structural component costs during a lesser construction of the lease store causes us to be named the owner of the property for accounting purposes. This results in us capitalizing these leased assets on our balance sheet. We don't know the impact to our financial statements, but believe it mostly to be a balance sheet issue at this time. We will provide more information once the review is complete. 
Turning to cash. During the quarter, we spent approximately $760 million to acquire the remaining shares of Yihaodian, a strategic acquisition for e-commerce growth in China. In addition, we continued to provide shareholder returns in the form of dividends and share repurchases. And in the second quarter, we paid approximately $1.6 billion in dividends and repurchased approximately $1 billion of shares. This represents our largest share repurchase activity in the last 4 quarters. As always, we will remain opportunistic with share repurchase throughout the year. As of the end of the second quarter, we had approximately $9 billion remaining under our current $15 billion authorization. 
Membership in other income increased 13.9% to $899 million. Other income primarily benefited from the gain on the sale of the bank operations in Mexico. FCPA- and compliance-related costs were approximately $30 million, comprised of approximately $23 million for the ongoing inquiries and investigations at approximately $7 million for our global compliance program and organizational enhancements. 
Last year, FCPA- and compliance-related costs were $43 million in the second quarter. We expect FCPA-related expenses to continue to trend down, so we now expect our full year FCPA-related expenses to range between $130 million and $150 million. This compares to our guidance in February of $160 million to $180 million. 
Return on investment for the trailing 12 months ended July 31, 2015, were 16.2%, which compares to 16.7% last year. The decline in ROI has primarily been due to continued capital investments as well as our decrease in operating income. 
Earlier, Greg mentioned that as part of our commitment to EDLC, we are working on amending terms and allowance agreements with our Walmart U.S. suppliers to drive simplicity and consistency across our business. We began this effort in June and discussions will continue over the coming months. 
On a constant currency basis, inventory grew slower than sales. While we are pleased with the progress in managing our inventories, working capital is still an opportunity for us to generate stronger free cash flow.
Now let's turn our attention to guidance. In February, we indicated that we expected our full year fiscal 2016 earnings per share to range between $4.70 and $5.05. Today, we expect our fiscal 2016 earnings per share to range between $4.40 and $4.70, including a range of $0.93 and $1.05 for the third quarter. 
These new range includes the following updated assumptions: First, the impact from our investments and wages, training and additional hours in our stores will be approximately $0.24, including approximately $0.08 in the third quarter. Through the first half of this year, we have incurred approximately $0.10 of the expected full year impact. This compares to our original guidance in February of approximately $0.20. As you heard from Greg earlier, our decision to increase associate hours beyond our February plan to areas of the stores such as front end and stocking positions are intended to drive the most benefit for our customers. 
Next, the incremental investment and Global eCommerce will range between $0.06 and $0.09. This is unchanged from our guidance in February. In the third quarter, we expect the impact to be approximately $0.02. Through the first half of this year, we have incurred approximately $0.04 of the expected full year impact. 
Third, we expect full year impact of approximately $0.11, including approximately $0.03 in the third quarter from the unplanned headwinds that I'd discussed earlier. The headwinds are primarily in Walmart U.S. pharmacy margins as well as higher-than-expected shrink continuing through this fiscal year. Assuming currency exchange rates remain at current levels for the remainder of the year, we now expect the full year impact to be approximately $0.15, up $0.02 from last quarter's revised guidance of $0.13.  Our effective tax rate is expected to range between 32% and 34%, unchanged from our guidance in February.  Now as a reminder, our tax rate will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter and may be impacted by a number of factors, including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, valuation allowances, changes in law, outcomes of administrative audits, the impacts of discrete items and the mix of earnings among our U.S. and International operations. And in any given quarter, our effective tax rate could be higher or lower than the full year. 
We will host our Annual Investment Meeting in New York on October 14. As we have in prior annual investment community meetings, we will provide an update of our capital plans at that time. We look forward to seeing you there. Thank you for your interest in Walmart, and have a great day."

Thank you for joining us to hear more about our second quarter earnings and get an update on how things are progressing relative to our strategy. We just returned from our Walmart U.S. holiday meeting in Denver.",1628,"Thanks, Carol, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us to hear more about our second quarter earnings and get an update on how things are progressing relative to our strategy. We just returned from our Walmart U.S. holiday meeting in Denver. As you may know, we gather all of our store managers and market managers to talk about the plan for the holiday season and take stock of where we are as a business. I can tell you that the feeling in the room was as good as it's been in years. Our stores in the U.S. are getting better, our associates are happier, and our managers are leading it. I talked with our managers about how our company has always changed to serve customers, and we're in another period of change right now. 
I shared an article from Fortune Magazine that I keep in my office titled, ""Can Walmart get back the magic?"" It's a pretty strong indictment of our future, and the fun fact is that it was written in 1996. Just as it was in 1996, we will win the future of retail if we make the right choices as a business. We have a strong point of view on what that future will look like. Through technology, data and mobile, we have incredible new ways to serve customers today and the opportunities are only growing. We believe that winners in retail will be those who can bring together the best of the offline world with the best of online to serve customers however they want to shop. And we believe Walmart has unique competitive advantages in this race. 
We're moving forward on our enterprise strategy to position ourselves to win, playing offense, which is the only way to play in retail. This is true around the world. It's not just a U.S. opportunity. The changes we need to make require investment, and we're pleased with the steps we've taken. We made continued progress towards our plan this quarter. Even if it's not as fast as we'd like, the fundamentals of serving our customers are consistently improving, and it's reflected in our comps and revenue growth. 
Our strategy starts with running great stores and clubs. In Denver, we talked about the choices we're making as a business. As you know, in the first quarter, we initiated a comprehensive multiyear plan to increase starting wages and training for associates in our U.S. stores and clubs. During the second quarter, we implemented the next phase of changes to our Walmart U.S. store structure, including adding department managers. Our focus on running better stores that are clean and well stocked, have friendly associates and an efficient checkout is resonating with customers. They've always counted on Walmart to have great prices. Now we're building their trust with better in-stock and delivering an enjoyable shopping experience. 
As a result, Walmart U.S. delivered its fourth consecutive quarter of positive comp sales as overall net sales grew nearly 5%. Customer traffic was strong again this quarter. Lower gas prices helped. I continue to be encouraged by the sales momentum that we're seeing, especially in general merchandise, and I'm confident that customers are benefiting from the investments we're making in our stores and associates. Obviously, we'd like to see it ramp higher and faster. We also recognize it won't be a linear path up into the right but we like the trend line.
Although we grew top line sales, we did fall short on managing the bottom line. During the quarter, operating expenses were higher than expected, and our gross margin was lower than planned. We are not pleased or satisfied. For the back half of the year, we will manage these items closely with a continued commitment to efficiency, cutting costs where appropriate even in a period of investment. 
Similar to the first quarter, Walmart International constant currency sales growth was solid this quarter, with Mexico and Canada delivering strong comps. We're also excited about the opportunities we see in China, despite slower economic growth and currency pressures. Our position is improving. We're gaining market share in the hypermarket category. Sam's Club continues to perform well, and we have great opportunities in e-commerce. 
Brazil and U.K. remain challenging markets but for different reasons. I'm pleased that our U.S. Sam's Club comp sales improved this quarter, and membership income was up close to 6%. Members are recognizing the enhanced value in our Plus memberships, which drove continued growth this quarter, both in club and online. 
Another piece of our plan to win is to build and run great e-commerce. We've made a lot of progress improving our mobile and e-commerce capabilities this year with several important milestones in the second quarter. You'll hear more details from Neil shortly about the investments that we've made in Pangaea, our global technology platform, and the progress on opening our 4 new fulfillment centers in the United States. These investments are designed to give customers the ability to find what they want more easily and get what they want faster while enabling us to fulfill orders in a more cost-effective manner. 
Another important milestone in the quarter was our acquisition of the remaining stake of Yihaodian, our e-commerce business in China. We're extremely excited about the growth potential of Yihaodian and the opportunity it presents over time to deliver for customers in a seamless manner. 
In the second quarter, Walmart's worldwide e-commerce sales grew approximately 16% on a constant currency basis, led by solid results in both of our U.S. businesses, Walmart and Sam's Club. 
The third leg of our strategy is to innovate the future of retail by bringing online and offline together. Here, we can see the pieces starting to come together. In the U.S., the response to our grocery home shopping offering has been strong. I'm particularly pleased with the number of repeat customers we have and the strength of our average ticket. Anecdotally, I can share that customers have told us it's changing their perception of the shopping experience at Walmart. In stores, we've been aggressively pursuing store pick-up options. And Pickup, while on a very small base in Walmart terms, is growing very quickly. 
At samsclub.com, we're also seeing stronger sales as members appreciate the convenience of our Club Pickup. We're also focused on leveraging data to bring exciting, member-relevant merchandise to our clubs and online with an eye towards growing our share of members from the higher income household demographic. 
Internationally, one of the encouraging signs we're seeing in the Mexico and Canada is that customers are not only purchasing more in our stores but also driving sales through e-commerce and mobile commerce. In China, we're expanding our omnichannel offerings with the new test of in-store pickup of online orders in a number of our Shenzhen stores. Chinese customers increasingly value the choice of both picking up their online orders in a local store and having it shipped to their homes. And we've started integrating our digital and physical offering for these customers. 
Winning in the future requires change. Change, in this case, requires investment, and investment pressures short-term earnings. Our strategy is designed to create robust and sustainable growth that will deliver returns to shareholders. We obviously want to do that in a short and long term, and it all starts by winning with customers. The good news is that our short-term investments help build the bridge to the mid and long-term. 
In the second quarter, Walmart generated more than $120 billion in revenue and delivered earnings per share of $1.08. I'm encouraged by the improvement in our constant currency sales and recognize that our bottom line results should have been better. We have margin pressure from pharmacy reimbursements and higher shrink than we expected during the quarter. These impacts, coupled with higher wage investments, impacted EPS. 
Walmart U.S. is the driver of our bottom line results. With the headwinds I just mentioned continuing the rest of the year and the level of investments we have, our operating income will continue to be pressured. We have a strong balance sheet, one that allowed us the opportunity to invest significantly in our business and the acquisitions like Yihaodian. You'll hear more about on the impact of these investments from Charles when he updates EPS guidance. 
In the short term, we expect Walmart U.S. comps to accelerate as the service from our associates gains even more traction with our customer experience. When all of our e-commerce fulfillment investments come online, we expect them to lower our distribution costs in the midterm, starting in the fourth quarter and having a larger positive impact next year. Over the longer term, we believe we'll continue to grow in key markets around the world and further integrate our store and e-commerce offerings. We know that to deliver for our shareholders in a sustainable way, we must first win with our customers and associates. So I'm confident that these are the right decisions to position Walmart for the future. 
Finally, I want to mention an important moment we'll observe these week. Nearly 10 years ago, our customers and associates on the Gulf Coast were impacted by Hurricane Katrina. Throughout the devastation that the residents of this region faced, Walmart associates demonstrated extraordinary courage and passion for these communities. I often think how simple acts of kindness can have a dramatic impact. Our people really do make the difference at Walmart, not only for our customers, but also for the communities we serve. I look forward to joining our associates and community leaders in New Orleans later this week to look back at this event and to discuss how to get better at disaster resiliency and response. 
Now I will turn it over to Neil. Neil?"

We delivered a lot during the quarter at Walmart U.S., at Sam's Club and in our key markets around the world, all possible because of the groundwork we laid over the last few years. As a quick recap, we've re-platformed both our technology and physical distribution network for e-commerce. 
The technology platform, Pangaea, is consistently improving the customer experience and conversion for walmart.com, which has led a solid sales growth. We've created a U.S. grocery home shopping business that is getting great reviews from our customers. And we developed e-commerce at Sam's Club and in key markets around the world, notably in Brazil and in China. 
All of this was made possible because we have built a talent-dense Internet technology company inside of Walmart. We're now able to create new experiences for customers across digital and physical. Overall, Global eCommerce constant currency sales grew approximately 16%. GMV, or gross merchandise value, grew approximately 18% on a constant currency basis. The highlight was solid growth in the walmart.com and samsclub.com U.S. businesses while International was soft due to economic challenges in several of our key markets. Because of the softness in International, we are resetting our Global eCommerce sales growth forecast for this fiscal year from the mid 20s to a range in the mid to high teens. 
As I mentioned,, both businesses in the U.S. are going very well. A great example of how everything came to life was our walmart.com Dare To Compare event that we kicked off in July. This event created a perfect opportunity to highlight that customers can trust us to offer them the assortment they want at low prices everyday, not just during a 1-day sale. We were able to use our technology platform and sophisticated pricing algorithms to help us track and deliver lower pricing than competitors. 
Given that we've tripled our assortment in the past 3 years, we have more items for customers to shop. Customers could then choose how to get their purchases in the most convenient way for them. We offer customers the option to get orders shipped to their door or to a store with same-day pickup. In fact, it led to our biggest day of the year so far for same-day pickup. The flexibility of our new platform allowed us to move very quickly, and the new site delivered a better, faster shopping experience to customers. And those customers who were shopping on mobile devices had an improved experience, thanks to the responsive design we rolled out in the quarter. 
We are using e-commerce to bring both new customers to Walmart as well as to deepen our relationship with our existing customers. On the largest day of our Dare To Compare event, we saw more than double the number of new customers to walmart.com than a typical day. 
During the second quarter, we had a number of milestones for Walmart U.S. We migrated 100% of customers to the new cart and checkout based on our new technology platform. We delivered responsive design to dynamically adjust the site to whatever device was being used. We started rolling out a significantly enhanced store search capability on mobile. We opened 2 new automated online fulfillment centers, each bigger than 20 football fields, and we have 2 more coming this quarter. These fulfillment centers are strategically located across geographies and will begin to serve our customers this holiday. They will be cornerstones of our fulfillment network going forward. We also started a targeted test of an unlimited free shipping program priced at $50 for 1 year. 
I'm also pleased with the expansion in progress on grocery home shopping in the U.S. We're in 5 markets and sales continued to grow because customers, especially moms with children, love the convenience of ordering online and having their car loaded at a pickup location. 
In addition to expanding pick-up in stores, we are offering customers remote pick up points that are convenient to them, including their corporate campuses. In fact, we launched 1 here at our campus in San Bruno. 
We have also made great progress at Sam's Club, where we  have been tightly aligned with clubs to deliver a better member experience, which has helped deliver high growth on samsclub.com. Sam's delivered new Club Pickup options to make it easier and more convenient for members to shop online and pick up at the club. Prepaid Club Pickup rolled out across the country, and we started testing mobile check-in and drive-through in several clubs. We have also improved the assortment and pricing online. Knowing that members love the treasure hunt, we launched Shocking Values on samsclub.com that gives members access to special items at outstanding prices for a very limited time. 
Our enhancements to mobile have also built on our member experience, and we've seen double-digit growth in mobile. 
As I mentioned earlier, sales in our international markets were softer during the second quarter than we've seen previously. While still growing, grocery home shopping in the U.K. has slowed down, commensurate with the market. Asda opened 14 petrol stations during the second quarter, and these were enabled with click-and-collect lockers for both grocery and general merchandise items. 
In Brazil, the overall economic environment is very challenging, but we have continued to take share in this down market. We are growing sales faster than the market and we are continuing to see growth in GMV. Our team has used this opportunity to build a lean and nimble operating model that can succeed in any market condition. 
As Doug mentioned, we acquired the remaining shares of Yihaodian in China. In 2012, we became 51% owners, and we have seen strong growth since that time. Yihaodian now has about 100 million registered customers, more than twice as many as when we first invested. Our primary goal is to continue to accelerate Yihaodian's core e-commerce business and maintain strong local Chinese expertise. Now that we are the sole owners, we will be expanding our leadership team from within the Yihaodian business, from within Walmart and from the e-commerce industry in China. We will also leverage Walmart's global reach and scale to better benefit Yihaodian, including global sourcing. 
Wang Lu, who joined us earlier this year to lead Global eCommerce in Asia, is overseeing Yihaodian. He brings a strong background in developing digital businesses in China. China is an exciting, dynamic, large and competitive market. We are excited about our long-term opportunity in China. 
We're delivering important e-commerce capabilities around the world. And ultimately, these capabilities are enabling experiences that impact the stores and clubs as well as e-commerce. Customers see us as Walmart and Sam's Club, not a collection of shopping channels. We are delivering experiences on apps and sites and in stores and clubs that come together to differentiate us in the eyes of our customers and members. To remain in leadership position, we must continue to invest in technology and people to deliver the customer and member experiences.

Our bottom line came in substantially below what was planned.  Three major factors contributed to our underperformance: a decline in gross margin, primarily related to lower-than-expected pharmacy reimbursements and accelerating pressures in shrink; as well as a higher-than-planned investment in store hours, which was essential to improving the customer experience. 
I want to be straightforward. These issues will present continuing profit challenges for the remainder of the year. We are certainly disappointed, but we are not standing still. We know we can do better and we will.
For the Walmart U.S. business, doing better means staying focused on an aggressive strategic plan to improve the customer experience in our stores and deliver sustainable top and bottom line growth for the long term. This strategic plan includes a number of large, specific projects that fit within our broader focus on assortment, price, access and customer experience. This plan requires significant investments, and we are confident we are making the right decisions for our customers and our business. 
Amid the investment, we are focused on growing sales and controlling costs, as you would expect from Walmart. We are staying true to our roots. However, we are committed to improving the customer experience, and we will protect the investments necessary to achieve this goal. 
Let me dig in a bit on details. I'm pleased to report that we're seeing progress on our top line, as net sales for the second quarter were up 4.8% and comp sales increased 1.5%. We also improved inventory, making our goal to grow inventory less than sales growth. Additionally, we have seen improvements in traffic and customer experience from these actions. Each decision was in line with the strategy we laid out and progress has been steady and consistent. 
Let me share with you some of our accomplishments in the first half of this fiscal year, many of which occurred during the second quarter. First, across all our formats, we're focused on improving the shopping experience for our customers. We've continued our Checkout Promise initiative, ensuring more registers are open during peak shopping hours. We've invested in providing customers with a cleaner, better-maintained shopping environment. And we've added approximately 1,700 items, primarily in grocery, to warehouse stock, driving faster replenishment times to the stores and ensuring the product is available for our customers. 
Second, we are investing in our associates. This April, we raised the minimum starting wage in our stores to $9 per hour, resulting in over 500,000 associates receiving a raise. This new wage structure is expanding our applicant pool. We're also introducing 8,000 new department manager positions, a more focused role that allows the associate to be trained and become more knowledgeable with the areas they support, providing our customers with a better experience in the store. Additionally, we are continuing to focus on career development for all our associates. 
Finally, we've increased the amount an associate will receive upon being promoted into higher levels of responsibility. These changes gave pay raises to an additional 150,000 associates who are critical to improving the in-store experience. 
Alongside wage improvement and to support career development, we're rolling out new training programs designed to help associates grow their careers at Walmart and provide a better experience for our customers. These programs, which will be rolled out this fall,  are hands-on, instructor-led and tailored specifically to a position, ensuring the training is relevant to an associate's current role or to a future role they aspire to achieve. And we're piloting new scheduling tools that allow associates to select shifts that work best for them while ensuring the store's staffed appropriately for customer demand. This program is reducing associate absences and turnover in the pilot stores and providing managers with better visibility to coverage gaps.  
Lastly, we're investing in operational improvements. In the second quarter, we began an overhaul of our inventory management systems, routines and schedules. The Customer Availability Program, or CAP, will supply decade-old processes with modern technology and new routines that keep associates on the sales floor rather than in the stock room. Processes for truck deliveries at peak times and for stocking shelves have been significantly simplified, freeing more associates to be on the floor during peak customer traffic. We've also began rolling out MC 40 technology to all department managers. This smaller, more intuitive hand-held tool allows us to replace the current devices with one that can provide enhanced technology. This will simplify how our associates work in a way that was not possible before. Additionally, this month, store managers are receiving mobile tablets that will help them stay connected to the business while keeping them on the sales floor to help our customers and associates. 
As part of our focus on EDLC, we've reduced supplier marketing funds that have traditionally offset a portion of our advertising expenses as we work towards better product costs. This will translate into lower prices for our customers. As a result of this reduction, we've lowered our second quarter print advertising count from 20 pieces last year to just 4 pieces this year. Moreover, since June, we've been working on amending terms and allowance agreements with our suppliers, driving consistency and simplification across our business. We've also reinstated our shrink training program for our asset protection and store management teams as part of our efforts to improve in this area. 
And finally, we've reduced feature and modular changes across the store, ensuring there is space for each feature and associate hours to make these changes. Along with this reduction, we've moved some feature and modular decisions back to the stores, allowing them to set features that best align to their local customer needs and preferences. Whilst there are numerous initiatives being landed across our business, these are being executed in a coordinated and systematic fashion to allow us to achieve our full potential. 
We're pleased with our progress in the first half of the year, but we recognize that we still have a lot to do to meet our long-term goals, and that it will take time to get where we want to be. I recognize these actions have, and will continue to, pressure our bottom line, but they are already driving meaningful improvements. Over the past year, we have seen growth in store traffic and comp sales. Additionally, our customer satisfaction scores continue to improve. Everyday, a sample of customers in every store rate us across a number of metrics, including providing a fast checkout, friendly service and a clean store environment. Based on the ratings from these surveys, we can see that our stores are making significant improvement from their baseline, and we expect that trend to continue. Improving the customer experience is fundamental to our success. 
Finally, we're proud of the impact these decisions have had on our associates. Nearly 80% of our 1.2 million U.S. store associates participated in our annual associate survey administered during this quarter. Our associate's engagement has increased approximately 100 basis points this year after remaining static for the prior 2 years. 
We've remained committed to the strategy we laid out for you earlier this year, ensuring we're making the right decisions to benefit both our customers and our associates and to drive long-term sustainable growth.  We know we will continue to face considerable challenges, but our goal for the back half of this year is to build on the improvements in top line and customer experience, and our list of things to accomplish is even longer. 
Now let's cover the details on our financial performance for the second quarter. Net sales increased $3.4 billion or 4.8% versus last year. Comparable store sales were up 1.5% and driven by strength in traffic, which increased 1.3%. Traffic was particularly strong on the general merchandise and softlines side of the box. Seasonal categories resonated well with customers, and changes in replenishment strategies ensured product was on the shelves when and where customers needed it. Finally, e-commerce sales contributed approximately 20 basis points to our overall comp. Neil will share the details on our progress on technology infrastructure and fulfillment for walmart.com orders. We are pleased that these efforts will position us even more competitively for the back half of the year. 
Our grocery home shopping pilots remain underway in 5 key markets, and we're happy with increased customer counts in these areas. 
All formats delivered positive comp sales growth this quarter, in particular, comps in Neighborhood Markets were up approximately 7.3%. We remain encouraged by the performance of this format. As mentioned, the general merchandise and softlines side of the supercenter performed well this quarter, driving strong traffic and sales growth through relevant offerings and better in-stock positions. While warm weather, particularly in July, helped propel sales in seasonal categories, our ongoing focus on the basics across apparel, indoor home and the hardlines drove momentum throughout the quarter. Additionally, while we saw our shift to back-to-school sales into August as several states adjusted the timing of their tax-free weekends, early indications are positive. 
Health and wellness benefited from continued growth in pharmacy scripts, along with new brands in optical and a focus on better in-stock positions in OTC. 
And while we saw improved trends in our entertainment business from better in-stocks and stronger online sales, comps continue to run negative, pressured by ongoing industry declines and the shift from postpaid to installment wireless plans. 
On the grocery side of the box, consumables had positive comps, driven by a strong base business. New products, particularly in chemicals, drove additional momentum. More notably, continued pressure in food from declining inflation negatively impacted our total box comp by approximately 60 basis points. 
Moving on to the remainder of our financials. Gross profit rate declined 41 basis points this quarter. As I said before, this was driven by a handful of key issues. 
Let's talk about pharmacy. Reflecting industry-wide trends, we are seeing reduced reimbursement rates from pharmacy benefit managers, which is negatively impacting gross margin. We are also seeing a lower mix of higher margin cash transactions, reflecting a marketplace shift in which more customers are now benefiting from greater drug insurance coverage. While we are taking a number of actions to lessen the impact, we expect to have pressure on pharmacy for the rest of the fiscal year. Additionally, inventory shrinkage was meaningfully higher-than-planned for the quarter. We are reviewing the end-to-end inventory management process, with a special focus on shrinkage and working to close gaps. Investments are being made in training programs for store and asset protection associates as well as investments in staffing in high shrink areas of the store. But it will take time to see results, so this will impact us versus planned for the rest of the year. 
Operating expenses deleveraged 50 basis points to last year, primarily due to our higher-than-planned investments in customer experience. These investments included the planned wage rate increases and structural changes I mentioned earlier as well as additional associate hours needed to improve customer service. This quarter, we thoughtfully added back hours to specific areas of the store, such as the front-end and stocking positions. This was a strategic decision to invest where we can drive the most benefit for our customers. These adds were significant and more than we had planned, but we felt it was the right decision to meet the goals we have set, and we've started to see the investment translate into better top line performance. The focus on customer experience, along with ongoing investments in e-commerce and the reduction in gross profit rate, led to an operating income decline of approximately 8.2% versus last year. 
Moving on. In the second quarter, total inventory grew slower than the rate of sales at 2.2%. Comp store inventory declined by 2.4% versus last year. The majority of these improvement came from decisions we made regarding replenishment strategies, whereby we strategically move inventory for certain items upstream from our store backrooms to our distribution centers. Additionally, we continued our focus on clearing our backrooms of excess inventory, improving operational efficiency in the stores. These actions, along with better management of seasonal inventory and reducing modular changes and feature shipments to the stores, allowed us to reduce comp store inventory while improving both in-stock levels and sales. Inventory management will continue to be an ongoing focus for us. 
This quarter, we opened 16 supercenters, including relocations and expansions. Additionally, we opened 22 traditional-format Neighborhood Markets, and the final 6 of our smaller-format Neighborhood Market test locations. 
As we think about future store openings, we'll continue to focus on quality versus quantity. Having opened more than 350 Neighborhood Markets in the past 2 years, we have a better understanding of what customers value most, from the choice of location to the size of the box to the product offerings. Based on these learnings, we've decided not to pursue a number of potential locations as they would not provide the type of quality experience customers expect from a Neighborhood Market. We now expect to open a total of 160 to 170 Neighborhood Markets in fiscal 2016, including the 51 locations already opened. Our previous forecast was to open between 180 and 200 Neighborhood Markets. We're still on track to build approximately 60 to 70 supercenters this year, which was our original forecast. We know that we still have a lot of work to do to achieve the long-term goals we have set our business. The investments we are making, along with the headwinds we've mentioned, will weigh more heavily on operating income than initially forecasted. 
Amid the pressures, we are thoughtfully evaluating every decision and use of company resources as we go through the back half the year. But we are confident in the direction we are headed. We are seeing improvements everyday from sales and traffic growth to increased customer satisfaction to more engaged associates. 
For the third quarter, we expect our ongoing investments in stores and customer experience to drive further sales momentum, offset partially by continued deflationary pressures in food, especially in meat and dairy. For the 13-week period ending October 30, we anticipate a comp sales increase of approximately 1% to 2%. Last year, our comp sales for the period were up 0.5%. 
Now I'll turn it over to Dave for an update on Walmart International. Dave?"

The international business had a fairly solid quarter given tough economic environments in certain markets and ongoing currency impacts. In Q2, we saw accelerating sales growth in Mexico and Canada, offsetting ongoing challenges in the U.K., Brazil and China. Overall, I continue to be enthusiastic about our long-term prospects to profitably grow our international business in a controlled and disciplined manner. 
Similar to last quarter, the performance in Mexico and Canada continued to be solid. Our Mexico team has done an excellent job reenergizing that business, driving strong performance across all formats. We continue to see significant growth opportunities in Mexico, along with the improving core business. In Canada, we continue to gain market share, driven by our fifth consecutive quarter of positive comps. These 2 markets will continue to play a key role in our back-half performance. I'll provide more details on key market performance in a few minutes. 
Now let's jump to our overall results. In the second quarter, net sales grew 2.8% on a constant currency basis despite headwinds in Latin America from lapping last year's World Cup and the timing shift of Easter. The U.S. dollar remains strong, which led to a currency impact of $4.2 billion, resulting in a 9.6% sales decline on a reported basis. Comp sales were positive in Mexico and Canada while the U.K., Brazil and China posted negative comps. All other markets had positive comp sales. 
Operating income declined 1.5% on a constant currency basis, negatively impacted by increased employment claim contingencies and higher-than-expected utility rates in Brazil as well as continued investments in Global eCommerce. This was partially offset by gains from the sale of the bank operations in Mexico and certain properties in Canada. Excluding the impact of these items, operating income would have grown faster than sales. With the currency exchange impact, operating income decreased 14.2%. On a constant-currency basis, inventory grew faster than sales at 4.2%, driven primarily by slower sales in the U.K. On a reported basis, inventory declined 10.5%. 
Now let's discuss market results, presented on a-constant currency basis for our largest markets. In all countries except Brazil and China, financial results are inclusive of e-commerce. 
Let's start with the U.K. The market remained highly competitive during the second quarter, with significant ongoing vouchering from Asda's competitors. Grocery deflation remained at near record levels as prices decreased 1.7% versus last year for the 12 weeks ended June 21 according to Kantar. The total market declined 0.1%, a reversal from a slight growth in Q1 in part due to the timing of Easter. 
U.K. sales declined 4.1%, and comp sales, excluding fuel, were down 5.2%, driven by declining traffic, especially in fresh food categories. Grocery home shopping sales continue to grow, and we remain focused on driving improvements to our customer metrics. Operating income increased year-over-year, mostly driven by the timing of Easter and margin improvement in nonfood categories from a favorable mix shift. 
For the rest of the year, we're focused on strengthening the assortment in private label and improving pricing on national brands. We will continue to drive aggressive cost-reduction initiatives supporting our GBP 1 billion 5-year price investment strategy. We're investing to improve store standards and on-shelf availability and to maintain recent improvements in grocery home shopping service metrics. In addition, we launched our new branding and marketing campaign based around adoption of the Walmart Save Money. Live Better mission to help build brand and quality perception. Collectively, these actions are designed to address some of the challenges we face in store traffic and fresh food. 
Let's now discuss Mexico, which released their earnings on July 21. Please note that Walmex release is under IFRS and the results here are under U.S. GAAP, therefore, some numbers may differ. 
Consolidated Walmex net sales increased 7.2%, with solid comp sales in both Mexico and Central America. Mexico sales grew 7.4% and comp sales increased 5.4%. We continue to see strong comps across all formats, including Sam's Club, which delivered 4.6% comp growth. Self-service continues to gain share and delivered 190 basis point improvement in market share, according to ANTAD. General merchandise performed very well at 4.9% comp growth despite a tough year-over-year comparison from last year's World Cup. Operating income grew faster than sales. 
The sale of our banking unit in the second quarter, along with the Vips restaurant divestiture last fiscal year, helps us focus on our core business, which is our strength. We are intent on being the most relevant retailer of our customers through excellent price, great assortment and consistent execution. We remain confident that the steps we have in place to improve Walmex are working and will serve as a catalyst for our business over the long term. 
In Canada, sales grew 5.4% and comps grew 3.9% in a low-growth economic environment, driven by strong performance in food, health and wellness, home and toys. We're investing in price and value as we look for opportunities to lower costs in our business. We continued to gain share in our core categories of food, health and wellness and infant categories, as per Nielsen data for the 12 weeks ended July 18. Additionally, our Canadian e-commerce business grew sales at more than 40%, albeit on a small base. In July, we successfully launched our online grocery business, starting with 11 store pickup locations in the Ottawa area. In addition to top line performance, we remain focused on our low-cost operating model. Operating income grew significantly faster than sales.
In the quarter, we finalized the acquisition of 13 stores and 1 distribution center from a former competitor. 7 of the stores are planned to open by the end of this fiscal year, and the remainder will open next year. In May, we also closed the sale of a portfolio of properties under development with our shopping center joint venture partner, which generated the previously mentioned gain. Overall, I'm pleased with our results in Canada and expect consistent, profitable growth to continue.
In Brazil, the country is facing a prolonged recession and the highest inflation rate in 12 years, driven in part by electricity rate increases of more than 50% versus last year, which is driving a cautious approach to consumption. For Walmart Brazil, net sales declined 0.9%, and comp sales were down 1%, largely impacted by the World Cup event held during the same period last year and the timing of the Easter holiday. We experienced a decline in the hypermarket format, driven by electronics, but are pleased with the double-digit comp sales increases in the wholesale business.
Brazil operating income declined for the quarter, driven by the previously mentioned employment claims and rapidly rising utility rates compared to last year. The management team is making progress on the operational, people and legal fronts to address ongoing employment claims as they work through a challenging business environment. In addition, they are focused on key leverage initiatives to increase store productivity and help offset inflationary pressure.
We continue to make progress on converting stores and distribution centers to standardized systems, which provides better visibility to business results, leverages costs and reduces compliance risk. Last year, we integrated all of our stores in the south region. This year, we're focused on converting the south dry DC network as well as approximately 100 stores in the northeast. Next year, we plan to convert the remaining northeast stores and dry DCs to this unified platform.
Despite challenging market conditions, the e-commerce business in Brazil continues to perform well. Sales grew double digits and outpaced the Brazilian e-commerce market. Market share rose from 8% to 8.5% in Q2, according to eBit, an e-commerce research firm, with share gains in several categories, including babies, toys and games and auto parts. Marketplace sales growth was also strong.
Last, let's discuss China. Walmart China's sales grew 1.2%, while comp sales declined 1.4%. Walmart increased market share in fast-moving consumer goods in the hypermarket channel and maintained share in the modern trade channel, which includes smaller-format stores, for the 12 weeks ended June 28, according to Nielsen.
While there are ongoing market headwinds from slower economic growth, we're confident we'll continue to deliver sustainable growth in China. Walmart continues to outperform the market and gain market share in hypermarkets for the 10th quarter in a row. We're focused on driving efficiency, reducing expenses and strengthening our portfolio through We Operate For Less and We Buy for Less initiatives. These actions contributed to operating income growing significantly faster than sales. The team continues to set the foundation for our business, positioning it for increased growth and profitability in the future.
Throughout the quarter, we made significant progress in our omnichannel efforts. Walmart China launched Walmart To Go in 23 stores in Shenzhen, bringing customers the convenience of ordering through the Walmart app and the choice of pick up in store or delivery to their home. We're also testing ways to bring added payment choices and the convenience of mobile payment to our customers in our stores.
In addition, as Doug and Neil mentioned, we increased our ownership of Yihaodian, our China e-commerce platform, to 100%. We're excited about the opportunities to deliver new experiences to customers in China and further leverage Yihaodian and Walmart's global and local assets.
In the second quarter, Yihaodian grew sales double digits, driven by strong growth in orders and continued improvement in conversion rates. Mobile contributed more than 55% of orders.
As I wrap up the International portion of today's call, I'd like to express how pleased I am with our associates around the globe and their efforts in driving consistent and solid performance in the first half. We're growing comp sales across the majority of our portfolio and stepping up investments in e-commerce while setting our business up for long-term success.
We expect continued economic challenges in the U.K. and Brazil but also expect continued strong performance in Mexico and Canada. We're optimistic about our growth prospects in China despite a softening economy, and we'll continue to invest in that market.
Now I'll turn it over to Roz for an update on Sam's. Roz?"
313055,280452627,860499,"Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Q2 2016 Pre Recorded Earnings Call, Aug 18, 2015",2015-08-18,"Earnings Calls","Walmart Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Dave.

In the second quarter, we grew comp sales, without fuel, 1.3% and net sales 2.8%. Our square footage also grew due to 3 new clubs opening during the quarter. We are accelerating our efforts to strengthen the Sam's Club member value proposition.
Since last year, our investments have been targeted to better merchandise assortment, membership acquisition, engagement and retention, new programs to enhance member value and our investment in e-commerce. By staying on a consistent path and driving these priorities, we continue to simplify our business. We saw the benefits in improved membership trends and higher traffic during the second quarter. What is most important is the overwhelmingly positive feedback we're hearing from our members, not just about our clubs but also about improvement in the e-commerce experience. I'll provide some examples shortly.
Now on to the numbers. With fuel, operating income declined by 13.4% to $428 million. Fuel profitability improved from Q1 but is still below planned levels and below last year's dollars. For additional results with fuel, please reference the accompanying presentation.
Net sales without fuel grew 2.8%. Comp sales without fuel were up 1.3%, with ticket contributing 80 basis points and traffic 50 basis points. Savings member traffic was positive, partially offset by a decline in business member traffic.
Our gross profit rate declined 38 basis points versus last year, driven in part by our ongoing cash rewards investment, increased seasonal markdowns and industry headwinds in pharmacy prescriptions, similar to those referenced in the Walmart U.S. business.
Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased by 13 basis points due to continued investments in new clubs, technology and e-commerce. Membership and other income grew 6.1%, with membership income up 5.8%, driven in large part by Plus upgrades. As a result of both of these factors, operating income declined 9.7% versus last year.
We continue to manage our inventory appropriately. Inventory without fuel grew by 3.4% driven in part by new clubs.
In our merchandising areas, let me start by highlighting 2 of our stronger categories: home and apparel and health and wellness. Home and apparel delivered low single-digit comp sales, with strength in apparel offset by softness in kitchen electrics, domestics and furniture.
Health and wellness posted mid-single-digit comps, driven by generics and by increased member adoption of our Free/4/10 prescription program. Since the launch of this program last quarter for Plus members, we see that those who utilize the program transfer, on average, 2/3 of their scripts to Sam's Club. We are optimistic that these trends will continue to drive traffic.
Our fresh/freezer/cooler business was softer than expected due to deflation in key dairy commodities such as milk and cheese, along with higher costs in areas such as meat.
Grocery and beverages delivered low single-digit comps, with dry grocery delivering solid comp sales.
The consumables business also delivered low single-digit comps, driven by laundry and tabletop categories.
Our technology, entertainment and office businesses, albeit posting negative comps, saw improvement from Q1 levels. We saw acceleration in certain key categories such as tablets. That was offset in part by our wireless business, which has been negatively impacted by the industry shift to installment plans.
We continue to make progress in e-commerce to build the most convenient club in the industry. We're pleased with our ongoing integration of digital and physical. E-commerce contributed approximately 60 basis points to our club comp performance during the period, and traffic to our site was up just over 20%. We delivered new club pickup options that make it easier and more convenient for members to shop online and pick up at the club.
Prepaid club pickup rolled out across the country, and we started testing mobile check-in and drive-through in several clubs. The number of members trying it for the first time during the quarter exceeded our expectations, and we expect ongoing acceptance of this service. We have also improved the assortment and pricing online. Knowing that members love the treasure hunt, we launched Shocking Values that give members access to special items at outstanding prices for a very limited time. Shocking Values products are carefully chosen based on members' interests, top trends and items from the company's most popular shopping categories. In addition, our enhancements to mobile have also built on our member experience and drove double-digit growth in traffic.
Membership income was up versus last year, with growth driven by social media campaigns as well as strong Plus renewals and upgrades due to the benefits of cash rewards. We also continue to emphasize our award-winning Sam's Club 5-3-1 MasterCard, which allows members to save inside and outside the club. We've received very positive feedback from our members on this program.
We recently hosted our Annual Supplier Summit here in Bentonville, and we were pleased with the excellent attendance and engagement. Our suppliers are very interested in the work we've done to ensure their great items are getting in front of our member base. They are supportive of the innovation and merchandising transformation we have in place. We have great items coming for the holidays.
We are focused on further progress in the Sam's Club business for the back half of the year. For the 13-week period ending October 30, 2015, we expect comp sales without fuel to be between flat and up 2%.
Now I'll turn things over to Charles. Charles?"
313055,280452627,860499,"Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Q2 2016 Pre Recorded Earnings Call, Aug 18, 2015",2015-08-18,"Earnings Calls","Walmart Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Roz. I'll start with the top line. We're pleased with the sales increases we saw in the U.S. as well as in our International businesses when considering constant currency. We believe traffic and comp sales increases for Walmart U.S. show we are on",1033,"Thanks, Roz. I'll start with the top line. We're pleased with the sales increases we saw in the U.S. as well as in our International businesses when considering constant currency. We believe traffic and comp sales increases for Walmart U.S. show we are on the right track with our investments. Walmart U.S. now has had positive comps for 4 straight quarters. As expected, these investments impacted both operating expenses and profits. In addition, Walmart U.S. experienced gross margin pressure from pharmacy and shrink that we had not expected.
Looking forward at the rest of the year, operating profit will be pressured more than we originally planned. This is primarily driven by the headwinds to Walmart U.S. gross margins that I'd just mentioned. We will continue to scrutinize and evaluate how we manage our capital in order to optimize both the customer experience and returns.
Before I turn to guidance, let me cover some other items. You may have read in our earnings release that we are reviewing leases across all of our segments. This is part of a comprehensive ongoing lease review. One item that we are focusing on and may need to be corrected relates to leases where our payment of certain structural component costs during a lessor's construction of the leased store causes us to be deemed the owner of the property for accounting purposes. This results in us capitalizing these leased assets on our balance sheet. We don't know the impact to our financial statements but believe it mostly to be a balance sheet issue at this time. We will provide more information once the review is complete.
Turning to cash. During the quarter, we spent approximately $760 million to acquire the remaining shares of Yihaodian, a strategic acquisition for e-commerce growth in China. In addition, we continued to provide shareholder returns in the form of dividends and share repurchases. And in the second quarter, we paid approximately $1.6 billion in dividends and repurchased approximately $1 billion of shares. This represents our largest share repurchase activity in the last 4 quarters. As always, we will remain opportunistic with share repurchase throughout the year. As of the end of the second quarter, we had approximately $9 billion remaining under our current $15 billion authorization.
Membership and other income increased 13.9% to $899 million. Other income primarily benefited from the gain on the sale of the bank operations in Mexico. FCPA- and compliance-related costs were approximately $30 million, comprised of approximately $23 million for the ongoing inquiries and investigations and approximately $7 million for our global compliance program and organizational enhancements.
Last year, FCPA- and compliance-related costs were $43 million in the second quarter. We expect FCPA-related expenses to continue to trend down, so we now expect our full year FCPA-related expenses to range between $130 million and $150 million. This compares to our guidance in February of $160 million to $180 million.
Return on investment for the trailing 12 months ended July 31, 2015, were 16.2%, which compares to 16.7% last year. The decline in ROI has primarily been due to continued capital investments as well as our decrease in operating income.
Earlier, Greg mentioned that as part of our commitment to EDLC, we are working on amending terms and allowance agreements with our Walmart U.S. suppliers to drive simplicity and consistency across our business. We began this effort in June, and discussions will continue over the coming months.
On a constant currency basis, inventory grew slower than sales. While we are pleased with the progress in managing our inventories, working capital is still an opportunity for us to generate stronger free cash flow.
Now let's turn our attention to guidance. In February, we indicated that we expected our full year fiscal 2016 earnings per share to range between $4.70 and $5.05. Today, we expect our fiscal 2016 earnings per share to range between $4.40 and $4.70, including a range of $0.93 and $1.05 for the third quarter.
This new range includes the following updated assumptions: First, the impact from our investments in wages, training and additional hours in our stores will be approximately $0.24, including approximately $0.08 in the third quarter. Through the first half of this year, we have incurred approximately $0.10 of the expected full year impact. This compares to our original guidance in February of approximately $0.20. As you heard from Greg earlier, our decision to increase associate hours beyond our February plan to areas of the store such as front end and stocking positions are intended to drive the most benefit for our customers.
Next, the incremental investment in Global eCommerce will range between $0.06 and $0.09. This is unchanged from our guidance in February. In the third quarter, we expect the impact to be approximately $0.02. Through the first half of this year, we have incurred approximately $0.04 of the expected full year impact.
Third, we expect a full year impact of approximately $0.11, including approximately $0.03 in the third quarter from the unplanned headwinds that I discussed earlier. The headwinds are primarily in Walmart U.S. pharmacy margins as well as higher-than-expected shrink continuing through this fiscal year.
Assuming currency exchange rates remain at current levels for the remainder of the year, we now expect the full year impact to be approximately $0.15, up $0.02 from last quarter's revised guidance of $0.13. Our effective tax rate is expected to range between 32% and 34%, unchanged from our guidance in February. Now as a reminder, our tax rate will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter and may be impacted by a number of factors, including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, valuation allowances, changes in law, outcomes of administrative audits, the impacts of discrete items and the mix of earnings among our U.S. and international operations. And in any given quarter, our effective tax rate could be higher or lower than the full year.
We will host our Annual Investment Meeting in New York on October 14. As we have in prior annual investment community meetings, we will provide an update on our capital plans at that time. We look forward to seeing you there.
Thank you for your interest in Walmart, and have a great day."

Thank you for joining us to hear more about our second quarter earnings and get an update on how things are progressing relative to our strategy. We just returned from our Walmart U.S. holiday meeting in Denver.",1628,"Thanks, Carol, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us to hear more about our second quarter earnings and get an update on how things are progressing relative to our strategy. We just returned from our Walmart U.S. holiday meeting in Denver. As you may know, we gather all of our store managers and market managers to talk about the plan for the holiday season and take stock of where we are as a business. I can tell you that the feeling in the room was as good as it's been in years. Our stores in the U.S. are getting better, our associates are happier, and our managers are leading it. I talked with our managers about how our company has always changed to serve customers, and we're in another period of change right now. 
I shared an article from Fortune Magazine that I keep in my office titled, ""Can Walmart get back the magic?"" It's a pretty strong indictment of our future, and the fun fact is that it was written in 1996. Just as it was in 1996, we will win the future of retail if we make the right choices as a business. We have a strong point of view on what that future will look like. Through technology, data and mobile, we have incredible new ways to serve customers today and the opportunities are only growing. We believe the winners in retail will be those who can bring together the best of the offline world with the best of online to serve customers however they want to shop. And we believe Walmart has unique competitive advantages in this race. 
We're moving forward on our enterprise strategy to position ourselves to win, playing offense, which is the only way to play in retail. This is true around the world. It's not just a U.S. opportunity. The changes we need to make require investment, and we're pleased with the steps we've taken. We made continued progress towards our plan this quarter. Even if it's not as fast as we'd like, the fundamentals of serving our customers are consistently improving, and it's reflected in our comps and revenue growth. 
Our strategy starts with running great stores and clubs. In Denver, we talked about the choices we're making as a business. As you know, in the first quarter, we initiated a comprehensive multiyear plan to increase starting wages and training for associates in our U.S. stores and clubs. During the second quarter, we implemented the next phase of changes to our Walmart U.S. store structure, including adding department managers. Our focus on running better stores that are clean and well stocked, have friendly associates and an efficient checkout is resonating with customers. They've always counted on Walmart to have great prices. Now we're building their trust with better in-stock and delivering an enjoyable shopping experience. 
As a result, Walmart U.S. delivered its fourth consecutive quarter of positive comp sales, as overall net sales grew nearly 5%. Customer traffic was strong again this quarter. Lower gas prices helped. I continue to be encouraged by the sales momentum that we're seeing, especially in general merchandise, and I'm confident that customers are benefiting from the investments we're making in our stores and associates. Obviously, we'd like to see it ramp higher and faster. We also recognize it won't be a linear path up into the right but we like the trend line.
Although we grew top line sales, we did fall short on managing the bottom line. During the quarter, operating expenses were higher than expected, and our gross margin was lower than planned. We are not pleased or satisfied. For the back half of the year, we will manage these items closely with a continued commitment to efficiency, cutting costs where appropriate even in a period of investment. 
Similar to the first quarter, Walmart International constant currency sales growth was solid this quarter, with Mexico and Canada delivering strong comps. We're also excited about the opportunities we see in China, despite slower economic growth and currency pressures. Our position is improving. We're gaining market share in the hypermarket category. Sam's Club continues to perform well, and we have great opportunities in e-commerce. 
Brazil and U.K. remain challenging markets but for different reasons. I'm pleased that our U.S. Sam's Club comp sales improved this quarter, and membership income was up close to 6%. Members are recognizing the enhanced value in our Plus memberships, which drove continued growth this quarter, both in club and online. 
Another piece of our plan to win is to build and run great e-commerce. We've made a lot of progress improving our mobile and e-commerce capabilities this year with several important milestones in the second quarter. You'll hear more details from Neil shortly about the investments that we've made in Pangaea, our global technology platform, and the progress on opening our 4 new fulfillment centers in the United States. These investments are designed to give customers the ability to find what they want more easily and get what they want faster while enabling us to fulfill orders in a more cost-effective manner. 
Another important milestone in the quarter was our acquisition of the remaining stake of Yihaodian, our e-commerce business in China. We're extremely excited about the growth potential of Yihaodian and the opportunity it presents over time to deliver for customers in a seamless manner. 
In the second quarter, Walmart's worldwide e-commerce sales grew approximately 16% on a constant currency basis, led by solid results in both of our U.S. businesses, Walmart and Sam's Club. 
The third leg of our strategy is to innovate the future of retail by bringing online and offline together. Here, we can see the pieces starting to come together. In the U.S., the response to our grocery home shopping offering has been strong. I'm particularly pleased with the number of repeat customers we have and the strength of our average ticket. Anecdotally, I can share that customers have told us it's changing their perception of the shopping experience at Walmart. In stores, we've been aggressively pursuing store pick-up options. And Pickup, while on a very small base in Walmart terms, is growing very quickly. 
At samsclub.com, we're also seeing stronger sales as members appreciate the convenience of our Club Pickup. We're also focused on leveraging data to bring exciting, member-relevant merchandise to our clubs and online with an eye towards growing our share of members from the higher income household demographic. 
Internationally, one of the encouraging signs we're seeing in the Mexico and Canada is that customers are not only purchasing more in our stores but also driving sales through e-commerce and mobile commerce. In China, we're expanding our omnichannel offerings with the new test of in-store pickup of online orders in a number of our Shenzhen stores. Chinese customers increasingly value the choice of both picking up their online orders in a local store and having it shipped to their homes. And we've started integrating our digital and physical offering for these customers. 
Winning in the future requires change. Change, in this case, requires investment, and investment pressures short-term earnings. Our strategy is designed to create robust and sustainable growth that will deliver returns to shareholders. We obviously want to do that in a short and long term, and it all starts by winning with customers. The good news is that our short-term investments help build the bridge to the mid and long-term. 
In the second quarter, Walmart generated more than $120 billion in revenue and delivered earnings per share of $1.08. I'm encouraged by the improvement in our constant currency sales and recognize that our bottom line results should have been better. We have margin pressure from pharmacy reimbursements and higher shrink than we expected during the quarter. These impacts, coupled with higher wage investments, impacted EPS. 
Walmart U.S. is the driver of our bottom line results. With the headwinds I just mentioned continuing the rest of the year and the level of investments we have, our operating income will continue to be pressured. We have a strong balance sheet, one that allowed us the opportunity to invest significantly in our business and the acquisitions like Yihaodian. You'll hear more about on the impact of these investments from Charles when he updates EPS guidance. 
In the short term, we expect Walmart U.S. comps to accelerate as the service from our associates gains even more traction with our customer experience. When all of our e-commerce fulfillment investments come online, we expect them to lower our distribution costs in the midterm, starting in the fourth quarter and having a larger positive impact next year. Over the longer term, we believe we'll continue to grow in key markets around the world and further integrate our store and e-commerce offerings. We know that to deliver for our shareholders in a sustainable way, we must first win with our customers and associates. So I'm confident that these are the right decisions to position Walmart for the future. 
Finally, I want to mention an important moment we'll observe these week. Nearly 10 years ago, our customers and associates on the Gulf Coast were impacted by Hurricane Katrina. Throughout the devastation that the residents of this region faced, Walmart associates demonstrated extraordinary courage and passion for these communities. I often think how simple acts of kindness can have a dramatic impact. Our people really do make the difference at Walmart, not only for our customers, but also for the communities we serve. I look forward to joining our associates and community leaders in New Orleans later this week to look back at this event and to discuss how to get better at disaster resiliency and response. 
Now I will turn it over to Neil. Neil?"

We delivered a lot during the quarter at Walmart U.S., at Sam's Club and in our key markets around the world, all possible because of the groundwork we laid over the last few years. As a quick recap, we've re-platformed both our technology and physical distribution network for e-commerce. 
The technology platform, Pangaea, is consistently improving the customer experience and conversion for walmart.com, which has led a solid sales growth. We've created a U.S. grocery home shopping business that is getting great reviews from our customers. And we developed e-commerce at Sam's Club and in key markets around the world, notably in Brazil and in China. 
All of this was made possible because we have built a talent-dense Internet technology company inside of Walmart. We're now able to create new experiences for customers across digital and physical. Overall, Global eCommerce constant currency sales grew approximately 16%. GMV, or gross merchandise value, grew approximately 18% on a constant currency basis. The highlight was solid growth in the walmart.com and samsclub.com U.S. businesses while International was soft due to economic challenges in several of our key markets. Because of the softness in International, we are resetting our Global eCommerce sales growth forecast for this fiscal year from the mid 20s to a range in the mid to high teens. 
As I mentioned, both businesses in the U.S. are going very well. A great example of how everything came to life was our walmart.com Dare To Compare event that we kicked off in July. This event created a perfect opportunity to highlight that customers can trust us to offer them the assortment they want at low prices everyday, not just during a 1-day sale. We were able to use our technology platform and sophisticated pricing algorithms to help us track and deliver lower pricing than competitors. 
Given that we've tripled our assortment in the past 3 years, we had more items for customers to shop. Customers could then choose how to get their purchases in the most convenient way for them. We offer customers the option to get orders shipped to their door or to a store with same-day pickup. In fact, it led to our biggest day of the year so far for same-day pickup. The flexibility of our new platform allowed us to move very quickly, and the new site delivered a better, faster shopping experience to customers. And those customers who were shopping on mobile devices had an improved experience, thanks to the responsive design we rolled out in the quarter. 
We are using e-commerce to bring both new customers to Walmart as well as to deepen our relationship with our existing customers. On the largest day of our Dare To Compare event, we saw more than double the number of new customers to walmart.com than a typical day. 
During the second quarter, we had a number of milestones for Walmart U.S. We migrated 100% of customers to the new cart and checkout based on our new technology platform. We delivered responsive design to dynamically adjust the site to whatever device was being used. We started rolling out a significantly enhanced store search capability on mobile. We opened 2 new automated online fulfillment centers, each bigger than 20 football fields, and we have 2 more coming this quarter. These fulfillment centers are strategically located across geographies and will begin to serve our customers this holiday. They will be cornerstones of our fulfillment network going forward. We also started a targeted test of an unlimited free shipping program priced at $50 for 1 year. 
I'm also pleased with the expansion in progress on grocery home shopping in the U.S. We're in 5 markets and sales continued to grow because customers, especially moms with children, love the convenience of ordering online and having their car loaded at a pickup location. 
In addition to expanding pick-up in stores, we are offering customers remote pick up points that are convenient to them, including their corporate campuses. In fact, we launched 1 here at our campus in San Bruno. 
We have also made great progress at Sam's Club, where we  have been tightly aligned with clubs to deliver a better member experience, which has helped deliver high growth on samsclub.com. Sam's delivered new Club Pickup options to make it easier and more convenient for members to shop online and pick up at the club. Prepaid Club Pickup rolled out across the country, and we started testing mobile check-in and drive-through in several clubs. We have also improved the assortment and pricing online. Knowing that members love the treasure hunt, we launched Shocking Values on samsclub.com that gives members access to special items at outstanding prices for a very limited time. 
Our enhancements to mobile have also built on our member experience, and we've seen double-digit growth in mobile. 
As I mentioned earlier, sales in our international markets were softer during the second quarter than we've seen previously. While still growing, grocery home shopping in the U.K. has slowed down, commensurate with the market. Asda opened 14 petrol stations during the second quarter, and these were enabled with click-and-collect lockers for both grocery and general merchandise items. 
In Brazil, the overall economic environment is very challenging, but we have continued to take share in this down market. We are growing sales faster than the market and we are continuing to see growth in GMV. Our team has used this opportunity to build a lean and nimble operating model that can succeed in any market condition. 
As Doug mentioned, we acquired the remaining shares of Yihaodian in China. In 2012, we became 51% owners, and we have seen strong growth since that time. Yihaodian now has about 100 million registered customers, more than twice as many as when we first invested. Our primary goal is to continue to accelerate Yihaodian's core e-commerce business and maintain strong local Chinese expertise. Now that we are the sole owners, we will be expanding our leadership team from within the Yihaodian business, from within Walmart and from the e-commerce industry in China. We will also leverage Walmart's global reach and scale to better benefit Yihaodian, including global sourcing. 
Wang Lu, who joined us earlier this year to lead Global eCommerce in Asia, is overseeing Yihaodian. He brings a strong background in developing digital businesses in China. China is an exciting, dynamic, large and competitive market. We are excited about our long-term opportunity in China. 
We're delivering important e-commerce capabilities around the world. And ultimately, these capabilities are enabling experiences that impact the stores and clubs as well as e-commerce. Customers see us as Walmart and Sam's Club, not a collection of shopping channels. We are delivering experiences on apps and sites and in stores and clubs that come together to differentiate us in the eyes of our customers and members. To remain in leadership position, we must continue to invest in technology and people to deliver the customer and member experiences.

Our bottom line came in substantially below what was planned.  Three major factors contributed to our underperformance: a decline in gross margin, primarily related to lower-than-expected pharmacy reimbursements and accelerating pressures in shrink; as well as a higher-than-planned investment in store hours, which was essential to improving the customer experience. 
I want to be straightforward. These issues will present continuing profit challenges for the remainder of the year. We are certainly disappointed, but we are not standing still. We know we can do better and we will.
For the Walmart U.S. business, doing better means staying focused on an aggressive strategic plan to improve the customer experience in our stores and deliver sustainable top and bottom line growth for the long term. This strategic plan includes a number of large, specific projects that fit within our broader focus on assortment, price, access and customer experience. This plan requires significant investments, and we are confident we are making the right decisions for our customers and our business. 
Amid the investment, we are focused on growing sales and controlling costs, as you would expect from Walmart. We are staying true to our roots. However, we are committed to improving the customer experience, and we will protect the investments necessary to achieve this goal. 
Let me dig in a bit on details. I'm pleased to report that we're seeing progress on our top line, as net sales for the second quarter were up 4.8% and comp sales increased 1.5%. We also improved inventory, making our goal to grow inventory less than sales growth. Additionally, we have seen improvements in traffic and customer experience from these actions. Each decision was in line with the strategy we laid out and progress has been steady and consistent. 
Let me share with you some of our accomplishments in the first half of this fiscal year, many of which occurred during the second quarter. First, across all our formats, we're focused on improving the shopping experience for our customers. We've continued our Checkout Promise initiative, ensuring more registers are open during peak shopping hours. We've invested in providing customers with a cleaner, better-maintained shopping environment. And we've added approximately 1,700 items, primarily in grocery, to warehouse stock, driving faster replenishment times to the stores and ensuring the product is available for our customers. 
Second, we are investing in our associates. This April, we raised the minimum starting wage in our stores to $9 per hour, resulting in over 500,000 associates receiving a raise. This new wage structure is expanding our applicant pool. We're also introducing 8,000 new department manager positions, a more focused role that allows the associate to be trained and become more knowledgeable with the areas they support, providing our customers with a better experience in the store. Additionally, we are continuing to focus on career development for all our associates. 
Finally, we've increased the amount an associate will receive upon being promoted into higher levels of responsibility. These changes gave pay raises to an additional 150,000 associates who are critical to improving the in-store experience. 
Alongside wage improvement and to support career development, we're rolling out new training programs designed to help associates grow their careers at Walmart and provide a better experience for our customers. These programs, which will be rolled out this fall,  are hands-on, instructor-led and tailored specifically to a position, ensuring the training is relevant to an associate's current role or to a future role they aspire to achieve. And we're piloting new scheduling tools that allow associates to select shifts that work best for them while ensuring the store is staffed appropriately for customer demand. This program is reducing associate absences and turnover in the pilot stores and providing managers with better visibility to coverage gaps.  
Lastly, we're investing in operational improvements. In the second quarter, we began an overhaul of our inventory management systems, routines and schedules. The Customer Availability Program, or CAP, will supply decade-old processes with modern technology and new routines that keep associates on the sales floor rather than in the stock room. Processes for truck deliveries at peak times and for stocking shelves have been significantly simplified, freeing more associates to be on the floor during peak customer traffic. We've also began rolling out MC 40 technology to all department managers. This smaller, more intuitive hand-held tool allows us to replace the current devices with one that can provide enhanced technology. This will simplify how our associates work in a way that was not possible before. Additionally, this month, store managers are receiving mobile tablets that will help them stay connected to the business while keeping them on the sales floor to help our customers and associates. 
As part of our focus on EDLC, we've reduced supplier marketing funds that have traditionally offset a portion of our advertising expenses as we work towards better product costs. This will translate into lower prices for our customers. As a result of this reduction, we've lowered our second quarter print advertising count from 20 pieces last year to just 4 pieces this year. Moreover, since June, we've been working on amending terms and allowance agreements with our suppliers, driving consistency and simplification across our business. We've also reinstated our shrink training program for our asset protection and store management teams as part of our efforts to improve in this area. 
And finally, we've reduced feature and modular changes across the store, ensuring there is space for each feature and associate hours to make these changes. Along with this reduction, we've moved some feature and modular decisions back to the stores, allowing them to set features that best align to their local customer needs and preferences. Whilst there are numerous initiatives being landed across our business, these are being executed in a coordinated and systematic fashion to allow us to achieve our full potential. 
We're pleased with our progress in the first half of the year, but we recognize that we still have a lot to do to meet our long-term goals, and that it will take time to get where we want to be. I recognize these actions have, and will continue to, pressure our bottom line, but they are already driving meaningful improvements. Over the past year, we have seen growth in store traffic and comp sales. Additionally, our customer satisfaction scores continue to improve. Everyday, a sample of customers in every store rate us across a number of metrics, including providing a fast checkout, friendly service and a clean store environment. Based on the ratings from these surveys, we can see that our stores are making significant improvement from their baseline, and we expect that trend to continue. Improving the customer experience is fundamental to our success. 
Finally, we're proud of the impact these decisions have had on our associates. Nearly 80% of our 1.2 million U.S. store associates participated in our annual associate survey administered during this quarter. Our associate's engagement has increased approximately 100 basis points this year after remaining static for the prior 2 years. 
We've remained committed to the strategy we laid out for you earlier this year, ensuring we're making the right decisions to benefit both our customers and our associates and to drive long-term sustainable growth.  We know we will continue to face considerable challenges, but our goal for the back half of this year is to build on the improvements in top line and customer experience, and our list of things to accomplish is even longer. 
Now let's cover the details on our financial performance for the second quarter. Net sales increased $3.4 billion or 4.8% versus last year. Comparable store sales were up 1.5% and driven by strength in traffic, which increased 1.3%. Traffic was particularly strong on the general merchandise and softlines side of the box. Seasonal categories resonated well with customers, and changes in replenishment strategies ensured product was on the shelves when and where customers needed it. Finally, e-commerce sales contributed approximately 20 basis points to our overall comp. Neil will share the details on our progress on technology infrastructure and fulfillment for walmart.com orders. We are pleased that these efforts will position us even more competitively for the back half of the year. 
Our grocery home shopping pilots remain underway in 5 key markets, and we're happy with increased customer counts in these areas. 
All formats delivered positive comp sales growth this quarter, in particular, comps in Neighborhood Markets were up approximately 7.3%. We remain encouraged by the performance of this format. As mentioned, the general merchandise and softlines side of the supercenter performed well this quarter, driving strong traffic and sales growth through relevant offerings and better in-stock positions. While warm weather, particularly in July, helped propel sales in seasonal categories, our ongoing focus on the basics across apparel, indoor home and the hardlines drove momentum throughout the quarter. Additionally, while we saw our shift to back-to-school sales into August as several states adjusted the timing of their tax-free weekends, early indications are positive. 
Health and wellness benefited from continued growth in pharmacy scripts, along with new brands in optical and a focus on better in-stock positions in OTC. 
And while we saw improved trends in our entertainment business from better in-stocks and stronger online sales, comps continue to run negative, pressured by ongoing industry declines and the shift from postpaid to installment wireless plans. 
On the grocery side of the box, consumables had positive comps, driven by a strong base business. New products, particularly in chemicals, drove additional momentum. More notably, continued pressure in food from declining inflation negatively impacted our total box comp by approximately 60 basis points. 
Moving on to the remainder of our financials. Gross profit rate declined 41 basis points this quarter. As I said before, this was driven by a handful of key issues. 
Let's talk about pharmacy. Reflecting industry-wide trends, we are seeing reduced reimbursement rates from pharmacy benefit managers, which is negatively impacting gross margin. We are also seeing a lower mix of higher margin cash transactions, reflecting a marketplace shift in which more customers are now benefiting from greater drug insurance coverage. While we are taking a number of actions to lessen the impact, we expect to have pressure on pharmacy for the rest of the fiscal year. Additionally, inventory shrinkage was meaningfully higher-than-planned for the quarter. We are reviewing the end-to-end inventory management process, with a special focus on shrinkage and working to close gaps. Investments are being made in training programs for store and asset protection associates as well as investments in staffing in high shrink areas of the store. But it will take time to see results, so this will impact us versus planned for the rest of the year. 
Operating expenses deleveraged 50 basis points to last year, primarily due to our higher-than-planned investments in customer experience. These investments included the planned wage rate increases and structural changes I mentioned earlier as well as additional associate hours needed to improve customer service. This quarter, we thoughtfully added back hours to specific areas of the store, such as the front-end and stocking positions. This was a strategic decision to invest where we can drive the most benefit for our customers. These adds were significant and more than we had planned, but we felt it was the right decision to meet the goals we have set, and we've started to see the investment translate into better top line performance. The focus on customer experience, along with ongoing investments in e-commerce and the reduction in gross profit rate, led to an operating income decline of approximately 8.2% versus last year. 
Moving on. In the second quarter, total inventory grew slower than the rate of sales at 2.2%. Comp store inventory declined by 2.4% versus last year. The majority of this improvement came from decisions we made regarding replenishment strategies, whereby we strategically moved inventory for certain items upstream from our store backrooms to our distribution centers. Additionally, we continued our focus on clearing our backrooms of excess inventory, improving operational efficiency in the stores. These actions, along with better management of seasonal inventory and reducing modular changes and feature shipments to the stores, allowed us to reduce comp store inventory while improving both in-stock levels and sales. Inventory management will continue to be an ongoing focus for us. 
This quarter, we opened 16 supercenters, including relocations and expansions. Additionally, we opened 22 traditional-format Neighborhood Markets, and the final 6 of our smaller-format Neighborhood Market test locations. 
As we think about future store openings, we'll continue to focus on quality versus quantity. Having opened more than 350 Neighborhood Markets in the past 2 years, we have a better understanding of what customers value most, from the choice of location to the size of the box to the product offerings. Based on these learnings, we've decided not to pursue a number of potential locations as they would not provide the type of quality experience customers expect from a Neighborhood Market. We now expect to open a total of 160 to 170 Neighborhood Markets in fiscal 2016, including the 51 locations already opened. Our previous forecast was to open between 180 and 200 Neighborhood Markets. We're still on track to build approximately 60 to 70 supercenters this year, which was our original forecast. We know that we still have a lot of work to do to achieve the long-term goals we have set our business. The investments we are making, along with the headwinds we've mentioned, will weigh more heavily on operating income than initially forecasted. 
Amid the pressures, we are thoughtfully evaluating every decision and use of company resources as we go through the back half the year. But we are confident in the direction we are headed. We are seeing improvements everyday from sales and traffic growth to increased customer satisfaction to more engaged associates. 
For the third quarter, we expect our ongoing investments in stores and customer experience to drive further sales momentum, offset partially by continued deflationary pressures in food, especially in meat and dairy. For the 13-week period ending October 30, we anticipate a comp sales increase of approximately 1% to 2%. Last year, our comp sales for the period were up 0.5%. 
Now I'll turn it over to Dave for an update on Walmart International. Dave?"

The international business had a fairly solid quarter given tough economic environments in certain markets and ongoing currency impacts. In Q2, we saw accelerating sales growth in Mexico and Canada, offsetting ongoing challenges in the U.K., Brazil and China. Overall, I continue to be enthusiastic about our long-term prospects to profitably grow our international business in a controlled and disciplined manner. 
Similar to last quarter, the performance in Mexico and Canada continued to be solid. Our Mexico team has done an excellent job reenergizing that business, driving strong performance across all formats. We continue to see significant growth opportunities in Mexico, along with the improving core business. In Canada, we continue to gain market share, driven by our fifth consecutive quarter of positive comps. These 2 markets will continue to play a key role in our back-half performance. I'll provide more details on key market performance in a few minutes. 
Now let's jump to our overall results. In the second quarter, net sales grew 2.8% on a constant currency basis despite headwinds in Latin America from lapping last year's World Cup and the timing shift of Easter. The U.S. dollar remains strong, which led to a currency impact of $4.2 billion, resulting in a 9.6% sales decline on a reported basis. Comp sales were positive in Mexico and Canada while the U.K., Brazil and China posted negative comps. All other markets had positive comp sales. 
Operating income declined 1.5% on a constant currency basis, negatively impacted by increased employment claim contingencies and higher-than-expected utility rates in Brazil as well as continued investments in Global eCommerce. This was partially offset by gains from the sale of the bank operations in Mexico and certain properties in Canada. Excluding the impact of these items, operating income would have grown faster than sales. With the currency exchange impact, operating income decreased 14.2%. On a constant-currency basis, inventory grew faster than sales at 4.2%, driven primarily by slower sales in the U.K. On a reported basis, inventory declined 10.5%. 
Now let's discuss market results, presented on a-constant currency basis for our largest markets. In all countries except Brazil and China, financial results are inclusive of e-commerce. 
Let's start with the U.K. The market remained highly competitive during the second quarter, with significant ongoing vouchering from Asda's competitors. Grocery deflation remained at near record levels as prices decreased 1.7% versus last year for the 12 weeks ended June 21 according to Kantar. The total market declined 0.1%, a reversal from a slight growth in Q1 in part due to the timing of Easter. 
U.K. sales declined 4.1%, and comp sales, excluding fuel, were down 5.2%, driven by declining traffic, especially in fresh food categories. Grocery home shopping sales continue to grow, and we remain focused on driving improvements to our customer metrics. Operating income increased year-over-year, mostly driven by the timing of Easter and margin improvement in nonfood categories from a favorable mix shift. 
For the rest of the year, we're focused on strengthening the assortment in private label and improving pricing on national brands. We will continue to drive aggressive cost-reduction initiatives supporting our GBP 1 billion 5-year price investment strategy. We're investing to improve store standards and on-shelf availability and to maintain recent improvements in grocery home shopping service metrics. In addition, we launched our new branding and marketing campaign based around adoption of the Walmart ""Save Money, Live Better"" mission to help build brand and quality perception. Collectively, these actions are designed to address some of the challenges we face in store traffic and fresh food. 
Let's now discuss Mexico, which released their earnings on July 21. Please note that Walmex release is under IFRS and the results here are under U.S. GAAP, therefore, some numbers may differ. 
Consolidated Walmex net sales increased 7.2%, with solid comp sales in both Mexico and Central America. Mexico sales grew 7.4% and comp sales increased 5.4%. We continue to see strong comps across all formats, including Sam's Club, which delivered 4.6% comp growth. Self-service continues to gain share and delivered 190 basis point improvement in market share, according to ANTAD. General merchandise performed very well at 4.9% comp growth despite a tough year-over-year comparison from last year's World Cup. Operating income grew faster than sales. 
The sale of our banking unit in the second quarter, along with the Vips restaurant divestiture last fiscal year, helps us focus on our core business, which is our strength. We are intent on being the most relevant retailer of our customers through excellent prices, great assortment and consistent execution. We remain confident that the steps we have in place to improve Walmex are working and will serve as a catalyst for our business over the long term.
In Canada, sales grew 5.4% and comps grew 3.9% in a low-growth economic environment, driven by strong performance in food, health and wellness, home and toys. We're investing in price and value as we look for opportunities to lower costs in our business. We continued to gain share in our core categories of food, health and wellness and infant categories, as per Nielsen data for the 12 weeks ended July 18. Additionally, our Canadian e-commerce business grew sales at more than 40%, albeit on a small base. In July, we successfully launched our online grocery business, starting with 11 store pickup locations in the Ottawa area. In addition to top line performance, we remain focused on our low-cost operating model. Operating income grew significantly faster than sales.
In the quarter, we finalized the acquisition of 13 stores and 1 distribution center from a former competitor. 7 of the stores are planned to open by the end of this fiscal year, and the remainder will open next year. In May, we also closed the sale of a portfolio of properties under development with our shopping center joint venture partner, which generated the previously mentioned gain. Overall, I'm pleased with our results in Canada and expect consistent, profitable growth to continue.
In Brazil, the country is facing a prolonged recession and the highest inflation rate in 12 years, driven in part by electricity rate increases of more than 50% versus last year, which is driving a cautious approach to consumption. For Walmart Brazil, net sales declined 0.9%, and comp sales were down 1%, largely impacted by the World Cup event held during the same period last year and the timing of the Easter holiday. We experienced a decline in the hypermarket format, driven by electronics, but are pleased with the double-digit comp sales increases in the wholesale business.
Brazil operating income declined for the quarter, driven by the previously mentioned employment claims and rapidly rising utility rates compared to last year. The management team is making progress on the operational, people and legal fronts to address ongoing employment claims as they work through a challenging business environment. In addition, they are focused on key leverage initiatives to increase store productivity and help offset inflationary pressure.
We continue to make progress on converting stores and distribution centers to standardized systems, which provides better visibility to business results, leverages costs and reduces compliance risk. Last year, we integrated all of our stores in the south region. This year, we're focused on converting the south dry DC network as well as approximately 100 stores in the northeast. Next year, we plan to convert the remaining northeast stores and dry DCs to this unified platform.
Despite challenging market conditions, the e-commerce business in Brazil continues to perform well. Sales grew double digits and outpaced the Brazilian e-commerce market. Market share rose from 8% to 8.5% in Q2, according to eBit, an e-commerce research firm, with share gains in several categories, including babies, toys and games and auto parts. Marketplace sales growth was also strong.
Last, let's discuss China. Walmart China's sales grew 1.2%, while comp sales declined 1.4%. Walmart increased market share in fast-moving consumer goods in the hypermarket channel and maintained share in the modern trade channel, which includes smaller-format stores, for the 12 weeks ended June 28, according to Nielsen.
While there are ongoing market headwinds from slower economic growth, we're confident we'll continue to deliver sustainable growth in China. Walmart continues to outperform the market and gain market share in hypermarkets for the 10th quarter in a row. We're focused on driving efficiency, reducing expenses and strengthening our portfolio through We Operate For Less and We Buy for Less initiatives. These actions contributed to operating income growing significantly faster than sales. The team continues to set the foundation for our business, positioning it for increased growth and profitability in the future.
Throughout the quarter, we made significant progress in our omnichannel efforts. Walmart China launched Walmart To Go in 23 stores in Shenzhen, bringing customers the convenience of ordering through the Walmart app and the choice of pick up in store or delivery to their home. We're also testing ways to bring added payment choices and the convenience of mobile payment to our customers in our stores.
In addition, as Doug and Neil mentioned, we increased our ownership of Yihaodian, our China e-commerce platform, to 100%. We're excited about the opportunities to deliver new experiences to customers in China and further leverage Yihaodian and Walmart's global and local assets.
In the second quarter, Yihaodian grew sales double digits, driven by strong growth in orders and continued improvement in conversion rates. Mobile contributed more than 55% of orders.
As I wrap up the International portion of today's call, I'd like to express how pleased I am with our associates around the globe and their efforts in driving consistent and solid performance in the first half. We're growing comp sales across the majority of our portfolio and stepping up investments in e-commerce while setting our business up for long-term success.
We expect continued economic challenges in the U.K. and Brazil but also expect continued strong performance in Mexico and Canada. We're optimistic about our growth prospects in China despite a softening economy, and we'll continue to invest in that market.
Now I'll turn it over to Roz for an update on Sam's. Roz?"
313055,280452627,860560,"Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Q2 2016 Pre Recorded Earnings Call, Aug 18, 2015",2015-08-18,"Earnings Calls","Walmart Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Dave.

In the second quarter, we grew comp sales, without fuel, 1.3% and net sales 2.8%. Our square footage also grew due to 3 new clubs opening during the quarter. We are accelerating our efforts to strengthen the Sam's Club member value proposition.
Since last year, our investments have been targeted to better merchandise assortment, membership acquisition, engagement and retention, new programs to enhance member value and our investment in e-commerce. By staying on a consistent path and driving these priorities, we continue to simplify our business. We saw the benefits in improved membership trends and higher traffic during the second quarter. What is most important is the overwhelmingly positive feedback we're hearing from our members, not just about our clubs but also about improvement in the e-commerce experience. I'll provide some examples shortly.
Now on to the numbers. With fuel, operating income declined by 13.4% to $428 million. Fuel profitability improved from Q1 but is still below planned levels and below last year's dollars. For additional results with fuel, please reference the accompanying presentation.
Net sales without fuel grew 2.8%. Comp sales without fuel were up 1.3%, with ticket contributing 80 basis points and traffic 50 basis points. Savings member traffic was positive, partially offset by a decline in business member traffic.
Our gross profit rate declined 38 basis points versus last year, driven in part by our ongoing cash rewards investment, increased seasonal markdowns and industry headwinds in pharmacy prescriptions, similar to those referenced in the Walmart U.S. business.
Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased by 13 basis points due to continued investments in new clubs, technology and e-commerce. Membership and other income grew 6.1%, with membership income up 5.8%, driven in large part by Plus upgrades. As a result of both of these factors, operating income declined 9.7% versus last year.
We continue to manage our inventory appropriately. Inventory without fuel grew by 3.4% driven in part by new clubs.
In our merchandising areas, let me start by highlighting 2 of our stronger categories: home and apparel and health and wellness. Home and apparel delivered low single-digit comp sales, with strength in apparel offset by softness in kitchen electrics, domestics and furniture.
Health and wellness posted mid-single-digit comps, driven by generics and by increased member adoption of our Free/4/10 prescription program. Since the launch of this program last quarter for Plus members, we see that those who utilize the program transfer, on average, 2/3 of their scripts to Sam's Club. We are optimistic that these trends will continue to drive traffic.
Our fresh/freezer/cooler business was softer than expected due to deflation in key dairy commodities such as milk and cheese, along with higher costs in areas such as meat.
Grocery and beverages delivered low single-digit comps, with dry grocery delivering solid comp sales.
The consumables business also delivered low single-digit comps, driven by laundry and tabletop categories.
Our technology, entertainment and office businesses, albeit posting negative comps, saw improvement from Q1 levels. We saw acceleration in certain key categories such as tablets. That was offset in part by our wireless business, which has been negatively impacted by the industry shift to installment plans.
We continue to make progress in e-commerce to build the most convenient club in the industry. We're pleased with our ongoing integration of digital and physical. E-commerce contributed approximately 60 basis points to our club comp performance during the period, and traffic to our site was up just over 20%. We delivered new club pickup options that make it easier and more convenient for members to shop online and pick up at the club.
Prepaid club pickup rolled out across the country, and we started testing mobile check-in and drive-through in several clubs. The number of members trying it for the first time during the quarter exceeded our expectations, and we expect ongoing acceptance of this service. We have also improved the assortment and pricing online. Knowing that members love the treasure hunt, we launched Shocking Values that give members access to special items at outstanding prices for a very limited time. Shocking Values products are carefully chosen based on members' interests, top trends and items from the company's most popular shopping categories. In addition, our enhancements to mobile have also built on our member experience and drove double-digit growth in traffic.
Membership income was up versus last year, with growth driven by social media campaigns as well as strong Plus renewals and upgrades due to the benefits of cash rewards. We also continue to emphasize our award-winning Sam's Club 5-3-1 MasterCard, which allows members to save inside and outside the club. We've received very positive feedback from our members on this program.
We recently hosted our Annual Supplier Summit here in Bentonville, and we were pleased with the excellent attendance and engagement. Our suppliers are very interested in the work we've done to ensure their great items are getting in front of our member base. They are supportive of the innovation and merchandising transformation we have in place. We have great items coming for the holidays.
We are focused on further progress in the Sam's Club business for the back half of the year. For the 13-week period ending October 30, 2015, we expect comp sales without fuel to be between flat and up 2%.
Now I'll turn things over to Charles. Charles?"
313055,280452627,860560,"Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Q2 2016 Pre Recorded Earnings Call, Aug 18, 2015",2015-08-18,"Earnings Calls","Walmart Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Roz. I'll start with the top line. We're pleased with the sales increases we saw in the U.S. as well as in our International businesses when considering constant currency. We believe traffic and comp sales increases for Walmart U.S. show we are on",1033,"Thanks, Roz. I'll start with the top line. We're pleased with the sales increases we saw in the U.S. as well as in our International businesses when considering constant currency. We believe traffic and comp sales increases for Walmart U.S. show we are on the right track with our investments. Walmart U.S. now has had positive comps for 4 straight quarters. As expected, these investments impacted both operating expenses and profits. In addition, Walmart U.S. experienced gross margin pressure from pharmacy and shrink that we had not expected.
Looking forward at the rest of the year, operating profit will be pressured more than we originally planned. This is primarily driven by the headwinds to Walmart U.S. gross margins that I'd just mentioned. We will continue to scrutinize and evaluate how we manage our capital in order to optimize both the customer experience and returns.
Before I turn to guidance, let me cover some other items. You may have read in our earnings release that we are reviewing leases across all of our segments. This is part of a comprehensive ongoing lease review. One item that we are focusing on and may need to be corrected relates to leases where our payment of certain structural component costs during a lessor's construction of the leased store causes us to be deemed the owner of the property for accounting purposes. This results in us capitalizing these leased assets on our balance sheet. We don't know the impact to our financial statements but believe it mostly to be a balance sheet issue at this time. We will provide more information once the review is complete.
Turning to cash. During the quarter, we spent approximately $760 million to acquire the remaining shares of Yihaodian, a strategic acquisition for e-commerce growth in China. In addition, we continued to provide shareholder returns in the form of dividends and share repurchases. And in the second quarter, we paid approximately $1.6 billion in dividends and repurchased approximately $1 billion of shares. This represents our largest share repurchase activity in the last 4 quarters. As always, we will remain opportunistic with share repurchase throughout the year. As of the end of the second quarter, we had approximately $9 billion remaining under our current $15 billion authorization.
Membership and other income increased 13.9% to $899 million. Other income primarily benefited from the gain on the sale of the bank operations in Mexico. FCPA- and compliance-related costs were approximately $30 million, comprised of approximately $23 million for the ongoing inquiries and investigations and approximately $7 million for our global compliance program and organizational enhancements.
Last year, FCPA- and compliance-related costs were $43 million in the second quarter. We expect FCPA-related expenses to continue to trend down, so we now expect our full year FCPA-related expenses to range between $130 million and $150 million. This compares to our guidance in February of $160 million to $180 million.
Return on investment for the trailing 12 months ended July 31, 2015, were 16.2%, which compares to 16.7% last year. The decline in ROI has primarily been due to continued capital investments as well as our decrease in operating income.
Earlier, Greg mentioned that as part of our commitment to EDLC, we are working on amending terms and allowance agreements with our Walmart U.S. suppliers to drive simplicity and consistency across our business. We began this effort in June, and discussions will continue over the coming months.
On a constant currency basis, inventory grew slower than sales. While we are pleased with the progress in managing our inventories, working capital is still an opportunity for us to generate stronger free cash flow.
Now let's turn our attention to guidance. In February, we indicated that we expected our full year fiscal 2016 earnings per share to range between $4.70 and $5.05. Today, we expect our fiscal 2016 earnings per share to range between $4.40 and $4.70, including a range of $0.93 and $1.05 for the third quarter.
This new range includes the following updated assumptions: First, the impact from our investments in wages, training and additional hours in our stores will be approximately $0.24, including approximately $0.08 in the third quarter. Through the first half of this year, we have incurred approximately $0.10 of the expected full year impact. This compares to our original guidance in February of approximately $0.20. As you heard from Greg earlier, our decision to increase associate hours beyond our February plan to areas of the store such as front end and stocking positions are intended to drive the most benefit for our customers.
Next, the incremental investment in Global eCommerce will range between $0.06 and $0.09. This is unchanged from our guidance in February. In the third quarter, we expect the impact to be approximately $0.02. Through the first half of this year, we have incurred approximately $0.04 of the expected full year impact.
Third, we expect a full year impact of approximately $0.11, including approximately $0.03 in the third quarter from the unplanned headwinds that I discussed earlier. The headwinds are primarily in Walmart U.S. pharmacy margins as well as higher-than-expected shrink continuing through this fiscal year.
Assuming currency exchange rates remain at current levels for the remainder of the year, we now expect the full year impact to be approximately $0.15, up $0.02 from last quarter's revised guidance of $0.13. Our effective tax rate is expected to range between 32% and 34%, unchanged from our guidance in February. Now as a reminder, our tax rate will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter and may be impacted by a number of factors, including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, valuation allowances, changes in law, outcomes of administrative audits, the impacts of discrete items and the mix of earnings among our U.S. and international operations. And in any given quarter, our effective tax rate could be higher or lower than the full year.
We will host our Annual Investment Meeting in New York on October 14. As we have in prior annual investment community meetings, we will provide an update on our capital plans at that time. We look forward to seeing you there.
Thank you for your interest in Walmart, and have a great day."

Thank you for joining us to hear more about our second quarter earnings and get an update on how things are progressing relative to our strategy. We just returned from our Walmart U.S. holiday meeting in Denver.",1628,"Thanks, Carol, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us to hear more about our second quarter earnings and get an update on how things are progressing relative to our strategy. We just returned from our Walmart U.S. holiday meeting in Denver. As you may know, we gather all of our store managers and market managers to talk about the plan for the holiday season and take stock of where we are as a business. I can tell you that the feeling in the room was as good as it's been in years. Our stores in the U.S. are getting better, our associates are happier, and our managers are leading it. I talked with our managers about how our company has always changed to serve customers, and we're in another period of change right now. 
I shared an article from Fortune Magazine that I keep in my office titled, ""Can Walmart get back the magic?"" It's a pretty strong indictment of our future, and the fun fact is that it was written in 1996. Just as it was in 1996, we will win the future of retail if we make the right choices as a business. We have a strong point of view on what that future will look like. Through technology, data and mobile, we have incredible new ways to serve customers today and the opportunities are only growing. We believe the winners in retail will be those who can bring together the best of the offline world with the best of online to serve customers however they want to shop. And we believe Walmart has unique competitive advantages in this race. 
We're moving forward on our enterprise strategy to position ourselves to win, playing offense, which is the only way to play in retail. This is true around the world. It's not just a U.S. opportunity. The changes we need to make require investment, and we're pleased with the steps we've taken. We made continued progress towards our plan this quarter. Even if it's not as fast as we'd like, the fundamentals of serving our customers are consistently improving, and it's reflected in our comps and revenue growth. 
Our strategy starts with running great stores and clubs. In Denver, we talked about the choices we're making as a business. As you know, in the first quarter, we initiated a comprehensive multiyear plan to increase starting wages and training for associates in our U.S. stores and clubs. During the second quarter, we implemented the next phase of changes to our Walmart U.S. store structure, including adding department managers. Our focus on running better stores that are clean and well stocked, have friendly associates and an efficient checkout is resonating with customers. They've always counted on Walmart to have great prices. Now we're building their trust with better in-stock and delivering an enjoyable shopping experience. 
As a result, Walmart U.S. delivered its fourth consecutive quarter of positive comp sales, as overall net sales grew nearly 5%. Customer traffic was strong again this quarter. Lower gas prices helped. I continue to be encouraged by the sales momentum that we're seeing, especially in general merchandise, and I'm confident that customers are benefiting from the investments we're making in our stores and associates. Obviously, we'd like to see it ramp higher and faster. We also recognize it won't be a linear path up into the right but we like the trend line.
Although we grew top line sales, we did fall short on managing the bottom line. During the quarter, operating expenses were higher than expected, and our gross margin was lower than planned. We are not pleased or satisfied. For the back half of the year, we will manage these items closely with a continued commitment to efficiency, cutting costs where appropriate even in a period of investment. 
Similar to the first quarter, Walmart International constant currency sales growth was solid this quarter, with Mexico and Canada delivering strong comps. We're also excited about the opportunities we see in China, despite slower economic growth and currency pressures. Our position is improving. We're gaining market share in the hypermarket category. Sam's Club continues to perform well, and we have great opportunities in e-commerce. 
Brazil and U.K. remain challenging markets but for different reasons. I'm pleased that our U.S. Sam's Club comp sales improved this quarter, and membership income was up close to 6%. Members are recognizing the enhanced value in our Plus memberships, which drove continued growth this quarter, both in club and online. 
Another piece of our plan to win is to build and run great e-commerce. We've made a lot of progress improving our mobile and e-commerce capabilities this year with several important milestones in the second quarter. You'll hear more details from Neil shortly about the investments that we've made in Pangaea, our global technology platform, and the progress on opening our 4 new fulfillment centers in the United States. These investments are designed to give customers the ability to find what they want more easily and get what they want faster while enabling us to fulfill orders in a more cost-effective manner. 
Another important milestone in the quarter was our acquisition of the remaining stake of Yihaodian, our e-commerce business in China. We're extremely excited about the growth potential of Yihaodian and the opportunity it presents over time to deliver for customers in a seamless manner. 
In the second quarter, Walmart's worldwide e-commerce sales grew approximately 16% on a constant currency basis, led by solid results in both of our U.S. businesses, Walmart and Sam's Club. 
The third leg of our strategy is to innovate the future of retail by bringing online and offline together. Here, we can see the pieces starting to come together. In the U.S., the response to our grocery home shopping offering has been strong. I'm particularly pleased with the number of repeat customers we have and the strength of our average ticket. Anecdotally, I can share that customers have told us it's changing their perception of the shopping experience at Walmart. In stores, we've been aggressively pursuing store pick-up options. And Pickup, while on a very small base in Walmart terms, is growing very quickly. 
At samsclub.com, we're also seeing stronger sales as members appreciate the convenience of our Club Pickup. We're also focused on leveraging data to bring exciting, member-relevant merchandise to our clubs and online with an eye towards growing our share of members from the higher income household demographic. 
Internationally, one of the encouraging signs we're seeing in the Mexico and Canada is that customers are not only purchasing more in our stores but also driving sales through e-commerce and mobile commerce. In China, we're expanding our omnichannel offerings with the new test of in-store pickup of online orders in a number of our Shenzhen stores. Chinese customers increasingly value the choice of both picking up their online orders in a local store and having it shipped to their homes. And we've started integrating our digital and physical offering for these customers. 
Winning in the future requires change. Change, in this case, requires investment, and investment pressures short-term earnings. Our strategy is designed to create robust and sustainable growth that will deliver returns to shareholders. We obviously want to do that in a short and long term, and it all starts by winning with customers. The good news is that our short-term investments help build the bridge to the mid and long-term. 
In the second quarter, Walmart generated more than $120 billion in revenue and delivered earnings per share of $1.08. I'm encouraged by the improvement in our constant currency sales and recognize that our bottom line results should have been better. We have margin pressure from pharmacy reimbursements and higher shrink than we expected during the quarter. These impacts, coupled with higher wage investments, impacted EPS. 
Walmart U.S. is the driver of our bottom line results. With the headwinds I just mentioned continuing the rest of the year and the level of investments we have, our operating income will continue to be pressured. We have a strong balance sheet, one that allowed us the opportunity to invest significantly in our business and the acquisitions like Yihaodian. You'll hear more about on the impact of these investments from Charles when he updates EPS guidance. 
In the short term, we expect Walmart U.S. comps to accelerate as the service from our associates gains even more traction with our customer experience. When all of our e-commerce fulfillment investments come online, we expect them to lower our distribution costs in the midterm, starting in the fourth quarter and having a larger positive impact next year. Over the longer term, we believe we'll continue to grow in key markets around the world and further integrate our store and e-commerce offerings. We know that to deliver for our shareholders in a sustainable way, we must first win with our customers and associates. So I'm confident that these are the right decisions to position Walmart for the future. 
Finally, I want to mention an important moment we'll observe these week. Nearly 10 years ago, our customers and associates on the Gulf Coast were impacted by Hurricane Katrina. Throughout the devastation that the residents of this region faced, Walmart associates demonstrated extraordinary courage and passion for these communities. I often think how simple acts of kindness can have a dramatic impact. Our people really do make the difference at Walmart, not only for our customers, but also for the communities we serve. I look forward to joining our associates and community leaders in New Orleans later this week to look back at this event and to discuss how to get better at disaster resiliency and response. 
Now I will turn it over to Neil. Neil?"

We delivered a lot during the quarter at Walmart U.S., at Sam's Club and in our key markets around the world, all possible because of the groundwork we laid over the last few years. As a quick recap, we've re-platformed both our technology and physical distribution network for e-commerce. 
The technology platform, Pangaea, is consistently improving the customer experience and conversion for walmart.com, which has led a solid sales growth. We've created a U.S. grocery home shopping business that is getting great reviews from our customers. And we developed e-commerce at Sam's Club and in key markets around the world, notably in Brazil and in China. 
All of this was made possible because we have built a talent-dense Internet technology company inside of Walmart. We're now able to create new experiences for customers across digital and physical. Overall, Global eCommerce constant currency sales grew approximately 16%. GMV, or gross merchandise value, grew approximately 18% on a constant currency basis. The highlight was solid growth in the walmart.com and samsclub.com U.S. businesses while International was soft due to economic challenges in several of our key markets. Because of the softness in International, we are resetting our Global eCommerce sales growth forecast for this fiscal year from the mid-20s to a range in the mid to high teens. 
As I mentioned, both businesses in the U.S. are going very well. A great example of how everything came to life was our walmart.com Dare To Compare event that we kicked off in July. This event created a perfect opportunity to highlight that customers can trust us to offer them the assortment they want at low prices every day, not just during a 1-day sale. We were able to use our technology platform and sophisticated pricing algorithms to help us track and deliver lower pricing than competitors. 
Given that we've tripled our assortment in the past 3 years, we had more items for customers to shop. Customers could then choose how to get their purchases in the most convenient way for them. We offer customers the option to get orders shipped to their door or to a store with same-day pickup. In fact, it led to our biggest day of the year so far for same-day pickup. The flexibility of our new platform allowed us to move very quickly, and the new site delivered a better, faster shopping experience to customers. And those customers who were shopping on mobile devices had an improved experience, thanks to the responsive design we rolled out in the quarter. 
We are using e-commerce to bring both new customers to Walmart as well as to deepen our relationship with our existing customers. On the largest day of our Dare To Compare event, we saw more than double the number of new customers to walmart.com than a typical day. 
During the second quarter, we had a number of milestones for Walmart U.S. We migrated 100% of customers to the new cart and checkout based on our new technology platform. We delivered responsive design to dynamically adjust the site to whatever device was being used. We started rolling out a significantly enhanced store search capability on mobile. We opened 2 new automated online fulfillment centers, each bigger than 20 football fields, and we have 2 more coming this quarter. These fulfillment centers are strategically located across geographies and will begin to serve our customers this holiday. They will be cornerstones of our fulfillment network going forward. We also started a targeted test of an unlimited free shipping program priced at $50 for 1 year. 
I'm also pleased with the expansion in progress on grocery home shopping in the U.S. We're in 5 markets and sales continued to grow because customers, especially moms with children, love the convenience of ordering online and having their car loaded at a pickup location. 
In addition to expanding pick-up in stores, we are offering customers remote pick up points that are convenient to them, including their corporate campuses. In fact, we launched 1 here at our campus in San Bruno. 
We have also made great progress at Sam's Club, where we  have been tightly aligned with clubs to deliver a better member experience, which has helped deliver high growth on samsclub.com. Sam's delivered new Club Pickup options to make it easier and more convenient for members to shop online and pick up at the club. Prepaid Club Pickup rolled out across the country, and we started testing mobile check-in and drive-through in several clubs. We have also improved the assortment and pricing online. Knowing that members love the treasure hunt, we launched Shocking Values on samsclub.com that gives members access to special items at outstanding prices for a very limited time. 
Our enhancements to mobile have also built on our member experience, and we've seen double-digit growth in mobile. 
As I mentioned earlier, sales in our international markets were softer during the second quarter than we've seen previously. While still growing, grocery home shopping in the U.K. has slowed down, commensurate with the market. Asda opened 14 petrol stations during the second quarter, and these were enabled with click-and-collect lockers for both grocery and general merchandise items. 
In Brazil, the overall economic environment is very challenging, but we have continued to take share in this down market. We are growing sales faster than the market and we are continuing to see growth in GMV. Our team has used this opportunity to build a lean and nimble operating model that can succeed in any market condition. 
As Doug mentioned, we acquired the remaining shares of Yihaodian in China. In 2012, we became 51% owners, and we have seen strong growth since that time. Yihaodian now has about 100 million registered customers, more than twice as many as when we first invested. Our primary goal is to continue to accelerate Yihaodian's core e-commerce business and maintain strong local Chinese expertise. Now that we are the sole owners, we will be expanding our leadership team from within the Yihaodian business, from within Walmart and from the e-commerce industry in China. We will also leverage Walmart's global reach and scale to better benefit Yihaodian, including global sourcing. 
Wang Lu, who joined us earlier this year to lead Global eCommerce in Asia, is overseeing Yihaodian. He brings a strong background in developing digital businesses in China. China is an exciting, dynamic, large and competitive market. We are excited about our long-term opportunity in China. 
We're delivering important e-commerce capabilities around the world. And ultimately, these capabilities are enabling experiences that impact the stores and clubs as well as e-commerce. Customers see us as Walmart and Sam's Club, not a collection of shopping channels. We are delivering experiences on apps and sites and in stores and clubs that come together to differentiate us in the eyes of our customers and members. To remain in leadership position, we must continue to invest in technology and people to deliver the customer and member experiences.

Our bottom line came in substantially below what was planned.  Three major factors contributed to our underperformance: a decline in gross margin, primarily related to lower-than-expected pharmacy reimbursements and accelerating pressures in shrink; as well as a higher-than-planned investment in store hours, which was essential to improving the customer experience. 
I want to be straightforward. These issues will present continuing profit challenges for the remainder of the year. We are certainly disappointed, but we are not standing still. We know we can do better and we will.
For the Walmart U.S. business, doing better means staying focused on an aggressive strategic plan to improve the customer experience in our stores and deliver sustainable top and bottom line growth for the long term. This strategic plan includes a number of large, specific projects that fit within our broader focus on assortment, price, access and customer experience. This plan requires significant investments, and we are confident we are making the right decisions for our customers and our business. 
Amid the investment, we are focused on growing sales and controlling costs, as you would expect from Walmart. We are staying true to our roots. However, we are committed to improving the customer experience, and we will protect the investments necessary to achieve this goal. 
Let me dig in a bit on details. I'm pleased to report that we're seeing progress on our top line, as net sales for the second quarter were up 4.8% and comp sales increased 1.5%. We also improved inventory, making our goal to grow inventory less than sales growth. Additionally, we have seen improvements in traffic and customer experience from these actions. Each decision was in line with the strategy we laid out and progress has been steady and consistent. 
Let me share with you some of our accomplishments in the first half of this fiscal year, many of which occurred during the second quarter. First, across all our formats, we're focused on improving the shopping experience for our customers. We've continued our Checkout Promise initiative, ensuring more registers are open during peak shopping hours. We've invested in providing customers with a cleaner, better-maintained shopping environment. And we've added approximately 1,700 items, primarily in grocery, to warehouse stock, driving faster replenishment times to the stores and ensuring the product is available for our customers. 
Second, we are investing in our associates. This April, we raised the minimum starting wage in our stores to $9 per hour, resulting in over 500,000 associates receiving a raise. This new wage structure is expanding our applicant pool. We're also introducing 8,000 new department manager positions, a more focused role that allows the associate to be trained and become more knowledgeable with the areas they support, providing our customers with a better experience in the store. Additionally, we are continuing to focus on career development for all our associates. 
Finally, we've increased the amount an associate will receive upon being promoted into higher levels of responsibility. These changes gave pay raises to an additional 150,000 associates who are critical to improving the in-store experience. 
Alongside wage improvement and to support career development, we're rolling out new training programs designed to help associates grow their careers at Walmart and provide a better experience for our customers. These programs, which will be rolled out this fall,  are hands-on, instructor-led and tailored specifically to a position, ensuring the training is relevant to an associate's current role or to a future role they aspire to achieve. And we're piloting new scheduling tools that allow associates to select shifts that work best for them while ensuring the store is staffed appropriately for customer demand. This program is reducing associate absences and turnover in the pilot stores and providing managers with better visibility to coverage gaps.  
Lastly, we're investing in operational improvements. In the second quarter, we began an overhaul of our inventory management systems, routines and schedules. The Customer Availability Program, or CAP, will supply decade-old processes with modern technology and new routines that keep associates on the sales floor rather than in the stock room. Processes for truck deliveries at peak times and for stocking shelves have been significantly simplified, freeing more associates to be on the floor during peak customer traffic. We've also began rolling out MC 40 technology to all department managers. This smaller, more intuitive hand-held tool allows us to replace the current devices with one that can provide enhanced technology. This will simplify how our associates work in a way that was not possible before. Additionally, this month, store managers are receiving mobile tablets that will help them stay connected to the business while keeping them on the sales floor to help our customers and associates. 
As part of our focus on EDLC, we've reduced supplier marketing funds that have traditionally offset a portion of our advertising expenses as we work towards better product costs. This will translate into lower prices for our customers. As a result of this reduction, we've lowered our second quarter print advertising count from 20 pieces last year to just 4 pieces this year. Moreover, since June, we've been working on amending terms and allowance agreements with our suppliers, driving consistency and simplification across our business. We've also reinstated our shrink training program for our asset protection and store management teams as part of our efforts to improve in this area. 
And finally, we've reduced feature and modular changes across the store, ensuring there is space for each feature and associate hours to make these changes. Along with this reduction, we've moved some feature and modular decisions back to the stores, allowing them to set features that best align to their local customer needs and preferences. Whilst there are numerous initiatives being landed across our business, these are being executed in a coordinated and systematic fashion to allow us to achieve our full potential. 
We're pleased with our progress in the first half of the year, but we recognize that we still have a lot to do to meet our long-term goals, and that it will take time to get where we want to be. I recognize these actions have, and will continue to, pressure our bottom line, but they are already driving meaningful improvements. Over the past year, we have seen growth in store traffic and comp sales. Additionally, our customer satisfaction scores continue to improve. Every day, a sample of customers in every store rate us across a number of metrics, including providing a fast checkout, friendly service and a clean store environment. Based on the ratings from these surveys, we can see that our stores are making significant improvement from their baseline, and we expect that trend to continue. Improving the customer experience is fundamental to our success. 
Finally, we're proud of the impact these decisions have had on our associates. Nearly 80% of our 1.2 million U.S. store associates participated in our annual associate survey administered during this quarter. Our associate's engagement has increased approximately 100 basis points this year after remaining static for the prior 2 years. 
We've remained committed to the strategy we laid out for you earlier this year, ensuring we're making the right decisions to benefit both our customers and our associates and to drive long-term sustainable growth.  We know we will continue to face considerable challenges, but our goal for the back half of this year is to build on the improvements in top line and customer experience, and our list of things to accomplish is even longer. 
Now let's cover the details on our financial performance for the second quarter. Net sales increased $3.4 billion or 4.8% versus last year. Comparable store sales were up 1.5% and driven by strength in traffic, which increased 1.3%. Traffic was particularly strong on the general merchandise and softlines side of the box. Seasonal categories resonated well with customers, and changes in replenishment strategies ensured product was on the shelves when and where customers needed it. Finally, e-commerce sales contributed approximately 20 basis points to our overall comp. Neil will share the details on our progress on technology infrastructure and fulfillment for walmart.com orders. We are pleased that these efforts will position us even more competitively for the back half of the year. 
Our grocery home shopping pilots remain underway in 5 key markets, and we're happy with increased customer counts in these areas. 
All formats delivered positive comp sales growth this quarter, in particular, comps in Neighborhood Markets were up approximately 7.3%. We remain encouraged by the performance of this format. As mentioned, the general merchandise and softlines side of the supercenter performed well this quarter, driving strong traffic and sales growth through relevant offerings and better in-stock positions. While warm weather, particularly in July, helped propel sales in seasonal categories, our ongoing focus on the basics across apparel, indoor home and the hardlines drove momentum throughout the quarter. Additionally, while we saw our shift to back-to-school sales into August as several states adjusted the timing of their tax-free weekends, early indications are positive. 
Health and wellness benefited from continued growth in pharmacy scripts, along with new brands in optical and a focus on better in-stock positions in OTC. 
And while we saw improved trends in our entertainment business from better in-stocks and stronger online sales, comps continue to run negative, pressured by ongoing industry declines and the shift from postpaid to installment wireless plans. 
On the grocery side of the box, consumables had positive comps, driven by a strong base business. New products, particularly in chemicals, drove additional momentum. More notably, continued pressure in food from declining inflation negatively impacted our total box comp by approximately 60 basis points. 
Moving on to the remainder of our financials. Gross profit rate declined 41 basis points this quarter. As I said before, this was driven by a handful of key issues. 
Let's talk about pharmacy. Reflecting industry-wide trends, we are seeing reduced reimbursement rates from pharmacy benefit managers, which is negatively impacting gross margin. We are also seeing a lower mix of higher margin cash transactions, reflecting a marketplace shift in which more customers are now benefiting from greater drug insurance coverage. While we are taking a number of actions to lessen the impact, we expect to have pressure on pharmacy for the rest of the fiscal year. Additionally, inventory shrinkage was meaningfully higher-than-planned for the quarter. We are reviewing the end-to-end inventory management process, with a special focus on shrinkage and working to close gaps. Investments are being made in training programs for store and asset protection associates as well as investments in staffing in high shrink areas of the store. But it will take time to see results, so this will impact us versus planned for the rest of the year. 
Operating expenses deleveraged 50 basis points to last year, primarily due to our higher-than-planned investments in customer experience. These investments included the planned wage rate increases and structural changes I mentioned earlier as well as additional associate hours needed to improve customer service. This quarter, we thoughtfully added back hours to specific areas of the store, such as the front-end and stocking positions. This was a strategic decision to invest where we can drive the most benefit for our customers. These adds were significant and more than we had planned, but we felt it was the right decision to meet the goals we have set, and we've started to see the investment translate into better top line performance. The focus on customer experience, along with ongoing investments in e-commerce and the reduction in gross profit rate, led to an operating income decline of approximately 8.2% versus last year. 
Moving on. In the second quarter, total inventory grew slower than the rate of sales at 2.2%. Comp store inventory declined by 2.4% versus last year. The majority of this improvement came from decisions we made regarding replenishment strategies, whereby we strategically moved inventory for certain items upstream from our store backrooms to our distribution centers. Additionally, we continued our focus on clearing our backrooms of excess inventory, improving operational efficiency in the stores. These actions, along with better management of seasonal inventory and reducing modular changes and feature shipments to the stores, allowed us to reduce comp store inventory while improving both in-stock levels and sales. Inventory management will continue to be an ongoing focus for us. 
This quarter, we opened 16 supercenters, including relocations and expansions. Additionally, we opened 22 traditional-format Neighborhood Markets, and the final 6 of our smaller-format Neighborhood Market test locations. 
As we think about future store openings, we'll continue to focus on quality versus quantity. Having opened more than 350 Neighborhood Markets in the past 2 years, we have a better understanding of what customers value most, from the choice of location to the size of the box to the product offerings. Based on these learnings, we've decided not to pursue a number of potential locations as they would not provide the type of quality experience customers expect from a Neighborhood Market. We now expect to open a total of 160 to 170 Neighborhood Markets in fiscal 2016, including the 51 locations already opened. Our previous forecast was to open between 180 and 200 Neighborhood Markets. We're still on track to build approximately 60 to 70 supercenters this year, which was our original forecast. We know that we still have a lot of work to do to achieve the long-term goals we have set our business. The investments we are making, along with the headwinds we've mentioned, will weigh more heavily on operating income than initially forecasted. 
Amid the pressures, we are thoughtfully evaluating every decision and use of company resources as we go through the back half the year. But we are confident in the direction we are headed. We are seeing improvements every day from sales and traffic growth to increased customer satisfaction to more engaged associates. 
For the third quarter, we expect our ongoing investments in stores and customer experience to drive further sales momentum, offset partially by continued deflationary pressures in food, especially in meat and dairy. For the 13-week period ending October 30, we anticipate a comp sales increase of approximately 1% to 2%. Last year, our comp sales for the period were up 0.5%. 
Now I'll turn it over to Dave for an update on Walmart International. Dave?"

The international business had a fairly solid quarter given tough economic environments in certain markets and ongoing currency impacts. In Q2, we saw accelerating sales growth in Mexico and Canada, offsetting ongoing challenges in the U.K., Brazil and China. Overall, I continue to be enthusiastic about our long-term prospects to profitably grow our international business in a controlled and disciplined manner. 
Similar to last quarter, the performance in Mexico and Canada continued to be solid. Our Mexico team has done an excellent job reenergizing that business, driving strong performance across all formats. We continue to see significant growth opportunities in Mexico, along with the improving core business. In Canada, we continue to gain market share, driven by our fifth consecutive quarter of positive comps. These 2 markets will continue to play a key role in our back-half performance. I'll provide more details on key market performance in a few minutes. 
Now let's jump to our overall results. In the second quarter, net sales grew 2.8% on a constant currency basis despite headwinds in Latin America from lapping last year's World Cup and the timing shift of Easter. The U.S. dollar remains strong, which led to a currency impact of $4.2 billion, resulting in a 9.6% sales decline on a reported basis. Comp sales were positive in Mexico and Canada while the U.K., Brazil and China posted negative comps. All other markets had positive comp sales. 
Operating income declined 1.5% on a constant currency basis, negatively impacted by increased employment claim contingencies and higher-than-expected utility rates in Brazil as well as continued investments in Global eCommerce. This was partially offset by gains from the sale of the bank operations in Mexico and certain properties in Canada. Excluding the impact of these items, operating income would have grown faster than sales. With the currency exchange impact, operating income decreased 14.2%. On a constant-currency basis, inventory grew faster than sales at 4.2%, driven primarily by slower sales in the U.K. On a reported basis, inventory declined 10.5%. 
Now let's discuss market results, presented on a-constant currency basis for our largest markets. In all countries except Brazil and China, financial results are inclusive of e-commerce. 
Let's start with the U.K. The market remained highly competitive during the second quarter, with significant ongoing vouchering from Asda's competitors. Grocery deflation remained at near record levels as prices decreased 1.7% versus last year for the 12 weeks ended June 21 according to Kantar. The total market declined 0.1%, a reversal from a slight growth in Q1 in part due to the timing of Easter. 
U.K. sales declined 4.1%, and comp sales, excluding fuel, were down 5.2%, driven by declining traffic, especially in fresh food categories. Grocery home shopping sales continue to grow, and we remain focused on driving improvements to our customer metrics. Operating income increased year-over-year, mostly driven by the timing of Easter and margin improvement in nonfood categories from a favorable mix shift. 
For the rest of the year, we're focused on strengthening the assortment in private label and improving pricing on national brands. We will continue to drive aggressive cost-reduction initiatives supporting our GBP 1 billion 5-year price investment strategy. We're investing to improve store standards and on-shelf availability and to maintain recent improvements in grocery home shopping service metrics. In addition, we launched our new branding and marketing campaign based around adoption of the Walmart ""Save Money, Live Better"" mission to help build brand and quality perception. Collectively, these actions are designed to address some of the challenges we face in store traffic and fresh food. 
Let's now discuss Mexico, which released their earnings on July 21. Please note that Walmex release is under IFRS and the results here are under U.S. GAAP, therefore, some numbers may differ. 
Consolidated Walmex net sales increased 7.2%, with solid comp sales in both Mexico and Central America. Mexico sales grew 7.4% and comp sales increased 5.4%. We continue to see strong comps across all formats, including Sam's Club, which delivered 4.6% comp growth. Self-service continues to gain share and delivered 190 basis point improvement in market share, according to ANTAD. General merchandise performed very well at 4.9% comp growth despite a tough year-over-year comparison from last year's World Cup. Operating income grew faster than sales. 
The sale of our banking unit in the second quarter, along with the Vips restaurant divestiture last fiscal year, helps us focus on our core business, which is our strength. We are intent on being the most relevant retailer of our customers through excellent prices, great assortment and consistent execution. We remain confident that the steps we have in place to improve Walmex are working and will serve as a catalyst for our business over the long term.
In Canada, sales grew 5.4% and comps grew 3.9% in a low-growth economic environment, driven by strong performance in food, health and wellness, home and toys. We're investing in price and value as we look for opportunities to lower costs in our business. We continued to gain share in our core categories of food, health and wellness and infant categories, as per Nielsen data for the 12 weeks ended July 18. Additionally, our Canadian e-commerce business grew sales at more than 40%, albeit on a small base. In July, we successfully launched our online grocery business, starting with 11 store pickup locations in the Ottawa area. In addition to top line performance, we remain focused on our low-cost operating model. Operating income grew significantly faster than sales.
In the quarter, we finalized the acquisition of 13 stores and 1 distribution center from a former competitor. 7 of the stores are planned to open by the end of this fiscal year, and the remainder will open next year. In May, we also closed the sale of a portfolio of properties under development with our shopping center joint venture partner, which generated the previously mentioned gain. Overall, I'm pleased with our results in Canada and expect consistent, profitable growth to continue.
In Brazil, the country is facing a prolonged recession and the highest inflation rate in 12 years, driven in part by electricity rate increases of more than 50% versus last year, which is driving a cautious approach to consumption. For Walmart Brazil, net sales declined 0.9%, and comp sales were down 1%, largely impacted by the World Cup event held during the same period last year and the timing of the Easter holiday. We experienced a decline in the hypermarket format, driven by electronics, but are pleased with the double-digit comp sales increases in the wholesale business.
Brazil operating income declined for the quarter, driven by the previously mentioned employment claims and rapidly rising utility rates compared to last year. The management team is making progress on the operational, people and legal fronts to address ongoing employment claims as they work through a challenging business environment. In addition, they are focused on key leverage initiatives to increase store productivity and help offset inflationary pressure.
We continue to make progress on converting stores and distribution centers to standardized systems, which provides better visibility to business results, leverages costs and reduces compliance risk. Last year, we integrated all of our stores in the south region. This year, we're focused on converting the south dry DC network as well as approximately 100 stores in the northeast. Next year, we plan to convert the remaining northeast stores and dry DCs to this unified platform.
Despite challenging market conditions, the e-commerce business in Brazil continues to perform well. Sales grew double digits and outpaced the Brazilian e-commerce market. Market share rose from 8% to 8.5% in Q2, according to eBit, an e-commerce research firm, with share gains in several categories, including babies, toys and games and auto parts. Marketplace sales growth was also strong.
Last, let's discuss China. Walmart China's sales grew 1.2%, while comp sales declined 1.4%. Walmart increased market share in fast-moving consumer goods in the hypermarket channel and maintained share in the modern trade channel, which includes smaller-format stores, for the 12 weeks ended June 28, according to Nielsen.
While there are ongoing market headwinds from slower economic growth, we're confident we'll continue to deliver sustainable growth in China. Walmart continues to outperform the market and gain market share in hypermarkets for the 10th quarter in a row. We're focused on driving efficiency, reducing expenses and strengthening our portfolio through We Operate For Less and We Buy for Less initiatives. These actions contributed to operating income growing significantly faster than sales. The team continues to set the foundation for our business, positioning it for increased growth and profitability in the future.
Throughout the quarter, we made significant progress in our omnichannel efforts. Walmart China launched Walmart To Go in 23 stores in Shenzhen, bringing customers the convenience of ordering through the Walmart app and the choice of pick up in store or delivery to their home. We're also testing ways to bring added payment choices and the convenience of mobile payment to our customers in our stores.
In addition, as Doug and Neil mentioned, we increased our ownership of Yihaodian, our China e-commerce platform, to 100%. We're excited about the opportunities to deliver new experiences to customers in China and further leverage Yihaodian and Walmart's global and local assets.
In the second quarter, Yihaodian grew sales double digits, driven by strong growth in orders and continued improvement in conversion rates. Mobile contributed more than 55% of orders.
As I wrap up the International portion of today's call, I'd like to express how pleased I am with our associates around the globe and their efforts in driving consistent and solid performance in the first half. We're growing comp sales across the majority of our portfolio and stepping up investments in e-commerce while setting our business up for long-term success.
We expect continued economic challenges in the U.K. and Brazil but also expect continued strong performance in Mexico and Canada. We're optimistic about our growth prospects in China despite a softening economy, and we'll continue to invest in that market.
Now I'll turn it over to Roz for an update on Sam's. Roz?"
313055,280452627,860647,"Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Q2 2016 Pre Recorded Earnings Call, Aug 18, 2015",2015-08-18,"Earnings Calls","Walmart Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Dave.

In the second quarter, we grew comp sales, without fuel, 1.3% and net sales 2.8%. Our square footage also grew due to 3 new clubs opening during the quarter. We are accelerating our efforts to strengthen the Sam's Club member value proposition.
Since last year, our investments have been targeted to better merchandise assortment, membership acquisition, engagement and retention, new programs to enhance member value and our investment in e-commerce. By staying on a consistent path and driving these priorities, we continue to simplify our business. We saw the benefits in improved membership trends and higher traffic during the second quarter. What is most important is the overwhelmingly positive feedback we're hearing from our members, not just about our clubs but also about improvement in the e-commerce experience. I'll provide some examples shortly.
Now on to the numbers. With fuel, operating income declined by 13.4% to $428 million. Fuel profitability improved from Q1 but is still below planned levels and below last year's dollars. For additional results with fuel, please reference the accompanying presentation.
Net sales without fuel grew 2.8%. Comp sales without fuel were up 1.3%, with ticket contributing 80 basis points and traffic 50 basis points. Savings member traffic was positive, partially offset by a decline in business member traffic.
Our gross profit rate declined 38 basis points versus last year, driven in part by our ongoing cash rewards investment, increased seasonal markdowns and industry headwinds in pharmacy prescriptions, similar to those referenced in the Walmart U.S. business.
Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased by 13 basis points due to continued investments in new clubs, technology and e-commerce. Membership and other income grew 6.1%, with membership income up 5.8%, driven in large part by Plus upgrades. As a result of both of these factors, operating income declined 9.7% versus last year.
We continue to manage our inventory appropriately. Inventory without fuel grew by 3.4% driven in part by new clubs.
In our merchandising areas, let me start by highlighting 2 of our stronger categories: home and apparel and health and wellness. Home and apparel delivered low single-digit comp sales, with strength in apparel offset by softness in kitchen electrics, domestics and furniture.
Health and wellness posted mid-single-digit comps, driven by generics and by increased member adoption of our Free/4/10 prescription program. Since the launch of this program last quarter for Plus members, we see that those who utilize the program transfer, on average, 2/3 of their scripts to Sam's Club. We are optimistic that these trends will continue to drive traffic.
Our fresh/freezer/cooler business was softer than expected due to deflation in key dairy commodities such as milk and cheese, along with higher costs in areas such as meat.
Grocery and beverages delivered low single-digit comps, with dry grocery delivering solid comp sales.
The consumables business also delivered low single-digit comps, driven by laundry and tabletop categories.
Our technology, entertainment and office businesses, albeit posting negative comps, saw improvement from Q1 levels. We saw acceleration in certain key categories such as tablets. That was offset in part by our wireless business, which has been negatively impacted by the industry shift to installment plans.
We continue to make progress in e-commerce to build the most convenient club in the industry. We're pleased with our ongoing integration of digital and physical. E-commerce contributed approximately 60 basis points to our club comp performance during the period, and traffic to our site was up just over 20%. We delivered new club pickup options that make it easier and more convenient for members to shop online and pick up at the club.
Prepaid club pickup rolled out across the country, and we started testing mobile check-in and drive-through in several clubs. The number of members trying it for the first time during the quarter exceeded our expectations, and we expect ongoing acceptance of this service. We have also improved the assortment and pricing online. Knowing that members love the treasure hunt, we launched Shocking Values that give members access to special items at outstanding prices for a very limited time. Shocking Values products are carefully chosen based on members' interests, top trends and items from the company's most popular shopping categories. In addition, our enhancements to mobile have also built on our member experience and drove double-digit growth in traffic.
Membership income was up versus last year, with growth driven by social media campaigns as well as strong Plus renewals and upgrades due to the benefits of cash rewards. We also continue to emphasize our award-winning Sam's Club 5-3-1 MasterCard, which allows members to save inside and outside the club. We've received very positive feedback from our members on this program.
We recently hosted our Annual Supplier Summit here in Bentonville, and we were pleased with the excellent attendance and engagement. Our suppliers are very interested in the work we've done to ensure their great items are getting in front of our member base. They are supportive of the innovation and merchandising transformation we have in place. We have great items coming for the holidays.
We are focused on further progress in the Sam's Club business for the back half of the year. For the 13-week period ending October 30, 2015, we expect comp sales without fuel to be between flat and up 2%.
Now I'll turn things over to Charles. Charles?"
313055,280452627,860647,"Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Q2 2016 Pre Recorded Earnings Call, Aug 18, 2015",2015-08-18,"Earnings Calls","Walmart Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Roz. I'll start with the top line. We're pleased with the sales increases we saw in the U.S. as well as in our International businesses when considering constant currency. We believe traffic and comp sales increases for Walmart U.S. show we are on",1033,"Thanks, Roz. I'll start with the top line. We're pleased with the sales increases we saw in the U.S. as well as in our International businesses when considering constant currency. We believe traffic and comp sales increases for Walmart U.S. show we are on the right track with our investments. Walmart U.S. now has had positive comps for 4 straight quarters. As expected, these investments impacted both operating expenses and profits. In addition, Walmart U.S. experienced gross margin pressure from pharmacy and shrink that we had not expected.
Looking forward at the rest of the year, operating profit will be pressured more than we originally planned. This is primarily driven by the headwinds to Walmart U.S. gross margins that I'd just mentioned. We will continue to scrutinize and evaluate how we manage our capital in order to optimize both the customer experience and returns.
Before I turn to guidance, let me cover some other items. You may have read in our earnings release that we are reviewing leases across all of our segments. This is part of a comprehensive ongoing lease review. One item that we are focusing on and may need to be corrected relates to leases where our payment of certain structural component costs during a lessor's construction of the leased store causes us to be deemed the owner of the property for accounting purposes. This results in us capitalizing these leased assets on our balance sheet. We don't know the impact to our financial statements but believe it mostly to be a balance sheet issue at this time. We will provide more information once the review is complete.
Turning to cash. During the quarter, we spent approximately $760 million to acquire the remaining shares of Yihaodian, a strategic acquisition for e-commerce growth in China. In addition, we continued to provide shareholder returns in the form of dividends and share repurchases. And in the second quarter, we paid approximately $1.6 billion in dividends and repurchased approximately $1 billion of shares. This represents our largest share repurchase activity in the last 4 quarters. As always, we will remain opportunistic with share repurchase throughout the year. As of the end of the second quarter, we had approximately $9 billion remaining under our current $15 billion authorization.
Membership and other income increased 13.9% to $899 million. Other income primarily benefited from the gain on the sale of the bank operations in Mexico. FCPA- and compliance-related costs were approximately $30 million, comprised of approximately $23 million for the ongoing inquiries and investigations and approximately $7 million for our global compliance program and organizational enhancements.
Last year, FCPA- and compliance-related costs were $43 million in the second quarter. We expect FCPA-related expenses to continue to trend down, so we now expect our full year FCPA-related expenses to range between $130 million and $150 million. This compares to our guidance in February of $160 million to $180 million.
Return on investment for the trailing 12 months ended July 31, 2015, were 16.2%, which compares to 16.7% last year. The decline in ROI has primarily been due to continued capital investments as well as our decrease in operating income.
Earlier, Greg mentioned that as part of our commitment to EDLC, we are working on amending terms and allowance agreements with our Walmart U.S. suppliers to drive simplicity and consistency across our business. We began this effort in June, and discussions will continue over the coming months.
On a constant currency basis, inventory grew slower than sales. While we are pleased with the progress in managing our inventories, working capital is still an opportunity for us to generate stronger free cash flow.
Now let's turn our attention to guidance. In February, we indicated that we expected our full year fiscal 2016 earnings per share to range between $4.70 and $5.05. Today, we expect our fiscal 2016 earnings per share to range between $4.40 and $4.70, including a range of $0.93 and $1.05 for the third quarter.
This new range includes the following updated assumptions: First, the impact from our investments in wages, training and additional hours in our stores will be approximately $0.24, including approximately $0.08 in the third quarter. Through the first half of this year, we have incurred approximately $0.10 of the expected full year impact. This compares to our original guidance in February of approximately $0.20. As you heard from Greg earlier, our decision to increase associate hours beyond our February plan to areas of the store such as front end and stocking positions are intended to drive the most benefit for our customers.
Next, the incremental investment in Global eCommerce will range between $0.06 and $0.09. This is unchanged from our guidance in February. In the third quarter, we expect the impact to be approximately $0.02. Through the first half of this year, we have incurred approximately $0.04 of the expected full year impact.
Third, we expect a full year impact of approximately $0.11, including approximately $0.03 in the third quarter from the unplanned headwinds that I discussed earlier. The headwinds are primarily in Walmart U.S. pharmacy margins as well as higher-than-expected shrink continuing through this fiscal year.
Assuming currency exchange rates remain at current levels for the remainder of the year, we now expect the full year impact to be approximately $0.15, up $0.02 from last quarter's revised guidance of $0.13. Our effective tax rate is expected to range between 32% and 34%, unchanged from our guidance in February. Now as a reminder, our tax rate will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter and may be impacted by a number of factors, including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, valuation allowances, changes in law, outcomes of administrative audits, the impacts of discrete items and the mix of earnings among our U.S. and international operations. And in any given quarter, our effective tax rate could be higher or lower than the full year.
We will host our Annual Investment Meeting in New York on October 14. As we have in prior annual investment community meetings, we will provide an update on our capital plans at that time. We look forward to seeing you there.
Thank you for your interest in Walmart, and have a great day."

Thank you for joining us to hear more about our third-quarter earnings as well as the strategy we shared at our Annual Meeting for the investment community last month.Overall, we had a good quarter. We delive",1696,"Thanks, Pauleen, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us to hear more about our third-quarter earnings as well as the strategy we shared at our Annual Meeting for the investment community last month.
Overall, we had a good quarter. We delivered earnings per share well within our guidance range, recorded our fifth straight quarter of positive comps at Walmart U.S., and had solid International sales and profit growth on a constant currency basis.
At the same time, we still have plenty of work to do, and there are areas of our business that must perform better. Our earnings per share were $1.03, and we posted total revenue of $117.4 billion. I want to highlight that on a constant currency basis, our total revenue would have been $122.4 billion. That's growth of $3.4 billion or 2.8% on a constant currency basis, which is solid growth.
Even if the percentage doesn't sound high because we have such a large denominator, not many companies grow by this amount in a quarter. I called this out because I don't want the currency impacts to obscure the strength of our business. We are a growth company and we're growing.
As we expected, operating income continued to be pressured by our decision to invest in our frontline associates. To improve the store experience for our customers and create a bridge to our future where digital capabilities will play an increasing role in our stores, we're making a $1.2 billion planned investment in our people this year that we understood would impact near-term operating income. This is by far the biggest driver of the decline in consolidated operating income.
Before going into the details, I want to take a step back to talk about our strategy. At our investor meeting last month, we shared more detail than usual about the next 3 years of our growth plan. We've never been a company that manages only for the short-term, and that's certainly true during this period of change. Although investments in our people and technology impact near-term earnings, they will help us deliver sustainable growth and returns to shareholders over time. We're confident these are the right steps because we know where and how we're going to win. We will be the first to deliver a seamless shopping experience at scale. No matter how you choose to shop with us through your mobile device, online, in a store or a combination, it will be fast and easy. Online retailers are testing physical store experiences because they recognize the same customer desire that we do. There's a race to do this right, but only Walmart can bring together a dense network of stores, supported by a supply chain and systems like ours, with an emerging set of digital capabilities to win with customers.
As we create this seamless experience, we're positioning for growth in 5 key areas. First, we'll continue to win on value. We've won on value in the past and that won't change. Second, convenience is increasingly important as customers want to save both money and time. Third, we will always work to be great merchants, whether in-stores or online. Fourth, we're focused on the key geographies for customer growth which are North America and China. Finally, we want to appeal to a blend of income levels. The way we're approaching e-commerce, Neighborhood Markets, Sam's Club, grocery pickup and other areas will appeal to value-conscious customers of all demographics. We already serve customers from all income levels around the world, but we have an opportunity to get even stronger.
By taking these steps, we will grow the company faster. We will add between $45 billion and $60 billion of revenue to the company in the next 3 years. That's a lot of growth. It just happens to be on a big base.
Returning to this quarter's results, one of the most important takeaways is that our U.S. stores continue to improve with total net sales up nearly 4%. In addition to positive comp sales, Walmart U.S. had its fourth straight quarter of positive traffic. We're now lapping positive comp sales and building on our progress. Our customers are telling us that our efforts around clean, fast and friendly are resonating. 
Neighborhood Markets continued to show strong sales led by our newer stores and have posted positive comps for 19 consecutive quarters. A key part of creating a seamless shopping experience is to have great stores, and we feel good about where we're heading. We also made strides in the U.S. on adding critical capabilities to our supply chain. In the third quarter, we opened a new e-commerce fulfillment center in Atlanta with more than 1 million square feet of space. This is our fifth next-generation fulfillment center.
As we build out our e-commerce capabilities, we are deepening our digital relationships with our customers. We've accelerated our expansion of online grocery pickup, and we've seen that customers who start using online grocery spend nearly 50% more than similar customers who shop only in-stores. This is the customer we're going after. The shopper in our sweet spot who accesses Walmart in multiple ways.
We also began the chainwide use of a mobile service that can tell us when a customer is coming to pick up an online general merchandise order before they even walk into the store. And we launched a new digital wish list that you can build at home or simply by scanning items in the store. We expect more than 210 million visits to our app in November and December, up from 18 million in 2012.
Last month, we told you about our longer-term plans to grow e-commerce sales and GMV. That plan anticipates ebbs and flows along the way, but we are confident in our targets. We continue to expect to grow mid- to high teens for this fiscal year. 
During the third quarter, global e-commerce sales and GMV growth both came in at around 10%. This was due primarily to continued economic challenges in our major international markets including Brazil, China and the U.K. 
In the U.S., where we've seen good growth for the year, we continue to make progress on key initiatives but we know we have more work to do. I was pleased that SamsClub.com continue to deliver strong growth. At Walmart International, we're pleased with the solid 3.2% sales growth on a constant currency basis. Operating income grew faster than sales at 8.5% excluding currency. Our North American markets delivered strong performance and Mexico, in particular, is starting to fire on all cylinders. I'm pleased with our momentum in these markets. We continue to face specific challenges in the U.K. and Brazil.
China remains a huge long-term opportunity. We started in China in 1996. We've grown the business, reached profitability years ago, and grown our level of profitability. We obviously learned a lot about Chinese customers and the market, and that's an asset. A few weeks ago, I was back in Beijing and Shanghai walking stores, clubs and visiting our e-commerce offices. We now have a total of 12 Sam's Clubs open and they're performing very well. Our stores have clearly improved operationally in recent years in particular, and now they're supported by a supply chain that positions us to win. We see that e-commerce, online grocery and convenience are critical in the dense urban areas that make up so much of the Chinese opportunity. That's why our Yihaodian acquisition is of such strategic significance. We also recommitted to our work on food safety, environmental sustainability and empowering women during my visit, announcing another investment in the China Women's Development Foundation.
With the improvements we've made to our stores and clubs, and the full acquisition of Yihaodian, we have a unique opportunity and a plan to put it all together to win in China.
While positive, our U.S. Sam's Club comp sales without fuel, were at the low end of our guidance. We were pleased with the growth in membership income but we can do better with our overall results. Sam's Club did take important steps this quarter to deepen digital relationships with our members through club pickup, expanded mobile check-in capabilities and extended drive-through or curbside options. Roz will share more about our strategy going forward in a moment.
In addition to releasing earnings, today is a big day at our Home Office. We're holding a sustainability milestone meeting to celebrate 10 years of progress on sustainability since our then CEO, Lee Scott, delivered a landmark speech titled 21st Century Leadership. In those remarks, Lee laid out 3 big goals for Walmart: to be powered by 100% renewable energy, to create 0 waste and to sell products that sustain people and the environment. It was a defining moment for our company. By looking through the winds of sustainability, we realized we can think about problems in creative ways, make our business more efficient and bring renewed passion to our work. It was and is inspiring to be part of this journey.
Today, we'll mark how far we've come and what we've achieved. For example, the savings we've generated from reducing waste, running our truck fleet more efficiently and pursuing energy efficiency has been good for society and good for our shareholders. We're getting excited to take the next steps in this journey early next year. In true Walmart fashion, we're looking at ways to make a difference in the world, serve our stakeholders and drive our bottom line.
Let me reiterate that we are excited about the unique opportunity we have to create a seamless shopping experience for our customers and ensure sustainable growth for the business. We're making critical investments to better serve our customers, associates and shareholders and we are on the right path.
As I close, I want to pause to thank Charles Holley for his years of outstanding service to Walmart. As you know, he's made the decision to retire. He's been a huge asset to the company and a great partner to me and the leadership team. This is his last earnings call and he will be missed. Thank you, Charles. 
Now I'll turn it over to Claire. Claire?"

Today, I'll provide commentary on the company's consolidated financial statements. Further details are available in the accompanying presentation posted with this transcript.
Prior to discussing our results, let me talk about an item that although immaterial, impacts comparability against last year.
As we disclosed in the second quarter, we conducted a global review of the accounting treatment for leases, which included a focus on leases where our payment of certain structural component costs during a lessor's construction of the lease store causes us to be deemed the owner of the property for accounting purposes. In the third quarter, we finalized this review and recorded an immaterial cumulative adjustment.
On a consolidated basis, the immaterial adjustment increased total assets by approximately $1.7 billion, which was primarily an increase in property under capital lease and financing obligations. Increased total liabilities by approximately $1.6 billion, which was primarily an increase in current and long-term capital lease and financing obligations. And it positively impacted earnings per share by approximately $0.04.
Let's now move to our results for the quarter. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Walmart, EPS, were $1.03, which includes the item mentioned above. Additionally, there were significant items that negatively impacted EPS including investments in wages and training in the U.S. of approximately $0.10, and currency exchange rate movements totaling $0.04. Last year's EPS was $1.15.
Total revenue reached $117.4 billion. Currency negatively impacted net sales by approximately $5 billion. On a constant currency basis, total revenue was $122.4 billion.
Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 91 basis points compared to last year, primarily as a result of investments in store wages and labor hours in the U.S. Additionally, FCPA and compliance-related costs were approximately $30 million, comprised of $22 million for ongoing inquiries and investigations, and $8 million for our global compliance program and organizational enhancements. Last year, FCPA and compliance-related costs were approximately $41 million.
The company's consolidated operating income decreased 8.8% to $5.7 billion. Excluding the impact from currency of approximately $214 million, operating income decreased by 0.4%, primarily related to the factors that increased our offer expenses.
I'll close today's discussion with a few comments on returns. At Walmart, we remain committed to providing good returns for our shareholders. During last month's meeting for the investment community, we announced a new share repurchase authorization of $20 billion, and said that our intention is to utilize this authorization over a 2-year period. The company repurchased approximately 6.1 million shares for $437 million during the third quarter.
Return on investment, ROI, for the trailing 12 months ended October 31, 2015, was 15.9% versus 16.4% for the prior comparable period. The decline in ROI was primarily due to our decrease in operating income as well as continued capital investments.
Thank you for listening. And now I'll turn it over to Greg. Greg?"
313055,280452666,905274,"Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Q3 2016 Pre Recorded Earnings Call, Nov 17, 2015",2015-11-17,"Earnings Calls","Walmart Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Claire.

Last month, at our annual meeting for the investment community, I spoke in detail about how Walmart U.S. will execute our part of the plant to be the first to deliver a seamless shopping experience at scale. We will drive growth and deliver shareholder returns by winning with stores, delivering value, being great merchants and providing our customers with a convenient shopping experience that is fast and easy. Although we are in the early stages of our journey, we're confident in our plan and we're executing against it.
Now let's talk about our Q3 performance. As we've said before, we continue to measure our success in terms of traffic, in-stock and customer experience. Overall, we are pleased with the momentum in the top line. Net sales increased $2.7 billion or 3.8%. Unit sales picked up and traffic strengthened, improving 40 basis points from Q2 to 1.7%. This is now the fourth consecutive quarter of positive comp traffic growth for Walmart U.S. Our comp sales growth of 1.5% was solidly within our guidance despite minimal food inflation. In-stocks improved, while comp store inventory declined.
Our customers told us they're happy with the improvements we're making in their shopping experience as reflected in our customer experience scores. To date, 70% of our stores have achieved the initial goal we set for them, and we'll raise the bar for next year. We also saw some progress this quarter in gross margin with the work we've put in on pharmacy, markdowns and shrink. However, as we have discussed before, the investments in our stores and our associates are significant and will continue to pressure the bottom line.
All formats in our portfolio had positive comps this quarter, and we're happy with the progress we've made in our supercenters, which saw continued traffic growth and positive comps across all areas except entertainment.
Our traditional-format Neighborhood Markets delivered an approximate 8% comp in the third quarter, a 70-basis-point acceleration from our Q2 comp and aided by strong performance in our less mature stores.
New technology and processes are improving in-stocks, and we're working hard on providing the best associate coverage to most effectively serve our customers. Most importantly, fresh remains a key focus. We're encouraged by our newest prototype, which features better sightlines and displays. We've seen fresh penetration expand in the store relative to its peers. We've made solid progress this year but we still have a ways to go to ensure we're creating the best experience for our customer while simultaneously improving the profitability of this format.
In e-commerce, we made strides on deepening the digital relationship with our customer. This quarter, we accelerated our online grocery pickup offering to 85 additional locations. We now have almost 140 locations across 25 markets that offer the customer the ability to order their groceries online and conveniently pick up at a time of their choosing. We also launched a new mobile service, which alerts us when a customer is coming to pick up their online general merchandise order even before they walk into the store. And just in time for the holidays, we introduced a digital wish list that can be built at home or by simply scanning items while at the store. 
E-commerce sales and traffic were softer than we would like. We'll continue to strive to balance sales growth and profitability. Overall, e-commerce sales contributed approximately 15 basis points to our comp.
From a merchandise perspective, we saw growth across most of the store, particularly in our apparel, hardlines, home and seasonal businesses. While warmer weather somewhat slowed performance in October, solid back to school and Halloween seasons, along with new launches such as Pioneer Woman and Star Wars, drove mid-single-digit comps across each of these departments.
Continued growth in prescription count and branded drug inflation drove mid-single-digit comps in health and wellness. OTC was also strong as better in-stocks particularly in vitamins, helped drive sales.
In food, we saw our best top line results of the year. Despite minimal inflation, which negatively impacted our total box comp by approximately 90 basis points. Momentum from a solid Labor Day weekend continued through to Halloween. We're particularly pleased with the results in fresh, where we brought in new products, developed strong price leadership through strategic buys and promoted locally sourced and organic products.
While most of the box continued to grow, we still have considerable headwinds in entertainment. A slow adoption of new technology in televisions and the shift from postpaid to installment wireless plans contributed to disappointing sales results. We're working on improving our operating model in this area both in terms of service to our customers and in the layout of the department.
We've made some progress this year including the recent remodel of the Rogers, Arkansas supercenter we showed you last month but it will take time to get this Department where it needs to be.
Moving on to the remainder of our financials. Gross margins increased 32 basis points versus last year. Gross margin rate improved in food, general merchandise and consumables but were somewhat offset by declines in health and wellness. Reimbursement levels continued to pressure pharmacy profits. However, we've made some strides across several initiatives that improved margins in this department versus Q2.
Additionally, we remain focused on our urgent agenda items, including better management of markdowns to 0. Finally, while only just beginning to show in our results, we are pleased with our efforts thus far on addressing shrink, which has been a significant headwind for us this year.
As we have said before, our top priority this year is to provide a better customer experience in our stores. We are committed to actions that help accomplish this goal as we've invested this year in our associates and in improving our stores. These investments are substantial and continue to reflect in our bottom line performance.
Specifically, in the third quarter, we intentionally added store labor hours above our initial plans and incurred significant maintenance expenses related to the customer-facing areas of the store.
This investments, along with the wage increases in the store structure changes implemented earlier this year, drove the majority of the 116 basis point deleverage in operating expenses.
As the store experience is being addressed and efficiencies are created through new tools, technology and processes, we've begun calibrating labor hours against these improvements. Over time, as the productivity loop begins turning faster, we know we can create a strong balance between experience and profitability.
We did benefit this quarter from the immaterial lease accounting cumulative adjustment that Claire mentioned in her earlier remarks, which favorably impacted operating expenses by $74 million.
As a result of our focus on improving customer experience, along with our ongoing investments in e-commerce and somewhat offset by the lease accounting adjustment I just mentioned, operating income declined 8.6%. Excluding the impact from the lease adjustment, operating income declined approximately 10%.
Moving on, in the third quarter, total inventory grew around 1%, which was less than half the rate of sales. Inventory declined approximately 1.9% in comp stores as new processes in technology have reduced inventory across the store, while simultaneously improving in-stock levels. We're proud of the progress we've made this year on improving inventory levels across our network but we have room to improve and we remain focused on these efforts.
Finally, on the real estate side, we opened 15 supercenters in the third quarter including relocations and expansions and 35 traditional format Neighborhood Markets. We're working hard on improving both of these formats to ensure we have the best customer offering alongside strong operating efficiency. We'll continue to test ideas, honing in on the best options for each of these formats.
Shifting now to the fourth quarter. The holiday season is upon us. Our associates have been working hard all year to prepare and we're ready.
We have the best value on great merchandise for the entire season without gimmicks. Our merchants have done a terrific job of listening to our customers on what they're looking for this season. We're excited about programs such as Chosen by Kids and our exclusive 1-hour guarantee event. And this holiday, we're working to bring our customers an improved shopping experience, whether they're in the store, online or using our mobile app. We know the holidays will be competitive. 
Additionally, we expect food inflation to remain low relative to last year and will lap last year's significant drop in fuel prices which will make the comparison for the fourth quarter more difficult. But we're confident in our strategy and the actions we're taking, and believe they'll help offset some of these pressures.
Therefore, for the 13-week period ending January 29, 2016, we expect the comp sales increase of around 1%, which would represent a 50-basis-point improvement in our 2-year comps stack from third quarter. Last year's fourth income was up 1.5%, our strongest comp performance of fiscal 2015.

We had a solid quarter with sales growth accelerating slightly from last quarter, and operating income growing faster than sales, both on a constant currency basis. Comp trends in Mexico and Canada continued to be strong which more than offset weaker sales performances in the U.K., Brazil and China, where we continue to experience various competitive and economic challenges.
Our markets remain focused on the strategic priorities discussed earlier this year, which include actively managing the existing portfolio; delivering balanced growth, including e-commerce; being the lowest-cost operator; and building solid foundations in terms of talent, trust and technology. Let me touch on some of the progress we've made.
We've continued to take action this year to drive simplicity and focus in our portfolio. We sold a portfolio of properties under development with our shopping center joint venture partner in Canada, and exited our bank operations in Mexico. We're currently pursuing the sale of a portfolio shopping centers in Chile and we're closing our business-to-business sales operations in the U.K At the same time, we've looked for ways to enhance our portfolio in core markets, which we've done by creating taking full ownership of Yihaodian in China and acquiring 13 stores in 1 DC from a former competitor in Canada. We'll continue to review our portfolio to simplify our operations and help our teams stay focused on running great businesses.
Our markets continue to invest heavily in price, quality and service, aimed at driving comp sales. Our overall trend is improving as 7 of our 11 markets have now delivered positive comps for sixes recorders. We're delivering value and providing convenience that is attracting customers to our stores, clubs, websites and apps across our markets. 
I'm pleased with the innovation we're driving in e-commerce, led by online grocery. And I'm excited about the potential we have to access a broader customer segment. We continue to learn from our online grocery business in the U.K. as we test and roll out similar initiatives in Mexico and Canada and build a strong platform for growth in China.
As Doug mentioned, the continued economic challenges in some of our major markets impacted on our overall global e-commerce sales growth this quarter. We still have work to do but I'm confident we're executing against this key strategic priority.
Now let's discuss our overall results. In the third quarter, net sales grew 3.2% on a constant currency basis. Reported net sales declined 11.4%, impacted by an approximately $5 billion currency impact from the continued strength of the U.S. dollar. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates continue to negatively impact our target results. So it's important to emphasize that our business on a  constant currency basis is maintaining steady growth. We had strong positive comp sales in Mexico and Canada. The U.K., Brazil and China posted negative comps although the comps were slightly better in Q3 versus Q2.
In each of our other markets, we had solid comps of at least 3%. Operating income grew faster than net sales at 8.5% on a constant currency basis, driven in large part by excellent performance in Mexico and Canada. In addition, as Claire mentioned earlier, there was an immaterial lease accounting adjustment this quarter, which favorably impacted operating expenses by approximately $49 million on a constant currency basis. With the currency exchange impact, operating income decreased 6.4%.
On a constant currency basis, inventory grew faster than net sales at 7%, primarily driven by our decision in Mexico to flow inventory through our import network early for the upcoming holiday season. On a reported basis, inventory declined 10%. 
Now let's discuss market results presented on a constant currency basis for our largest markets. In all countries except Brazil and China, financial results are inclusive of e-commerce.
Let's begin with the U.K. Challenging competitive conditions persisted throughout the quarter as the market continues to experience rapid structural change. Customers have now benefited for more than 12 months of continually falling prices, and the market has grown by less than 1% for 6 consecutive months, despite a healthier overall economy according to Cantar. The big 4 grocers continue to lose share to the discounters.
U.K. net sales declined by 3.2% and comp sales, excluding fuel, were down 4.6%. Large store traffic and food remain the primary challenges, while online grocery continues to grow. The online business is focused on improving its core service offering and is performing above target on key internal performance metrics. Operating income increased, driven by reduced expenses as well as lapping some organizational restructuring costs from last year.
The U.K. is focused on rebuilding momentum in its core business. Last month, we launched Project Renewal an 18-month project that reaffirms the direction set out in the 5-year strategy, but prioritizes investments more clearly on price, quality and service in large stores while putting noncore expansion, such as remote petrol stations, on hold.
Greater focus on driving out inefficiencies across both buying and operations will enable U.K. to build on its well-established value credentials and strengthen its competitive position.
Let's now discuss Mexico, which released their earnings on October 27. Please note the Walmex release is under IFRS and the results here are under U.S. GAAP. Therefore, some numbers may differ.
Consolidated Walmex net sales increased 7.4% with strong comp sales in both Mexico and Central America. Mexico sales grew 7.6% and comp sales increased 6.3%, driven by solid comp growth in both self-service and Sam's Club. In self-service, we achieved mid-single-digit growth in groceries and high single-digit growth in GM and apparel. Self-service continues to gain share, and delivered a 220 basis point improvement in market share according to ANTAD. Sam's Club is maintaining it's steady improvement in comps, aided by ongoing events and campaigns to drive traffic and grow membership. We leveraged expenses in the quarter and grew operating income significantly faster than sales.
Our e-commerce business in Mexico is growing in line with the market, driven by strong growth in general merchandise. Under the Walmart banner, we're significantly expanding our assortment of ship-from-store items. We're rapidly growing store coverage for online grocery and customer orders are increasing. At Sam's Club, we've soft launched our new website, while maintaining healthy growth with our existing platform. 
In Canada, we continue to maintain solid growth and gain share in a competitive and low growth environment. Net sales grew 5.7% and comps were up 4.3%, driven by strong performance in our core grocery business as well as stronger performance in our GM business. In the quarter, Canada saw share gains in food, health and wellness, consumables and infants for the 12 weeks ended October 29 according to Nielsen. In addition to strong top line performance, the team continues the focus on our low-cost operating model to drive a sustainable price advantage. Canada grew operating income faster than sales.
We continue to invest in expanding customer access. We recently began a partnership with 7-Eleven and a piloting Grab & Go lockers at some of their convenience stores in the Greater Toronto area. We are pleased with the progress that our online grocery business has made since our pilot launched in July. Overall, I'm pleased with our results in Canada, and I expect reliable growth to continue.
In Brazil, the economic challenges are largely unchanged as high inflation and unemployment continue to impact consumer confidence and consumption levels. Net sales were down 0.4% and comps were down 0.6%, driven by a decline in the hypermarket format, mostly offset by strong sales growth in our wholesale business.
General merchandise, primarily electronics, accounted for the largest portion of the hypermarket sales decline. These economic challenges are impacting both our store and e-commerce sales.
Operating income declined faster than sales due to increased labor claims, continued high utility costs and higher markdown activity, which helped us improve our inventory position going into the fourth quarter.
Let's now shift to China, a key growth market. This quarter, sales grew 2.9%, driven by new store openings. Comp sales declined 0.7% amid slower consumption growth. In the hypermarket channel, we gained share for an 11th consecutive quarter. We'll continue to invest in physical and digital to deliver a seamless shopping experience.
We continue to drive efficiency in stores and at the home office. Operating income grew faster than net sales. We operate for less productivity initiatives remain a focus, allowing reinvestment in labor and customer experience, particularly in fresh.
Yihaodian, our e-commerce business in China, is focused on further leveraging Walmart's global and local assets. The business improved margins and balanced marketing spend, amid intense competition on price.
While I'm not satisfied with recent results, I'm confident in the actions we're taking in China that position us to achieve success for many years to come. 
Now let me recap. We had a good quarter with solid sales momentum in our underlying business, driven by healthy comp sales in a majority of our markets. In addition, we delivered a relatively high level of constant currency operating profit. Our strategy remains focused and our priorities are clear and we're well-positioned for future growth.
Now I'll turn it over to Roz for the update on Sam's. Roz?"

Today, I'll share details about our third quarter powerful, along with comp guidance for the fourth quarter. Members are at the center of the decisions we make, and I'll talk about our ongoing efforts this year to deliver value for them. I'll also share with you specifics around our strategy, which is based on an in-depth review of the business that we've conducted this year.
Before we get started, let me recognize Charles Redfield for his many contributions to Sam's Club over the last 3 years as our Chief Merchandising Officer. His passion for merchandising was experienced throughout the organization. We're excited for Charles as he takes on his new role as Head Merchant for Food in the Walmart U.S. business. With Charles' transition, we are thrilled to have John Furner back at Sam's Club as our new Chief Merchandising Officer after having served as the Chief Merchandising and Marketing Officer in China for nearly 3 years.
Let's move on to a few specifics around our third quarter results. Unless otherwise noted, today's financial discussion will exclude fuel for purposes of comparability. For results with fuel and additional information, please refer to the accompanying presentation posted with this transcript.
Comp sales for the third quarter were at the low end of our guidance. In key food categories, we faced comparisons to last year's steep inflationary environment. And in our wireless business, we continue to experience headwinds from changing industry dynamics. We saw positive results in areas of the business that introduced more newness such as health and wellness and consumables.
Net sales grew 1.6% as comp sales increased 0.4%. Slide 10 provides the components of our comp increase. Ticket grew 70 basis points during the period. Positive momentum in traffic from savings members continued but softness from our business member negatively impacted our results.
Our gross profit rate increased 46 basis points from last year due to a disciplined focus on product acquisition costs, a favorable mix and logistics benefits.
Operating expenses deleveraged during quarter as we continued to invest in people and technology. We are confident that these are the right choices to make for our business and the benefits of these investments will help us deliver sustainable growth over time. Earlier, you heard Claire talk about an immaterial item related to the company's accounting for certain leases, which resulted in a benefit to operate expenses of approximately $27 million for Sam's Club.
We were pleased with the growth in membership income during the quarter, which increased 5.4%. Investments in the cash rewards program for Plus members resulted in improved Plus renewal rates and Plus penetration is at an all-time high. The impact of social media campaigns was also a contributing factor.
Turning to our merchandising categories, let me talk about a few areas that had the most impact during the quarter. Please see slide 11 of the accompanying presentation for the comp performance of the remaining categories.
Our fresh/freezer/cooler business faced significant headwinds as deflation in key areas including fresh meat and dairy weighed on our comps. We were pleased with our performance we produce.
Technology and entertainment was pressured during the period, led by a decline in wireless. The industry shift in installment plans continued to negatively impact the category. In electronics, imaging and audio performed well and we continued our efforts to refine the assortment.
Health and wellness and consumables benefited from innovation and newness. In pharmacy, the free/4/10 prescription program continued to drive growth in script counts. New items in OTC led to a solid performance in the quarter and products like protein powder drove good results, further supporting our initiatives around healthy for you. 
Our consumables business benefited as several new items were launched and we continue to gain share in tabletop as the focus on private brands and quality resonated with members.
In e-commerce, we continue to make progress with integrating digital efforts to transform how members shop and interact with our clubs. Business members have enjoyed the convenience of preordering merchandise for pickup at the club for more than a decade. Now through advances in technology along with innovation from the e-commerce team, all of our members can enjoy similar access with an improved digital experience.
This year's roll-out of Club Pickup to all of our clubs has been well received and represents the fastest growing area of our business. Sales in this space increased 50% during the third quarter. We have also added features along the way. During the quarter, we completed the implementation of mobile check-in capabilities to provide members with a better experience and shorter wait times. We introduced the Geo fencing technology that alerts our associates when members drive onto the parking lot. We extended drive-through or curbside options to more clubs and members love the convenience. These new features build on earlier advances in Club Pickup, including easy reorder and a prepaid option.
Now let me move on to guidance for the fourth quarter. As we move into the quarter, we will face last year's inflationary environment and a tough comparison. As a result, we believe comp sales without fuel for the 13-week period ending January 29, 2016, will be flat to up 1%.
Members are at the center of the decisions we make. We've worked diligently this year to deliver on what we know they want. They expect offerings that are relevant and convenient. They want excitement and newness. They want a seamless shopping experience that integrate the best in digital and physical. We see success where we are delivering on these expectations.
For example, you've heard us talk about the expansion of organics in our assortment. Members ask for an improved selection and we are delivering. Over the summer, we launched Shocking Values online, which has helped to instill a treasure hunt mentality with members. And the innovative free/4/10 prescription program is providing real savings to Plus members and helping to lift the overall health and wellness category.
I'm pleased with the steps and we've been taking throughout this year to deliver for members. We know we must do more with member-relevant merchandise and new member growth. Today, I'm excited to share with you the plans we've developed as we look ahead. We have been focused on developing a strategy at Sam's Club that will deliver our business into the future and build long-term sustainable growth. The 4 key elements of our strategy include: growth through higher household income members and high-value business segments; relevant merchandise and increased value for our members; acquiring and retaining the right members and increasing the spend; and lastly, integrating digital to transform the club experience.
In order to better align the business as we move forward, we made organizational changes and enhancements. John Furner is returning to Sam's Club as the Executive Vice President and Chief Merchandising Officer. John has rejoined the team after nearly 3 years as Chief Merchandising and Chief Marketing Officer of Walmart China, where he led Merchandising, Procurement, Marketing, Supply Chain, Financial Services and Mobile Commerce for the Hypermarket division. Prior to moving overseas, John was Senior Vice President of home And & Merchandise in global sourcing for Sam's Club.
In addition, we've reallocated resources pertaining to merchandising and have created new positions in critical areas including data and analytics, fresh food, regional buying and proprietary brands. We also created a new leadership position dedicated to business member merchandising. 
Moving forward, we'll continue to serve both savings and business members. We have clarity around the categories of members we will target. Data will drive our decisions and I'm confident we are focused on the right opportunities.
As I close, let me summarize today's thoughts. As we look back at the third quarter, we acknowledge that we need to improve our sales. Where we introduce new merchandise, we delivered strong results. We continue to make strategic investments in people and technology as these are critical enablers of our strategy. We're also pleased with our efforts to further integrate digital and physical retail. Our members are at the center of all our decisions. We are making progress across the club and through online and mobile commerce capabilities to deliver value for them. Whether it's saving them time with club pickup or saving them money on their prescriptions with free/4/10, we continue to find new ways to innovate. And we're confident the strategy and enhancements to our organizational structure will propel our business into the future.
Now I'll turn the call over to Charles. Charles?"
313055,280452666,905274,"Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Q3 2016 Pre Recorded Earnings Call, Nov 17, 2015",2015-11-17,"Earnings Calls","Walmart Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Roz.

I'd like to start by highlighting that we are pleased with the sales increases we experienced in Walmart U.S. as well as in our International business when considering constant currency. Stronger traffic in our Walmart U.S. stores and a fifth consecutive quarter of positive comp sales indicate that we're taking the right steps to win with customers, grow sales and deliver a seamless shopping experience at scale. 
From an e-commerce standpoint, we have long-term plans in place to grow our business. We are making progress on several of our key initiatives and recognize we have more work to do. As expected, the investments we're making in people and technology impacted both operating expenses and profits in the quarter. However, we delivered earnings per share well within our guidance and remain confident that these investments will better position Walmart for the future. 
Now let's turn our attention to guidance for the fourth quarter and the full year. Last quarter, we indicated that we expected our full year fiscal 2016 earnings per share to range between $4.40 and $4.70. Today, we are narrowing our full year earnings per share guidance to range between $4.50 and $4.65, including a range of $1.40 and $1.55 for the fourth quarter. These ranges include the assumptions we provided in the second quarter, which consists of the impact of our investments and wages, training and additional labor hours in our stores, the incremental investment in global e-commerce and the headwinds in the U.S. from pharmacy margins and shrink.
Currency remains a significant headwind for us. As I indicated at our analyst meeting last month, we expect our total net sales growth to be relatively flat for fiscal year 2016. It's important to note that if we were to exclude the impact of currency, our total net sales growth would be around 3% for the year. 
Now assuming currency exchange rates remain at current levels for the remainder of the year, we now expect the full year impact to earnings per share to be approximately $0.16, up $0.01 from last quarter's revised guidance of $0.15. Our effective tax rate is expected to range between 31% and 33% for the full year. As we have indicated in the past, our tax rate will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter, and may be impacted by a number of factors including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, valuation allowances, changes in law, outcomes of administrative audits, the impacts of discrete items in the mix of earnings among our U.S. and International operations. And in any given quarter, our effective tax rate could be higher or lower than the full year. 
Now as I've mentioned at our analyst meeting last month, we are monitoring progress in Congress with respect to the extension of certain U.S. income tax legislation that expired at the end of calendar year 2014. If the legislation is passed, we'll end up closer to the lower end of the updated range that we've provided.
As I mentioned at the October analyst meeting, we will continue to review our portfolio, including stores and clubs. As in prior years, we may have charges related to closing businesses or stores and clubs. These charges would not be included in our guidance. This is my last call as the Chief Financial Officer as I'll be retiring effective January 31. I feel fortunate to be a small part of the Walmart story. I have enjoyed working with all of you over the past few years. Brett Biggs will take over as the Chief Financial Officer for Walmart effective January 1. You're in very capable hands, and I'm proud of the strong team that we've left behind that Brett will be leading in the future.
With that, thank you for listening today and for your interest in our company. And on behalf of the management team and our associates worldwide, we thank you for your support this year and wish you a happy, healthy and safe holiday season."

Thank you for joining us to hear more about our third quarter earnings as well as the strategy we shared at our Annual Meeting for the investment community last month.
Overall, we had a good quarter. We delivered earnings per share well within our guidance range, recorded our fifth straight quarter of positive comps at Walmart U.S., and had solid international sales and profit growth on a constant currency basis. At the same time, we still have plenty of work to do, and there are areas of our business that must perform better.
Our earnings per share were $1.03, and we posted total revenue of $117.4 billion. I want to highlight that on a constant currency basis, our total revenue would have been $122.4 billion. That's growth of $3.4 billion or 2.8% on a constant currency basis, which is solid growth. Even if the percentage doesn't sound high because we have such a large denominator, not many companies grow by this amount in a quarter. I call this out because I don't want the currency impacts to obscure the strength of our business. We are a growth company, and we're growing.
As we expected, operating income continued to be pressured by our decision to invest in our frontline associates. To improve the store experience for our customers and create a bridge to our future where digital capabilities will play an increasing role in our stores, we're making a $1.2 billion planned investment in our people this year that we understood would impact near-term operating income. This is by far the biggest driver of the decline in consolidated operating income.
Before going into the details, I want to take a step back to talk about our strategy. At our investor meeting last month, we shared more detail than usual about the next 3 years of our growth plan. We've never been a company that manages only for the short-term, and that's certainly true during this period of change. Although investments in our people and technology impact near-term earnings, they will help us deliver sustainable growth and returns to shareholders over time.
We're confident these are the right steps because we know where and how we're going to win. We will be the first to deliver a seamless shopping experience at scale. No matter how you choose to shop with us, through your mobile device, online, in a store or a combination, it will be fast and easy. Online retailers are testing physical store experiences because they recognize the same customer desire that we do. There's a race to do this right, but only Walmart can bring together a dense network of stores, supported by a supply chain and systems like ours, with an emerging set of digital capabilities to win with customers.
As we create this seamless experience, we're positioning for growth in 5 key areas. First, we'll continue to win on value. We've won on value in the past and that won't change. Second, convenience is increasingly important as customers want to save both money and time. Third, we will always work to be great merchants, whether in-stores or online. Fourth, we're focused on the key geographies for customer growth, which are North America and China. Finally, we want to appeal to a blend of income levels. The way we're approaching e-commerce, Neighborhood Markets, Sam's Club, grocery pickup and other areas will appeal to value-conscious customers of all demographics. We already serve customers from all income levels around the world, but we have an opportunity to get even stronger.
By taking these steps, we will grow the company faster. We will add between $45 billion and $60 billion of revenue to the company in the next 3 years. That's a lot of growth. It just happens to be on a big base.
Returning to this quarter's results, one of the most important takeaways is that our U.S. stores continue to improve, with total net sales up nearly 4%. In addition to positive comp sales, Walmart U.S. had its fourth straight quarter of positive traffic. We're now lapping positive comp sales and building on our progress. Our customers are telling us that our efforts around clean, fast and friendly are resonating.
Neighborhood Markets continued to show strong sales, led by our newer stores, and have posted positive comps for 19 consecutive quarters. A key part of creating a seamless shopping experience is to have great stores, and we feel good about where we're heading.
We also made strides in the U.S. on adding critical capabilities to our supply chain. In the third quarter, we opened a new e-commerce fulfillment center in Atlanta with more than 1 million square feet of space. This is our fifth next-generation fulfillment center.
As we build out our e-commerce capabilities, we are deepening our digital relationships with our customers. We've accelerated our expansion of online grocery pickup, and we've seen that customers who start using online grocery spend nearly 50% more than similar customers who shop only in stores. This is the customer we're going after: the shopper in our sweet spot who accesses Walmart in multiple ways.
We also began the chain-wide use of a mobile service that can tell us when a customer is coming to pick up an online general merchandise order before they even walk into the store. And we launched a new digital wish list that you can build at home or simply by scanning items in a store. We expect more than 210 million visits to our app in November and December, up from 18 million in 2012.
Last month, we told you about our longer-term plans to grow e-commerce sales and GMV. That plan anticipates ebbs and flows along the way, but we are confident in our targets. We continue to expect to grow mid- to high-teens for this fiscal year. During the third quarter, Global eCommerce sales and GMV growth both came in at around 10%. This was due primarily to continued economic challenges in our major international markets, including Brazil, China and the U.K. In the U.S., where we've seen good growth for the year, we continue to make progress on key initiatives but we know we have more work to do. I was pleased that SamsClub.com continued to deliver strong growth.
In Walmart International, we're pleased with the solid 3.2% sales growth on a constant currency basis. Operating income grew faster than sales at 8.5%, excluding currency. Our North American markets delivered strong performance, and Mexico, in particular, is starting to fire on all cylinders. I'm pleased with our momentum in these markets. We continue to face specific challenges in the U.K. and Brazil.
China remains a huge long-term opportunity. We started in China in 1996. We've grown the business, reached profitability years ago and grown our level of profitability. We obviously learned a lot about Chinese customers and the market, and that's an asset. A few weeks ago, I was back in Beijing and Shanghai, walking stores, clubs and visiting our e-commerce offices. We now have a total of 12 Sam's Clubs open and they're performing very well. Our stores have clearly improved operationally in recent years in particular, and now they're supported by a supply chain that positions us to win. We see that e-commerce, online grocery and convenience are critical in the dense urban areas that make up so much of the Chinese opportunity. That's why our Yihaodian acquisition is of such strategic significance. We also recommitted to our work on food safety, environmental sustainability and empowering women during my visit, announcing another investment in the China Women's Development Foundation. With the improvements we've made to our stores and clubs, and the full acquisition of Yihaodian, we have a unique opportunity and a plan to put it all together to win in China.
While positive, our U.S. Sam's Club comp sales, without fuel, were at the low end of our guidance. We were pleased with the growth in membership income, but we can do better with our overall results. Sam's Club did take important steps this quarter to deepen digital relationships with our members through Club Pickup, expanded mobile check-in capabilities and extended drive-thru or curbside options. Roz will share more about our strategy going forward in a moment.
In addition to releasing earnings, today is a big day at our Home Office. We're holding a Sustainability Milestone Meeting to celebrate 10 years of progress on sustainability since our then-CEO, Lee Scott, delivered a landmark speech titled 21st Century Leadership. In those remarks, Lee laid out 3 big goals for Walmart: to be powered by 100% renewable energy, to create 0 waste and to sell products that sustain people and the environment. It was a defining moment for our company. By looking through the lens of sustainability, Lee realized we can think about problems in creative ways, make our business more efficient and bring renewed passion to our work. It was and is inspiring to be part of this journey.
Today, we'll mark how far we've come and what we've achieved. For example, the savings we've generated from reducing waste, running our truck fleet more efficiently and pursuing energy efficiency has been good for society and good for our shareholders. We're getting excited to take the next steps in this journey early next year. In true Walmart fashion, we're looking at ways to make a difference in the world, serve our stakeholders and drive our bottom line.
Let me reiterate that we are excited about the unique opportunity we have to create a seamless shopping experience for our customers and ensure sustainable growth for the business. We're making critical investments to better serve our customers, associates and shareholders, and we are on the right path.
As I close, I want to pause to thank Charles Holley for his years of outstanding service to Walmart. As you know, he's made the decision to retire. He's been a huge asset to the company and a great partner to me and the leadership team. This is his last earnings call, and he will be missed. Thank you, Charles. 
Now I'll turn it over to Claire. Claire?"

Today, I'll provide commentary on the company's consolidated financial statements. Further details are available in the accompanying presentation posted with this transcript.Prior to discussing our results, let me talk about an item that,",478,"Thanks, Doug. Today, I'll provide commentary on the company's consolidated financial statements. Further details are available in the accompanying presentation posted with this transcript.
Prior to discussing our results, let me talk about an item that, although immaterial, impacts comparability against last year.
As we disclosed in the second quarter, we conducted a global review of the accounting treatment for leases, which included a focus on leases where our payment of certain structural component costs during a lessor's construction of the leased store causes us to be deemed the owner of the property for accounting purposes. In the third quarter, we finalized this review and recorded an immaterial cumulative adjustment.
On a consolidated basis, the immaterial adjustment increased total assets by approximately $1.7 billion, which was primarily an increase in property under capital lease and financing obligations; increased total liabilities by approximately $1.6 billion, which was primarily an increase in current and long-term capital lease and financing obligations; and it positively impacted earnings per share by approximately $0.04.
Let's now move to our results for the quarter. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Walmart, EPS, were $1.03, which includes the item mentioned above. Additionally, there were significant items that negatively impacted EPS, including investments in wages and training in the U.S. of approximately $0.10 and currency exchange rate movements totaling $0.04. Last year's EPS was $1.15.
Total revenue reached $117.4 billion. Currency negatively impacted net sales by approximately $5 billion. On a constant currency basis, total revenue was $122.4 billion.
Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 91 basis points compared to last year, primarily as a result of investments in store wages and labor hours in the U.S. Additionally, FCPA and compliance-related costs were approximately $30 million, comprised of $22 million for ongoing inquiries and investigations, and $8 million for our global compliance program and organizational enhancements. Last year, FCPA and compliance-related costs were approximately $41 million.
The company's consolidated operating income decreased 8.8% to $5.7 billion. Excluding the impact from currency of approximately $214 million, operating income decreased 5.4%, primarily related to the factors that increased our operating expenses.
I'll close today's discussion with a few comments on returns. At Walmart, we remain committed to providing good returns for our shareholders. During last month's meeting for the investment community, we announced a new share repurchase authorization of $20 billion, and said that our intention is to utilize this authorization over a 2-year period. The company repurchased approximately 6.1 million shares for $437 million during the third quarter.
Return on investment, ROI, for the trailing 12 months ended October 31, 2015, was 15.9% versus 16.4% for the prior comparable period. The decline in ROI was primarily due to our decrease in operating income as well as continued capital investments.
Thank you for listening. And now I'll turn it over to Greg. Greg?"

Last month at our annual meeting for the investment community, I spoke in detail about how Walmart U.S. will execute our part of the plant to be the first to deliver a seamless shopping experience at scale. We will drive growth and deliver shareholder returns by winning with stores, delivering value, being great merchants and providing our customers with a convenient shopping experience that is fast and easy. Although we're in the early stages of our journey, we're confident in our plan, and we're executing against it.
Now let's talk about our Q3 performance. As we've said before, we continue to measure our success in terms of traffic, in-stock and customer experience. Overall, we're pleased with the momentum in the top line. Net sales increased $2.7 billion or 3.8%. Unit sales picked up and traffic strengthened, improving 40 basis points from Q2 to 1.7%. This is now the fourth consecutive quarter of positive comp traffic growth for Walmart U.S. Our comp sales growth of 1.5% was solidly within our guidance despite minimal food inflation. In-stocks improved, while comp store inventory declined.
Our customers told us they're happy with the improvements we're making in their shopping experience, as reflected in our customer experience scores. To date, 70% of our stores have achieved the initial goal we set for them, and we'll raise the bar for next year. We also saw some progress this quarter in gross margin with the work we've put in on pharmacy, markdowns and shrink. However, as we have discussed before, the investments in our stores and our associates are significant and will continue to pressure the bottom line.
All formats in our portfolio had positive comps this quarter, and we're happy with the progress we've made in our supercenters, which saw continued traffic growth and positive comps across all areas except entertainment.
Our traditional-format Neighborhood Markets delivered an approximate 8% comp in the third quarter, a 70-basis-point acceleration from our Q2 comp, and aided by strong performance in our less mature stores. New technology and processes are improving in-stocks, and we're working hard on providing the best associate coverage to most effectively serve our customers.
Most importantly, fresh remains a key focus. We're encouraged by our newest prototype, which features better sightlines and displays. We've seen fresh penetration expand in the store relative to its peers. We've made solid progress this year, but we still have a ways to go to ensure we're creating the best experience for our customer while simultaneously improving the profitability of this format.
In e-commerce, we made strides on deepening the digital relationship with our customer. This quarter, we accelerated our online grocery pickup offering to 85 additional locations. We now have almost 140 locations across 25 markets that offer the customer the ability to order their groceries online and conveniently pick up at a time of their choosing. We also launched a new mobile service, which alerts us when a customer is coming to pick up their online general merchandise order even before they walk into the store. And just in time for the holidays, we introduced a digital wish list that can be built at home or by simply scanning items while at the store. 
E-commerce sales and traffic were softer than we would like. We'll continue to strive to balance sales growth and profitability. Overall, e-commerce sales contributed approximately 15 basis points to our comp.
From a merchandise perspective, we saw growth across most of the store, particularly in our apparel, hardlines, home and seasonal businesses. While warmer weather somewhat slowed performance in October, solid back-to-school and Halloween seasons, along with new launches such as Pioneer Woman and Star Wars, drove mid-single-digit comps across each of these departments.
Continued growth in prescription count and branded drug inflation drove mid-single-digit comps in health and wellness. OTC was also strong as better in-stocks, particularly in vitamins, helped drive sales.
In food, we saw our best top line results of the year, despite minimal inflation, which negatively impacted our total box comp by approximately 90 basis points. Momentum from a solid Labor Day weekend continued through to Halloween. We're particularly pleased with the results in fresh, where we brought in new products, developed strong price leadership through strategic buys and promoted locally sourced and organic product.
While most of the box continued to grow, we still have considerable headwinds in entertainment. A slow adoption of new technology in televisions and the shift from postpaid to installment wireless plans contributed to disappointing sales results. We're working on improving our operating model in this area, both in terms of service to our customers and in the layout of the department.
We've made some progress this year, including the recent remodel of the Rogers, Arkansas supercenter we showed you last month, but it will take time to get this department where it needs to be.
Moving on to the remainder of our financials. Gross margins increased 32 basis points versus last year. Gross margin rate improved in food, general merchandise and consumables, but were somewhat offset by declines in health and wellness. Reimbursement levels continued to pressure pharmacy profits, however, we've made some strides across several initiatives that improved margins in this department versus Q2. Additionally, we remain focused on our urgent agenda items, including better management of markdowns to 0. Finally, while only just beginning to show in our results, we are pleased with our efforts thus far on addressing shrink, which has been a significant headwind for us this year.
As we've said before, our top priority this year is to provide a better customer experience in our stores. We're committed to actions that help accomplish this goal as we have invested this year in our associates and in improving our stores. These investments are substantial and continue to reflect in our bottom line performance.
Specifically, in the third quarter, we intentionally added store labor hours above our initial plans and incurred significant maintenance expenses related to the customer-facing areas of the store. These investments, along with the wage increases and the store structure changes implemented earlier this year, drove the majority of the 116-basis-point deleverage in operating expenses.
As the store experience is being addressed and efficiencies are created through new tools, technology and processes, we've begun calibrating labor hours against these improvements. Over time, as the productivity loop begins turning faster, we know we can create a strong balance between experience and profitability.
We did benefit this quarter from the immaterial lease accounting cumulative adjustment that Claire mentioned in her earlier remarks, which favorably impacted operating expenses by $74 million.
As a result of our focus on improving customer experience, along with our ongoing investments in e-commerce and somewhat offset by the lease accounting adjustment I just mentioned, operating income declined 8.6%. Excluding the impact from the lease adjustment, operating income declined approximately 10%.
Moving on, in the third quarter, total inventory grew around 1%, which was less than half the rate of sales. Inventory declined approximately 1.9% in comp stores as new processes in technology have reduced inventory across the store, while simultaneously improving in-stock levels. We're proud of the progress we've made this year on improving inventory levels across our network, but we have room to improve and we remain focused on these efforts.
Finally, on the real estate side, we opened 15 supercenters in the third quarter, including relocations and expansions and 35 traditional format Neighborhood Markets. We're working hard on improving both of these formats to ensure we have the best customer offering alongside strong operating efficiency. We'll continue to test ideas, honing in on the best options for each of these formats.
Shifting now to the fourth quarter. The holiday season is upon us. Our associates have been working hard all year to prepare, and we're ready.
We have the best value on great merchandise for the entire season, without gimmicks. Our merchants have done a terrific job of listening to our customers on what they're looking for this season. We're excited about programs such as Chosen by Kids and our exclusive 1-Hour Guarantee event. And this holiday, we're working to bring our customers an improved shopping experience, whether they're in the store, online or using our mobile app. We know the holidays will be competitive. 
Additionally, we expect food inflation to remain low relative to last year, and we'll lap last year's significant drop in fuel prices, which will make the comparison for the fourth quarter more difficult. But we're confident in our strategy and the actions we're taking, and believe they'll help offset some of these pressures.
Therefore, for the 13-week period ending January 29, 2016, we expect the comp sales increase of around 1%, which would represent a 50-basis-point improvement in our 2-year comp stack from third quarter. Last year's fourth income was up 1.5%, our strongest comp performance of fiscal 2015.

We had a solid quarter with sales growth accelerating slightly from last quarter and operating income growing faster than sales, both on a constant currency basis. Comp trends in Mexico and Canada continued to be strong, which more than offset weaker sales performances in the U.K., Brazil and China, where we continue to experience various competitive and economic challenges.
Our markets remain focused on the strategic priorities discussed earlier this year, which include actively managing the existing portfolio; delivering balanced growth, including e-commerce; being the lowest cost operator; and building solid foundations in terms of talent, trust and technology.
Let me touch on some of the progress we've made. We've continued to take action this year to drive simplicity and focus in our portfolio. We sold a portfolio of properties under development with our shopping center joint venture partner in Canada and exited our bank operations in Mexico. We're currently pursuing the sale of a portfolio of shopping centers in Chile, and we're closing our business-to-business sales operations in the U.K. At the same time, we've looked for ways to enhance our portfolio in core markets, which we've done by creating taking full ownership of Yihaodian in China and acquiring 13 stores and 1 DC from a former competitor in Canada. We'll continue to review our portfolio to simplify our operations and help our teams stay focused on running great businesses.
Our markets continue to invest heavily in price, quality and service, aimed at driving comp sales. Our overall trend is improving as 7 of our 11 markets have now delivered positive comps for 6 straight quarters. We're delivering value and providing convenience that is attracting customers to our stores, clubs, websites and apps across our markets. 
I'm pleased with the innovation we're driving in e-commerce, led by online grocery. And I'm excited about the potential we have to access a broader customer segment. We continue to learn from our online grocery business in the U.K. as we test and roll out similar initiatives in Mexico and Canada and build a strong platform for growth in China.
As Doug mentioned, the continued economic challenges in some of our major markets impacted on our overall Global eCommerce sales growth this quarter. We still have work to do, but I'm confident we're executing against this key strategic priority.
Now let's discuss our overall results. In the third quarter, net sales grew 3.2% on a constant currency basis. Reported net sales declined 11.4%, impacted by an approximately $5 billion currency impact from the continued strength of the U.S. dollar. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates continue to negatively impact our reported results. So it's important to emphasize that our business on a constant currency basis is maintaining steady growth. We had strong positive comp sales in Mexico and Canada. The U.K., Brazil and China posted negative comps although the comps were slightly better in Q3 versus Q2. In each of our other markets, we had solid comps of at least 3%.
Operating income grew faster than net sales at 8.5% on a constant currency basis, driven in large part by excellent performance in Mexico and Canada. In addition, as Claire mentioned earlier, there was an immaterial lease accounting adjustment this quarter, which favorably impacted operating expenses by approximately $49 million on a constant currency basis. With the currency exchange impact, operating income decreased 6.4%.
On a constant currency basis, inventory grew faster than net sales at 7%, primarily driven by our decision in Mexico to flow inventory through our import network early for the upcoming holiday season. On a reported basis, inventory declined 10%. 
Now let's discuss market results presented on a constant currency basis for our largest markets. In all countries except Brazil and China, financial results are inclusive of e-commerce.
Let's begin with the U.K. Challenging competitive conditions persisted throughout the quarter as the market continues to experience rapid structural change. Customers have now benefited for more than 12 months of continually falling prices, and the market has grown by less than 1% for 6 consecutive months, despite a healthier overall economy according to Kantar. The big 4 grocers continue to lose share to the discounters.
U.K. net sales declined by 3.2% and comp sales, excluding fuel, were down 4.6%. Large store traffic and food remain the primary challenges, while online grocery continues to grow. The online business is focused on improving its core service offering and is performing above target on key internal performance metrics. Operating income increased, driven by reduced expenses as well as lapping some organizational restructuring costs from last year.
The U.K. is focused on rebuilding momentum in its core business. Last month, we launched Project Renewal, an 18-month project that reaffirms the direction set out in the 5-year strategy, but prioritizes the investments more clearly on price, quality and service in large stores while putting noncore expansion, such as remote petrol stations, on hold.
Greater focus on driving out inefficiencies across both buying and operations will enable the U.K. to build on its well-established value credentials and strengthen its competitive position.
Let's now discuss Mexico which released their earnings on October 27. Please note the Walmex release is under IFRS and the results here are under U.S. GAAP, therefore, some numbers may differ.
Consolidated Walmex net sales increased 7.4%, with strong comp sales in both Mexico and Central America. Mexico sales grew 7.6% and comp sales increased 6.3%, driven by solid comp growth in both self-service and Sam's Club. In self-service, we achieved mid-single-digit growth in groceries and high single-digit growth in GM and apparel. Self-service continues to gain share and delivered a 220 basis point improvement in market share according to ANTAD. Sam's Club is maintaining it's steady improvement in comps, aided by ongoing events and campaigns to drive traffic and grow membership. We leveraged expenses in the quarter and grew operating income significantly faster than sales.
Our e-commerce business in Mexico is growing in line with the market, driven by strong growth in general merchandise. Under the Walmart banner, we're significantly expanding our assortment of ship-from-store items. We're rapidly growing store coverage for online grocery and customer orders are increasing. At Sam's Club, we've soft launched our new website, while maintaining healthy growth with our existing platform. 
In Canada, we continue to maintain solid growth and gain share in a competitive and low growth environment. Net sales grew 5.7% and comps were up 4.3%, driven by strong performance in our core grocery business as well as stronger performance in our GM business. In the quarter, Canada saw share gains in food, health and wellness, consumables and infants for the 12 weeks ended October 29 according to Nielsen. In addition to strong top line performance, the team continues the focus on our low-cost operating model to drive a sustainable price advantage. Canada grew operating income faster than sales.
We continue to invest in expanding customer access. We recently began a partnership with 7-Eleven and are piloting Grab & Go lockers at some of their convenience stores in the Greater Toronto area. We are pleased with the progress that our online grocery business has made since our pilot launched in July. Overall, I'm pleased with our results in Canada and I expect reliable growth to continue.
In Brazil, the economic challenges are largely unchanged as high inflation and unemployment continue to impact consumer confidence and consumption levels. Net sales were down 0.4% and comps were down 0.6%, driven by a decline in the hypermarket format, mostly offset by strong sales growth in our wholesale business.
General merchandise, primarily electronics, accounted for the largest portion of the hypermarket sales decline. These economic challenges are impacting both our store and e-commerce sales.
Operating income declined faster than sales due to increased labor claims, continued high utility costs and higher markdown activity which helped us improve our inventory position going into the fourth quarter.
Let's now shift to China, a key growth market. This quarter, sales grew 2.9%, driven by new store openings. Comp sales declined 0.7% amid slower consumption growth. In the hypermarket channel, we gained share for an 11th consecutive quarter. We'll continue to invest in physical and digital to deliver a seamless shopping experience.
We continue to drive efficiency in stores and at the home office. Operating income grew faster than net sales. We operate for less productivity initiatives remain a focus, allowing reinvestment in labor and customer experience, particularly in fresh.
Yihaodian, our e-commerce business in China, is focused on further leveraging Walmart's global and local assets. The business improved margins and balanced marketing spend amid intense competition on price.
While I'm not satisfied with recent results, I'm confident in the actions we're taking in China that position us to achieve success for many years to come. 
Now let me recap. We had a good quarter with solid sales momentum in our underlying business, driven by healthy comp sales in a majority of our markets. In addition, we delivered a relatively high level of constant currency operating profit. Our strategy remains focused and our priorities are clear and we're well-positioned for future growth.

Today, I'll share details about our third quarter performance along with comp guidance for the fourth quarter. Members are at the center of the decisions we make, and I'll talk about our ongoing efforts this year to deliver value for them. I'll also share with you specifics around our strategy which is based on an in-depth review of the business that we've conducted this year.
Before I get started, let me recognize Charles Redfield for his many contributions to Sam's Club over the last 3 years as our Chief Merchandising Officer. His passion for merchandising was experienced throughout the organization. We are excited for Charles as he takes on his new role as Head Merchant for Food in the Walmart U.S. business. With Charles' transition, we are thrilled to have John Furner back at Sam's Club as our new Chief Merchandising Officer after having served as the Chief Merchandising and Marketing Officer in China for nearly 3 years.
Let's move on to a few specifics around our third quarter results. Unless otherwise noted, today's financial discussion will exclude fuel for purposes of comparability. For results with fuel and additional information, please refer to the accompanying presentation posted with this transcript.
Comp sales for the third quarter were at the low end of our guidance. In key food categories, we faced comparisons to last year's steep inflationary environment. And in our wireless business, we continue to experience headwinds from changing industry dynamics. We saw positive results in areas of the business that introduced more newness such as health and wellness and consumables.
Net sales grew 1.6% as comp sales increased 0.4%. Slide 10 provides the components of our comp increase. Ticket grew 70 basis points during the period. Positive momentum in traffic from savings members continued but softness from our business member negatively impacted our results.
Our gross profit rate increased 46 basis points from last year due to a disciplined focus on product acquisition costs, a favorable mix and logistics benefits.
Operating expenses deleveraged during quarter as we continued to invest in people and technology. We are confident that these are the right choices to make for our business and the benefits of these investments will help us deliver sustainable growth over time. Earlier, you heard Claire talk about an immaterial item related to the company's accounting for certain leases which resulted in a benefit to operating expenses of approximately $27 million for Sam's Club.
We were pleased with the growth in membership income during the quarter which increased 5.4%. Investments in the cash rewards program for Plus members resulted in improved Plus renewal rates and Plus penetration is at an all-time high. The impact of social media campaigns was also a contributing factor.
Turning to our merchandising categories, let me talk about a few areas that had the most impact during the quarter. Please see Slide 11 of the accompanying presentation for the comp performance of the remaining categories.
Our fresh/freezer/cooler business faced significant headwinds as deflation in key areas including fresh meat and dairy weighed on our comps. We were pleased with our performance in produce.
Technology and entertainment was pressured during the period, led by a decline in wireless. The industry shift in installment plans continued to negatively impact the category. In electronics, imaging and audio performed well and we continued our efforts to refine the assortment.
Health and wellness and consumables benefited from innovation and newness. In pharmacy, the free/4/10 prescription program continued to drive growth in script counts. New items in OTC led to a solid performance in the quarter and products like protein powder drove good results, further supporting our initiatives around healthy for you. 
Our consumables business benefited as several new items were launched and we continue to gain share in tabletop as the focus on private brands and quality resonated with members.
In e-commerce, we continue to make progress with integrating digital efforts to transform how members shop and interact with our clubs. Business members have enjoyed the convenience of preordering merchandise for pickup at the club for more than a decade. Now through advances in technology along with innovation from the e-commerce team, all of our members can enjoy similar access with an improved digital experience.
This year's roll-out of Club Pickup to all of our clubs has been well received and represents the fastest growing area of our business. Sales in this space increased 50% during the third quarter. We have also added features along the way. During the quarter, we completed the implementation of mobile check-in capabilities to provide members with a better experience and shorter wait times. We introduced geofencing technology that alerts our associates when members drive onto the parking lot. We extended drive-through or curbside options to more clubs and members love the convenience. These new features build on earlier advances in Club Pickup, including easy reorder and a prepaid option.
Now let me move on to our guidance for the fourth quarter. As we move into the quarter, we will face last year's inflationary environment and a tough comparison. As a result, we believe comp sales without fuel for the 13-week period ending January 29, 2016, will be flat to up 1%.
Members are at the center of the decisions we make. We've worked diligently this year to deliver on what we know they want. They expect offerings that are relevant and convenient. They want excitement and newness. They want a seamless shopping experience that integrate the best in digital and physical. We see success where we are delivering on these expectations.
For example, you've heard us talk about the expansion of organics in our assortment. Members ask for an improved selection and we are delivering. Over the summer, we launched Shocking Values online which has helped to instill a treasure hunt mentality with members. And the innovative free/4/10 prescription program is providing real savings to Plus members and helping to lift the overall health and wellness category.
I'm pleased with the steps we've been taking throughout this year to deliver for members. We know we must do more with member-relevant merchandise and new member growth. Today, I'm excited to share with you the plans we've developed as we look ahead. We have been focused on developing a strategy at Sam's Club that will deliver our business into the future and build long-term sustainable growth. The 4 key elements of our strategy include: growth through higher household income members and high-value business segments; relevant merchandise and increased value for our members; acquiring and retaining the right members and increasing the spend; and lastly, integrating digital to transform the club experience.
In order to better align the business as we move forward, we made organizational changes and enhancements. John Furner is returning to Sam's Club as the Executive Vice President and Chief Merchandising Officer. John has rejoined the team after nearly 3 years as Chief Merchandising and Chief Marketing Officer of Walmart China, where he led Merchandising, Procurement, Marketing, Supply Chain, Financial Services and Mobile Commerce for the Hypermarket division. Prior to moving overseas, John was Senior Vice President of Home and  Apparel Merchandise in Global Sourcing for Sam's Club.
In addition, we've reallocated resources pertaining to merchandising and have created new positions in critical areas including data and analytics, fresh food, regional buying and proprietary brands. We also created a new leadership position dedicated to business member merchandising. 
Moving forward, we will continue to serve both savings and business members. We have clarity around the categories of members we will target. Data will drive our decisions and I'm confident we are focused on the right opportunities.
As I close, let me summarize today's thoughts. As we look back at the third quarter, we acknowledge that we need to improve our sales. Where we introduce new merchandise, we delivered strong results. We continue to make strategic investments in people and technology as these are critical enablers of our strategy. We're also pleased with our efforts to further integrate digital and physical retail. Our members are at the center of all our decisions. We are making progress across the club and through online and mobile commerce capabilities to deliver value for them. Whether it's saving them time with Club Pickup or saving them money on their prescriptions with free/4/10, we continue to find new ways to innovate. And we're confident the strategy and enhancements to our organizational structure will propel our business into the future.
Now I'll turn the call over to Charles. Charles?"

I'd like to start by highlighting that we are pleased with the sales increases we experienced in Walmart U.S. as well as in our International business when considering constant currency. Stronger traffic in our Walmart U.S. stores and a fifth consecutive quarter of positive comp sales indicate that we are taking the right steps to win with customers, grow sales and deliver a seamless shopping experience at scale. 
From an e-commerce standpoint, we have long-term plans in place to grow our business. We are making progress on several of our key initiatives and recognize we have more work to do. As expected, the investments we are making in people and technology impacted both operating expenses and profits in the quarter. However, we delivered earnings per share well within our guidance and remain confident that these investments will better position Walmart for the future. 
Now let's turn our attention to guidance for the fourth quarter and the full year. Last quarter, we indicated that we expected our full year fiscal 2016 earnings per share to range between $4.40 and $4.70. Today, we are narrowing our full year earnings per share guidance to range between $4.50 and $4.65, including a range of $1.40 and $1.55 for the fourth quarter. These ranges include the assumptions we provided in the second quarter which consists of the impact of our investments in wages, training and additional labor hours in our stores, the incremental investment in global e-commerce and the headwinds in the U.S. from pharmacy margins and shrink.
Currency remains a significant headwind for us. As I indicated at our analyst meeting last month, we expect our total net sales growth to be relatively flat for fiscal year 2016. It's important to note that if we were to exclude the impact of currency, our total net sales growth would be around 3% for the year. 
Now assuming currency exchange rates remain at current levels for the remainder of the year, we now expect the full year impact to earnings per share to be approximately $0.16, up $0.01 from last quarter's revised guidance of $0.15. Our effective tax rate is expected to range between 31% and 33% for the full year. As we have indicated in the past, our tax rate will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter and may be impacted by a number of factors including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, valuation allowances, changes in law, outcomes of administrative audits, the impacts of discrete items and the mix of earnings among our U.S. and International operations. And in any given quarter, our effective tax rate could be higher or lower than the full year. 
Now as I've mentioned at our analyst meeting last month, we are monitoring progress in Congress with respect to the extension of certain U.S. income tax legislation that expired at the end of calendar year 2014. If the legislation is passed, we'll end up closer to the lower end of the updated range that we've provided.
As I mentioned at the October analyst meeting, we will continue to review our portfolio, including stores and clubs. As in prior years, we may have charges related to closing businesses or stores and clubs. These charges would not be included in our guidance. This is my last call as the Chief Financial Officer as I'll be retiring effective January 31. I feel fortunate to be a small part of the Walmart story. I have enjoyed working with all of you over the past few years. Brett Biggs will take over as the Chief Financial Officer for Walmart effective January 1. You're in very capable hands, and I'm proud of the strong team that we've left behind that Brett will be leading in the future.
With that, thank you for listening today and for your interest in our company. And on behalf of the management team and our associates worldwide, we thank you for your support this year and wish you a happy, healthy and safe holiday season."

Thank you for joining us to hear more about our third quarter earnings as well as the strategy we shared at our Annual Meeting for the investment community last month.
Overall, we had a good quarter. We delivered earnings per share well within our guidance range, recorded our fifth straight quarter of positive comps at Walmart U.S.  and had solid international sales and profit growth on a constant currency basis. At the same time, we still have plenty of work to do, and there are areas of our business that must perform better.
Our earnings per share were $1.03, and we posted total revenue of $117.4 billion. I want to highlight that on a constant currency basis, our total revenue would have been $122.4 billion. That's growth of $3.4 billion or 2.8% on a constant currency basis, which is solid growth. Even if the percentage doesn't sound high because we have such a large denominator, not many companies grow by this amount in a quarter. I call this out because I don't want the currency impacts to obscure the strength of our business. We are a growth company, and we're growing.
As we expected, operating income continued to be pressured by our decision to invest in our frontline associates. To improve the store experience for our customers and create a bridge to our future where digital capabilities will play an increasing role in our stores, we're making a $1.2 billion planned investment in our people this year that we understood would impact near-term operating income. This is by far the biggest driver of the decline in consolidated operating income.
Before going into the details, I want to take a step back to talk about our strategy. At our investor meeting last month, we shared more detail than usual about the next 3 years of our growth plan. We've never been a company that manages only for the short term, and that's certainly true during this period of change. Although investments in our people and technology impact near-term earnings, they will help us deliver sustainable growth and returns to shareholders over time.
We're confident these are the right steps because we know where and how we're going to win. We will be the first to deliver a seamless shopping experience at scale. No matter how you choose to shop with us, through your mobile device, online, in a store or a combination, it will be fast and easy. Online retailers are testing physical store experiences because they recognize the same customer desire that we do. There's a race to do this right, but only Walmart can bring together a dense network of stores, supported by a supply chain and systems like ours, with an emerging set of digital capabilities to win with customers.
As we create this seamless experience, we're positioning for growth in 5 key areas. First, we'll continue to win on value. We've won on value in the past and that won't change. Second, convenience is increasingly important as customers want to save both money and time. Third, we will always work to be great merchants, whether in-stores or online. Fourth, we're focused on the key geographies for customer growth, which are North America and China. Finally, we want to appeal to a blend of income levels. The way we're approaching e-commerce, Neighborhood Markets, Sam's Club, grocery pickup and other areas will appeal to value-conscious customers of all demographics. We already serve customers from all income levels around the world, but we have an opportunity to get even stronger.
By taking these steps, we will grow the company faster. We will add between $45 billion and $60 billion of revenue to the company in the next 3 years. That's a lot of growth. It just happens to be on a big base.
Returning to this quarter's results, one of the most important takeaways is that our U.S. stores continue to improve, with total net sales up nearly 4%. In addition to positive comp sales, Walmart U.S. had its fourth straight quarter of positive traffic. We're now lapping positive comp sales and building on our progress. Our customers are telling us that our efforts around clean, fast and friendly are resonating.
Neighborhood Markets continued to show strong sales, led by our newer stores, and have posted positive comps for 19 consecutive quarters. A key part of creating a seamless shopping experience is to have great stores, and we feel good about where we're heading.
We also made strides in the U.S. on adding critical capabilities to our supply chain. In the third quarter, we opened a new e-commerce fulfillment center in Atlanta with more than 1 million square feet of space. This is our fifth next-generation fulfillment center.
As we build out our e-commerce capabilities, we are deepening our digital relationships with our customers. We've accelerated our expansion of online grocery pickup, and we've seen that customers who start using online grocery spend nearly 50% more than similar customers who shop only in stores. This is the customer we're going after: the shopper in our sweet spot who accesses Walmart in multiple ways.
We also began the chain-wide use of a mobile service that can tell us when a customer is coming to pick up an online general merchandise order before they even walk into the store. And we launched a new digital wish list that you can build at home or simply by scanning items in a store. We expect more than 210 million visits to our app in November and December, up from 18 million in 2012.
Last month, we told you about our longer-term plans to grow e-commerce sales and GMV. That plan anticipates ebbs and flows along the way, but we are confident in our targets. We continue to expect to grow mid- to high-teens for this fiscal year. During the third quarter, Global eCommerce sales and GMV growth both came in at around 10%. This was due primarily to continued economic challenges in our major international markets, including Brazil, China and the U.K. In the U.S., where we've seen good growth for the year, we continue to make progress on key initiatives but we know we have more work to do. I was pleased that SamsClub.com continued to deliver strong growth.
In Walmart International, we're pleased with the solid 3.2% sales growth on a constant currency basis. Operating income grew faster than sales at 8.5%, excluding currency. Our North American markets delivered strong performance, and Mexico, in particular, is starting to fire on all cylinders. I'm pleased with our momentum in these markets. We continue to face specific challenges in the U.K. and Brazil.
China remains a huge long-term opportunity. We started in China in 1996. We've grown the business, reached profitability years ago and grown our level of profitability. We obviously learned a lot about Chinese customers and the market, and that's an asset. A few weeks ago, I was back in Beijing and Shanghai, walking stores, clubs and visiting our e-commerce offices. We now have a total of 12 Sam's Clubs open and they're performing very well. Our stores have clearly improved operationally in recent years in particular, and now they're supported by a supply chain that positions us to win. We see that e-commerce, online grocery and convenience are critical in the dense urban areas that make up so much of the Chinese opportunity. That's why our Yihaodian acquisition is of such strategic significance. We also recommitted to our work on food safety, environmental sustainability and empowering women during my visit, announcing another investment in the China Women's Development Foundation. With the improvements we've made to our stores and clubs, and the full acquisition of Yihaodian, we have a unique opportunity and a plan to put it all together to win in China.
While positive, our U.S. Sam's Club comp sales, without fuel, were at the low end of our guidance. We were pleased with the growth in membership income, but we can do better with our overall results. Sam's Club did take important steps this quarter to deepen digital relationships with our members through Club Pickup, expanded mobile check-in capabilities and extended drive-thru or curbside options. Roz will share more about our strategy going forward in a moment.
In addition to releasing earnings, today is a big day at our Home Office. We're holding a Sustainability Milestone Meeting to celebrate 10 years of progress on sustainability since our then-CEO, Lee Scott, delivered a landmark speech titled 21st Century Leadership. In those remarks, Lee laid out 3 big goals for Walmart: to be powered by 100% renewable energy, to create 0 waste and to sell products that sustain people and the environment. It was a defining moment for our company. By looking through the lens of sustainability, Lee realized we can think about problems in creative ways, make our business more efficient and bring renewed passion to our work. It was and is inspiring to be part of this journey.
Today, we'll mark how far we've come and what we've achieved. For example, the savings we've generated from reducing waste, running our truck fleet more efficiently and pursuing energy efficiency has been good for society and good for our shareholders. We're getting excited to take the next steps in this journey early next year. In true Walmart fashion, we're looking at ways to make a difference in the world, serve our stakeholders and drive our bottom line.
Let me reiterate that we are excited about the unique opportunity we have to create a seamless shopping experience for our customers and ensure sustainable growth for the business. We're making critical investments to better serve our customers, associates and shareholders, and we are on the right path.
As I close, I want to pause to thank Charles Holley for his years of outstanding service to Walmart. As you know, he's made the decision to retire. He's been a huge asset to the company and a great partner to me and the leadership team. This is his last earnings call, and he will be missed. Thank you, Charles.

Today, I'll provide commentary on the company's consolidated financial statements. Further details are available in the accompanying presentation posted with this transcript.
Prior to discussing our results, let me talk about an item that, although immaterial, impacts comparability against last year.
As we disclosed in the second quarter, we conducted a global review of the accounting treatment for leases, which included a focus on leases where our payment of certain structural component costs during a lessor's construction of a leased store causes us to be deemed the owner of the property for accounting purposes. In the third quarter, we finalized this review and recorded an immaterial cumulative adjustment.
On a consolidated basis, the immaterial adjustment increased total assets by approximately $1.7 billion, which was primarily an increase in property under capital lease and financing obligations; increased total liabilities by approximately $1.6 billion, which was primarily an increase in current and long-term capital lease and financing obligations; and it positively impacted earnings per share by approximately $0.04.
Let's now move to our results for the quarter. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Walmart, EPS, were $1.03, which includes the item mentioned above. Additionally, there were significant items that negatively impacted EPS, including investments in wages and training in the U.S. of approximately $0.10 and currency exchange rate movements totaling $0.04. Last year's EPS was $1.15.
Total revenue reached $117.4 billion. Currency negatively impacted net sales by approximately $5 billion. On a constant currency basis, total revenue was $122.4 billion.
Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 91 basis points compared to last year, primarily as a result of investments in store wages and labor hours in the U.S. Additionally, FCPA and compliance-related costs were approximately $30 million, comprised of $22 million for ongoing inquiries and investigations, and $8 million for our global compliance program and organizational enhancements. Last year, FCPA and compliance-related costs were approximately $41 million.
The company's consolidated operating income decreased 8.8% to $5.7 billion. Excluding the impact from currency of approximately $214 million, operating income decreased 5.4%, primarily related to the factors that increased our operating expenses.
I'll close today's discussion with a few comments on returns. At Walmart, we remain committed to providing good returns for our shareholders. During last month's meeting for the investment community, we announced a new share repurchase authorization of $20 billion, and said that our intention is to utilize this authorization over a 2-year period. The company repurchased approximately 6.1 million shares for $437 million during the third quarter.
Return on investment, ROI, for the trailing 12 months ended October 31, 2015, was 15.9% versus 16.4% for the prior comparable period. The decline in ROI was primarily due to our decrease in operating income as well as continued capital investments.

Last month at our annual meeting for the investment community, I spoke in detail about how Walmart U.S. will execute our part of the plan to be the first to deliver a seamless shopping experience at scale. We will drive growth and deliver shareholder returns by winning with stores, delivering value, being great merchants and providing our customers with a convenient shopping experience that is fast and easy. Although we're in the early stages of our journey, we're confident in our plan, and we're executing against it.
Now let's talk about our Q3 performance. As we've said before, we continue to measure our success in terms of traffic, in-stock and customer experience. Overall, we're pleased with the momentum in the top line. Net sales increased $2.7 billion or 3.8%. Unit sales picked up and traffic strengthened, improving 40 basis points from Q2 to 1.7%. This is now the fourth consecutive quarter of positive comp traffic growth for Walmart U.S. Our comp sales growth of 1.5% was solidly within our guidance despite minimal food inflation. In-stocks improved, while comp store inventory declined.
Our customers told us they're happy with the improvements we're making in their shopping experience, as reflected in our customer experience scores. To date, 70% of our stores have achieved the initial goal we set for them, and we'll raise the bar for next year. We also saw some progress this quarter in gross margin with the work we've put in on pharmacy, markdowns and shrink. However, as we have discussed before, the investments in our stores and our associates are significant and will continue to pressure the bottom line.
All formats in our portfolio had positive comps this quarter, and we're happy with the progress we've made in our supercenters, which saw continued traffic growth and positive comps across all areas except entertainment.
Our traditional-format Neighborhood Markets delivered an approximate 8% comp in the third quarter, a 70-basis-point acceleration from our Q2 comp, and aided by strong performance in our less mature stores. New technology and processes are improving in-stocks, and we're working hard on providing the best associate coverage to most effectively serve our customers.
Most importantly, fresh remains a key focus. We're encouraged by our newest prototype, which features better sightlines and displays. We've seen fresh penetration expand in the store relative to its peers. We've made solid progress this year, but we still have a ways to go to ensure we're creating the best experience for our customer while simultaneously improving the profitability of this format.
In e-commerce, we made strides on deepening the digital relationship with our customer. This quarter, we accelerated our online grocery pickup offering to 85 additional locations. We now have almost 140 locations across 25 markets that offer the customer the ability to order their groceries online and conveniently pick up at a time of their choosing. We also launched a new mobile service, which alerts us when a customer is coming to pick up their online general merchandise order even before they walk into the store. And just in time for the holidays, we introduced a digital wish list that can be built at home or by simply scanning items while at the store. 
E-commerce sales and traffic were softer than we would like. We'll continue to strive to balance sales growth and profitability. Overall, e-commerce sales contributed approximately 15 basis points to our comp.
From a merchandise perspective, we saw growth across most of the store, particularly in our apparel, hardlines, home and seasonal businesses. While warmer weather somewhat slowed performance in October, solid back-to-school and Halloween seasons, along with new launches such as Pioneer Woman and Star Wars, drove mid-single-digit comps across each of these departments.
Continued growth in prescription count and branded drug inflation drove mid-single-digit comps in health and wellness. OTC was also strong as better in-stocks, particularly in vitamins, helped drive sales.
In food, we saw our best top line results of the year, despite minimal inflation, which negatively impacted our total box comp by approximately 90 basis points. Momentum from a solid Labor Day weekend continued through to Halloween. We're particularly pleased with the results in fresh, where we brought in new products, developed strong price leadership through strategic buys and promoted locally sourced and organic product.
While most of the box continued to grow, we still have considerable headwinds in entertainment. A slow adoption of new technology in televisions and the shift from postpaid to installment wireless plans contributed to disappointing sales results. We're working on improving our operating model in this area, both in terms of service to our customers and in the layout of the department.
We've made some progress this year, including the recent remodel of the Rogers, Arkansas supercenter we showed you last month, but it will take time to get this department where it needs to be.
Moving on to the remainder of our financials. Gross margins increased 32 basis points versus last year. Gross margin rate improved in food, general merchandise and consumables, but were somewhat offset by declines in health and wellness. Reimbursement levels continued to pressure pharmacy profits, however, we've made some strides across several initiatives that improved margins in this department versus Q2. Additionally, we remain focused on our urgent agenda items, including better management of markdowns to 0. Finally, while only just beginning to show in our results, we are pleased with our efforts thus far on addressing shrink, which has been a significant headwind for us this year.
As we've said before, our top priority this year is to provide a better customer experience in our stores. We're committed to actions that help accomplish this goal as we have invested this year in our associates and in improving our stores. These investments are substantial and continue to reflect in our bottom line performance.
Specifically, in the third quarter, we intentionally added store labor hours above our initial plans and incurred significant maintenance expenses related to the customer-facing areas of the store. These investments, along with the wage increases and the store structure changes implemented earlier this year, drove the majority of the 116-basis-point deleverage in operating expenses.
As the store experience is being addressed and efficiencies are created through new tools, technology and processes, we've begun calibrating labor hours against these improvements. Over time, as the productivity loop begins turning faster, we know we can create a strong balance between experience and profitability.
We did benefit this quarter from the immaterial lease accounting cumulative adjustment that Claire mentioned in her earlier remarks, which favorably impacted operating expenses by $74 million.
As a result of our focus on improving customer experience, along with our ongoing investments in e-commerce and somewhat offset by the lease accounting adjustment I just mentioned, operating income declined 8.6%. Excluding the impact from the lease adjustment, operating income declined approximately 10%.
Moving on, in the third quarter, total inventory grew around 1%, which was less than half the rate of sales. Inventory declined approximately 1.9% in comp stores as new processes in technology have reduced inventory across the store, while simultaneously improving in-stock levels. We're proud of the progress we've made this year on improving inventory levels across our network, but we have room to improve and we remain focused on these efforts.
Finally, on the real estate side, we opened 15 supercenters in the third quarter, including relocations and expansions and 35 traditional format Neighborhood Markets. We're working hard on improving both of these formats to ensure we have the best customer offering alongside strong operating efficiency. We'll continue to test ideas, honing in on the best options for each of these formats.
Shifting now to the fourth quarter. The holiday season is upon us. Our associates have been working hard all year to prepare, and we're ready.
We have the best value on great merchandise for the entire season, without gimmicks. Our merchants have done a terrific job of listening to our customers on what they're looking for this season. We're excited about programs such as Chosen by Kids and our exclusive 1-Hour Guarantee event. And this holiday, we're working to bring our customers an improved shopping experience, whether they're in the store, online or using our mobile app. We know the holidays will be competitive. 
Additionally, we expect food inflation to remain low relative to last year, and we'll lap last year's significant drop in fuel prices, which will make the comparison for the fourth quarter more difficult. But we're confident in our strategy and the actions we're taking, and believe they'll help offset some of these pressures.
Therefore, for the 13-week period ending January 29, 2016, we expect a comp sales increase of around 1%, which would represent a 50-basis-point improvement in our 2-year comp stack from third quarter. Last year's fourth quarter comp was up 1.5%, our strongest comp performance of fiscal 2015.

We had a solid quarter with sales growth accelerating slightly from last quarter and operating income growing faster than sales, both on a constant currency basis. Comp trends in Mexico and Canada continued to be strong, which more than offset weaker sales performances in the U.K., Brazil and China, where we continue to experience various competitive and economic challenges.
Our markets remain focused on the strategic priorities discussed earlier this year, which include actively managing the existing portfolio; delivering balanced growth, including e-commerce; being the lowest cost operator; and building solid foundations in terms of talent, trust and technology.
Let me touch on some of the progress we've made. We've continued to take action this year to drive simplicity and focus in our portfolio. We sold a portfolio of properties under development with our shopping center joint venture partner in Canada and exited our bank operations in Mexico. We're currently pursuing the sale of a portfolio of shopping centers in Chile, and we're closing our business-to-business sales operations in the U.K. At the same time, we've looked for ways to enhance our portfolio in core markets, which we've done by creating taking full ownership of Yihaodian in China and acquiring 13 stores and 1 DC from a former competitor in Canada. We'll continue to review our portfolio to simplify our operations and help our teams stay focused on running great businesses.
Our markets continue to invest heavily in price, quality and service, aimed at driving comp sales. Our overall trend is improving as 7 of our 11 markets have now delivered positive comps for 6 straight quarters. We're delivering value and providing convenience that is attracting customers to our stores, clubs, websites and apps across our markets. 
I'm pleased with the innovation we're driving in e-commerce, led by online grocery. And I'm excited about the potential we have to access a broader customer segment. We continue to learn from our online grocery business in the U.K. as we test and roll out similar initiatives in Mexico and Canada and build a strong platform for growth in China.
As Doug mentioned, the continued economic challenges in some of our major markets impacted on our overall Global eCommerce sales growth this quarter. We still have work to do, but I'm confident we're executing against this key strategic priority.
Now let's discuss our overall results. In the third quarter, net sales grew 3.2% on a constant currency basis. Reported net sales declined 11.4%, impacted by an approximately $5 billion currency impact from the continued strength of the U.S. dollar. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates continue to negatively impact our reported results. So it's important to emphasize that our business on a constant currency basis is maintaining steady growth. We had strong positive comp sales in Mexico and Canada. The U.K., Brazil and China posted negative comps although the comps were slightly better in Q3 versus Q2. In each of our other markets, we had solid comps of at least 3%.
Operating income grew faster than net sales at 8.5% on a constant currency basis, driven in large part by excellent performance in Mexico and Canada. In addition, as Claire mentioned earlier, there was an immaterial lease accounting adjustment this quarter, which favorably impacted operating expenses by approximately $49 million on a constant currency basis. With the currency exchange impact, operating income decreased 6.4%.
On a constant currency basis, inventory grew faster than net sales at 7%, primarily driven by our decision in Mexico to flow inventory through our import network early for the upcoming holiday season. On a reported basis, inventory declined 10%. 
Now let's discuss market results presented on a constant currency basis for our largest markets. In all countries except Brazil and China, financial results are inclusive of e-commerce.
Let's begin with the U.K. Challenging competitive conditions persisted throughout the quarter as the market continues to experience rapid structural change. Customers have now benefited for more than 12 months of continually falling prices, and the market has grown by less than 1% for 6 consecutive months, despite a healthier overall economy according to Kantar. The big 4 grocers continue to lose share to the discounters.
U.K. net sales declined by 3.2% and comp sales, excluding fuel, were down 4.6%. Large store traffic and food remain the primary challenges, while online grocery continues to grow. The online business is focused on improving its core service offering and is performing above target on key internal performance metrics. Operating income increased, driven by reduced expenses as well as lapping some organizational restructuring costs from last year.
The U.K. is focused on rebuilding momentum in its core business. Last month, we launched Project Renewal, an 18-month project that reaffirms the direction set out in the 5-year strategy, but prioritizes investments more clearly on price, quality and service in large stores while putting noncore expansion, such as remote petrol stations, on hold.
Greater focus on driving out inefficiencies across both buying and operations will enable the U.K. to build on its well-established value credentials and strengthen its competitive position.
Let's now discuss Mexico, which released their earnings on October 27. Please note the Walmex release is under IFRS and the results here are under U.S. GAAP, therefore, some numbers may differ.
Consolidated Walmex net sales increased 7.4%, with strong comp sales in both Mexico and Central America. Mexico sales grew 7.6% and comp sales increased 6.3%, driven by solid comp growth in both self-service and Sam's Club. In self-service, we achieved mid-single-digit growth in groceries and high single-digit growth in GM and apparel. Self-service continues to gain share and delivered a 220 basis-point improvement in market share according to ANTAD. Sam's Club is maintaining its steady improvement in comps, aided by ongoing events and campaigns to drive traffic and grow membership. We leveraged expenses in the quarter and grew operating income significantly faster than sales.
Our e-commerce business in Mexico is growing in line with the market, driven by strong growth in general merchandise. Under the Walmart banner, we're significantly expanding our assortment of ship-from-store items. We're rapidly growing store coverage for online grocery and customer growth orders are increasing. At Sam's Club, we've soft launched our new website, while maintaining healthy with our existing platform. 
In Canada, we continue to maintain solid growth and gain share in a competitive and low growth environment. Net sales grew 5.7% and comps were up 4.3%, driven by strong performance in our core grocery business as well as stronger performance in our GM business. In the quarter, Canada saw share gains in food, health and wellness, consumables and infants for the 12 weeks ended October 29 according to Nielsen. In addition to strong top line performance, the team continues to focus on our low-cost operating model to drive a sustainable price advantage. Canada grew operating income faster than sales.
We continue to invest in expanding customer access. We recently began a partnership with 7-Eleven and are piloting Grab & Go lockers at some of their convenience stores in the Greater Toronto area. We are pleased with the progress that our online grocery business has made since our pilot launch in July. Overall, I'm pleased with our results in Canada and I expect reliable growth to continue.
In Brazil, the economic challenges are largely unchanged as high inflation and unemployment continue to impact consumer confidence and consumption levels. Net sales were down 0.4% and comps were down 0.6%, driven by a decline in the hypermarket format, mostly offset by strong sales growth in our wholesale business.
General merchandise, primarily electronics, accounted for the largest portion of the hypermarket sales decline. These economic challenges are impacting both our store and e-commerce sales.
Operating income declined faster than sales due to increased labor claims, continued high utility costs and higher markdown activity, which helped us improve our inventory position going into the fourth quarter.
Let's now shift to China, a key growth market. This quarter, sales grew 2.9%, driven by new store openings. Comp sales declined 0.7% amid slower consumption growth. In the hypermarket channel, we gained share for an 11th consecutive quarter. We'll continue to invest in physical and digital to deliver a seamless shopping experience.
We continue to drive efficiency in stores and at the home office. Operating income grew faster than net sales. We operate for less productivity initiatives remain a focus, allowing reinvestment in labor and customer experience, particularly in fresh.
Yihaodian, our e-commerce business in China, is focused on further leveraging Walmart's global and local assets. The business improved margins and balanced marketing spend amid intense competition on price.
While I'm not satisfied with recent results, I'm confident in the actions we're taking in China that position us to achieve success for many years to come. 
Now let me recap. We had a good quarter with solid sales momentum in our underlying business, driven by healthy comp sales in a majority of our markets. In addition, we delivered a relatively high level of constant currency operating profit. Our strategy remains focused and our priorities are clear and we're well positioned for future growth.

Today, I'll share details about our third quarter performance along with comp guidance for the fourth quarter. Members are at the center of the decisions we make, and I'll talk about our ongoing efforts this year to deliver value for them. I'll also share with you specifics around our strategy, which is based on an in-depth review of the business that we've conducted this year.
Before I get started, let me recognize Charles Redfield for his many contributions to Sam's Club over the last 3 years as our Chief Merchandising Officer. His passion for merchandising was experienced throughout the organization. We are excited for Charles as he takes on his new role as Head Merchant for Food in the Walmart U.S. business. With Charles' transition, we are thrilled to have John Furner back at Sam's Club as our new Chief Merchandising Officer after having served as the Chief Merchandising and Marketing Officer in China for nearly 3 years.
Let's move on to a few specifics around our third quarter results. Unless otherwise noted, today's financial discussion will exclude fuel for purposes of comparability. For results with fuel and additional information, please refer to the accompanying presentation posted with this transcript.
Comp sales for the third quarter were at the low end of our guidance. In key food categories, we faced comparisons to last year's steep inflationary environment. And in our wireless business, we continue to experience headwinds from changing industry dynamics. We saw positive results in areas of the business that introduced more newness such as health and wellness and consumables.
Net sales grew 1.6% as comp sales increased 0.4%. Slide 10 provides the components of our comp increase. Ticket grew 70 basis points during the period. Positive momentum in traffic from savings members continued but softness from our business member negatively impacted our results.
Our gross profit rate increased 46 basis points from last year due to a disciplined focus on product acquisition costs, a favorable mix and logistics benefits.
Operating expenses deleveraged during quarter as we continued to invest in people and technology. We are confident that these are the right choices to make for our business and the benefits of these investments will help us deliver sustainable growth over time. Earlier, you heard Claire talk about an immaterial item related to the company's accounting for certain leases, which resulted in a benefit to operating expenses of approximately $27 million for Sam's Club.
We were pleased with the growth in membership income during the quarter, which increased 5.4%. Investments in the cash rewards program for Plus members resulted in improved Plus renewal rates and Plus penetration is at an all-time high. The impact of social media campaigns was also a contributing factor.
Turning to our merchandising categories, let me talk about a few areas that had the most impact during the quarter. Please see Slide 11 of the accompanying presentation for the comp performance of the remaining categories.
Our fresh/freezer/cooler business faced significant headwinds as deflation in key areas including fresh meat and dairy weighed on our comps. We were pleased with our performance in produce.
Technology and entertainment was pressured during the period, led by a decline in wireless. The industry shift in installment plans continued to negatively impact the category. In electronics, imaging and audio performed well and we continued our efforts to refine the assortment.
Health and wellness and consumables benefited from innovation and newness. In pharmacy, the Free/4/10 prescription program continued to drive growth in script counts. New items in OTC led to a solid performance in the quarter and products like protein powder drove good results, further supporting our initiatives around healthy for you. 
Our consumables business benefited as several new items were launched and we continue to gain share in tabletop as the focus on private brands and quality resonated with members.
In e-commerce, we continue to make progress with integrating digital efforts to transform how members shop and interact with our clubs. Business members have enjoyed the convenience of preordering merchandise for pickup at the club for more than a decade. Now through advances in technology along with innovation from the e-commerce team, all of our members can enjoy similar access with an improved digital experience.
This year's roll-out of Club Pickup to all of our clubs has been well received and represents the fastest growing area of our business. Sales in this space increased 50% during the third quarter. We have also added features along the way. During the quarter, we completed the implementation of mobile check-in capabilities to provide members with a better experience and shorter wait times. We introduced geofencing technology that alerts our associates when members drive onto the parking lot. We extended drive-through or curbside options to more clubs and members love the convenience. These new features build on earlier advances in Club Pickup, including easy reorder and a prepaid option.
Now let me move on to guidance for the fourth quarter. As we move into the quarter, we will face last year's inflationary environment and a tough comparison. As a result, we believe comp sales without fuel for the 13-week period ending January 29, 2016, will be flat to up 1%.
Members are at the center of the decisions we make. We've worked diligently this year to deliver on what we know they want. They expect offerings that are relevant and convenient. They want excitement and newness. They want a seamless shopping experience that integrates the best in digital and physical. We see success where we are delivering on these expectations.
For example, you've heard us talk about the expansion of organics in our assortment. Members ask for an improved selection and we are delivering. Over the summer, we launched Shocking Values online, which has helped to instill a treasure hunt mentality with members. And the innovative Free/4/10 prescription program is providing real savings to Plus members and helping to lift the overall health and wellness category.
I'm pleased with the steps we've been taking throughout this year to deliver for members. We know we must do more with member-relevant merchandise and new member growth. Today, I'm excited to share with you the plans we've developed as we look ahead. We have been focused on developing a strategy at Sam's Club that will deliver our business into the future and build long-term sustainable growth. The 4 key elements of our strategy include: growth through higher household income members and high-value business segments; relevant merchandise and increased value for our members; acquiring and retaining the right members and increasing the spend; and lastly, integrating digital to transform the club experience.
In order to better align the business as we move forward, we made organizational changes and enhancements. John Furner is returning to Sam's Club as the Executive Vice President and Chief Merchandising Officer. John has rejoined the team after nearly 3 years as Chief Merchandising and Chief Marketing Officer of Walmart China, where he led Merchandising, Procurement, Marketing, Supply Chain, Financial Services and Mobile Commerce for the Hypermarket division. Prior to moving overseas, John was Senior Vice President of Home and Apparel Merchandise in Global Sourcing for Sam's Club.
In addition, we've reallocated resources pertaining to merchandising and have created new positions in critical areas including data and analytics, fresh food, regional buying and proprietary brands. We also created a new leadership position dedicated to business member merchandising. 
Moving forward, we will continue to serve both savings and business members. We have clarity around the categories of members we will target. Data will drive our decisions and I'm confident we are focused on the right opportunities.
As I close, let me summarize today's thoughts. As we look back at the third quarter, we acknowledge that we need to improve our sales. Where we introduce new merchandise, we delivered strong results. We continue to make strategic investments in people and technology as these are critical enablers of our strategy. We're also pleased with our efforts to further integrate digital and physical retail. Our members are at the center of all our decisions. We are making progress across the Club and through online and mobile commerce capabilities to deliver value for them. Whether it's saving them time with Club Pickup or saving them money on their prescriptions with Free/4/10, we continue to find new ways to innovate. And we're confident the strategy and enhancements to our organizational structure will propel our business into the future.
Now I'll turn the call over to Charles. Charles?"
313055,280452666,905460,"Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Q3 2016 Pre Recorded Earnings Call, Nov 17, 2015",2015-11-17,"Earnings Calls","Walmart Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Roz. I'd like to start by highlighting that we are pleased with the sales increases we experienced in Walmart U.S. as well as in our International business when considering constant currency. Stronger traffic in our Walmart U.S. stores and a fifth",667,"Thanks, Roz. I'd like to start by highlighting that we are pleased with the sales increases we experienced in Walmart U.S. as well as in our International business when considering constant currency. Stronger traffic in our Walmart U.S. stores and a fifth consecutive quarter of positive comp sales indicate that we are taking the right steps to win with customers, grow sales and deliver a seamless shopping experience at scale. 
From an e-commerce standpoint, we have long-term plans in place to grow our business. We are making progress on several of our key initiatives and recognize we have more work to do. As expected, the investments we are making in people and technology impacted both operating expenses and profits in the quarter. However, we delivered earnings per share well within our guidance and remain confident that these investments will better position Walmart for the future. 
Now let's turn our attention to guidance for the fourth quarter and the full year. Last quarter, we indicated that we expected our full year fiscal 2016 earnings per share to range between $4.40 and $4.70. Today, we are narrowing our full year earnings per share guidance to a range between $4.50 and $4.65, including a range of $1.40 and $1.55 for the fourth quarter. These ranges include the assumptions we provided in the second quarter, which consists of the impact of our investments in wages, training and additional labor hours in our stores, the incremental investment in global e-commerce and the headwinds in the U.S. from pharmacy margins and shrink.
Currency remains a significant headwind for us. As I indicated at our analyst meeting last month, we expect our total net sales growth to be relatively flat for fiscal year 2016. It's important to note that if we were to exclude the impact of currency, our total net sales growth would be around 3% for the year. 
Now assuming currency exchange rates remain at current levels for the remainder of the year, we now expect the full year impact to earnings per share to be approximately $0.16, up $0.01 from last quarter's revised guidance of $0.15. Our effective tax rate is expected to range between 31% and 33% for the full year. As we have indicated in the past, our tax rate will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter and may be impacted by a number of factors including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, valuation allowances, changes in law, outcomes of administrative audits, the impacts of discrete items and the mix of earnings among our U.S. and International operations. And in any given quarter, our effective tax rate could be higher or lower than the full year. 
Now as I've mentioned at our analyst meeting last month, we are monitoring progress in Congress with respect to the extension of certain U.S. income tax legislation that expired at the end of calendar year 2014. If the legislation is passed, we'll end up closer to the lower end of the updated range that we've provided.
As I mentioned at the October analyst meeting, we will continue to review our portfolio, including stores and clubs. As in prior years, we may have charges related to closing businesses or stores and clubs. These charges would not be included in our guidance. This is my last call as the Chief Financial Officer as I'll be retiring effective January 31. I feel fortunate to be a small part of the Walmart story. I have enjoyed working with all of you over the past few years. Brett Biggs will take over as the Chief Financial Officer for Walmart effective January 1. You're in very capable hands, and I'm proud of the strong team that we've left behind that Brett will be leading in the future.
With that, thank you for listening today and for your interest in our company. And on behalf of the management team and our associates worldwide, we thank you for your support this year and wish you a happy, healthy and safe holiday season."

We deliv",1697,"Thanks, Pauline, and good morning, everyone.
Thank you for joining us to hear more about our third quarter earnings as well as the strategy we shared at our Annual Meeting for the investment community last month.
Overall, we had a good quarter. We delivered earnings per share well within our guidance range, recorded our fifth straight quarter of positive comps at Walmart U.S. and had solid international sales and profit growth on a constant currency basis. At the same time, we still have plenty of work to do, and there are areas of our business that must perform better.
Our earnings per share were $1.03, and we posted total revenue of $117.4 billion. I want to highlight that on a constant currency basis, our total revenue would have been $122.4 billion. That's growth of $3.4 billion or 2.8% on a constant currency basis, which is solid growth. Even if the percentage doesn't sound high because we have such a large denominator, not many companies grow by this amount in a quarter. I call this out because I don't want the currency impacts to obscure the strength of our business. We are a growth company, and we're growing.
As we expected, operating income continued to be pressured by our decision to invest in our frontline associates. To improve the store experience for our customers and create a bridge to our future where digital capabilities will play an increasing role in our stores, we're making a $1.2 billion planned investment in our people this year that we understood would impact near-term operating income. This is by far the biggest driver of the decline in consolidated operating income.
Before going into the details, I want to take a step back to talk about our strategy. At our investor meeting last month, we shared more detail than usual about the next 3 years of our growth plan. We've never been a company that manages only for the short term, and that's certainly true during this period of change. Although investments in our people and technology impact near-term earnings, they will help us deliver sustainable growth and returns to shareholders over time.
We're confident these are the right steps because we know where and how we're going to win. We will be the first to deliver a seamless shopping experience at scale. No matter how you choose to shop with us, through your mobile device, online, in a store or a combination, it will be fast and easy. Online retailers are testing physical store experiences because they recognize the same customer desire that we do. There's a race to do this right, but only Walmart can bring together a dense network of stores, supported by a supply chain and systems like ours, with an emerging set of digital capabilities to win with customers.
As we create this seamless experience, we're positioning for growth in 5 key areas. First, we'll continue to win on value. We've won on value in the past and that won't change. Second, convenience is increasingly important as customers want to save both money and time. Third, we will always work to be great merchants, whether in-stores or online. Fourth, we're focused on the key geographies for customer growth, which are North America and China. Finally, we want to appeal to a blend of income levels. The way we're approaching e-commerce, Neighborhood Markets, Sam's Club, grocery pickup and other areas will appeal to value-conscious customers of all demographics. We already serve customers from all income levels around the world, but we have an opportunity to get even stronger.
By taking these steps, we will grow the company faster. We will add between $45 billion and $60 billion of revenue to the company in the next 3 years. That's a lot of growth. It just happens to be on a big base.
Returning to this quarter's results, one of the most important takeaways is that our U.S. stores continue to improve, with total net sales up nearly 4%. In addition to positive comp sales, Walmart U.S. had its fourth straight quarter of positive traffic. We're now lapping positive comp sales and building on our progress. Our customers are telling us that our efforts around clean, fast and friendly are resonating.
Neighborhood Markets continued to show strong sales, led by our newer stores, and have posted positive comps for 19 consecutive quarters. A key part of creating a seamless shopping experience is to have great stores, and we feel good about where we're heading.
We also made strides in the U.S. on adding critical capabilities to our supply chain. In the third quarter, we opened a new e-commerce fulfillment center in Atlanta with more than 1 million square feet of space. This is our fifth next-generation fulfillment center.
As we build out our e-commerce capabilities, we are deepening our digital relationships with our customers. We've accelerated our expansion of online grocery pickup, and we've seen that customers who start using online grocery spend nearly 50% more than similar customers who shop only in stores. This is the customer we're going after: the shopper in our sweet spot who accesses Walmart in multiple ways.
We also began the chain-wide use of a mobile service that can tell us when a customer is coming to pick up an online general merchandise order before they even walk into the store. And we launched a new digital wish list that you can build at home or simply by scanning items in a store. We expect more than 210 million visits to our app in November and December, up from 18 million in 2012.
Last month, we told you about our longer-term plans to grow e-commerce sales and GMV. That plan anticipates ebbs and flows along the way, but we are confident in our targets. We continue to expect to grow mid- to high-teens for this fiscal year. During the third quarter, Global eCommerce sales and GMV growth both came in at around 10%. This was due primarily to continued economic challenges in our major international markets, including Brazil, China and the U.K. In the U.S., where we've seen good growth for the year, we continue to make progress on key initiatives but we know we have more work to do. I was pleased that SamsClub.com continued to deliver strong growth.
In Walmart International, we're pleased with the solid 3.2% sales growth on a constant currency basis. Operating income grew faster than sales at 8.5%, excluding currency. Our North American markets delivered strong performance, and Mexico, in particular, is starting to fire on all cylinders. I'm pleased with our momentum in these markets. We continue to face specific challenges in the U.K. and Brazil.
China remains a huge long-term opportunity. We started in China in 1996. We've grown the business, reached profitability years ago and grown our level of profitability. We obviously learned a lot about Chinese customers and the market, and that's an asset. A few weeks ago, I was back in Beijing and Shanghai, walking stores, clubs and visiting our e-commerce offices. We now have a total of 12 Sam's Clubs open and they're performing very well. Our stores have clearly improved operationally in recent years in particular, and now they're supported by a supply chain that positions us to win. We see that e-commerce, online grocery and convenience are critical in the dense urban areas that make up so much of the Chinese opportunity. That's why our Yihaodian acquisition is of such strategic significance. We also recommitted to our work on food safety, environmental sustainability and empowering women during my visit, announcing another investment in the China Women's Development Foundation. With the improvements we've made to our stores and clubs, and the full acquisition of Yihaodian, we have a unique opportunity and a plan to put it all together to win in China.
While positive, our U.S. Sam's Club comp sales, without fuel, were at the low end of our guidance. We were pleased with the growth in membership income, but we can do better with our overall results. Sam's Club did take important steps this quarter to deepen digital relationships with our members through Club Pickup, expanded mobile check-in capabilities and extended drive-thru or curbside options. Roz will share more about our strategy going forward in a moment.
In addition to releasing earnings, today is a big day at our Home Office. We're holding a Sustainability Milestone Meeting to celebrate 10 years of progress on sustainability since our then-CEO, Lee Scott, delivered a landmark speech titled 21st Century Leadership. In those remarks, Lee laid out 3 big goals for Walmart: to be powered by 100% renewable energy, to create 0 waste and to sell products that sustain people and the environment. It was a defining moment for our company. By looking through the lens of sustainability, Lee realized we can think about problems in creative ways, make our business more efficient and bring renewed passion to our work. It was and is inspiring to be part of this journey.
Today, we'll mark how far we've come and what we've achieved. For example, the savings we've generated from reducing waste, running our truck fleet more efficiently and pursuing energy efficiency has been good for society and good for our shareholders. We're getting excited to take the next steps in this journey early next year. In true Walmart fashion, we're looking at ways to make a difference in the world, serve our stakeholders and drive our bottom line.
Let me reiterate that we are excited about the unique opportunity we have to create a seamless shopping experience for our customers and ensure sustainable growth for the business. We're making critical investments to better serve our customers, associates and shareholders, and we are on the right path.
As I close, I want to pause to thank Charles Holley for his years of outstanding service to Walmart. As you know, he's made the decision to retire. He's been a huge asset to the company and a great partner to me and the leadership team. This is his last earnings call, and he will be missed. Thank you, Charles. 
Now I'll turn it over to Claire. Claire?"

Today, I'll provide commentary on the company's consolidated financial statements.

Today, I'll provide commentary on the company's consolidated financial statements. Further details are available in the accompanying presentation posted with this transcript.
Prior to discussing our results, let me talk about an item that, although immaterial, impacts comparability against last year.
As we disclosed in the second quarter, we conducted a global review of the accounting treatment for leases, which included a focus on leases where our payment of certain structural component costs during a lessor's construction of a leased store causes us to be deemed the owner of the property for accounting purposes. In the third quarter, we finalized this review and recorded an immaterial cumulative adjustment.
On a consolidated basis, the immaterial adjustment increased total assets by approximately $1.7 billion, which was primarily an increase in property under capital lease and financing obligations; increased total liabilities by approximately $1.6 billion, which was primarily an increase in current and long-term capital lease and financing obligations; and it positively impacted earnings per share by approximately $0.04.
Let's now move to our results for the quarter. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Walmart, EPS, were $1.03, which includes the item mentioned above. Additionally, there were significant items that negatively impacted EPS, including investments in wages and training in the U.S. of approximately $0.10 and currency exchange rate movements totaling $0.04. Last year's EPS was $1.15.
Total revenue reached $117.4 billion. Currency negatively impacted net sales by approximately $5 billion. On a constant currency basis, total revenue was $122.4 billion.
Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 91 basis points compared to last year, primarily as a result of investments in store wages and labor hours in the U.S. Additionally, FCPA and compliance-related costs were approximately $30 million, comprised of $22 million for ongoing inquiries and investigations, and $8 million for our global compliance program and organizational enhancements. Last year, FCPA and compliance-related costs were approximately $41 million.
The company's consolidated operating income decreased 8.8% to $5.7 billion. Excluding the impact from currency of approximately $214 million, operating income decreased 5.4%, primarily related to the factors that increased our operating expenses.
I'll close today's discussion with a few comments on returns. At Walmart, we remain committed to providing good returns for our shareholders. During last month's meeting for the investment community, we announced a new share repurchase authorization of $20 billion, and said that our intention is to utilize this authorization over a 2-year period. The company repurchased approximately 6.1 million shares for $437 million during the third quarter.
Return on investment, ROI, for the trailing 12 months ended October 31, 2015, was 15.9% versus 16.4% for the prior comparable period. The decline in ROI was primarily due to our decrease in operating income as well as continued capital investments.
Thank you for listening. And now I'll turn it over to Greg. Greg?"

Last month at our annual meeting for the investment community, I spoke in detail about how Walmart U.S. will execute our part of the plan to be the first to deliver a seamless shopping experience at scale. We will drive growth and deliver shareholder returns by winning with stores, delivering value, being great merchants and providing our customers with a convenient shopping experience that is fast and easy. Although we're in the early stages of our journey, we're confident in our plan, and we're executing against it.
Now let's talk about our Q3 performance. As we've said before, we continue to measure our success in terms of traffic, in-stock and customer experience. Overall, we're pleased with the momentum in the top line. Net sales increased $2.7 billion or 3.8%. Unit sales picked up and traffic strengthened, improving 40 basis points from Q2 to 1.7%. This is now the fourth consecutive quarter of positive comp traffic growth for Walmart U.S. Our comp sales growth of 1.5% was solidly within our guidance despite minimal food inflation. In-stocks improved, while comp store inventory declined.
Our customers told us they're happy with the improvements we're making in their shopping experience, as reflected in our customer experience scores. To date, 70% of our stores have achieved the initial goal we set for them, and we'll raise the bar for next year. We also saw some progress this quarter in gross margin with the work we've put in on pharmacy, markdowns and shrink. However, as we have discussed before, the investments in our stores and our associates are significant and will continue to pressure the bottom line.
All formats in our portfolio had positive comps this quarter, and we're happy with the progress we've made in our supercenters, which saw continued traffic growth and positive comps across all areas except entertainment.
Our traditional-format Neighborhood Markets delivered an approximate 8% comp in the third quarter, a 70-basis-point acceleration from our Q2 comp, and aided by strong performance in our less mature stores. New technology and processes are improving in-stocks, and we're working hard on providing the best associate coverage to most effectively serve our customers.
Most importantly, fresh remains a key focus. We're encouraged by our newest prototype, which features better sightlines and displays. We've seen fresh penetration expand in the store relative to its peers. We've made solid progress this year, but we still have a ways to go to ensure we're creating the best experience for our customer while simultaneously improving the profitability of this format.
In e-commerce, we made strides on deepening the digital relationship with our customer. This quarter, we accelerated our online grocery pickup offering to 85 additional locations. We now have almost 140 locations across 25 markets that offer the customer the ability to order their groceries online and conveniently pick up at a time of their choosing. We also launched a new mobile service, which alerts us when a customer is coming to pick up their online general merchandise order even before they walk into the store. And just in time for the holidays, we introduced a digital wish list that can be built at home or by simply scanning items while at the store. 
E-commerce sales and traffic were softer than we would like. We'll continue to strive to balance sales growth and profitability. Overall, e-commerce sales contributed approximately 15 basis points to our comp.
From a merchandise perspective, we saw growth across most of the store, particularly in our apparel, hardlines, home and seasonal businesses. While warmer weather somewhat slowed performance in October, solid back-to-school and Halloween seasons, along with new launches such as Pioneer Woman and Star Wars, drove mid-single-digit comps across each of these departments.
Continued growth in prescription count and branded drug inflation drove mid-single-digit comps in health and wellness. OTC was also strong as better in-stocks, particularly in vitamins, helped drive sales.
In food, we saw our best top line results of the year, despite minimal inflation, which negatively impacted our total box comp by approximately 90 basis points. Momentum from a solid Labor Day weekend continued through to Halloween. We're particularly pleased with the results in fresh, where we brought in new products, developed strong price leadership through strategic buys and promoted locally sourced and organic product.
While most of the box continued to grow, we still have considerable headwinds in entertainment. A slow adoption of new technology in televisions and the shift from postpaid to installment wireless plans contributed to disappointing sales results. We're working on improving our operating model in this area, both in terms of service to our customers and in the layout of the department.
We've made some progress this year, including the recent remodel of the Rogers, Arkansas supercenter we showed you last month, but it will take time to get this department where it needs to be.
Moving on to the remainder of our financials. Gross margins increased 32 basis points versus last year. Gross margin rate improved in food, general merchandise and consumables, but were somewhat offset by declines in health and wellness. Reimbursement levels continued to pressure pharmacy profits, however, we've made some strides across several initiatives that improved margins in this department versus Q2. Additionally, we remain focused on our urgent agenda items, including better management of markdowns to 0. Finally, while only just beginning to show in our results, we are pleased with our efforts thus far on addressing shrink, which has been a significant headwind for us this year.
As we've said before, our top priority this year is to provide a better customer experience in our stores. We're committed to actions that help accomplish this goal as we have invested this year in our associates and in improving our stores. These investments are substantial and continue to reflect in our bottom line performance.
Specifically, in the third quarter, we intentionally added store labor hours above our initial plans and incurred significant maintenance expenses related to the customer-facing areas of the store. These investments, along with the wage increases and the store structure changes implemented earlier this year, drove the majority of the 116-basis-point deleverage in operating expenses.
As the store experience is being addressed and efficiencies are created through new tools, technology and processes, we've begun calibrating labor hours against these improvements. Over time, as the productivity loop begins turning faster, we know we can create a strong balance between experience and profitability.
We did benefit this quarter from the immaterial lease accounting cumulative adjustment that Claire mentioned in her earlier remarks, which favorably impacted operating expenses by $74 million.
As a result of our focus on improving customer experience, along with our ongoing investments in e-commerce and somewhat offset by the lease accounting adjustment I just mentioned, operating income declined 8.6%. Excluding the impact from the lease adjustment, operating income declined approximately 10%.
Moving on, in the third quarter, total inventory grew around 1%, which was less than half the rate of sales. Inventory declined approximately 1.9% in comp stores as new processes in technology have reduced inventory across the store, while simultaneously improving in-stock levels. We're proud of the progress we've made this year on improving inventory levels across our network, but we have room to improve and we remain focused on these efforts.
Finally, on the real estate side, we opened 15 supercenters in the third quarter, including relocations and expansions and 35 traditional format Neighborhood Markets. We're working hard on improving both of these formats to ensure we have the best customer offering alongside strong operating efficiency. We'll continue to test ideas, honing in on the best options for each of these formats.
Shifting now to the fourth quarter. The holiday season is upon us. Our associates have been working hard all year to prepare, and we're ready.
We have the best value on great merchandise for the entire season, without gimmicks. Our merchants have done a terrific job of listening to our customers on what they're looking for this season. We're excited about programs such as Chosen by Kids and our exclusive 1-Hour Guarantee event. And this holiday, we're working to bring our customers an improved shopping experience, whether they're in the store, online or using our mobile app. We know the holidays will be competitive. 
Additionally, we expect food inflation to remain low relative to last year, and we'll lap last year's significant drop in fuel prices, which will make the comparison for the fourth quarter more difficult. But we're confident in our strategy and the actions we're taking, and believe they'll help offset some of these pressures.
Therefore, for the 13-week period ending January 29, 2016, we expect a comp sales increase of around 1%, which would represent a 50-basis-point improvement in our 2-year comp stack from third quarter. Last year's fourth quarter comp was up 1.5%, our strongest comp performance of fiscal 2015.
Now I will turn it over to Dave for an update on Walmart International. Dave?"

We had a solid quarter with sales growth accelerating slightly from last quarter and operating income growing faster than sales, both on a constant currency basis. Comp trends in Mexico and Canada continued to be strong, which more than offset weaker sales performances in the U.K., Brazil and China, where we continue to experience various competitive and economic challenges.
Our markets remain focused on the strategic priorities discussed earlier this year, which include actively managing the existing portfolio; delivering balanced growth, including e-commerce; being the lowest cost operator; and building solid foundations in terms of talent, trust and technology.
Let me touch on some of the progress we've made. We've continued to take action this year to drive simplicity and focus in our portfolio. We sold a portfolio of properties under development with our shopping center joint venture partner in Canada and exited our bank operations in Mexico. We're currently pursuing the sale of a portfolio of shopping centers in Chile, and we're closing our business-to-business sales operations in the U.K. At the same time, we've looked for ways to enhance our portfolio in core markets, which we've done by taking full ownership of Yihaodian in China and acquiring 13 stores and 1 DC from a former competitor in Canada. We'll continue to review our portfolio to simplify our operations and help our teams stay focused on running great businesses.
Our markets continue to invest heavily in price, quality and service, aimed at driving comp sales. Our overall trend is improving as 7 of our 11 markets have now delivered positive comps for 6 straight quarters. We're delivering value and providing convenience that is attracting customers to our stores, clubs, websites and apps across our markets. 
I'm pleased with the innovation we're driving in e-commerce, led by online grocery. And I'm excited about the potential we have to access a broader customer segment. We continue to learn from our online grocery business in the U.K. as we test and roll out similar initiatives in Mexico and Canada and build a strong platform for growth in China.
As Doug mentioned, the continued economic challenges in some of our major markets impacted on our overall Global eCommerce sales growth this quarter. We still have work to do, but I'm confident we're executing against this key strategic priority.
Now let's discuss our overall results. In the third quarter, net sales grew 3.2% on a constant currency basis. Reported net sales declined 11.4%, impacted by an approximately $5 billion currency impact from the continued strength of the U.S. dollar. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates continue to negatively impact our reported results. So it's important to emphasize that our business on a constant currency basis is maintaining steady growth. We had strong positive comp sales in Mexico and Canada. The U.K., Brazil and China posted negative comps although the comps were slightly better in Q3 versus Q2. In each of our other markets, we had solid comps of at least 3%.
Operating income grew faster than net sales at 8.5% on a constant currency basis, driven in large part by excellent performance in Mexico and Canada. In addition, as Claire mentioned earlier, there was an immaterial lease accounting adjustment this quarter, which favorably impacted operating expenses by approximately $49 million on a constant currency basis. With the currency exchange impact, operating income decreased 6.4%.
On a constant currency basis, inventory grew faster than net sales at 7%, primarily driven by our decision in Mexico to flow inventory through our import network early for the upcoming holiday season. On a reported basis, inventory declined 10%. 
Now let's discuss market results presented on a constant currency basis for our largest markets. In all countries except Brazil and China, financial results are inclusive of e-commerce.
Let's begin with the U.K. Challenging competitive conditions persisted throughout the quarter as the market continues to experience rapid structural change. Customers have now benefited for more than 12 months of continually falling prices, and the market has grown by less than 1% for 6 consecutive months, despite a healthy overall economy according to Kantar. The big 4 grocers continue to lose share to the discounters.
U.K. net sales declined by 3.2% and comp sales, excluding fuel, were down 4.6%. Large store traffic and food remain the primary challenges, while online grocery continues to grow. The online business is focused on improving its core service offering and is performing above target on key internal performance metrics. Operating income increased, driven by reduced expenses as well as lapping some organizational restructuring costs from last year.
The U.K. is focused on rebuilding momentum in its core business. Last month, we launched Project Renewal, an 18-month project that reaffirms the direction set out in the 5-year strategy, but prioritizes investments more clearly on price, quality and service in large stores while putting noncore expansion, such as remote petrol stations, on hold.
Greater focus on driving out inefficiencies across both buying and operations will enable the U.K. to build on its well-established value credentials and strengthen its competitive position.
Let's now discuss Mexico, which released their earnings on October 27. Please note the Walmex release is under IFRS and the results here are under U.S. GAAP, therefore, some numbers may differ.
Consolidated Walmex net sales increased 7.4%, with strong comp sales in both Mexico and Central America. Mexico sales grew 7.6% and comp sales increased 6.3%, driven by solid comp growth in both self-service and Sam's Club. In self-service, we achieved mid-single-digit growth in groceries and high single-digit growth in GM and apparel. Self-service continues to gain share and delivered a 220 basis-point improvement in market share according to ANTAD. Sam's Club is maintaining its steady improvement in comps, aided by ongoing events and campaigns to drive traffic and grow membership. We leveraged expenses in the quarter and grew operating income significantly faster than sales.
Our e-commerce business in Mexico is growing in line with the market, driven by strong growth in general merchandise. Under the Walmart banner, we're significantly expanding our assortment of ship-from-store items. We're rapidly growing store coverage for online grocery and customer orders are increasing. At Sam's Club, we've soft launched our new website, while maintaining healthy growth with our existing platform. 
In Canada, we continue to maintain solid growth and gain share in a competitive and low growth environment. Net sales grew 5.7% and comps were up 4.3%, driven by strong performance in our core grocery business as well as stronger performance in our GM business. In the quarter, Canada saw share gains in food, health and wellness, consumables and infants for the 12 weeks ended October 29 according to Nielsen. In addition to strong top line performance, the team continues to focus on our low-cost operating model to drive a sustainable price advantage. Canada grew operating income faster than sales.
We continue to invest in expanding customer access. We recently began a partnership with 7-Eleven and are piloting Grab & Go lockers at some of their convenience stores in the Greater Toronto area. We are pleased with the progress that our online grocery business has made since our pilot launch in July. Overall, I'm pleased with our results in Canada and I expect reliable growth to continue.
In Brazil, the economic challenges are largely unchanged as high inflation and unemployment continue to impact consumer confidence and consumption levels. Net sales were down 0.4% and comps were down 0.6%, driven by a decline in the hypermarket format, mostly offset by strong sales growth in our wholesale business.
General merchandise, primarily electronics, accounted for the largest portion of the hypermarket sales decline. These economic challenges are impacting both our store and e-commerce sales.
Operating income declined faster than sales due to increased labor claims, continued high utility costs and higher markdown activity, which helped us improve our inventory position going into the fourth quarter.
Let's now shift to China, a key growth market. This quarter, sales grew 2.9%, driven by new store openings. Comp sales declined 0.7% amid slower consumption growth. In the hypermarket channel, we gained share for an 11th consecutive quarter. We'll continue to invest in physical and digital to deliver a seamless shopping experience.
We continue to drive efficiency in stores and at the home office. Operating income grew faster than net sales. We operate for less productivity initiatives remain a focus, allowing reinvestment in labor and customer experience, particularly in fresh.
Yihaodian, our e-commerce business in China, is focused on further leveraging Walmart's global and local assets. The business improved margins and balanced marketing spend amid intense competition on price.
While I'm not satisfied with recent results, I'm confident in the actions we're taking in China that position us to achieve success for many years to come. 
Now let me recap. We had a good quarter with solid sales momentum in our underlying business, driven by healthy comp sales in a majority of our markets. In addition, we delivered a relatively high level of constant currency operating profit. Our strategy remains focused and our priorities are clear and we're well positioned for future growth.

Today, I'll share details about our third quarter performance along with comp guidance for the fourth quarter. Members are at the center of the decisions we make, and I'll talk about our ongoing efforts this year to deliver value for them. I'll also share with you specifics around our strategy, which is based on an in-depth review of the business that we've conducted this year.
Before I get started, let me recognize Charles Redfield for his many contributions to Sam's Club over the last 3 years as our Chief Merchandising Officer. His passion for merchandising was experienced throughout the organization. We are excited for Charles as he takes on his new role as Head Merchant for Food in the Walmart U.S. business. With Charles' transition, we are thrilled to have John Furner back at Sam's Club as our new Chief Merchandising Officer after having served as the Chief Merchandising and Marketing Officer in China for nearly 3 years.
Let's move on to a few specifics around our third quarter results. Unless otherwise noted, today's financial discussion will exclude fuel for purposes of comparability. For results with fuel and additional information, please refer to the accompanying presentation posted with this transcript.
Comp sales for the third quarter were at the low end of our guidance. In key food categories, we faced comparisons to last year's steep inflationary environment. And in our wireless business, we continue to experience headwinds from changing industry dynamics. We saw positive results in areas of the business that introduced more newness such as health and wellness and consumables.
Net sales grew 1.6% as comp sales increased 0.4%. Slide 10 provides the components of our comp increase. Ticket grew 70 basis points during the period. Positive momentum in traffic from savings members continued but softness from our business member negatively impacted our results.
Our gross profit rate increased 46 basis points from last year due to a disciplined focus on product acquisition costs, a favorable mix and logistics benefits.
Operating expenses deleveraged during the quarter as we continued to invest in people and technology. We are confident that these are the right choices to make for our business and the benefits of these investments will help us deliver sustainable growth over time. Earlier, you heard Claire talk about an immaterial item related to the company's accounting for certain leases, which resulted in a benefit to operating expenses of approximately $27 million for Sam's Club.
We were pleased with the growth in membership income during the quarter, which increased 5.4%. Investments in the cash rewards program for Plus members resulted in improved Plus renewal rates and Plus penetration is at an all-time high. The impact of social media campaigns was also a contributing factor.
Turning to our merchandising categories, let me talk about a few areas that had the most impact during the quarter. Please see Slide 11 of the accompanying presentation for the comp performance of the remaining categories.
Our fresh/freezer/cooler business faced significant headwinds as deflation in key areas including fresh meat and dairy weighed on our comps. We were pleased with our performance in produce.
Technology and entertainment was pressured during the period, led by a decline in wireless. The industry shift in installment plans continued to negatively impact the category. In electronics, imaging and audio performed well and we continued our efforts to refine the assortment.
Health and wellness and consumables benefited from innovation and newness. In pharmacy, the Free/4/10 prescription program continued to drive growth in script counts. New items in OTC led to a solid performance in the quarter and products like protein powder drove good results, further supporting our initiatives around healthy for you. 
Our consumables business benefited as several new items were launched and we continue to gain share in tabletop as the focus on private brands and quality resonated with members.
In e-commerce, we continue to make progress with integrating digital efforts to transform how members shop and interact with our clubs. Business members have enjoyed the convenience of preordering merchandise for pickup at the club for more than a decade. Now through advances in technology along with innovation from the e-commerce team, all of our members can enjoy similar access with an improved digital experience.
This year's roll-out of Club Pickup to all of our clubs has been well received and represents the fastest growing area of our business. Sales in this space increased 50% during the third quarter. We have also added features along the way. During the quarter, we completed the implementation of mobile check-in capabilities to provide members with a better experience and shorter wait times. We introduced geofencing technology that alerts our associates when members drive onto the parking lot. We extended drive-through or curbside options to more clubs and members love the convenience. These new features build on earlier advances in Club Pickup, including easy reorder and a prepaid option.
Now let me move on to guidance for the fourth quarter. As we move into the quarter, we will face last year's inflationary environment and a tough comparison. As a result, we believe comp sales without fuel for the 13-week period ending January 29, 2016, will be flat to up 1%.
Members are at the center of the decisions we make. We've worked diligently this year to deliver on what we know they want. They expect offerings that are relevant and convenient. They want excitement and newness. They want a seamless shopping experience that integrates the best in digital and physical. We see success where we are delivering on these expectations.
For example, you've heard us talk about the expansion of organics in our assortment. Members ask for an improved selection and we are delivering. Over the summer, we launched Shocking Values online, which has helped to instill a treasure hunt mentality with members. And the innovative Free/4/10 prescription program is providing real savings to Plus members and helping to lift the overall health and wellness category.
I'm pleased with the steps we've been taking throughout this year to deliver for members. We know we must do more with member-relevant merchandise and new member growth. Today, I'm excited to share with you the plans we've developed as we look ahead. We have been focused on developing a strategy at Sam's Club that will deliver our business into the future and build long-term sustainable growth. The 4 key elements of our strategy include: growth through higher household income members and high-value business segments; relevant merchandise and increased value for our members; acquiring and retaining the right members and increasing the spend; and lastly, integrating digital to transform the club experience.
In order to better align the business as we move forward, we made organizational changes and enhancements. John Furner is returning to Sam's Club as the Executive Vice President and Chief Merchandising Officer. John has rejoined the team after nearly 3 years as Chief Merchandising and Chief Marketing Officer of Walmart China, where he led Merchandising, Procurement, Marketing, Supply Chain, Financial Services and Mobile Commerce for the Hypermarket division. Prior to moving overseas, John was Senior Vice President of Home and Apparel Merchandise and Global Sourcing for Sam's Club.
In addition, we've reallocated resources pertaining to merchandising and have created new positions in critical areas including data and analytics, fresh food, regional buying and proprietary brands. We also created a new leadership position dedicated to business member merchandising. 
Moving forward, we will continue to serve both savings and business members. We have clarity around the categories of members we will target. Data will drive our decisions and I'm confident we are focused on the right opportunities.
As I close, let me summarize today's thoughts. As we look back at the third quarter, we acknowledge that we need to improve our sales. Where we introduce new merchandise, we delivered strong results. We continue to make strategic investments in people and technology as these are critical enablers of our strategy. We're also pleased with our efforts to further integrate digital and physical retail. Our members are at the center of all our decisions. We are making progress across the Club and through online and mobile commerce capabilities to deliver value for them. Whether it's saving them time with Club Pickup or saving them money on their prescriptions with Free/4/10, we continue to find new ways to innovate. And we're confident the strategy and enhancements to our organizational structure will propel our business into the future.
Now I'll turn the call over to Charles. Charles?"
313055,280452666,908679,"Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Q3 2016 Pre Recorded Earnings Call, Nov 17, 2015",2015-11-17,"Earnings Calls","Walmart Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Roz.

Stronger traffic in our Walmart U.S. stores and a fifth",667,"Thanks, Roz. I'd like to start by highlighting that we are pleased with the sales increases we experienced in Walmart U.S. as well as in our International business when considering constant currency. Stronger traffic in our Walmart U.S. stores and a fifth consecutive quarter of positive comp sales indicate that we are taking the right steps to win with customers, grow sales and deliver a seamless shopping experience at scale. 
From an e-commerce standpoint, we have long-term plans in place to grow our business. We are making progress on several of our key initiatives and recognize we have more work to do. As expected, the investments we are making in people and technology impacted both operating expenses and profits in the quarter. However, we delivered earnings per share well within our guidance and remain confident that these investments will better position Walmart for the future. 
Now let's turn our attention to guidance for the fourth quarter and the full year. Last quarter, we indicated that we expected our full year fiscal 2016 earnings per share to range between $4.40 and $4.70. Today, we are narrowing our full year earnings per share guidance to a range between $4.50 and $4.65, including a range of $1.40 and $1.55 for the fourth quarter. These ranges include the assumptions we provided in the second quarter, which consists of the impact of our investments in wages, training and additional labor hours in our stores, the incremental investment in global e-commerce and the headwinds in the U.S. from pharmacy margins and shrink.
Currency remains a significant headwind for us. As I indicated at our analyst meeting last month, we expect our total net sales growth to be relatively flat for fiscal year 2016. It's important to note that if we were to exclude the impact of currency, our total net sales growth would be around 3% for the year. 
Now assuming currency exchange rates remain at current levels for the remainder of the year, we now expect the full year impact to earnings per share to be approximately $0.16, up $0.01 from last quarter's revised guidance of $0.15. Our effective tax rate is expected to range between 31% and 33% for the full year. As we have indicated in the past, our tax rate will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter and may be impacted by a number of factors including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, valuation allowances, changes in law, outcomes of administrative audits, the impacts of discrete items and the mix of earnings among our U.S. and International operations. And in any given quarter, our effective tax rate could be higher or lower than the full year. 
Now as I've mentioned at our analyst meeting last month, we are monitoring progress in Congress with respect to the extension of certain U.S. income tax legislation that expired at the end of calendar year 2014. If the legislation is passed, we'll end up closer to the lower end of the updated range that we've provided.
As I mentioned at the October analyst meeting, we will continue to review our portfolio, including stores and clubs. As in prior years, we may have charges related to closing businesses or stores and clubs. These charges would not be included in our guidance. This is my last call as the Chief Financial Officer as I'll be retiring effective January 31. I feel fortunate to be a small part of the Walmart story. I have enjoyed working with all of you over the past few years. Brett Biggs will take over as the Chief Financial Officer for Walmart effective January 1. You're in very capable hands, and I'm proud of the strong team that we've left behind that Brett will be leading in the future.
With that, thank you for listening today and for your interest in our company. And on behalf of the management team and our associates worldwide, we thank you for your support this year and wish you a happy, healthy and safe holiday season."
