Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter 2014 earnings call. Let me begin by addressing the announcement made yesterday that we are in advanced negotiations with SunPower to form a joint YieldCo vehicle to which we expect to contribute a portfolio of selected solar generation assets. Upon the execution of a master formation agreement, the parties intend to file a registration statement with the SEC for an initial public offering of the YieldCo. Completion of the joint venture and IPO is subject to the execution of definitive documentation and board and regulatory approval. We cannot say any more about the transaction at this time, and we will not be taking any questions on the subject in our Q&A session today. We expect to file  apublic S-1 this quarter, which will provide additional details on this proposed transaction. Now I do want to emphasize the strategic value of this decision to First Solar's shareholders. We have undertaken a careful study of the strategic options available and determined that this is the best course of action to maximize project and shareholder returns in the long term. This combination brings together the 2 leading and most bankable companies in the solar industry, with a combined installed base of 16 gigawatts, [ph] the strongest balance sheet in the sector and combined strengths in utility scale and distributed generation as well as a broad geographical base. Lastly, as a result of this announcement, the 2015 target we provided at our prior Analyst Day is no longer applicable. Until we have clarity on the creation of a joint YieldCo with SunPower, we do not believe it is meaningful to provide full year 2015 guidance. Moreover, as a result of this potential transaction, we have decided to delay Analyst Day at this time. We continue to evaluate holding an Analyst Day later this year.
Now for an update on our technology. First, as we announced earlier this month, we have set yet another new world record for CdTe cell efficiency of 21.5%. This latest milestone certified at the Newport lab and documented in Andrew Charles Best Research Cell Efficiencies exceeds our previous record of 21%. We have now increased our record cell efficiency by over 400 basis points since mid-2011. This remarkable achievement demonstrates the potential of our CdTe technology and is another tremendous accomplishment by our R&D team. In conjunction with our record cell efficiency, we also announced that our production TV modules have reached a quality and reliability milestone by achieving Atlas 25-plus certification following a rigorous series of long-term, combined stress environmental exposure tests. This certification represents some of the most stringent standards available and demonstrates that the progress in our module technologies not only in efficiency improvement, but also in quality and reliability. We continue to see the advancements in our technology manifest in our production module efficiency. Our full fleet average conversion efficiency for the fourth quarter was 14.4%, a 20 basis point improvement from the prior quarter and 100 basis point improvement from the prior year. We now have several lines of production running our latest technology, and we are encouraged by the results. So far this month, 4 of these lines have averaged an impressive 15.8% efficiency. This technology will be rolled out across the fleet over the course of 2015.
Switching briefly to our TetraSun product. We have recently begun production of our TetraSun modules at our manufacturing facility in Malaysia. We are encouraged by the performance of the technology, which is being produced with initial cell efficiencies of 20.5%. Our expected capacity for 2015 is approximately 50 megawatts, and we will ramp future production levels based on market demand.
Let me now turn to Slide 5 and 6, which highlight the tremendous progress we made in new bookings in 2014 and during the first 2 months of 2015. As in the past data -- as in the past, this data represents our total business and excludes systems module plus and module-only sales. Total bookings for 2014 were 2.5 gigawatts DC, which equates to a book-to-bill ratio of 1.7. This far exceeds the 2 gigawatt DC we communicated at Analyst Day last year and highlights the momentum in our bookings. Since our last earnings call, we have booked over 1 gigawatts with 726 megawatts recorded prior to the end of 2014 and the remaining 311 megawatts occurring during the first 2 months of 2015. As a result, our ending outstanding bookings are now at 4 gigawatts DC, an increase of 1.3 gigawatts from where we began 2014. The strength of these bookings and the accelerating demand we have seen in recent months is a testament to the increasing competitiveness of our module technology. The single-largest booking in the quarter was the 130 megawatts AC California project. As previously announced, the PPA for this project was signed with Apple and is the largest agreement in the industry to provide solar power to the commercial end user. This 25-year PPA will provide power to Apple's new headquarters, data centers and retail operations in California. This deal signals the growing importance of affordable clean energy to commercial customers. Combined with previously announced 150 megawatts AC PPA signed with PG&E, the total project stands at 280 megawatts AC. The combined size of the California project represents one of the largest self-developed projects announced in the last several years, highlighting our tremendous strength and utility scale in solar. This past quarter, we continued to demonstrate significant progress in the southeastern United States. We signed agreements with Southern Power to provide EPC services to 2 projects in Georgia, totaling over 210 megawatts AC. The larger of the 2, the 130 megawatts AC Taylor project, is expected to begin construction in September of this year and achieve COD in late 2016. Additionally, we recently signed a 188-megawatt DC module plus deal with Strata Solar to supply projects in North Carolina. Altogether, our bookings in the southeastern U.S. since mid-2014 now total almost 700 megawatts DC.
We also saw strength in our international bookings. In India, we contracted 265 megawatts DC of volumes since our last call. As disclosed previously, we were awarded 80 megawatts AC of projects in Andhra Pradesh, India. We have now signed the PPA on these projects and included them in our booking total. The remaining volume booked in the quarter was module-only sales. Underscoring our commitment to the growing solar market in India, we announced last week at RE-INVEST a commitment to develop 5 gigawatts of solar projects by 2019. We are excited by the Indian government's vision for solar energy and look forward to helping them achieve these goals.
Also, in Turkey, we are encouraged by the results of the recent solar power where we secured 19 megawatts AC of connection capacity. Other partners competing with Solar technology were also successful. While small in relative terms our overall bookings for the quarter, it is a significant first step in a market with tremendous potential for solar.
Turning to outstanding bookings and revenue terms. Our expected revenue stands at $7.5 billion, approximately flat compared to the beginning of the year. The increase in megawatts book was offset by a higher mix of module-only and module-plus volume, which resulted in a flat revenue bookings but also is indicative of our efficiency improvements on the competitiveness of our module in the global marketplace.
Turning to Slide 7. I will now cover our potential bookings opportunities, which now stand at 13.5 gigawatts DC, a slight decrease from 13.7 gigawatts in the prior quarter, primarily due to the conversion of several opportunities to bookings. As a reminder, this represents all potential bookings for some developed projects, EPC contracts, module-plus or module-only. Contracted projects are not included in this total. While our total opportunities decreased slightly, we are encouraged by the increase in the size of our mid- to late-stage deals, which increased by over 500 megawatts from the prior period. Slide 8 shows the breakdown of demand by geography. Our opportunity set outside of North America stands at 7.5 gigawatts or 56% of the total. One indication of the progress -- continued progress we are making in developing international markets is that the vast majority of our roughly 1.5 gigawatts at mid- to late-stage deals are outside of North America. And finally, in December, we announced our entry into the residential solar market with a strategic investment in clean energy collective. CEC is a lead nation's developer of community solar new strategic partnership allows us to develop the marketing community solar offerings to residential customers and businesses directly on behalf of client utilities. Community Solar is not only a more effective solution for customers, they also significant expands consumers' access to solar electricity. This allows any power consumer to go solar, including those who live in multitenant buildings, ramp [indiscernible] who cannot accommodate solar panels. In contrast, typical residential rooftop installations, which are limited to a fraction of the population due to factors such as income, local gradients and homeownership, virtually anyone can benefit from Community Solar. Community solar allows an individual to benefit directly from owning part of a solar asset, without concern such as an increase in their homeowners insurance, problems that arise when their rooftop requires repair or replacement or transferability of residential rooftop leases when they sell their home. For example, a student renting a condo could own panels through community Solar program and take a long credit for that Solar power even when he moves or just transfer or sell his ownership to a third-party without the need for credit scores. This strategic partnership with CEC allows First Solar to play to the strength of our proven utility scale capabilities, while leveraging the expertise of a leading community solar program operator. As an integral part of our distributed generation strategy, we will provide periodic updates on the progress of this partnership.
Now I'll turn it over to Mark, who will provide detail on our Q4 financial results and discuss guidance for the first quarter of 2015."

I'll begin by discussing fourth quarter operational performance. Production in the quarter was 509 megawatts DC, an increase of 13% from the prior quarter and 15% higher year-over-year due to the restart of our 4 manufacturing lines in Malaysia, as well as higher module efficiency. Our factory capacity utilization was 84%, up 7 percentage points from the third quarter. The higher factor utilization was also due to the restart of the idle capacity. In the fourth quarter, the average conversion efficiency of our modules was 14.4%, which is up 20 basis points quarter-over-quarter and 100 basis points higher year-over-year. Our best line average, 14.8% efficiency, during the quarter, an increase of approximately 50 basis points from the prior quarter. As Jim mentioned, our best lines are averaging 15.8% for the month of February. The substantial increase in our reline efficiency continues to highlight the great progress our team is making to deliver module efficiency road map, which effectively is converting our record sales and module accomplishment into reality. We are encouraged by our CdTe entitlement and the relative competitive energy density it can achieve.
Moving on to Slide 12, I'll discuss the P&L. Net sales for the fourth quarter was just over $1 billion compared to sales of $889 million last quarter. The increase is due to the sale of the Solar Gen project to Southern, initial revenue recognition on some estates up, higher third-party modules and other system projects under construction. This was partially offset by lower revenue from our Desert Sunlight and Topaz projects, which bought achieved substantial completion in the quarter. As a percentage of total net sales, our system revenue, which includes both our EPC revenue and Solar modules used in the system projects, was 92%, a decrease of 3 percentage points from the prior quarter. The higher mix of third-party modules sales was primarily due to recognizing revenue on electrics landing projects, which had 46 megawatts DC, is the largest operating solar farm in the U.K. For 2014, net sales increased to $3.4 billion compared to $3.3 billion in 2013. Relative to our guidance for the quarter, sales were lower due to a partial sale of the Solar Gen project, the timing of some module sales pushed into early 2015 and lower system revenue from weather-related delays. As highlighted in our last earnings call, our guidance assumes we sold 100% of Solar Gen to Southern. However, we noted subject to certain terms and conditions, we have the right to retain a minority interest in the project. In the fourth quarter, we elected to retain a 49% interest in Solar Gen. Gross margin in the fourth quarter was 30.6% compared to 21.3% in the third quarter. The increase was due to higher deposit associated with partial sale of Solar Gen and cost reductions on the Topaz and Desert Sunlight projects. On a full year basis, gross margins decreased 170 basis points to 24.4% from 26.1% in 2013. The lower gross margin was a result of the mix and system projects under construction between the periods. Fourth quarter operating expenses increased to $109 million, primarily due to the higher start-up expenses associated with restarting capacity. For the full year 2014, operating expense were $403 million compared to 2013 operating expenses of $407 million, which excludes $87 million of restructuring and asset impairments. The decrease in operating expenses from 2013 was primarily due to lower depreciation and compensation expenses, partially offset by higher investment in research and development of our CdTe technology. Operating income for the quarter was $199 million compared to $84 million in Q3. The increase was due to higher sequential sales and the increasing gross margins discussed earlier. For the year, operating income was $424 million compared to 2013 operating income of $455 million, which also excludes the $89 million of restructuring and asset impairments. Fourth quarter GAAP net income was $192 million or $1.89 per fully diluted share compared to $0.87 per fully diluted share in the third quarter. Full year earnings per fully diluted share was $3.91, including a 26 [ph] benefit of a onetime tax item noted in Q3. Excluding this item, full year earnings per share were $3.66. Note that relative to our guidance for the quarter and full year, there were several factors that led to the difference between our actual results and expectations. First, as indicated, we have elected to retain a minority interest in Solar Gen. As a result, a portion of the revenue source today for this project was not recognized in the quarter and contributed to the lower than forecasted revenue. Gross margin and operating income exceeded the guidance for the quarter due to higher-than-expected profit associated with Solar Gen and significant project cost savings on our Desert Sunlight and Topaz projects. The resulting earnings were significantly higher than the $2.80 per share, which was the upper end of our full year guidance due to the aforementioned factors and the lower-than-expected tax rate which resulted from a favorable mix of jurisdictional income. Putting ourselves in the context of the year, excluding the $0.26 per share onetime tax item we highlighted in Q3, our full year earnings would have been $3.66. The difference between the $3.66 and the $2.80 guidance is attributed to the addition of $0.26 from the lower-than-expected tax rate in Q4, with the remaining difference approximately $0.60 due to our better-than-expected gross margin. This highlights the strength of our execution from our core business and the project cost savings achieved.
Turning to Slide 13, I would read the balance sheet and cash flow summary. Cash and marketable securities increased by approximately $876 million to $2 billion. Our net cash position nearly doubled to just under $1.8 billion. The increase in cash resulted primarily from the sale of Solar Gen as well as the collection of retention payments on our Desert Sunlight and Topaz projects. We anticipate that our cash position will continue to have large fluctuations quarter-to-quarter as we continue to construct some projects on balance sheet. Our net working capital, including the change in noncurrent project assets and excluding cash and marketable securities, decreased by approximately $845 million from the prior quarter. The decrease was due to the reduction in unbilled accounts receivables from the collection of cash retention on Topaz and Desert Sunlight, a decrease in deferred project cost from the sale of Solar Gen and reduction in trade AR. These items were partially offset by an increase in inventories. Solar debt during the quarter decreased [ph] slightly to $217 million. Of this total, $75 million is project level debt associated with our Loop day project in Chile.
Cash flow from operations was $928 million compared to cash flow used in operations of $47 million in Q3. Free cash flow was $858 million compared to negative free cash flow of $107 million in the prior quarter. Capital expenditures totaled approximately $73 million, a slight increase from $71 million in the prior quarter. Depreciation for the quarter was $62 million compared to $60 million in the prior quarter.
Turning to Slide 14. I will now discuss our guidance for the first quarter of 2015. Note that given the announcement regarding the proposed YieldCo formation, we are holding off on providing full year guidance at this time. Specific to the quarter, our anticipated financial results is being impacted as we hold projects, build them on balance sheet, potential YieldCo creation previously mentioned. I believe this path will create long-term projects and shareholder value. In the near term, it will result in lower financial results than if we had sold these projects to a third-party. Our abbreviated financial guidance for the first quarter is as follows: net sales in the range of $550 million to $650 million, a loss of $0.25 to $0.35 per fully diluted share. Cash used in operations is expected to be between $400 million and $500 million. The sequentially lower revenue or earnings and operating cash flow is due to 2 main factors, first in the fourth quarter we sold a partial interest in Solar Gen and achieved substantial completion on our Topaz and Desert Sunlight projects. In addition, we are constructing several projects on balance sheet in Q1. We expect to complete nearly 200 megawatts in the quarter where we will not recognize any revenue.
Now moving on to Slide 15. I'd like to summarize our progress during the past quarter and past year. First, we continue to demonstrate the enormous potential of our CdTe technology. We set another new cell record efficiency of 21.5%. This positions us firmly on track to meet the 22% target we set last year. In addition, our efficiency continues to improve rapidly. Our lead line efficiency improved to 14.8% in Q4, which is 90 basis points improvement from the prior year. We've had tremendous progress in our new bookings with 2.5 gigawatts contracted during the year. We set a target of 2 gigawatts to book for the year, and we have exceeded that goal. Our book-to-bill ratio for the year was 1.7, allowing us to replenish our pipeline. From a financial standpoint, we exceed both our earnings per share and operating cash flow guidance. Finally, we believe the announced joint YieldCo with SunPower is the best avenue to achieve, to help provide access to sustainable, competitive cost of capital, which it also may provide enhanced value to our First Solar shareholders.
With that, we conclude our prepared remarks and open the call for questions. Operator?"

First, I don't think we're in a position to be able to provide you any guidance on the bookings outlook for '15 at this time. But generally, the strength in '14 was relatively broad-based, and it's a consistent pattern that we're seeing across broad swaths of our business where as costs continue to come down, we're seeing greater and greater adoption rates. And what's particularly encouraging there's a lot of this adoption is driven not by any policy impetus, but more by a recognition that utility-scale solar represents compelling value opportunity. So we've seen the growth in the market outside of California and the United States, particularly the Southeast United States, continue to see strong activity in that region in Texas, in the Western United States in North America. As identified, we continue to see a lot of strong activity in India. We've had our initial success in Turkey and expect to see momentum there. We've had a continued drumbeat of activity in Europe. It's not a gigantic, but it continues to roll along. And so we've just seen sort of a broad-based, a lot of the seeds that we planted over the last 2.5 years starting to take root and generate opportunities for us. So it's really been broad-based. Obviously, as the efficiency continues to improve, particularly the most recent efficiency improvements. And bear in mind that we've been competing in the market with the knowledge of where our efficiency was going to get too. So what we're seeing come off the production line out is that we've been competing with for the last 12 months. And obviously, as we are now roughly at parity from a temperature-adjusted energy density standpoint, it just dramatically increases our ability to compete and dramatically increases the entitlement we have to compete and to margin at the end of the day. So good to -- we believe the 2 go hand in hand. This overall pretty good health across the solar sector. And then, we, as an individual company, are doing well because we continue to have such success in advancing our technology."

Other customers want to own the facility, but they really want someone to handle the full turnkey EPC execution. And then, there's a spectrum in between those 2 that is the module-plus and the power Block offerings. For the customer doesn't want to own and they want to be provided with power, obviously, that flows out of our development business. And we will choose to monetize those development assets in a manner that provides the greatest long-term value for our shareholders. The same philosophy we've had for the last 2.5 years.

It will be lumpy the same way that -- I can't give you a profile of how that flows to the year. The construction of activity that would be relatively linear, not only for those projects, but for the projects that we are constructing CODs in 2016. However, the revenue associated with that and the cash flow associated will be relatively lumpy based on the COD achieved. I think the best way to think about it is to constructing a couple of hundred megawatts on balance sheet. You look at our aggregate pipeline and north of the gigawatt. That will be achieved COD now to the end of '16. That's the kind of cadence and kind of rhythm that we're on right now in terms of the monthly profile of 100 megawatts or so of construction of self-developed assets.

So instead of taking a 15% [ph] of delta, now you're taking 5% of delta. So get a little more [indiscernible] back but again that spread out over 5 years. But we would say is that obviously, it's going to make economics more challenging. However, we are -- when you look at a road map and entitlement of where our install cost is going, driven by the improvement of our module efficiency and higher energy density and overall reductions that we're driving across our balance of systems, we'll be better positioned than most to compete in that type of environment. So yes, the economics will become a little bit more challenging. But when you couple that with an aggressive cost reduction road map that we're on the journey of delivering get, we feel that we'll be able to realize comparable economics post the ITC as we are pre-ITC. Especially as we get into the '18 and '19 by mine. So again we're pretty well positioned from that. As it relates to bookings ASP, you got to remember one of the things that Jim indicated in the first quarter, I think we put a little less than 200 megawatts with Strada, which was included in that number. That's mainly module only, right? So you do the math, you got a remember though that mix of what came from in that 300 megawatts or so and the year-to-date bookings order was highly impacted as a result of that. Another thing I would say about Strada I think is important relates back to the comment that Jim answered -- the question Jim answered of the very front, was around relative competitiveness of our technology. That's a new customer for us. Now Strada obviously has installed hundreds of megawatts. What we've been able to do is to displace other mainly Chinese module supplies that they have historically relied upon. So we've been able to the overall increasing competitors are technology, developing strong relationships with the customer and then strength of our balance sheet in overall bankability, we've been able to penetrate accounts that we historically had not had a presence, which I think it's a great testament to the accomplishment of our BD team as well as our technology. But that's a thing you need to prospective as it relates to the first quarter. It is somewhat skewed down because of the high fixed module-only sales."

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter 2014 earnings call. Let me begin by addressing the announcement made yesterday that we are in advanced negotiations with SunPower to form a joint YieldCo vehicle to which we expect to contribute a portfolio of selected solar generation assets. Upon the execution of a master formation agreement, the parties intend to file a registration statement with the SEC for an initial public offering of the YieldCo. Completion of the joint venture and IPO is subject to the execution of definitive documentation and board and regulatory approval. We cannot say any more about the transaction at this time, and we will not be taking any questions on the subject in our Q&A session today. We expect to file a public S-1 this quarter, which will provide additional details on this proposed transaction. Now however, I do want to emphasize the strategic value of this decision to First Solar's shareholders. We have undertaken a careful study of the strategic options available and have determined that this is the best course of action to maximize project and shareholder returns in the long term. This combination brings together the 2 leading and most bankable companies in the solar industry, with a combined installed base of 16 gigawatts, the strongest balance sheets in the sector and combined strengths in utility scale and distributed generation as well as a broad geographical base. Lastly, as a result of this announcement, the 2015 target we provided at our prior Analyst Day is no longer applicable. Until we have clarity in the creation of a joint YieldCo with SunPower, we do not believe it is meaningful to provide full year 2015 guidance. Moreover, as a result of this potential transaction, we have decided to delay an Analyst Day at this time. We continue to evaluate holding an Analyst Day later this year.
Now for an update on our technology. First, as we announced earlier this month, we have set yet another new world record for cad tel cell efficiency of 21.5%. This latest milestone certified at the Newport Lab and documented in NREL Best Research Cell Efficiencies exceeds our previous record of 21%. We have now increased our record cell efficiency by over 400 basis points since mid-2011. This remarkable achievement demonstrates the potential of our cad tel technology and is another tremendous accomplishment by our R&D team. In conjunction with our record cell efficiency, we also announced that our production TV modules have reached a quality and reliability milestone by achieving Atlas 25+ certification following a rigorous series of long-term, combined stress environmental exposure tests. This certification represents some of the most stringent standards available and demonstrates that the progress in our module technology is not only in efficiency improvements, but also in quality and reliability. We continue to see the advancements in our technology manifest in our production module efficiency. Our full fleet average conversion efficiency for the fourth quarter was 14.4%, a 20 basis point improvement from the prior quarter and 100 basis point improvement from the prior year. We now have several lines of production running our latest technology, and we are encouraged by the results. So far this month, 4 of these lines have averaged an impressive 15.8% efficiency. This technology will be rolled out across the fleet over the course of 2015.
Switching briefly to our TetraSun product. We have recently begun production of our TetraSun modules at our manufacturing facility in Malaysia. We are encouraged by the performance of the technology, which is being produced with initial cell efficiencies of 20.5%. Our expected capacity for 2015 is approximately 50 megawatts, and we will ramp future production levels based on market demand.
Let me now turn to Slide 5 and 6, which highlight the tremendous progress we made in new bookings in 2014 and during the first 2 months of 2015. As in the past data -- as in the past, this data represents our total business and includes systems, Module Plus and module-only sales. Total bookings for 2014 were 2.5 gigawatts DC, which equates to a book-to-bill ratio of 1.7. This far exceeds the 2 gigawatt DC target we communicated at Analyst Day last year and highlights the momentum in our bookings. Since our last earnings call, we have booked over 1 gigawatt with 726 megawatts recorded prior to the end of 2014 and the remaining 311 megawatts occurring during the first 2 months of 2015. As a result, our ending outstanding bookings are now at 4 gigawatts DC, an increase of 1.3 gigawatts from where we began 2014. The strength of these bookings and the accelerating demand we have seen in recent months is a testament to the increasing competitiveness of our module technology. The single-largest booking in the quarter was the 130 megawatts AC, California Flats Project. As previously announced, the PPA for this project was signed with Apple and is the largest agreement in the industry to provide solar power to the commercial end user. This 25-year PPA will provide power to Apple's new headquarters, data centers and retail operations in California. This deal signals the growing importance of affordable clean energy to commercial customers. Combined with the previously announced 150 megawatts AC PPA signed with PG&E, the total project stands at 280 megawatts AC. The combined size of the California Flats Project represents one of the largest self-developed projects announced in the last several years, highlighting our tremendous strength and utility scale at Solar. This past quarter, we continued to demonstrate significant progress in the southeastern United States. We signed agreements with Southern Power to provide EPC services to 2 projects in Georgia, totaling over 210 megawatts AC. The larger of the 2, the 130-megawatt AC Taylor project, is expected to begin construction in September of this year and achieve COD in late 2016. Additionally, we recently signed a 188-megawatt DC Module Plus deal with Strata Solar to supply projects in North Carolina. Altogether, our bookings in the southeastern U.S. since mid-2014 now total almost 700 megawatts DC.
We also saw strength in our international bookings. In India, we contracted 265 megawatts DC of volumes since our last call. As disclosed previously, we were awarded 80 megawatts AC of projects in Andhra Pradesh, India. We have now signed the PPA on these projects and included them in our booking total. The remaining volume booked in the quarter was module-only sales. Underscoring our commitment to the growing solar market in India, we announced last week at RE-Invest a commitment to develop 5 gigawatts of solar projects by 2019. We are excited by the Indian government's vision for solar energy and look forward to helping them achieve these goals.
Also, in Turkey, we are encouraged by the results of the recent solar power tender, where we secured 19 megawatts AC of connection capacity. Other partners competing with First Solar technology were also successful. While in small and relative terms to our overall bookings for the quarter, it is a significant first step in a market with tremendous potential for solar.
Turning to outstanding bookings and revenue terms. Our expected revenue stands at $7.5 billion, approximately flat compared to the beginning of the year. The increase in megawatts booked was offset by a higher mix of module-only and Module Plus volume, which resulted in a flat revenue bookings but also is indicative of our efficiency improvements on the competitiveness of our module in the global marketplace.
Turning to Slide 7. I will now cover our potential bookings opportunities, which now stand at 13.5 gigawatts DC, a slight decrease from 13.7 gigawatts in the prior quarter, primarily due to the conversion of several opportunities to bookings. As a reminder, this represents all potential bookings whether they're self-developed projects, EPC contracts, Module Plus or module-only. Contracted projects are not included in this total. While our total opportunities decreased slightly, we are encouraged by the increase in the size of our mid- to late-stage deals, which increased by over 500 megawatts from the prior period. 
Slide 8 shows the breakdown of demand by geography. Our opportunity set outside of North America stands at 7.5 gigawatts or 56% of the total. One indication of the progress -- continued progress we are making in developing international markets is that the vast majority of our roughly 1.5 gigawatts at mid- to late-stage deals are outside of North America. And finally, in December, we announced our entry into the residential solar market with a strategic investment in Clean Energy Collective. CEC is the nation's leading developer of community solar and this strategic partnership allows us to develop and market community solar offerings to residential customers and businesses directly on behalf of client utilities. Community solar is not only a more cost-effective solution for customers, they also significantly expands consumers' access to solar electricity. This allows any power consumer to go solar, including those who live in multitenant buildings, ramp or whose rooftops cannot accommodate solar panels. In contrast, typical residential rooftop installations, which are limited to a fraction of the population due to factors such as income, local radiance and homeownership, virtually, anyone can benefit from community solar. Community solar allows an individual to benefit directly from owning part of the solar asset, without concerns such as the increase in their homeowner's insurance, problems that arise when their rooftop requires repair or replacement or transferability of residential rooftop leases when they sell their home. For example, a student renting a condo could own panels through our community solar program and take a long credit for that solar power even when he moves or just transfer or sell his ownership to a third party without the need for credit scores. This strategic partnership with CEC allows First Solar to play to the strength of our proven utility scale capabilities, while leveraging the expertise of a leading community solar program operator. As an integral part of our distributed generation strategy, we will provide periodic updates on the progress of this partnership.
Now I'll turn it over to Mark, who will provide detail on our Q4 financial results and discuss guidance for the first quarter of 2015."

I'll begin by discussing fourth quarter operational performance. Production in the quarter was 509 megawatts DC, an increase of 13% from the prior quarter and 15% higher year-over-year due to the restart of our 4 manufacturing lines in Malaysia as well as higher module efficiency. Our factory capacity utilization was 84%, up 7 percentage points from the third quarter. The higher factor utilization was also due to the restart of the idle capacity. In the fourth quarter, the average conversion efficiency of our modules was 14.4%, which is up 20 basis points quarter-over-quarter and 100 basis points higher year-over-year. Our best line average, 14.8% of efficiency during the quarter, an increase of approximately 50 basis points from the prior quarter. As Jim mentioned, our best lines are averaging 15.8% for the month of February. The substantial increase in our lead line efficiency continues to highlight the great progress our team is making to deliver our module efficiency road map, which effectively is converting our record sales and module accomplishments into reality. We are encouraged by our cad tel entitlement and the relative competitive energy density it can achieve.
Moving on to Slide 12, I'll discuss the P&L. Net sales for the fourth quarter were just over $1 billion compared to sales of $889 million last quarter. The increase is due to the sale of the Solar Gen project to Southern, initial revenue recognition on Silver State South, higher third-party module sales and various other system projects under construction. This was partially offset by lower revenue from our Desert Sunlight and Topaz projects, which bought achieved substantial completion in the quarter. As a percentage of total net sales, our system revenue, which includes both our EPC revenue and solar modules used in the system projects, was 92%, a decrease of 3 percentage points from the prior quarter. The higher mix of third-party modules sales was primarily due to recognizing revenue on BELECTRIC's landing project, which, at 46 megawatts DC, is the largest operating solar farm in the U.K. For 2014, net sales increased to $3.4 billion compared to $3.3 billion in 2013. Relative to our guidance for the quarter, sales were lower due to a partial sale of the Solar Gen project, the timing of some module sales pushed into early 2015 and lower system revenue from weather-related delays. As highlighted in our last earnings call, our guidance assumes we sold 100% of Solar Gen to Southern. However, we noted subject to certain terms and conditions, we have the right to retain a minority interest in the project. In the fourth quarter, we elected to retain a 49% interest in Solar Gen. Gross margin in the fourth quarter was 30.6% compared to 21.3% in the third quarter. The increase was due to higher profits associated with a partial sale of Solar Gen and cost reductions on the Topaz and Desert Sunlight projects. On a full year basis, gross margins decreased 170 basis points to 24.4% from 26.1% in 2013. The lower gross margin was a result of the mix of system projects under construction between the periods. Fourth quarter operating expenses increased to $109 million, primarily due to the higher start-up expenses associated with restarting capacity. For the full year 2014, operating expenses were $403 million compared to 2013 operating expenses of $407 million, which excludes $87 million of restructuring and asset impairments. The decrease in operating expenses from 2013 was primarily due to lower depreciation and compensation expenses, partially offset by higher investment in research and development of our cad tel technology. Operating income for the quarter was $199 million compared to $84 million in Q3. The increase was due to higher sequential sales and the increasing gross margins discussed earlier. For the year, operating income was $424 million compared to 2013 operating income of $455 million, which also excludes the $89 million of restructuring and asset impairments. Fourth quarter GAAP net income was $192 million or $1.89 per fully diluted share compared to $0.87 per fully diluted share in the third quarter. Full year earnings per fully diluted share was $3.91, including a $0.26 benefit of a onetime tax item noted in Q3. Excluding this item, full year earnings per share were $3.66. Note that relative to our guidance for the quarter and full year, there were several factors that led to the difference between our actual results and expectations. First, as indicated, we have elected to retain a minority interest in Solar Gen. As a result, a portion of the revenue associated with this project was not recognized in the quarter and contributed to the lower than forecasted revenue. Gross margin and operating income exceeded the guidance for the quarter due to the higher-than-expected profit associated with Solar Gen and significant project cost savings on our Desert Sunlight and Topaz projects. The resulting earnings were significantly higher than the $2.80 per share, which was the upper end of our full year guidance due to the aforementioned factors and a lower-than-expected tax rate which resulted from a favorable mix of jurisdictional income. Putting the results into the context for the year, excluding the $0.26 per share onetime tax item we highlighted in Q3, our full year earnings would have been $3.66. The difference between the $3.66 and the $2.80 guidance is attributed to an additional $0.26 from the lower-than-expected tax rate in Q4, with the remaining difference approximately $0.60 due to our better-than-expected gross margin. This highlights the strength of our execution from our core business and the project cost savings achieved.
Turning to Slide 13, I will read the balance sheet and cash flow summary. Cash and marketable securities increased by approximately $876 million to $2 billion. Our net cash position nearly doubled to just under $1.8 billion. The increase in cash resulted primarily from the sale of Solar Gen as well as the collection of retention payments on our Desert Sunlight and Topaz projects. We anticipate that our cash position will continue to have large fluctuations quarter-to-quarter as we continue to construct some projects on balance sheet. Our net working capital, including the change in noncurrent project assets and excluding cash and marketable securities, decreased by approximately $845 million from the prior quarter. The decrease was due to the reduction in unbilled accounts receivables from the collection of cash retention on Topaz and Desert Sunlight, a decrease in deferred project cost from the sale of Solar Gen and reduction in trade AR. These items were partially offset by an increase in inventories. Solar debt during the quarter decreased slightly to $217 million. Of this total, $75 million is project level debt associated with our Luz del Norte project in Chile.
Cash flow from operations was $928 million compared to cash flow used in operations of $47 million in Q3. Free cash flow was $858 million compared to negative free cash flow of $107 million in the prior quarter. Capital expenditures totaled approximately $73 million, a slight increase from $71 million in the prior quarter. Depreciation for the quarter was $62 million compared to $60 million in the prior quarter.
Turning to Slide 14. I will now discuss our guidance for the first quarter of 2015. Note that given the announcement regarding the proposed YieldCo formation, we are holding off on providing full year guidance at this time. Specific to the quarter, our anticipated financial results is being impacted as we hold projects, build them on balance sheet, for the potential YieldCo creation previously imagined. I believe this path will create long-term projects and shareholder value. In the near term, it will result in lower financial results than if we had sold these projects to a third-party. Our abbreviated financial guidance for the first quarter is as follows: net sales in the range of $550 million to $650 million, a loss of $0.25 to $0.35 per fully diluted share. Cash used in operations is expected to be between $400 million and $500 million. The sequentially lower revenue earnings and operating cash flow is due to 2 main factors. First, in the fourth quarter, we sold a partial interest in Solar Gen and achieved substantial completion on our Topaz and Desert Sunlight projects. In addition, we are constructing several projects on balance sheet in Q1. We expect to complete nearly 200 megawatts in the quarter where we will not recognize any revenue.
Now moving on to Slide 15. I'd like to summarize our progress during the past quarter and past year. First, we continue to demonstrate the enormous potential of our cad tel technology. We set another new cell record efficiency of 21.5%. This positions us firmly on track to meet the 22% target we set last year. In addition, our efficiency continues to improve rapidly. Our lead line efficiency improved to 14.8% in Q4, which is 90 basis points improvement from the prior year. We've had tremendous progress in our new bookings with 2.5 gigawatts contracted during the year. We set a target of 2 gigawatts to book for the year, and we have exceeded that goal. Our book-to-bill ratio for the year was 1.7, allowing us to replenish our pipeline. From a financial standpoint, we exceeded both our earnings per share and operating cash flow guidance. Finally, we believe the announced joint YieldCo with SunPower is the best avenue to achieve, to help provide access to sustainable, competitive cost of capital, which should also may provide enhanced value to our First Solar shareholders.
With that, we conclude our prepared remarks and open the call for questions. Operator?"

First, I don't think we're in a position to be able to provide you any guidance on the bookings outlook for '15 at this time. But generally, the strength in '14 was relatively broad-based, and it's a consistent pattern that we're seeing across broad swaths of our business where as costs continue to come down, we're seeing greater and greater adoption rates. And what's particularly encouraging is a lot of this adoption is driven not by any policy impetus but more by a recognition that utility-scale solar represents compelling value opportunity. So we've seen the growth in the market outside of California and the United States, particularly the Southeast United States, continue to see strong activity in that region in Texas, in the Western United States in North America. As identified, we continue to see a lot of strong activity in India. We've had our initial success in Turkey and expect to see momentum there. We've had continued drumbeat of activity in Europe. It's not gigantic, but it continues to roll along. And so we've just seen sort of a broad-based, a lot of the seeds that we planted over the last 2.5 years starting to take root and generate opportunities for us. So it's really been broad-based. Obviously, as the efficiency continues to improve, particularly the most recent efficiency improvements. And bear in mind that we've been competing in the market with the knowledge of where our efficiency was going to get to. So what we're seeing come off the production line now is what we've been competing with for the last 12 months. And obviously, as we are now roughly at parity from a temperature-adjusted energy density standpoint, it just dramatically increases our ability to compete and dramatically increases the entitlement we have to compete and to margin at the end of the day. So the 2 go -- we believe the 2 go hand in hand. There's broad -- overall pretty good health across the solar sector. And then, we, as an individual company, are doing well because we continue to have such success in advancing our technology."

We have different customers with different needs. Some customers have self-execution capability and they want to buy our module, and we're happy to supply them. Other customers want to own the facility, but they really want someone to handle the full turnkey EPC execution. And then, there's a spectrum in between those 2 that is the Module Plus and AC Power Block offerings where the customer doesn't want to own and they want to be provided with power, obviously, that flows out of our development business. And we will choose to monetize those development assets in the manner that provides the greatest long-term value for our shareholders. The same philosophy we've had for the last 2.5 years.

There can be some nuanced differences between the 2 approaches as a result of that, but by and large, it's the same things executing the 2 segments. It's the same product.

What I can say is that relative to guidance, the fact -- as we communicated, we actually retained 49% of the interest in Solar Gen. I think you could infer that the revenue mix relative to guidance largely was attributed to that. Relative to gross margin and as we indicated, operationally, we were about $0.60 better than what we had initially guided towards. The best way I would think that is I think it was about half of it was better margin realization on Solar Gen, which is a combination of better value, again, are indicative of cost of capital to the market as well as more -- lower cost to construct. So there's cost savings. And then, the other half of that $0.60 was largely associated with cost savings that we realized on Desert Sunlight and Topaz."

And those would include Lost Hills and North Star and Kingbird as an example. So those are going to be the projects which we'll be achieving COD this year and will ultimately recognize revenue on. It will be lumpy the same way that -- I can't give you a profile of how that flows to the year. The construction of the activity will be relatively linear, not only for those projects but for the projects that we are constructing with CODs in 2016. However, the revenue associated with that and the cash flow associated will be relatively lumpy based on the CODs that are achieved. So I think the best way to think about it is we're constructing a couple of hundred megawatts on balance sheet. You look at our aggregate pipeline of north of a gigawatt that will be achieved, COD between now and the end of '16. That's the kind of cadence and kind of rhythm that we're on right now in terms of the monthly profile of about 100 megawatts or so of construction of self-developed assets. Around the PPA environment, we're not going to provide any colors -- color on that at this point in time."

First off, could you provide some color on how you're thinking about the impact to cash flow economics at a high level on projects post-ITC starting in 2017 versus the level that you're generating it now. I guess, one of your peers suggested recently that it would be 20% to 30% lower, but would be curious to hear your take. And then secondly, if I look at the implied bookings, ASP, of this quarter or a quarter today, it suggests about $1 a watt, which is -- it's lower than what you've been at for the past several quarters or so. Wondering how much of that is being driven by mix here in the near-term versus just cost deflation on a like-for-like project basis, and also, if there's any international embedded in that mix that's having an impact."

You get a partial offset with that because you can recover a little bit more of the makers back because the makers -- you take half of the ITC delta and you reduce your makers basis by that. So instead of taking a 15% delta, now you're taking a 5% delta. So you get a little bit more of makers back but again, that's spread out over 5 years. But what we would say is that, obviously, it's going to make the economics more challenging. However, we are -- when you look at our road map and the entitlement of where our installed cost is going, driven by the improvement of our module efficiency to higher energy density and overall reductions that we're driving across our balance of systems, we'll be better positioned than most to compete in that type of environment. So yes, the economics will become a little bit more challenging, but when you couple that with an aggressive cost reduction road map that we're on the journey of delivering against, we feel that we'll be able to realize comparable economics post the ITC as we are pre-ITC especially as we get into the '18 and '19 time line. So we think we're pretty well positioned from that. As it relates to the bookings ASP, you got to remember one of the things that Jim indicated in the first quarter, I think we booked a little less than 200 megawatts with Strata, which was included in that number. That's mainly module only, right? So when you do the math, you got to remember that, that mix of what came through in that 300 megawatts or so in the year-to-date bookings number was highly impacted as a result of that. Now the other thing I would say about Strata that I think is important, it relates back to the comment that Jim answered -- or the question Jim answered at the very front, was around relative competitiveness of our technology. That's a new customer for us. Now Strata obviously has installed hundreds of megawatts. What we've been able to do is to displace other mainly Chinese module suppliers that they have historically relied upon. So we've been able -- with the overall increased competitiveness in our technology, developing the strong relationship with the customer and then strength of our balance sheet in overall bankability, we've been able to penetrate accounts that we historically had not had a presence, which I think is a great testament to the accomplishment of our BD team as well as our technology. But that's the thing you got to keep in prospective as it relates to the first quarter. It is somewhat skewed down because of the high mix of module-only sales."

And we think -- we've always said that there is a place for the higher-efficiency product in the marketplace and in our product mix.

And so that will weigh on the results for the first quarter because we won't be selling any of our self-developed projects. Again, as we indicated, we'll be constructing that on the balance sheet.

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter 2014 earnings call. Let me begin by addressing the announcement made yesterday that we are in advanced negotiations with SunPower to form a joint YieldCo vehicle to which we expect to contribute a portfolio of selected solar generation assets. Upon the execution of a master formation agreement, the parties intend to file a registration statement with the SEC for an initial public offering of the YieldCo. Completion of the joint venture and IPO is subject to the execution of definitive documentation and board and regulatory approval. We cannot say any more about the transaction at this time, and we will not be taking any questions on the subject in our Q&A session today. We expect to file a public S-1 this quarter, which will provide additional details on this proposed transaction. Now however, I do want to emphasize the strategic value of this decision to First Solar's shareholders. We have undertaken a careful study of the strategic options available and have determined that this is the best course of action to maximize project and shareholder returns in the long term. This combination brings together the 2 leading and most bankable companies in the solar industry, with a combined installed base of 16 gigawatts, the strongest balance sheets in the sector and combined strengths in utility scale and distributed generation as well as a broad geographical base. Lastly, as a result of this announcement, the 2015 target we provided at our prior Analyst Day is no longer applicable. Until we have clarity in the creation of the joint YieldCo with SunPower, we do not believe it is meaningful to provide full year 2015 guidance. Moreover, as a result of this potential transaction, we have decided to delay an Analyst Day at this time. We will continue to evaluate holding an Analyst Day later this year.
Now for an update on our technology. First, as we announced earlier this month, we have set yet another new world record for cad tel cell efficiency of 21.5%. This latest milestone certified at the Newport Lab and documented in NREL's Best Research Cell Efficiencies exceeds our previous record of 21%. We have now increased our record cell efficiency by over 400 basis points since mid-2011. This remarkable achievement demonstrates the potential of our cad tel technology and it's another tremendous accomplishment by our R&D team. In conjunction with our record cell efficiency, we also announced that our production PV modules have reached a quality and reliability milestone by achieving Atlas 25+ certification following a rigorous series of long-term, combined stress environmental exposure tests. This certification represents some of the most stringent standards available and demonstrates that the progress in our module technology is not only in efficiency improvements, but also in quality and reliability. We continue to see the advancements in our technology manifest in our production module efficiency. Our full fleet average conversion efficiency for the fourth quarter was 14.4%, a 20 basis point improvement from the prior quarter and 100 basis point improvement from the prior year. We now have several lines of production running our latest technology, and we are encouraged by the results. So far this month, 4 of these lines have averaged an impressive 15.8% efficiency. This technology will be rolled out across the fleet over the course of 2015.
Switching briefly to our TetraSun product. We have recently begun production of our TetraSun modules at our manufacturing facility in Malaysia. We are encouraged by the performance of the technology, which is being produced with initial cell efficiencies of 20.5%. Our expected capacity for 2015 is approximately 50 megawatts, and we will ramp future production levels based on market demand.
Let me now turn to Slides 5 and 6, which highlight the tremendous progress we made in new bookings in 2014 and during the first 2 months of 2015. As in the past data -- as in the past, this data represents our total business and includes systems, Module Plus and module-only sales. Total bookings for 2014 were 2.5 gigawatts DC, which equates to a book-to-bill ratio of 1.7. This far exceeds the 2 gigawatt DC target we communicated at Analyst Day last year and highlights the momentum in our bookings. Since our last earnings call, we have booked over 1 gigawatt with 726 megawatts recorded prior to the end of 2014 and the remaining 311 megawatts occurring during the first 2 months of 2015. As a result, our ending outstanding bookings are now at 4 gigawatts DC, an increase of 1.3 gigawatts from where we began 2014. The strength of these bookings and the accelerating demand we have seen in recent months is a testament to the increasing competitiveness of our module technology. The single-largest booking in the quarter was the 130 megawatts AC, California Flats Project. As previously announced, the PPA for this project was signed with Apple and is the largest agreement in the industry to provide solar power to a commercial end user. This 25-year PPA will provide power to Apple's new headquarters, data centers and retail operations in California. This deal signals the growing importance of affordable clean energy to commercial customers. Combined with the previously announced 150 megawatts AC PPA signed with PG&E, the total project stands at 280 megawatts AC. The combined size of the California Flats Project represents one of the largest self-developed projects announced in the last several years; highlighting our tremendous strength and utility scale Solar. This past quarter, we continued to demonstrate significant progress in the southeastern United States. We signed agreements with Southern Power to provide EPC services to 2 projects in Georgia, totaling over 210 megawatts AC. The larger of the 2, the 130-megawatt AC Taylor project, is expected to begin construction in September of this year and achieve COD in late 2016. Additionally, we recently signed a 188-megawatt DC Module Plus deal with Strata Solar to supply projects in North Carolina. Altogether, our bookings in the southeastern U.S. since mid-2014 now total almost 700 megawatts DC.
We also saw strength in our international bookings. In India, we contracted 265 megawatts DC of volumes since our last call. As disclosed previously, we were awarded 80 megawatts AC of projects in Andhra Pradesh, India. We have now signed the PPA on these projects and included them in our booking total. The remaining volume booked in the quarter was module-only sales. Underscoring our commitment to the growing solar market in India, we announced last week at RE-Invest a commitment to develop 5 gigawatts of solar projects by 2019. We are excited by the Indian government's vision for solar energy and look forward to helping them achieve these goals.
Also, in Turkey, we are encouraged by the results of the recent solar power tender, where we secured 19 megawatts AC of connection capacity. Other partners competing with First Solar technology were also successful. While small in relative terms to our overall bookings for the quarter, it is a significant first step in a market with tremendous potential for solar.
Turning to outstanding bookings and revenue terms. Our expected revenue stands at $7.5 billion, approximately flat compared to the beginning of the year. The increase in megawatts booked was offset by a higher mix of module-only and Module Plus volume, which resulted in flat revenue bookings but also is indicative of our efficiency improvements on the competitiveness of our module in the global marketplace.
Turning to Slide 7. I will now cover our potential bookings opportunities, which now stand at 13.5 gigawatts DC, a slight decrease from 13.7 gigawatts in the prior quarter, primarily due to the conversion of several opportunities to bookings. As a reminder, this represents all potential bookings whether they're self-developed projects, EPC contracts, Module Plus or module-only. Contracted projects are not included in this total. While our total opportunities decreased slightly, we are encouraged by the increase in the size of our mid- to late-stage deals, which increased by over 500 megawatts from the prior period. 
Slide 8 shows the breakdown of demand by geography. Our opportunity set outside of North America stands at 7.5 gigawatts or 56% of the total. One indication of the progress -- continued progress we are making in developing international markets is that the vast majority of our roughly 1.5 gigawatts at mid- to late-stage deals are outside of North America. And finally, in December, we announced our entry into the residential solar market with a strategic investment in Clean Energy Collective. CEC is the nation's leading developer of community solar and this strategic partnership allows us to develop and market community solar offerings to residential customers and businesses directly on behalf of client utilities. Community solar is not only a more cost-effective solution for customers, but it also significantly expands consumers' access to solar electricity. This allows any power consumer to go solar, including those who live in multi-tenant buildings, rent or whose rooftops cannot accommodate solar panels. In contrast, typical residential rooftop installations, which are limited to a fraction of the population due to factors such as income, local radiance and homeownership, virtually, anyone can benefit from community solar. Community solar allows an individual to benefit directly from owning part of a solar asset, without concerns such as an increase in their homeowner's insurance, problems that arise when their rooftop requires repair or replacement or transferability of residential rooftop leases when they sell their home. For example, a student renting a condo could own panels through our community solar program and take along credit for that solar power even when he moves or just transfers or sells his ownership to a third party without the need for credit scores. This strategic partnership with CEC allows First Solar to play to the strength of our proven utility scale capabilities, while leveraging the expertise of a leading community solar program operator. As an integral part of our distributed generation strategy, we will provide periodic updates on the progress of this partnership.
Now I'll turn it over to Mark, who will provide detail on our Q4 financial results and discuss guidance for the first quarter of 2015."

I'll begin by discussing fourth quarter operational performance. Production in the quarter was 509 megawatts DC, an increase of 13% from the prior quarter and 15% higher year-over-year due to the restart of our 4 manufacturing lines in Malaysia as well as higher module efficiency. Our factory capacity utilization was 84%, up 7 percentage points from the third quarter. The higher factory utilization was also due to the restart of the idle capacity. In the fourth quarter, the average conversion efficiency of our modules was 14.4%, which is up 20 basis points quarter-over-quarter and 100 basis points higher year-over-year. Our best line averaged 14.8% efficiency during the quarter, an increase of approximately 50 basis points from the prior quarter. As Jim mentioned, our best lines are averaging 15.8% for the month of February. The substantial increase in our lead line efficiency continues to highlight the great progress our team is making to deliver our module efficiency road map, which effectively is converting our record sales and module accomplishments into reality. We are encouraged by our cad tel entitlement and the relative competitive energy density it can achieve.
Moving on to Slide 12, I'll discuss the P&L. Net sales for the fourth quarter were just over $1 billion compared to sales of $889 million last quarter. The increase is due to the sale of the Solar Gen project to Southern, initial revenue recognition on Silver State South, higher third-party module sales and various other system projects under construction. This was partially offset by lower revenue from our Desert Sunlight and Topaz projects, which both achieved substantial completion in the quarter. As a percentage of total net sales, our system revenue, which includes both our EPC revenue and solar modules used in the system projects, was 92%, a decrease of 3 percentage points from the prior quarter. The higher mix of third-party modules sales was primarily due to recognizing revenue on BELECTRIC's landing project, which, at 46 megawatts DC, is the largest operating solar farm in the U.K. For 2014, net sales increased to $3.4 billion compared to $3.3 billion in 2013. Relative to our guidance for the quarter, sales were lower due to a partial sale of the Solar Gen project, the timing of some module sales pushed into early 2015 and lower system revenue from weather-related delays. As highlighted in our last earnings call, our guidance assumes we sold 100% of Solar Gen to Southern. However, we noted, subject to certain terms and conditions, we have the right to retain a minority interest in the project. In the fourth quarter, we elected to retain a 49% interest in Solar Gen. Gross margin in the fourth quarter was 30.6% compared to 21.3% in the third quarter. The increase was due to higher profits associated with a partial sale of Solar Gen and cost reductions on the Topaz and Desert Sunlight projects. On a full year basis, gross margins decreased 170 basis points to 24.4% from 26.1% in 2013. The lower gross margin was a result of the mix of system projects under construction between the periods. Fourth quarter operating expenses increased to $109 million, primarily due to the higher start-up expenses associated with restarting capacity. For the full year 2014, operating expenses were $403 million compared to 2013 operating expenses of $407 million, which excludes $87 million of restructuring and asset impairments. The decrease in operating expenses from 2013 was primarily due to lower depreciation and compensation expenses, partially offset by higher investment in research and development of our cad tel technology. Operating income for the quarter was $199 million compared to $84 million in Q3. The increase was due to higher sequential sales and the increasing gross margins discussed earlier. For the year, operating income was $424 million compared to 2013 operating income of $455 million, which also excludes the $89 million of restructuring and asset impairments. Fourth quarter GAAP net income was $192 million or $1.89 per fully diluted share compared to $0.87 per fully diluted share in the third quarter. Full year earnings per fully diluted share was $3.91, including a $0.26 benefit of a onetime tax item noted in Q3. Excluding this item, full year earnings per share were $3.66. Note that relative to our guidance for the quarter and full year, there were several factors that led to the difference between our actual results and expectations. First, as indicated, we have elected to retain a minority interest in Solar Gen. As a result, a portion of the revenue associated with this project was not recognized in the quarter and contributed to the lower than forecasted revenue. Gross margin and operating income exceeded the guidance for the quarter due to the higher-than-expected profit associated with Solar Gen and significant project cost savings on our Desert Sunlight and Topaz projects. The resulting earnings were significantly higher than the $2.80 per share, which was the upper end of our full year guidance due to the aforementioned factors and a lower-than-expected tax rate which resulted from a favorable mix of jurisdictional income. Putting the results into the context for the year, excluding the $0.26 per share onetime tax item we highlighted in Q3, our full year earnings would have been $3.66. The difference between the $3.66 and the $2.80 guidance is attributed to an additional $0.26 from the lower-than-expected tax rate in Q4, with the remaining difference approximately $0.60 due to our better-than-expected gross margin. This highlights the strength of our execution from our core business and the project cost savings achieved.
Turning to Slide 13, I will read the balance sheet and cash flow summary. Cash and marketable securities increased by approximately $876 million to $2 billion. Our net cash position nearly doubled to just under $1.8 billion. The increase in cash resulted primarily from the sale of Solar Gen as well as the collection of retention payments on our Desert Sunlight and Topaz projects. We anticipate that our cash position will continue to have large fluctuations quarter-to-quarter as we continue to construct some projects on balance sheet. Our net working capital, including the change in noncurrent project assets and excluding cash and marketable securities, decreased by approximately $845 million from the prior quarter. The decrease was due to the reduction in unbilled accounts receivables from the collection of cash retention on Topaz and Desert Sunlight, a decrease in deferred project cost from the sale of Solar Gen and reduction in trade AR. These items were partially offset by an increase in inventories. Solar debt during the quarter decreased slightly to $217 million. Of this total, $75 million is project level debt associated with our Luz del Norte project in Chile.
Cash flow from operations was $928 million compared to cash flow used in operations of $47 million in Q3. Free cash flow was $858 million compared to negative free cash flow of $107 million in the prior quarter. Capital expenditures totaled approximately $73 million, a slight increase from $71 million in the prior quarter. Depreciation for the quarter was $62 million compared to $60 million in the prior quarter.
Turning to Slide 14. I will now discuss our guidance for the first quarter of 2015. Note that given the announcement regarding the proposed YieldCo formation, we are holding off on providing full year guidance at this time. Specific to the quarter, our anticipated financial results is being impacted as we hold projects, build them on balance sheet, for the potential YieldCo creation previously imagined. I believe this path will create long-term projects and shareholder value. In the near term, it will result in lower financial results than if we had sold these projects to a third-party. Our abbreviated financial guidance for the first quarter is as follows: net sales in the range of $550 million to $650 million, a loss of $0.25 to $0.35 per fully diluted share. Cash used in operations is expected to be between $400 million and $500 million. The sequentially lower revenue, earnings and operating cash flow is due to 2 main factors. First, in the fourth quarter, we sold a partial interest in Solar Gen and achieved substantial completion on our Topaz and Desert Sunlight projects. In addition, we are constructing several projects on balance sheet in Q1. We expect to complete nearly 200 megawatts in the quarter where we will not recognize any revenue.
Now moving on to Slide 15. I'd like to summarize our progress during the past quarter and past year. First, we continue to demonstrate the enormous potential of our cad tel technology. We set another new cell record efficiency of 21.5%. This positions us firmly on track to meet the 22% target we set last year. In addition, our efficiency continues to improve rapidly. Our lead line efficiency improved to 14.8% in Q4, which is 90 basis points improvement from the prior year. We've had tremendous progress in our new bookings with 2.5 gigawatts contracted during the year. We set a target of 2 gigawatts to book for the year, and we have exceeded that goal. Our book-to-bill ratio for the year was 1.7, allowing us to replenish our pipeline. From a financial standpoint, we exceeded both our earnings per share and operating cash flow guidance. Finally, we believe the announced joint YieldCo with SunPower is the best avenue to achieve -- to help provide access to sustainable, competitive cost of capital, which should ultimately provide enhanced value to our First Solar shareholders.
With that, we conclude our prepared remarks and open the call for questions. Operator?"

First, I don't think we're in a position to be able to provide you any guidance on the bookings outlook for '15 at this time. But generally, the strength in '14 was relatively broad-based, and it's a consistent pattern that we're seeing across broad swaths of our business, where as costs continue to come down, we're seeing greater and greater adoption rates. And what's particularly encouraging is a lot of this adoption is driven not by any policy impetus but more by a recognition that utility-scale solar represents a compelling value opportunity. So we've seen the growth in the market outside of California and the United States, particularly the Southeast United States, continue to see strong activity in that region in Texas, in the Western United States in North America. As identified, we continue to see a lot of strong activity in India. We've had our initial success in Turkey and expect to see momentum there. We've had a continued drumbeat of activity in Europe. It's not gigantic, but it continues to roll along. And so we've just seen sort of a broad-based, a lot of the seeds that we planted over the last 2.5 years starting to take root and generate opportunities for us. So it's really been broad-based. Obviously, as the efficiency continues to improve, particularly the most recent efficiency improvements -- and bear in mind that we've been competing in the market with the knowledge of where our efficiency was going to get to -- so what we're seeing come off the production line now is what we've been competing with for the last 12 months. And obviously, as we are now roughly at parity from a temperature-adjusted energy density standpoint, it just dramatically increases our ability to compete and dramatically increases the entitlement we have to compete and to margin at the end of the day. So the 2 go -- we believe the 2 go hand in hand. There's broad -- overall pretty good health across the solar sector. And then, we, as an individual company, are doing well because we continue to have such success in advancing our technology."

In terms of the various product lines: Module, Module Plus, EPC and system, we don't have a preference as much as we look for what is our most potent weapon in each marketplace in which we operate and what it is that the customer wants in each marketplace. We have different customers with different needs. Some customers have self-execution capability and they want to buy a module, and we're happy to supply them. Other customers want to own the facility, but they really want someone to handle the full turnkey EPC execution. And then, there's a spectrum in between those 2 that is the Module Plus and AC Power Block offerings where the customer doesn't want to own and they want to be provided with power, obviously, that flows out of our development business. And we will choose to monetize those development assets in the manner that provides the greatest long-term value for our shareholders. The same philosophy we've had for the last 2.5 years. There's nothing that's going to change with respect to that analysis."

I will say that perhaps the largest difference is that the -- they are satisfying whatever they have determined their priorities and needs to be as a company, whereas a utility is working to a regulatory standard, a prudent utility standard. There can be some nuanced differences between the 2 approaches as a result of that, but by and large, it's the same things executing the 2 segments. It's the same product. It's just the commercial relationship and the priorities of the customers may have a bit of a nuance to it. But we think you'll see more of it as we move forward in time.

I think you could infer that the revenue mix relative to guidance largely was attributed to that. Relative to gross margin and as we indicated, operationally, we were about $0.60 better than what we had initially guided towards. The best way I would paint that is think of it as about half of it was better margin realization on Solar Gen, which is a combination of better value, again, are indicative of cost of capital that's in the market as well as more -- lower cost to construct. So there's cost savings. And then, the other half of that $0.60 was largely associated with cost savings that we realized on Desert Sunlight and Topaz."

And those would include Lost Hills and North Star and Kingbird as an example. So those are going to be the projects which will be achieving COD this year and we will ultimately recognize revenue on. It will be lumpy the same way that -- I can't give you a profile of how that flows to the year. The construction of the activity will be relatively linear, not only for those projects but for the projects that we are constructing with CODs in 2016. However, the revenue associated with that and the cash flow associated will be relatively lumpy based on the CODs that are achieved. So I think the best way to think about it is we're constructing a couple of hundred megawatts on balance sheet. If you look at our aggregate pipeline of north of a gigawatt that will be achieved, COD between now and the end of '16. That's the kind of cadence and kind of rhythm that we're on right now in terms of the monthly profile of about 100 megawatts or so of construction of self-developed assets. Around the PPA environment, we're not going to provide any colors -- color on that at this point in time."

I guess, one of your peers suggested recently that it would be 20% to 30% lower, but would be curious to hear your take. And then secondly, if I look at the implied bookings, ASP, this quarter or quarter to date, it suggests about $1 a watt, which is -- it's lower than what you've been at for the past several quarters or so. Wondering how much of that is being driven by mix here in the near-term versus just cost deflation on a like-for-like project basis, and also, if there's any international embedded in that mix that's having an impact."

Now, you get a partial offset with that because you can recover a little bit more of the makers back because the makers -- you take half of the ITC delta and you reduce your makers basis by that. So instead of taking a 15% delta, now you're taking a 5% delta. So you get a little bit more makers back, but again, that's spread out over 5 years. But what we would say is that, obviously, it's going to make the economics more challenging. However, we are -- when you look at our road map and the entitlement of where our installed cost is going, driven by the improvement of our module efficiency, higher energy density and overall reductions that we're driving across our balance of systems, we'll be better positioned than most to compete in that type of environment. So yes, the economics will become a little bit more challenging, but when you couple that with an aggressive cost reduction road map that we're on the journey of delivering against, we feel that we'll be able to realize comparable economics post the ITC, as we are pre-ITC, especially, as we get into the '18 and '19 time line. So we think we're pretty well positioned from that. As it relates to the bookings ASP, you got to remember one of the things that Jim indicated in the first quarter, I think we booked a little less than 200 megawatts with Strata, which was included in that number. That's mainly module only, right? So when you do the math, you got to remember that, that mix of what came through in that 300 megawatts or so in the year-to-date bookings number was highly impacted as a result of that. Now the other thing I would say about Strata that I think is important, it relates back to the comment that Jim answered -- or the question Jim answered at the very front, was around relative competitiveness of our technology. That's a new customer for us. Now Strata obviously has installed hundreds of megawatts. What we've been able to do is to displace others, mainly Chinese module suppliers that they had historically relied upon. So we've been able -- with the overall increased competitiveness in our technology, developing the strong relationship with the customer and then strength of our balance sheet in overall bankability, we've been able to penetrate accounts that we historically had not had a presence in, which I think is a great testament to the accomplishment of our BD team as well as our technology. But that's the thing you got to keep in prospective as it relates to the first quarter. It is somewhat skewed down because of the high mix of module-only sales."

And we think -- we've always said that there is a place for the higher-efficiency product in the marketplace and in our product mix.

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2015 earnings call. Let me begin by providing a brief update on our prior announcement regarding our intent to form a joint YieldCo vehicle with Southern Power. Since Our last earnings call, the 2 parties have filed a Public S-1 registration statement with the SEC for an initial public offering of 8point3 Energy Partners. Completion of the IPO is still subject to market factors and regulatory approval, but we continue to move forward through the process. Again, we cannot say anymore about the transaction at this time, outside of what is in the Public S-1 documents. Any questions on the subject in our Q&A session will be directed to the Public S-1 filing for answers. 
Now, for an update on our technology and manufacturing. Our module conversion efficiency continued to improve in the first quarter, with our full fleet averaging 14.7% efficiency, an improvement of 30 basis points from Q4. Our lead line efficiency averaged 15.6% for the quarter, an 80 basis point improvement quarter-over-quarter and 140 basis point improvement versus Q1 of '14. 
This improvement is the largest sequential and year-over-year increase in our lead line efficiency in the history of the company. Even more impressive is the recent performance of our lead line, which has reached a new milestone for modular efficiency of 16.3%. This is truly a remarkable achievement, which demonstrates the ability of our research and manufacturing organizations to execute to our road map. 
By late Q3, we will have rolled out these latest improvement programs across the majority of our fleet.
Slide 4 provides an update to our energy density roadmap, which we first showed at our Analyst Day last year and puts into context the advances in our efficiency. As we've discussed in the past, conversion efficiency is a narrow major of overall modular performance, while energy yield produced is a more comprehensive and superior metric. Energy density, which is energy yield per meter square incorporates several other factors beyond efficiency alone. These other factors include temperature, humidity and shade tolerance. Part technology has advantages in each of these areas over our crystal in competitors. 
As shown in the metric, our Q1 in the quarter efficiency achieved clarity with multicrystalline silicon on an energy density basis. In a of only a month, our lead line has now achieved an energy density advantage to multicrystalline and silicon. To put this achievement in perspective, when first traduced this metric a year ago at our Analyst Day, we had a significant disadvantage. But in the space of a little over a year, we have now erased that deficit. 
During the remainder of 2015, while early line will improve only modestly, our overall fleet average efficiency will increase significantly as the improvements are rolled out across the fleet.
In coming years, we expect to further increase our relative advantage based on the strength of our technology road map. Compared to our prior energy density road map, our expectations of relative advantage in future years has been updated. The update for the road map are primarily due to revised timing of our new technology implementations, which have been adjusted to minimize downtime from technology upgrades in order to maximize output, particularly in 2016.
Most importantly, the metric highlights the favorable competitive position we anticipate as we execute on our technology road map.
Given that all in new module efficiency enhancements are not created equal, let me make a few points related to our 16.3% production lead line efficiency as it relates to recent crystal and silicone record modules.
First, crystalline silicon competitors typically calculate record efficiencies using the aperture area of the module. We calculate efficiency on a whole area basis.
Our 16.3% efficiency announced today would equate to a 16.9% aperture area efficiency. Likewise, our 17% record module, which we announced last year would be 17.5% on a similar aperture area basis. It's also important to understand that our 16.9% aperture efficiency is in high volume commercial production and not in a laboratory. This new record also reflects materials and processes that are cost competitive and allow us to continue to lower our costs per watt. 
It is important to keep these facts in mind and based on our technology achievements, we feel that we are well positioned to compete with any commercial crystalline silicon technology available.
Turning to Slide 5. Let me discuss our capacity and demand outlook for 2015. This slide, besides illustrating our production capacity for 2015, more importantly highlights the profound impact efficiency improvements have on output. 
Since 2013, the year our production levels were at a low point, efficiency and throughput improvements have contributed to over 450 megawatts of capacity or the equivalent of 5 new lines. This is a key point to understand that our investment in efficiency improvements, not only improves our competitiveness, but also results in significant incremental capacity without building new factories. 
As a results of the improving competitiveness of our module and the continued demand we see ahead of the potential ITC step down after 2016, we are ramping our factories to full utilization. Also, as we indicated previously, we are adding 2 additional lines at our Ohio location.
We are virtually sold out for 2015 and we're increasing our contracted volumes for next year. We expect to shift between 2.6 to 2.8 gigawatts for the year, including shipments to developed projects. 
In the first quarter, we have shipped 690 megawatts, a new record for a single quarter. We are encouraged by the continuing bookings momentum as highlighted on Slide 6. Total bookings for the first quarter of 2015 were 422 megawatts DC against shipments of 690 megawatts DC. In the month of April, we have booked in additional 483 megawatts. As a result, our ending outstanding bookings are now at 3.9 gigawatt DC, an increase of 200 megawatts from where we ended 2015.
Achieving a book-to-bill ratio of at least 1:1 remains our objective for the year, but it will be more challenging in 2015 as some inventory was carried over from the prior year due to minor delays in shipments to projects.
The single largest booking since our last earnings call was a modular plus agreement that we signed with Strata Solar for 300 megawatts DC of deliveries in 2016. Through this deal, we've continued to strengthened our relationship with as well as extend our leadership in the Southeastern United States. 
Also, in the South, we signed an EPC agreement to construct a 100-megawatt AC Solar project and in a separate transaction, signed a module plus agreement with Silicon Wrenched to supply 70 megawatts DC on-site commercial and industrial solar power installation. 
This latter project highlights the value that First Solar technology provides for the growing number of commercial and industrial customers, peaking clean and affordable lower. 
Internationally, we continue to make strides in India where we booked another 75 megawatts AC of self-developed projects. This brings our captive project total in India to 200 megawatts AC and demonstrates the progress we are making in this rapidly growing market.
Finally, our utility scale solar development activities in Japan continue to progress as demonstrated by our first bookings this month. We expect to commence construction on our first round of projects under the mega solar program in Q3 this year. 
While ACcumulative volume of these initial projects is relatively small, it represents an important evolution from supplying modules to third parties in Japan to successfully developing and realizing our own pipeline. It also demonstrates that our technology has achieved adoption and acceptance in this important market.
Turning to Slide 7, our bookings in terms of expected revenue now stands at $7.6 billion. An increase of approximately $300 million compared to the beginning of the year. The balance increased primarily due to lower revenue recognized in the first quarter, resulting from constructing more projects on balance sheet.
While we don't provide details related to the gross margin on our bookings, we are seeing improving trends as we continue to lower our costs and see some stability in pricing. 
Turning to Slide 8, I will now cover our potential bookings opportunity, which have grown to 14 gigawatts DC, an increase of approximately 500 megawatts from the prior quarter.
Note also that the total potential bookings increased despite the strong year-to-date bookings. We are also pleased that the size of our mid to late-stage opportunities has nearly doubled from the prior period to 3 gigawatts. This increases our confidence in our ability to read our 1:1 book-to-bill ratio for the year.
Slide 9 shows the breakdown of demand by geography. Our opportunities set outside North America stands at 8.3 gigawatts or 59% of the total. Our transition is sustainable markets outside the U.S. is gaining traction as we are increasingly seeing the results of our investments in developing regions. More than half of our mid- and late-stage opportunities are now in international markets.
Finally, as announced earlier today, we have entered into a strategic alliance with Caterpillar to provide integrated turnkey photovoltaic solutions for distributed generation micro-grid applications. As part of this announcement, First Solar will provide a pre-engineered solutions package, including our advanced module technology, which will be sold under the Cat brand and through Cat dealers network. First Solar technology will be Caterpillar's generator sets and storage offerings will initially be marketed in the Asia Pacific, Africa and Latin America regions, beginning in the second half of 2015.
Microgrid provide value to prime, diesel and gas customers by integrating renewable energy such as solar power with generator sets. The target of opportunity includes in the 1 to 2 megawatt in locations such as mines in remote towns and villages. This alliance highlights of the ongoing global energy transition, where Solar's competitiveness allows complement conventional generation and is an exciting opportunity continue First Solar's growth outside of our core utility scale business. 
Now I'll turn it over to Mark who will provide detail in our first quarter financial results and discuss guidance during the second quarter."

Turning to Slide 12, I'll begin by discussing the first quarter operational performance. in the quarter was 500 megawatt DC, an increase of 6% due to higher module efficiency and improved utilization. Production was 22% hi",1213,"Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon. Turning to Slide 12, I'll begin by discussing the first quarter operational performance. in the quarter was 500 megawatt DC, an increase of 6% due to higher module efficiency and improved utilization. Production was 22% higher year-over-year due to the aforementioned factors and the restart of 4 manufacturing lines in Malaysia. Our factory utilization was 87%, up 3 percentage points from the order. The higher factory utilization in Q1 was primarily due to less downtime related to upgrades. 
In the first quarter, we -- the average conversion efficiency of our models was 14.7%, which is up 30 basis points quarter-over-quarter and 120 basis points higher year-over-year. 
Our best line average 15.6% efficiency during the quarter and [indiscernible] increase of 80 basis points from the prior quarter and 140 basis points year-over-year. Also, as Jim indicated, our lead line continues to make remarkable progress as we are now running at 16.3% efficiency.
To put this in perspective, our module produced in our Malaysia facility at 16.3% efficiency has a cost per watt below $0.40, excluding sales-related costs. 
Turning to slide 13, I'll discuss the P&L. Net sales for the first quarter were $469 million compared to sales of $1 billion last quarter. The lower net sales is due to constructing more project on balance sheet, following our decision to pursue a YieldCo. In addition, the sale of SolarGen in the prior quarter, a higher mix of module only sales in Q1 and delays on several projects in the current quarter resulted in a sequential revenue decline. 
Relative to expectations for the quarter, net sales were lower due to several factors. First, the sale of a partial interest in our projected did not close in the first quarter, as anticipated due to delays utility to complete the required commissioning test. The sale will close in early April and will be reflected in our future results.
In addition, revenue on several system projects was impacted by a combination of permitting delay and the West Coast port strike. It's important to note that while these project issues resulted in a delay of revenue recognition in Q1, we anticipate recovering the revenue in earnings in the balance of the year. 
As we have communicated previously, our systems business can be lumpy from 1 quarter to the next. Therefore, it's important to look at the business through that spans multiple quarters. As a percentage of total net sales, our systems revenue, which includes both our EPC revenue and Solar modules used in the systems projects was 78%, a decrease of 14 percentage points for the prior quarter. The higher mix of third-party module sales was primarily related to shipments to India and the aforementioned project delays. 
Gross margin in the first quarter was 8.3% compared to 30.6% in the fourth quarter. The lower gross margin is due to constructing more projects on balance sheet in preparation for YieldCo, unfavorable absorption of fixed costs against the lower sales volume, higher module-only sales and a higher mix of lower-margin system projects. 
In addition, the sale of SolarGen in the prior quarter contributed to the sequential decline. 
First quarter operating expenses were approximately flat in $109 million. SG&A expenses were lower, but offset by an increase in startup expense associated with the starting capacity. Also note, Q1 operating expenses, including approximately $4 million of expenses associated with the launch of 8point3 Energy Partners. 
The first quarter operating loss was $70 million compared to an operating income of $199 million in Q4. The decrease was due to sequentially lower sales and gross margin
The net loss in the first quarter was $62 million or $0.62 per fully diluted share compared to net income of $1.89 per fully diluted share for the quarter. 
Turning to Slide 14. I'll now discuss the balance sheet and cash flow summary. Cash and marketable securities decreased by $506 million to $1.5 billion. Our net cash position now stands at $1.2 billion, a decrease from $1.8 billion in the prior quarter. 
As indicated on last quarter's earnings call, the decrease in cash was expected as we are constructing several large projects on balance sheet and in conjunction with our YieldCo strategy. Increased construction activities and holding interest and assets on balance sheet ahead of our planed YieldCo IPO will continue through the second quarter of the year in place additional requirements on liquidity. 
And then working capital, including the change in noncurrent planned asset and excluding cash and marketable securities, increased by $516 million in the prior quarter. The increase is primarily due to an increase in project assets and related activity and an increase in accounts receivable. 
[indiscernible] prior quarter by $26 million to $243 million. The increase is related to additional drawdowns on the associated with our project in Chile, partially offset by scheduled payments on our model. Cash operations was $418 million compared to cash flow from operations of $928 million in Q4. 
Free cash flow was a negative $466 million compared to a positive free cash flow of $858 million in the prior quarter. Capital expenditures totaled $55 million, a decrease of $18 million from the prior quarter. Depreciation for the quarter was $62 million, unchanged from the prior quarter.
Turning to Slide 15, I'll now discuss our guidance for the second quarter of 2015. As indicated in our last quarter's earnings call, given the announcement regarding the proposed YieldCo information, we are holding off providing full year guidance until after 8point3 Energy Partners' IPO. 
So much for the first quarter, our expected financial results for Q2 will be influenced by constructing projects on balance sheet, a mix of lower margin EPC projects and third-party module sales.
In the near term, this will continue to contribute to lower earnings as can be seen in our future guidance. In the second half of the year, we anticipated strong first half us returns are more normal course of business. Our financial guidance for the second quarter net sales in the range of $750 million to $850 million. Earnings of $0.45 to $0.55 per fully diluted share. Cash used in operations expected to be between $250 million and $350 million.
Note that our earnings per share estimate includes a nonrecurring tax benefit of approximately $0.40. This week, we received a fair ruling from the Malaysian tax authorities, which resulted in future tax benefits. 
Finally, one last point relative to guidance. The Q2 earnings guidance does not reflect any potential impact to our financial results from the IPO of 8point3 Energy Partners should that incur in Q2. 
Turning on the next slide, I'll summarize our part impressive improvements in our technology. Our lead line average efficiency improved to 15.6% in the first quarter and is currently running at 16.3%, which rates of 3% energy density advantage relative to silicon.
Our improved competitiveness continues to be manifested in our new bookings. We have booked 905 megawatts DC so far to date and with over 3 megawatts of opportunities, we are seeing continued strong momentum in our business. 
Finally, with the the filing of the S1 for 8point3 Energy Partners, our planned for our joined YieldCo with Sun Power remains on track. 
With this, we conclude our prepared remarks and open the call for questions. Operator?"

So quite simply, having the lowest cost structure allows you to compete for business, capture that business at a more attractive margin than your competitors. It's a fairly straightforward analysis and formula. It also gives us pricing power to break up new markets. It also gives us pricing power to trigger the demand. The overwhelming impact on continuing reduction of prices on a global basis is increasingly utilities and commercial and industrial customers are seeing solar power as an attractive value proposition simply on its own. In the U.S., you have utilities that are increasingly moving towards natural gas as a large portion of their generation fleet. As they do with forward resource planning, fuel diversity, generation diversity is an important part of the formula. When you look at the prevailing prices in the market today, which dependent upon what region of the country can be from anywhere as low as $0.04 or just under that to as high as $0.06 a kilowatt hour. You may look at that on a flat basis for 20 years and compare that to additional costs exposure, even at today's low gas prices, the general view is that make sense as a portion of our total generation mix. So what you've seen in terms of this fairly large explosion of demand in the Southeastern United States is a result of that calculus, is a result of the marketplace understanding where pricing has gotten to and recognizing the value that it represents. We are seeing the same thing internationally. Just as one example, Dubai, originally had planned to carry out a 1-gigawatt program over a 3- to 4-year time frame. The first phase of that program, they were so enamored of the pricing that they receive -- that they doubled the size of that ramp and have accelerated the remaining 1 gigawatt to this year. So the -- we clearly, both in the U.S. and elsewhere, we've reached a price point where as compared with other sources of generation, both just on an absolute cost basis on a -- absence of commodity price risk basis and on a generation diversity basis, it's a very attractive offering."

So I fully expect that on small utility scale plans, let's say, sub-20 megawatts in size, we're likely to see opportunities to contract volume well into 2016. On a very large multi-hundred megawatt projects, I would think that we are over the course of the second and third quarter of 2015, we're probably seeing the end of the opportunity to contract those assets. And it will be a pretty linear relationship in between those 2 extremes. So it all depends. Obviously, permitting a facility in one of the counties close to population centers in California is a more daunting task than permitting the facility in West Texas. So there's a whole host of variables that are going to impact when that cutoff starts hitting in terms of the last opportunity to contract and complete the construction within the IPC deadline."

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2015 earnings call. Let me begin by providing a brief update on our prior announcement regarding our intent to form a joint YieldCo vehicle with SunPower. Since Our last earnings call, the 2 parties have filed a public S-1 registration statement with the SEC for an initial public offering of 8point3 Energy Partners. Completion of the IPO is still subject to market factors and regulatory approval, but we continue to move forward through the process. Again, we cannot say anymore about the transaction at this time outside of what is in the public S-1 documents. Any questions on the subject in our Q&A session will be directed to the public S-1 filing for answers. 
Now for an update on our technology and manufacturing. Our module conversion efficiency continued to improve in the first quarter, with our full fleet averaging 14.7% efficiency, an improvement of 30 basis points from Q4. Our lead line efficiency averaged 15.6% for the quarter, an 80 basis point improvement quarter-over-quarter and 140 basis point improvement versus Q1 of '14. 
This improvement is the largest sequential and year-over-year increase in our lead line efficiency in the history of the company. Even more impressive is the recent performance of our lead line, which has reached a new milestone for modular efficiency of 16.3%. This is truly a remarkable achievement, which demonstrates the ability of our research and manufacturing organizations to execute to our road map. 
By late Q3, we will have rolled out these latest improvement programs across the majority of our fleet.
Slide 4 provides an update to our energy density roadmap, which we first showed at our Analyst Day last year and puts into context the advances in our efficiency. As we've discussed in the past, conversion efficiency is a narrow major of overall modular performance, while energy yield produced is a more comprehensive and superior metric. Energy density, which is energy yield per meter square incorporates several other factors beyond efficiency alone. These other factors include temperature, humidity and shade tolerance. Cad tel technology has advantages in each of these areas over our multicrystalline competitors. 
As shown in the metric, our Q1 in the porter, lead line efficiency achieved clarity with multicrystalline silicon on an energy-density basis. In the space of only a month, our lead line has now achieved an energy density advantage to multicrystalline silicon. To put this achievement in perspective, when we first introduced this metric a year ago at our Analyst Day, we had a significant disadvantage. But in the space of a little over a year, we have now erased that deficit. 
During the remainder of 2015, while our lead line will improve only modestly, our overall fleet average efficiency will increase significantly as the improvements are rolled out across the fleet.
In coming years, we expect to further increase our relative advantage based on the strength of our technology roadmap. Compared to our prior energy density roadmap, our expectations of relative advantage in future years has been updated. The updates to the roadmap are primarily due to revised timing of our new technology implementations, which have been adjusted to minimize downtime from technology upgrades in order to maximize output, particularly in 2016.
Most importantly, the metric highlights the favorable competitive position we anticipate as we execute on our technology roadmap.
Given that all new module efficiency enhancements are not created equal, let me make a few points related to our 16.3% production lead line efficiency as it relates to recent crystalline silicon record modules.
First, crystalline silicon competitors typically calculate record efficiencies using the aperture area of the module. We calculate efficiency on a full area basis.
Our 16.3% efficiency announced today would equate to a 16.9% aperture area efficiency. Likewise, our 17% record module, which we announced last year, would be 17.5% on a similar aperture-area basis. It's also important to understand that our 16.9% aperture efficiency is in high-volume commercial production and not in laboratory. This new record also reflects materials and processes that are cost competitive and allow us to continue to lower our costs per watt. 
It is important to keep these facts in mind, and based on our technology achievements, we feel that we are well positioned to compete with any commercial crystalline silicon technology available.
Turning to Slide 5. Let me discuss our capacity and demand outlook for 2015. This slide, besides illustrating our production capacity for 2015, more importantly highlights the profound impact efficiency improvements have on output. 
Since 2013, the year our production levels were at a low point. Efficiency and throughput improvements have contributed to over 450 megawatts of capacity or the equivalent of 5 new lines. This is a key point to understand that our investment in efficiency improvements, not only improves our competitiveness, but also results in significant incremental capacity without building new factories. 
As a result of the improving competitiveness of our module and the continued demand we see ahead of the potential ITC step-down after 2016, we are ramping our factories to full utilization. Also, as we indicated previously, we are adding 2 additional lines at our Ohio location.
We have virtually sold out for 2015 and we're increasing our contracted volumes for next year. We expect to shift between 2.6 to 2.8 gigawatts for the year, including shipments to self-developed projects. 
In the first quarter, we have shipped 690 megawatts, a new record for a single quarter. We are encouraged by the continuing bookings momentum as highlighted on Slide 6. Total bookings for the first quarter of 2015 were 422 megawatts DC against shipments of 690 megawatts DC. In the month of April, we have booked an additional 483 megawatts. As a result, our ending outstanding bookings are now at 3.9 gigawatt DC, an increase of 200 megawatts from where we ended 2015.
Achieving a book-to-bill ratio of at least 1:1 remains our objective for the year, but it will be more challenging in 2015 as some inventory was carried over from the prior year due to minor delays in shipments to projects.
The single largest booking since our last earnings call was a modular plus agreement that we signed with Strata Solar for 300 megawatts DC of deliveries in 2016. Through this deal, we continued to strengthen our relationship with Strata as well as extend our leadership in the Southeastern United States. 
Also, in the South, we signed an EPC agreement to construct a 100-megawatt AC Solar project and in a separate transaction, signed a module plus agreement with Silicon Wrench to supply 17-megawatt DC on-site commercial and industrial solar power installation. 
This latter project highlights the value that First Solar technology provides for the growing number of commercial and industrial customers, peaking clean and affordable power. 
Internationally, we continue to make strides in India, where we booked another 75 megawatts AC of self-developed projects. This brings our captive project total in India to 200 megawatts AC and demonstrates the progress we are making in this rapidly growing market.
Finally, our utility-scale Solar development activities in Japan continue to progress as demonstrated by our first bookings this month. We expect to commence construction on our first round of projects under the mega Solar program in Q3 this year. 
While the cumulative volume of these initial projects is relatively small, it represents an important evolution from supplying modules to third parties in Japan to now successfully developing and realizing our own pipeline. It also demonstrates that our thin-film technology has achieved adoption and acceptance in this important market.
Turning to Slide 7. Our bookings in terms of expected revenue now stands at $7.6 billion, an increase of approximately $300 million compared to the beginning of the year. The balance increased primarily due to lower revenue recognized in the first quarter, resulting from constructing more projects on balance sheet.
While we don't provide details related to the gross margin on our bookings, we are seeing improving trends as we continue to lower our costs and see some stability in pricing. 
Turning to Slide 8, I will now cover our potential bookings opportunities, which have grown to 14 gigawatts DC, an increase of approximately 500 megawatts from the prior quarter.
Note also that the total potential bookings increased despite the strong year-to-date bookings. We are also pleased that the size of our mid- to late-stage opportunities has nearly doubled from the prior period to 3 gigawatts. This increases our confidence and our ability to hit our 1:1 book-to-bill ratio for the year.
Slide 9 shows the breakdown of demand by geography. Our opportunities set outside of North America stands at 8.3 gigawatts or 59% of the total. Our transition to sustainable markets outside the U.S. is gaining traction as we are increasingly seeing the results of our investments in developing regions. More than half of our mid- and late-stage opportunities are now in international markets.
Finally, as announced earlier today, we have entered into a strategic alliance with Caterpillar to provide integrated turnkey photovoltaic solutions for distributed generation micro-grid applications. As part of this announcement, First Solar will provide a pre-engineered solutions package, including our advanced module technology, which will be sold under the Cat brand and through Cat's dealer network. First Solar's technology, which will be combined with Caterpillar's generator sets and enter the storage offerings will initially be marketed in the Asia Pacific, Africa and Latin America regions, beginning in the second half of 2015.
Microgrids provide value to prime, power, diesel and gas customers by integrating renewable energy such as solar power with generator sets. The target of opportunity includes microgrids in the 1 to 2 megawatt range in locations such as mines or remote towns and villages. This alliance further highlights the ongoing global energy transition, where Solar's cross competitiveness allows it to complement conventional generation, and it's an exciting opportunity to continue First Solar's growth outside of our core utility-scale business. 
Now I'll turn it over to Mark who will provide details on our first quarter financial results and discuss guidance for the second quarter."

Production in the quarter was 540 megawatt DC, an increase of 6% from the prior quarter due to higher module efficiency and improved",1264,"Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon. Turning to Slide 12, I'll begin by discussing the first quarter operational performance. Production in the quarter was 540 megawatt DC, an increase of 6% from the prior quarter due to higher module efficiency and improved factory utilization. Production was 22% higher year-over-year due to the aforementioned factors and the restart of 4 manufacturing lines in Malaysia. Our factory capacity utilization was 87%, up 3 percentage points from the fourth quarter. The higher factory utilization in Q1 was primarily due to less downtime related to upgrades. 
In the first quarter, we -- the average conversion efficiency of our models was 14.7%, which is up 30 basis points quarter-over-quarter and 120 basis points higher year-over-year. 
Our best line averaged 15.6% efficiency during the quarter, and impressive increase of 80 basis points from the prior quarter and 140 basis points year-over-year. Also, as Jim indicated, our lead line continues to make remarkable progress as we are now running at 16.3% efficiency.
To put this in perspective, our module produced at our Malaysia facility at 16.3% efficiency has a cost per watt below $0.40, excluding sales-related costs. 
Turning to Slide 13, I'll discuss the P&L. Net sales for the first quarter were $469 million compared to sales of $1 billion last quarter. The lower net sales was due to constructing more projects on balance sheet, following our decision to pursue a YieldCo. In addition, the sale of Solar Gen in the prior quarter, a higher mix of module-only sales in Q1 and delays on several projects in the current quarter resulted in a sequential revenue decline. 
Relative to our expectations for the quarter, net sales were lower due to several factors. First, the sale of the partial interests in our last sale of Blackwell project did not close in the first quarter as anticipated due to delays in coordinating with utility to complete the required commissioning test. The sale will close in early April and will be reflected in our future results.
In addition, revenue on several system projects was impacted by a combination of permitting delays and the West Coast port strike. It's important to note that while these project issues resulted in a delay of revenue recognition in Q1, we anticipate recovering the revenue in earnings in the balance of the year. 
As we have communicated previously, our systems business can be lumpy from 1 quarter to the next. Therefore, it's important to look at the business through a lens that spans multiple quarters. As a percentage of total net sales, our systems revenue, which includes both our EPC revenue and Solar modules used in the systems projects was 78%, a decrease of 14 percentage points for the prior quarter. The higher mix of third-party module sales was primarily related to shipments to India and the aforementioned project delays. 
Gross margin in the first quarter was 8.3% compared to 30.6% in the fourth quarter. The lower gross margin is due to constructing more projects on balance sheet in preparation for YieldCo, unfavorable absorption of fixed costs against the lower sales volume, higher module-only sales and a higher mix of lower-margin system projects. 
In addition, the sale of Solar Gen in the prior quarter contributed to the sequential decline. 
First quarter operating expenses were approximately flat at $109 million. SG&A expenses were lower, but offset by an increase in start-up expense associated with restarting capacity. Also, note, Q1 operating expenses included approximately $4 million of expenses associated with the launch of 8point3 Energy Partners. 
The first quarter operating loss was $70 million compared to an operating income of $199 million in Q4. The decrease was due to sequentially lower sales and gross margin
The net loss in the first quarter was $62 million or $0.62 per fully diluted share compared to net income of $1.89 per fully diluted share for fourth quarter. 
Turning to Slide 14. I'll now discuss the balance sheet and cash flow summary. Cash and marketable securities decreased by $506 million to $1.5 billion. Our net cash position now stands at $1.2 billion, a decrease from $1.8 billion in the prior quarter. 
As indicated on last quarter's earnings call, the decrease in cash was expected as we are constructing several large projects on balance sheet and in conjunction with our YieldCo strategy. Increased construction activities and holding interest and assets on balance sheet ahead of our planned YieldCo IPO will continue through the second quarter of the year and place additional requirements on liquidity. 
Our net working capital, including the change in noncurrent project assets and excluding cash and marketable securities, increased by $516 million in the prior quarter. The increase is primarily due to an increase in project assets and related activities and an increase in accounts receivable. 
Though that increased from the prior quarter by $26 million to $243 million, the increase is related to additional drawdowns on project level debt associated with our Luz del Norte project in Chile, partially offset by scheduled payments on our Malaysian model. Cash flow used in operations was $418 million compared to cash flow from operations of $928 million in Q4. 
Free cash flow was a negative $466 million compared to a positive free cash flow of $858 million in the prior quarter. Capital expenditures totaled $55 million, a decrease of $18 million from the prior quarter. Depreciation for the quarter was $62 million, unchanged from the prior quarter.
Turning to Slide 15, I'll now discuss our guidance for the second quarter of 2015. As indicated on our last quarter's earnings call, given the announcement regarding the proposed YieldCo information, we are holding off of providing full year guidance until after 8point3 Energy Partners' IPO. 
So much of the first quarter, our expected financial results for Q2 will be influenced by constructing projects on balance sheet, a mix of lower-margin EPC projects and third-party module sales.
In the near term, this will continue to contribute to lower earnings as can be seen in our future guidance. In the second half of the year, we anticipated stronger financial results in the first half as we returned to a more normal course of business. Our abbreviated financial guidance for the second quarter is as follows: net sales in the range of $750 million to $850 million, earnings of $0.45 to $0.55 per fully diluted share. Cash used in operations expected to be between $250 million and $350 million.
Note, our earnings per share estimate includes a nonrecurring tax benefit of approximately $0.40. This week, we received a favorable ruling from the Malaysian tax authorities, which resulted in discrete Q2 tax benefits. 
Finally, one last point, relative to guidance. The Q2 earnings guidance does not reflect any potential impact to our financial results from the IPO of 8point3 Energy Partners should that incur in Q2. 
Turning to next slide, I'll summarize our progress during the past quarter. First, we continue to demonstrate impressive improvements in our technology. Our lead line average efficiency improved to 15.6% in the first quarter and is currently running at 16.3%, which creates a 3% energy density advantage relative to multicrystalline silicon.
Our improved competitiveness continues to be manifested in our new bookings. We have booked 905 megawatts DC so far to-date and with over 3 gigawatts of mid- to late-stage opportunities we are seeing continue strong momentum in our business. 
Finally, with the filing of the S1 for 8point3 Energy Partners, our plan for our joined YieldCo with Sun Power remains on track. 
With this, we conclude our prepared remarks and open the call for questions. Operator?"

So quite simply, having the lowest cost structure allows you to compete for business, capture that business at a more attractive margin than your competitors. It's a fairly straightforward analysis and formula. It also gives us pricing power to break up in new markets. It also gives us pricing power to trigger new demand. The overwhelming impact on continuing reduction of prices on a global basis is increasingly utilities and commercial and industrial customers are seeing solar power as an attractive value proposition simply on its own. In the U.S., you have utilities that are increasingly moving towards natural gas as a large portion of their generation fleet. As they do their forward resource planning, fuel diversity, generation diversity is an important part of the formula. When you look at the prevailing prices in the market today, which's dependent upon what region of the country can be from anywhere as low as $0.04 or just under that to as high as $0.06 a kilowatt hour. We may look at that on a flat basis for 20 years and compare that to additional natural gas exposure. Even at today's low gas prices, the general view is that make sense as a portion of our total generation mix. So what you've seen in terms of this fairly large explosion of demand in the Southeastern United States is a result of that calculus, is a result of the marketplace understanding where pricing has gotten to and recognizing the value that it represents. We are seeing the same thing internationally. Just as one example, Dubai, originally had planned to carry out 1-gigawatt program over 3- to 4-year time frame. The first phase of that program, they were so enamored of the pricing that they received, that they doubled the size of that ramp and have accelerated the remaining 1-gigawatt to this year. So the -- we clearly, both in the U.S. and elsewhere, we've reached a price point where as compared with other sources of generation, both just on an absolute cost basis on a -- absence of commodity price-risk basis and on a generation-diversity basis, it's a very attractive offering."

That sets the sort of the permitting and code requirements that you're going to have to meet. So I fully expect that on small utility-scale plants, let's say sub-20 megawatts in size, we're likely to see opportunities to contract volume well into 2016. On the very large multi-hundred megawatt projects, I would think that we are -- over the course of the second and third quarter of 2015, we're probably seeing the end of the opportunity to contract for those assets. And it'll be a pretty linear relationship in between those 2 extremes. So it all depends. Obviously permitting a facility in one of the counties close to population centers in California is a more daunting task than permitting a facility in rural West Texas. So there's a whole host of variables that are going to impact when that cutoff starts hitting in terms of the last opportunity to contract and complete the construction within the ITC deadline."

So we have yet to determine based off of the opportunity set that we have and the bookings for the first quarter, what the ultimate monetization will be and we will guide with that over time and make appropriate decision when it comes. The expense question is -- we've incurred more transactional expenses in Q1. As you can imagine, legal tax, accounting, other one-off type of transactions. We'll continue to incur those costs up until the IPO. Once the IPO launches, you shouldn't think of any incremental expenses being incurred by First Solar.

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2015 earnings call. Let me begin by providing a brief update on our prior announcement regarding our intent to form a joint YieldCo vehicle with SunPower. Since Our last earnings call, the 2 parties have filed a public S-1 registration statement with the SEC for an initial public offering of 8point3 Energy Partners. Completion of the IPO is still subject to market factors and regulatory approval, but we continue to move forward through the process. Again, we cannot say any more about the transaction at this time outside of what is in the public S-1 documents. Any questions on the subject in our Q&A session will be directed to the public S-1 filing for answers. 
Now for an update on our technology and manufacturing. Our module conversion efficiency continued to improve in the first quarter, with our full fleet averaging 14.7% efficiency, an improvement of 30 basis points from Q4. Our lead line efficiency averaged 15.6% for the quarter, an 80 basis point improvement quarter-over-quarter and 140 basis point improvement versus Q1 of '14. 
This improvement is the largest sequential and year-over-year increase in our lead line efficiency in the history of the company. Even more impressive is the recent performance of our lead line, which has reached a new milestone for module efficiency of 16.3%. This is truly a remarkable achievement, which demonstrates the ability of our research and manufacturing organizations to execute to our road map. 
By late Q3, we will have rolled out these latest improvement programs across the majority of our fleet.
Slide 4 provides an update to our energy density roadmap, which we first showed at our Analyst Day last year and puts into context the advances in our efficiency. As we've discussed in the past, conversion efficiency is a narrow measure of overall modular performance, while energy yield produced is a more comprehensive and superior metric. Energy density, which is energy yield per meter squared incorporates several other factors beyond efficiency alone. These other factors include temperature, humidity and shade tolerance. Cad tel technology has advantages in each of these areas over our multicrystalline competitors. 
As shown in the metric, our Q1 end of porter lead line efficiency achieved parity with multicrystalline silicon on an energy-density basis. In the space of only a month, our lead line has now achieved an energy density advantage to multicrystalline silicon. To put this achievement in perspective, when we first introduced this metric a year ago at our Analyst Day, we had a significant disadvantage. But in the space of a little over a year, we have now erased that deficit. 
During the remainder of 2015, while our lead line will improve only modestly, our overall fleet average efficiency will increase significantly as the improvements are rolled out across the fleet.
In coming years, we expect to further increase our relative advantage based on the strength of our technology roadmap. Compared to our prior energy density roadmap, our expectations of relative advantage in future years has been updated. The updates to the roadmap are primarily due to revised timing of our new technology implementations, which have been adjusted to minimize downtime from technology upgrades in order to maximize output, particularly in 2016.
Most importantly, the metric highlights the favorable competitive position we anticipate as we execute on our technology roadmap.
Given that all new module efficiency announcements are not created equal, let me make a few points related to our 16.3% production lead line efficiency as it relates to recent crystalline silicon record modules.
First, crystalline silicon competitors typically calculate record efficiencies using the aperture area of the module. We calculate efficiency on a full area basis.
Our 16.3% efficiency announced today would equate to a 16.9% aperture area efficiency. Likewise, our 17% record module, which we announced last year, would be 17.5% on a similar aperture-area basis. It's also important to understand that our 16.9% aperture efficiency is in high-volume commercial production and not in a laboratory. This new record also reflects materials and processes that are cost competitive and allow us to continue to lower our costs per watt. 
It is important to keep these facts in mind, and based on our technology achievements, we feel that we are well positioned to compete with any commercial crystalline silicon technology available.
Turning to Slide 5. Let me discuss our capacity and demand outlook for 2015. This slide, besides illustrating our production capacity for 2015, more importantly highlights the profound impact efficiency improvements have on output. 
Since 2013, the year our production levels were at a low point. Efficiency and throughput improvements have contributed to over 450 megawatts of capacity or the equivalent of 5 new lines. This is a key point to understand that our investment in efficiency improvements, not only improves our competitiveness, but also results in significant incremental capacity without building new factories. 
As a result of the improving competitiveness of our module and the continued demand we see ahead of the potential ITC step-down after 2016, we are ramping our factories to full utilization. Also, as we indicated previously, we are adding 2 additional lines at our Ohio location.
We have virtually sold out for 2015 and we're increasing our contracted volumes for next year. We expect to shift between 2.6 to 2.8 gigawatts for the year, including shipments to self-developed projects. 
In the first quarter, we have shipped 690 megawatts, a new record for a single quarter. We are encouraged by the continuing bookings momentum as highlighted on Slide 6. Total bookings for the first quarter of 2015 were 422 megawatts DC against shipments of 690 megawatts DC. In the month of April, we have booked an additional 483 megawatts. As a result, our ending outstanding bookings are now at 3.9 gigawatt DC, an increase of 200 megawatts from where we ended 2015.
Achieving a book-to-bill ratio of at least 1:1 remains our objective for the year, but it will be more challenging in 2015 as some inventory was carried over from the prior year due to minor delays in shipments to projects.
The single largest booking since our last earnings call was a Modules Plus agreement that we signed with Strata Solar for 300 megawatts DC of deliveries in 2016. Through this deal, we continue to strengthen our relationship with Strata as well as extend our leadership in the Southeastern United States. 
Also, in the South, we signed an EPC agreement to construct a 100-megawatt AC Solar project and in a separate transaction, signed a Modules Plus agreement with Silicon Wrench to supply 17-megawatt DC on-site commercial and industrial solar power installation. 
This latter project highlights the value that First Solar technology provides for the growing number of commercial and industrial customers seeking clean and affordable power. 
Internationally, we continue to make strides in India, where we booked another 75 megawatts AC of self-developed projects. This brings our captive project total in India to 200 megawatts AC and demonstrates the progress we are making in this rapidly growing market.
Finally, our utility-scale Solar development activities in Japan continue to progress as demonstrated by our first bookings this month. We expect to commence construction on our first round of projects under the mega Solar program in Q3 this year. 
While the cumulative volume of these initial projects is relatively small, it represents an important evolution from supplying modules to third parties in Japan to now successfully developing and realizing our own pipeline. It also demonstrates that our thin-film technology has achieved adoption and acceptance in this important market.
Turning to Slide 7. Our bookings in terms of expected revenue now stands at $7.6 billion, an increase of approximately $300 million compared to the beginning of the year. The balance increased primarily due to lower revenue recognized in the first quarter, resulting from constructing more projects on balance sheet.
While we don't provide details related to the gross margin on our bookings, we are seeing improving trends as we continue to lower our costs and see some stability in pricing. 
Turning to Slide 8, I will now cover our potential bookings opportunities, which have grown to 14 gigawatts DC, an increase of approximately 500 megawatts from the prior quarter.
Note also that the total potential bookings increased despite the strong year-to-date bookings. We are also pleased that the size of our mid- to late-stage opportunities has nearly doubled from the prior period to 3 gigawatts. This increases our confidence and our ability to hit our 1:1 book-to-bill ratio for the year.
Slide 9 shows the breakdown of demand by geography. Our opportunities set outside of North America stands at 8.3 gigawatts or 59% of the total. Our transition to sustainable markets outside the U.S. is gaining traction as we are increasingly seeing the results of our investments in developing regions. More than half of our mid- and late-stage opportunities are now in international markets.
Finally, as announced earlier today, we have entered into a strategic alliance with Caterpillar to provide integrated turnkey photovoltaic solutions for distributed generation micro-grid applications. As part of this announcement, First Solar will provide a pre-engineered solutions package, including our advanced module technology, which will be sold under the Cat brand and through Cat's dealer network. First Solar's technology, which will be combined with Caterpillar's generator sets and energy storage offerings will initially be marketed in the Asia Pacific, Africa and Latin America regions, beginning in the second half of 2015.
Microgrids provide value to prime power diesel and gas customers by integrating renewable energy such as solar power with generator sets. The target of opportunity includes microgrids in the 1 to 2 megawatt range in locations such as mines or remote towns and villages. This alliance further highlights the ongoing global energy transition, where Solar's cross competitiveness allows it to complement conventional generation, and it's an exciting opportunity to continue First Solar's growth outside of our core utility-scale business. 
Now I'll turn it over to Mark who will provide details on our first quarter financial results and discuss guidance for the second quarter."

Turning to Slide 12, I'll begin by discussing the first quarter operational performance. Production in the quarter was 540 megawatt DC, an increase of 6% from the prior quarter due to higher module efficiency and improved factory utilization. Production was 22% higher year-over-year due to the aforementioned factors and the restart of 4 manufacturing lines in Malaysia. Our factory capacity utilization was 87%, up 3 percentage points from the fourth quarter. The higher factory utilization in Q1 was primarily due to less downtime related to upgrades. 
In the first quarter, we -- the average conversion efficiency of our models was 14.7%, which is up 30 basis points quarter-over-quarter and 120 basis points higher year-over-year. 
Our best line averaged 15.6% efficiency during the quarter, an impressive increase of 80 basis points from the prior quarter and 140 basis points year-over-year. Also, as Jim indicated, our lead line continues to make remarkable progress as we are now running at 16.3% efficiency.
To put this in perspective, our module produced at our Malaysia facility at 16.3% efficiency has a cost per watt below $0.40, excluding sales-related costs. 
Turning to Slide 13, I'll discuss the P&L. Net sales for the first quarter were $469 million compared to sales of $1 billion last quarter. The lower net sales was due to constructing more projects on balance sheet, following our decision to pursue a YieldCo. In addition, the sale of Solar Gen in the prior quarter, a higher mix of module-only sales in Q1 and delays on several projects in the current quarter resulted in a sequential revenue decline. 
Relative to our expectations for the quarter, net sales were lower due to several factors. First, the sale of the partial interests in our Lost Hills of Blackwell project did not close in the first quarter as anticipated due to delays in coordinating with utility to complete the required commissioning test. The sale closed in early April and will be reflected in our future results.
In addition, revenue on several system projects was impacted by a combination of permitting delays and the West Coast port strike. It's important to note that while these project issues resulted in a delay of revenue recognition in Q1, we anticipate recovering the revenue in earnings in the balance of the year. 
As we have communicated previously, our systems business can be lumpy from 1 quarter to the next. Therefore, it's important to look at the business through a lens that spans multiple quarters. As a percentage of total net sales, our systems revenue, which includes both our EPC revenue and solar modules used in the systems projects was 78%, a decrease of 14 percentage points for the prior quarter. The higher mix of third-party module sales was primarily related to shipments to India and the aforementioned project delays. 
Gross margin in the first quarter was 8.3% compared to 30.6% in the fourth quarter. The lower gross margin is due to constructing more projects on balance sheet in preparation for YieldCo, unfavorable absorption of fixed costs against the lower sales volume, higher module-only sales and a higher mix of lower-margin system projects. 
In addition, the sale of Solar Gen in the prior quarter contributed to the sequential decline. 
First quarter operating expenses were approximately flat at $109 million. SG&A expenses were lower, but offset by an increase in start-up expense associated with restarting capacity. Also, note, Q1 operating expenses included approximately $4 million of expenses associated with the launch of 8point3 Energy Partners. 
The first quarter operating loss was $70 million compared to an operating income of $199 million in Q4. The decrease was due to sequentially lower sales and gross margin
The net loss in the first quarter was $62 million or $0.62 per fully diluted share compared to net income of $1.89 per fully diluted share for fourth quarter. 
Turning to Slide 14. I'll now discuss the balance sheet and cash flow summary. Cash and marketable securities decreased by $506 million to $1.5 billion. Our net cash position now stands at $1.2 billion, a decrease from $1.8 billion in the prior quarter. 
As indicated on last quarter's earnings call, the decrease in cash was expected as we are constructing several large projects on balance sheet and in conjunction with our YieldCo strategy. Increased construction activities and holding interest and assets on balance sheet ahead of our planned YieldCo IPO will continue through the second quarter of the year and place additional requirements on liquidity. 
Our net working capital, including the change in noncurrent project assets and excluding cash and marketable securities, increased by $516 million from the prior quarter. The increase is primarily due to an increase in project assets and related activities and an increase in accounts receivable. 
Total debt increased from the prior quarter by $26 million to $243 million, the increase is related to additional drawdowns on project level debt associated with our Luz del Norte project in Chile, partially offset by scheduled payments on our Malaysian loan. Cash flow used in operations was $418 million compared to cash flow from operations of $928 million in Q4. 
Free cash flow was a negative $466 million compared to a positive free cash flow of $858 million in the prior quarter. Capital expenditures totaled $55 million, a decrease of $18 million from the prior quarter. Depreciation for the quarter was $62 million, unchanged from the prior quarter.
Turning to Slide 15, I'll now discuss our guidance for the second quarter of 2015. As indicated on last quarter's earnings call, given the announcement regarding the proposed YieldCo information, we are holding off of providing full year guidance until after 8point3 Energy Partners' IPO. 
So much for the first quarter. Our expected financial results for Q2 will be influenced by constructing projects on balance sheet, a mix of lower-margin EPC projects and third-party module sales.
In the near term, this will continue to contribute to lower earnings as can be seen in our Q2 guidance. In the second half of the year, we anticipated stronger financial results in the first half as we returned to a more normal course of business. Our abbreviated financial guidance for the second quarter is as follows: net sales in the range of $750 million to $850 million, earnings of $0.45 to $0.55 per fully diluted share. Cash used in operations expected to be between $250 million and $350 million.
Note, our earnings per share estimate includes a nonrecurring tax benefit of approximately $0.40. This week, we received a favorable ruling from the Malaysian tax authorities, which resulted in discrete Q2 tax benefits. 
Finally, one last point, relative to guidance. The Q2 earnings guidance does not reflect any potential impact to our financial results from the IPO of 8point3 Energy Partners should that occur in Q2. 
Turning to next slide, I'll summarize our progress during the past quarter. First, we continue to demonstrate impressive improvements in our technology. Our lead line average efficiency improved to 15.6% in the first quarter and is currently running at 16.3%, which creates a 3% energy density advantage relative to multicrystalline silicon.
Our improved competitiveness continues to be manifested in our new bookings. We have booked 905 megawatts DC so far to-date and with over 3 gigawatts of mid- to late-stage opportunities we are seeing continue strong momentum in our business. 
Finally, with the filing of the S1 for 8point3 Energy Partners, our plan for our joined YieldCo with Sun Power remains on track. 
With this, we conclude our prepared remarks and open the call for questions. Operator?"

So quite simply, having the lowest cost structure allows you to compete for business, capture that business at a more attractive margin than your competitors. It's a fairly straightforward analysis and formula. It also gives us pricing power to break open new markets. It also gives us pricing power to trigger new demand. The overwhelming impact on continuing reduction of prices on a global basis is increasingly utilities and commercial and industrial customers are seeing solar power as an attractive value proposition simply on its own. In the U.S., you have utilities that are increasingly moving towards natural gas as a large portion of their generation fleet. As they do their forward resource planning, fuel diversity, generation diversity is an important part of the formula. When you look at the prevailing prices in the market today, which's dependent upon what region of the country can be from anywhere as low as $0.04 or just under that to as high as $0.06 a kilowatt hour. When they look at that on a flat basis for 20 years and compare that to additional natural gas exposure. Even at today's low gas prices, the general view is that makes sense as a portion of our total generation mix. So what you've seen in terms of this fairly large explosion of demand in the Southeastern United States is a result of that calculus, is a result of the marketplace understanding where pricing has gotten to and recognizing the value that it represents. 
We are seeing the same thing internationally. Just as one example, Dubai, originally had planned to carry out 1-gigawatt program over 3- to 4-year time frame. The first phase of that program, they were so enamored of the pricing that they received, that they doubled the size of that ramp and have accelerated the remaining 1-gigawatt to this year. So the -- we clearly, both in the U.S. and elsewhere, we've reached a price point where as compared with other sources of generation, both just on an absolute cost basis, on an absence of commodity price-risk basis and on a generation-diversity basis, it's a very attractive offering."

That sets the sort of the permitting and code requirements that you're going to have to meet. So I fully expect that on small utility-scale plants, let's say sub-20 megawatts in size, we're likely to see opportunities to contract volume well into 2016. On the very large multi-hundred megawatt projects, I would think that we are -- over the course of the second and third quarter of 2015, we're probably seeing the end of the opportunity to contract for those assets. And it'll be a pretty linear relationship in between those 2 extremes. So it all depends. Obviously permitting a facility in one of the counties close to population centers in California is a more daunting task than permitting a facility in rural West Texas. So there's a whole host of variables that are going to impact when that cutoff starts hitting in terms of the last opportunity to contract and complete the construction within the ITC deadline."

We'll continue to incur those costs up until the IPO. Once the IPO launches, you shouldn't think of any incremental expenses being incurred by First Solar. There will be expenses in management services agreements that will be provided to 8point3 Energy Partners, but those will be compensated appropriately by 8point3 Energy Partners."

We've got assets in Japan that we're developing and we'll be looking at those as well in terms of what is the right answer to do that. So what I would say is, it's given us significant optionality. It creates somewhat of a competitive tension so that others -- when we get into having to sell down an asset, there is a competitive tension and there's a fallback position in the negotiations which obviously is advantageous to us, because if we don't believe a market is willing to pay a proper returns for the value that they're getting from that asset, then we obviously have a different path to choose. So that optionality will be helpful in our negotiations. So I do see that we'll evolve over time. Again if you look at what we've included in the S1 is mainly U.S. assets, initially.

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2015 earnings call. Let me begin by providing a brief update on our prior announcement regarding our intent to form a joint YieldCo vehicle with SunPower. Since our last earnings call, the 2 parties have filed a public S-1 registration statement with the SEC for an initial public offering of 8point3 Energy Partners. Completion of the IPO is still subject to market factors and regulatory approval, but we continue to move forward through the process. Again, we cannot say any more about the transaction at this time outside of what is in the public S-1 documents. Any questions on the subject in our Q&A session will be directed to the public S-1 filing for answers. 
Now for an update on our technology and manufacturing. Our module conversion efficiency continued to improve in the first quarter, with our full fleet averaging 14.7% efficiency, an improvement of 30 basis points from Q4. Our lead line efficiency averaged 15.6% for the quarter, an 80 basis point improvement quarter-over-quarter and 140 basis point improvement versus Q1 of '14. 
This improvement is the largest sequential and year-over-year increase in our lead line efficiency in the history of the company. Even more impressive is the recent performance of our lead line, which has reached a new milestone for module efficiency of 16.3%. This is truly a remarkable achievement, which demonstrates the ability of our research and manufacturing organizations to execute to our road map. 
By late Q3, we will have rolled out these latest improvement programs across the majority of our fleet.
Slide 4 provides an update to our energy density roadmap, which we first showed at our Analyst Day last year and puts into context the advances in our efficiency. As we've discussed in the past, conversion efficiency is a narrow measure of overall modular performance, while energy yield produced is a more comprehensive and superior metric. Energy density, which is energy yield per meter squared incorporates several other factors beyond efficiency alone. These other factors include temperature, humidity and shade tolerance. Cad tel technology has advantages in each of these areas over our multicrystalline competitors. 
As shown in the metric, our Q1 end of porter lead line efficiency achieved parity with multicrystalline silicon on an energy-density basis. In the space of only a month, our lead line has now achieved an energy density advantage to multicrystalline silicon. To put this achievement in perspective, when we first introduced this metric a year ago at our Analyst Day, we had a significant disadvantage. But in the space of a little over a year, we have now erased that deficit. 
During the remainder of 2015, while our lead line will improve only modestly, our overall fleet average efficiency will increase significantly as the improvements are rolled out across the fleet.
In coming years, we expect to further increase our relative advantage based on the strength of our technology roadmap. Compared to our prior energy density roadmap, our expectations of relative advantage in future years has been updated. The updates to the roadmap are primarily due to revised timing of our new technology implementations, which have been adjusted to minimize downtime from technology upgrades in order to maximize output, particularly in 2016.
Most importantly, the metric highlights the favorable competitive position we anticipate as we execute on our technology roadmap.
Given that all new module efficiency announcements are not created equal, let me make a few points related to our 16.3% production lead line efficiency as it relates to recent crystalline silicon record modules.
First, crystalline silicon competitors typically calculate record efficiencies using the aperture area of the module. We calculate efficiency on a full area basis.
Our 16.3% efficiency announced today would equate to a 16.9% aperture area efficiency. Likewise, our 17% record module, which we announced last year, would be 17.5% on a similar aperture-area basis. It's also important to understand that our 16.9% aperture efficiency is in high-volume commercial production and not in a laboratory. This new record also reflects materials and processes that are cost competitive and allow us to continue to lower our costs per watt. 
It is important to keep these facts in mind, and based on our technology achievements, we feel that we are well positioned to compete with any commercial crystalline silicon technology available.
Turning to Slide 5. Let me discuss our capacity and demand outlook for 2015. This slide, besides illustrating our production capacity for 2015, more importantly highlights the profound impact efficiency improvements have on output. 
Since 2013, the year our production levels were at a low point. Efficiency and throughput improvements have contributed to over 450 megawatts of capacity or the equivalent of 5 new lines. This is a key point to understand that our investment in efficiency improvements, not only improves our competitiveness, but also results in significant incremental capacity without building new factories. 
As a result of the improving competitiveness of our module and the continued demand we see ahead of the potential ITC step-down after 2016, we are ramping our factories to full utilization. Also, as we indicated previously, we are adding 2 additional lines at our Ohio location.
We have virtually sold out for 2015 and we're increasing our contracted volumes for next year. We expect to shift between 2.6 to 2.8 gigawatts for the year, including shipments to self-developed projects. 
In the first quarter, we have shipped 690 megawatts, a new record for a single quarter. We are encouraged by the continuing bookings momentum as highlighted on Slide 6. Total bookings for the first quarter of 2015 were 422 megawatts DC against shipments of 690 megawatts DC. In the month of April, we have booked an additional 483 megawatts. As a result, our ending outstanding bookings are now at 3.9 gigawatt DC, an increase of 200 megawatts from where we ended 2015.
Achieving a book-to-bill ratio of at least 1:1 remains our objective for the year, but it will be more challenging in 2015 as some inventory was carried over from the prior year due to minor delays in shipments to projects.
The single largest booking since our last earnings call was a Modules Plus agreement that we signed with Strata Solar for 300 megawatts DC of deliveries in 2016. Through this deal, we continue to strengthen our relationship with Strata as well as extend our leadership in the Southeastern United States. 
Also, in the South, we signed an EPC agreement to construct a 100-megawatt AC Solar project and in a separate transaction, signed a Modules Plus agreement with Silicon Wrench to supply 17-megawatt DC on-site commercial and industrial solar power installation. 
This latter project highlights the value that First Solar technology provides for the growing number of commercial and industrial customers seeking clean and affordable power. 
Internationally, we continue to make strides in India, where we booked another 75 megawatts AC of self-developed projects. This brings our captive project total in India to 200 megawatts AC and demonstrates the progress we are making in this rapidly growing market.
Finally, our utility-scale Solar development activities in Japan continue to progress as demonstrated by our first bookings this month. We expect to commence construction on our first round of projects under the mega Solar program in Q3 this year. 
While the cumulative volume of these initial projects is relatively small, it represents an important evolution from supplying modules to third parties in Japan to now successfully developing and realizing our own pipeline. It also demonstrates that our thin-film technology has achieved adoption and acceptance in this important market.
Turning to Slide 7. Our bookings in terms of expected revenue now stands at $7.6 billion, an increase of approximately $300 million compared to the beginning of the year. The balance increased primarily due to lower revenue recognized in the first quarter, resulting from constructing more projects on balance sheet.
While we don't provide details related to the gross margin on our bookings, we are seeing improving trends as we continue to lower our costs and see some stability in pricing. 
Turning to Slide 8, I will now cover our potential bookings opportunities, which have grown to 14 gigawatts DC, an increase of approximately 500 megawatts from the prior quarter.
Note also that the total potential bookings increased despite the strong year-to-date bookings. We are also pleased that the size of our mid- to late-stage opportunities has nearly doubled from the prior period to 3 gigawatts. This increases our confidence and our ability to hit our 1:1 book-to-bill ratio for the year.
Slide 9 shows the breakdown of demand by geography. Our opportunities set outside of North America stands at 8.3 gigawatts or 59% of the total. Our transition to sustainable markets outside the U.S. is gaining traction as we are increasingly seeing the results of our investments in developing regions. More than half of our mid- and late-stage opportunities are now in international markets.
Finally, as announced earlier today, we have entered into a strategic alliance with Caterpillar to provide integrated turnkey photovoltaic solutions for distributed generation micro-grid applications. As part of this announcement, First Solar will provide a pre-engineered solutions package, including our advanced module technology, which will be sold under the Cat brand and through Cat's dealer network. First Solar's technology, which will be combined with Caterpillar's generator sets and energy storage offerings will initially be marketed in the Asia Pacific, Africa and Latin America regions, beginning in the second half of 2015.
Microgrids provide value to prime power diesel and gas customers by integrating renewable energy such as solar power with generator sets. The target of opportunity includes microgrids in the 1 to 2 megawatt range in locations such as mines or remote towns and villages. This alliance further highlights the ongoing global energy transition, where Solar's cross competitiveness allows it to complement conventional generation, and it's an exciting opportunity to continue First Solar's growth outside of our core utility-scale business. 
Now I'll turn it over to Mark who will provide details on our first quarter financial results and discuss guidance for the second quarter."

Turning to Slide 12, I'll begin by discussing the first quarter operational performance. Production in the quarter was 540 megawatt DC, an increase of 6% from the prior quarter due to higher module efficiency and improved",1262,"Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon. Turning to Slide 12, I'll begin by discussing the first quarter operational performance. Production in the quarter was 540 megawatt DC, an increase of 6% from the prior quarter due to higher module efficiency and improved factory utilization. Production was 22% higher year-over-year due to the aforementioned factors and the restart of 4 manufacturing lines in Malaysia. Our factory capacity utilization was 87%, up 3 percentage points from the fourth quarter. The higher factory utilization in Q1 was primarily due to less downtime related to upgrades. 
In the first quarter, we -- the average conversion efficiency of our models was 14.7%, which is up 30 basis points quarter-over-quarter and 120 basis points higher year-over-year. 
Our best line averaged 15.6% efficiency during the quarter, an impressive increase of 80 basis points from the prior quarter and 140 basis points year-over-year. Also, as Jim indicated, our lead line continues to make remarkable progress as we are now running at 16.3% efficiency.
To put this in perspective, our module produced at our Malaysia facility at 16.3% efficiency has a cost per watt below $0.40, excluding sales-related costs. 
Turning to Slide 13, I'll discuss the P&L. Net sales for the first quarter were $469 million compared to sales of $1 billion last quarter. The lower net sales was due to constructing more projects on balance sheet, following our decision to pursue a YieldCo. In addition, the sale of Solar Gen in the prior quarter, a higher mix of module-only sales in Q1 and delays on several projects in the current quarter resulted in a sequential revenue decline. 
Relative to our expectations for the quarter, net sales were lower due to several factors. First, the sale of the partial interests in our Lost Hills of Blackwell project did not close in the first quarter as anticipated due to delays in coordinating with utility to complete the required commissioning test. The sale closed in early April and will be reflected in our future results.
In addition, revenue on several system projects was impacted by a combination of permitting delays and the West Coast port strike. It's important to note that while these project issues resulted in a delay of revenue recognition in Q1, we anticipate recovering the revenue in earnings in the balance of the year. 
As we have communicated previously, our systems business can be lumpy from 1 quarter to the next. Therefore, it's important to look at the business through a lens that spans multiple quarters. As a percentage of total net sales, our systems revenue, which includes both our EPC revenue and solar modules used in the systems projects was 78%, a decrease of 14 percentage points for the prior quarter. The higher mix of third-party module sales was primarily related to shipments to India and the aforementioned project delays. 
Gross margin in the first quarter was 8.3% compared to 30.6% in the fourth quarter. The lower gross margin is due to constructing more projects on balance sheet in preparation for YieldCo, unfavorable absorption of fixed costs against the lower sales volume, higher module-only sales and a higher mix of lower-margin system projects. 
In addition, the sale of Solar Gen in the prior quarter contributed to the sequential decline. 
First quarter operating expenses were approximately flat at $109 million. SG&A expenses were lower, but offset by an increase in start-up expense associated with restarting capacity. Also, note, Q1 operating expenses included approximately $4 million of expenses associated with the launch of 8point3 Energy Partners. 
The first quarter operating loss was $70 million compared to an operating income of $199 million in Q4. The decrease was due to sequentially lower sales and gross margin
The net loss in the first quarter was $62 million or $0.62 per fully diluted share compared to net income of $1.89 per fully diluted share for fourth quarter. 
Turning to Slide 14. I'll now discuss the balance sheet and cash flow summary. Cash and marketable securities decreased by $506 million to $1.5 billion. Our net cash position now stands at $1.2 billion, a decrease from $1.8 billion in the prior quarter. 
As indicated on last quarter's earnings call, the decrease in cash was expected as we are constructing several large projects on balance sheet and in conjunction with our YieldCo strategy. Increased construction activities and holding interest and assets on balance sheet ahead of our planned YieldCo IPO will continue through the second quarter of the year and place additional requirements on liquidity. 
Our net working capital, including the change in noncurrent project assets and excluding cash and marketable securities, increased by $516 million from the prior quarter. The increase is primarily due to an increase in project assets and related activities and an increase in accounts receivable. 
Total debt increased from the prior quarter by $26 million to $243 million, the increase is related to additional drawdowns on project level debt associated with our Luz del Norte project in Chile, partially offset by scheduled payments on our Malaysian loan. Cash flow used in operations was $418 million compared to cash flow from operations of $928 million in Q4. 
Free cash flow was a negative $466 million compared to a positive free cash flow of $858 million in the prior quarter. Capital expenditures totaled $55 million, a decrease of $18 million from the prior quarter. Depreciation for the quarter was $62 million, unchanged from the prior quarter.
Turning to Slide 15, I'll now discuss our guidance for the second quarter of 2015. As indicated on last quarter's earnings call, given the announcement regarding the proposed YieldCo information, we are holding off of providing full year guidance until after 8point3 Energy Partners' IPO. 
So much for the first quarter. Our expected financial results for Q2 will be influenced by constructing projects on balance sheet, a mix of lower-margin EPC projects and third-party module sales.
In the near term, this will continue to contribute to lower earnings as can be seen in our Q2 guidance. In the second half of the year, we anticipated stronger financial results in the first half as we returned to a more normal course of business. Our abbreviated financial guidance for the second quarter is as follows: net sales in the range of $750 million to $850 million, earnings of $0.45 to $0.55 per fully diluted share. Cash used in operations expected to be between $250 million and $350 million.
Note, our earnings per share estimate includes a nonrecurring tax benefit of approximately $0.40. This week, we received a favorable ruling from the Malaysian tax authorities, which resulted in discrete Q2 tax benefits. 
Finally, one last point, relative to guidance. The Q2 earnings guidance does not reflect any potential impact to our financial results from the IPO of 8point3 Energy Partners should that occur in Q2. 
Turning to next slide, I'll summarize our progress during the past quarter. First, we continue to demonstrate impressive improvements in our technology. Our lead line average efficiency improved to 15.6% in the first quarter and is currently running at 16.3%, which creates a 3% energy density advantage relative to multicrystalline silicon.
Our improved competitiveness continues to be manifested in our new bookings. We have booked 905 megawatts DC so far to-date and with over 3 gigawatts of mid- to late-stage opportunities we are seeing continue strong momentum in our business. 
Finally, with the filing of the S1 for 8point3 Energy Partners, our plan for our joined YieldCo with Sun Power remains on track.

So quite simply, having the lowest cost structure allows you to compete for business, capture that business at a more attractive margin than your competitors. It's a fairly straightforward analysis and formula. It also gives us pricing power to break open new markets. It also gives us pricing power to trigger new demand. The overwhelming impact on continuing reduction of prices on a global basis is increasingly utilities and commercial and industrial customers are seeing solar power as an attractive value proposition simply on its own. In the U.S., you have utilities that are increasingly moving towards natural gas as a large portion of their generation fleet. As they do their forward resource planning, fuel diversity, generation diversity is an important part of the formula. When you look at the prevailing prices in the market today, which is dependent upon what region of the country can be from anywhere as low as $0.04 or just under that to as high as $0.06 a kilowatt hour. When they look at that on a flat basis for 20 years and compare that to additional natural gas exposure. Even at today's low gas prices, the general view is that makes sense as a portion of our total generation mix. So what you've seen in terms of this fairly large explosion of demand in the Southeastern United States is a result of that calculus, is a result of the marketplace understanding where pricing has gotten to and recognizing the value that it represents. 
We are seeing the same thing internationally. Just as one example, Dubai, originally had planned to carry out 1-gigawatt program over 3- to 4-year time frame. The first phase of that program, they were so enamored of the pricing that they received, that they doubled the size of that ramp and have accelerated the remaining 1-gigawatt to this year. So the -- we clearly, both in the U.S. and elsewhere, we've reached a price point where as compared with other sources of generation, both just on an absolute cost basis, on an absence of commodity price-risk basis and on a generation-diversity basis, it's a very attractive offering."

That sets the sort of the permitting and code requirements that you're going to have to meet. So I fully expect that on small utility-scale plants, let's say sub-20 megawatts in size, we're likely to see opportunities to contract volume well into 2016. On the very large multi-hundred megawatt projects, I would think that we are -- over the course of the second and third quarter of 2015, we're probably seeing the end of the opportunity to contract for those assets. And it'll be a pretty linear relationship in between those 2 extremes. So it all depends. Obviously permitting a facility in one of the counties close to population centers in California is a more daunting task than permitting a facility in rural West Texas. So there's a whole host of variables that are going to impact when that cutoff starts hitting in terms of the last opportunity to contract and complete the construction within the ITC deadline."

We could take a 100 megawatts of modules and sell them module-only at a very -- what looks like a very attractive gross margin. We can package those same modules into an engineering, procurement and construction contract that's at a much lower gross margin percentage but a much higher total gross margin dollars. And so it's very hard to look at our results in the aggregate and make a direct comparison to the other participants that are largely module-only sales as opposed to having a significant engineering, procurement and construction component."

That clearly could be a path that says that 8point3 is the best ultimate position of where we would want to monetize that asset. We've got assets in Japan that we're developing and we'll be looking at those as well in terms of what is the right answer to do that. So what I would say is, it's given us significant optionality. It creates somewhat of a competitive tension so that others -- when we get into having to sell down an asset, there is a competitive tension and there's a fallback position in the negotiations which obviously is advantageous to us, because if we don't believe a market is willing to pay a proper returns for the value that they're getting from that asset, then we obviously have a different path to choose. So that optionality will be helpful in our negotiations. So I do see that we'll evolve over time. Again if you look at what we've included in the S1 is mainly U.S. assets, initially. However, over time, I think you'll start to see some diversification into international markets."

This past quarter was marked with great execution across multiple aspects of our business. From the successful launch of 8point3 Energy Partners to the achievement of a new technology milestone and with strong financial results for the quarter, I am very pleased with the progress we are making. I want to recognize the tremendous efforts of the entire First Solar team to achieve these results.
Turning to Slide 4, I will discuss in more detail the benefits of the newly formed 8point3 Energy Partners, which we launched in conjunction with SunPower. The creation of this YieldCo vehicle benefits First Solar and its shareholders in several ways. First, it lowers our cost of capital even further. Next, ownership in 8point3 allows First Solar to retain a residual interest in high-quality solar assets while providing stable future cash flows through IDRs and dividends. Additionally, the creation of 8point3 provides another competitive buyer for our future projects. Lastly, the $284 million in proceeds received from 8point3 subsequent to the IPO provides capital for further investment in project development. Mark will discuss more details related to the specifics of the transaction later in the call.
We also achieved a significant milestone this past quarter related to our technology road map. As announced last month, First Solar achieved yet another new CdTe full-size module record of 18.6% aperture area conversion efficiency, which has been certified and recorded by NREL. This equates to a full area efficiency of 18.2%, which exceeds the record multicrystalline module full area conversion efficiency of approximately 17.7%. Our new module record demonstrates our ability to scale our research cell technologies to full production form factor and is indicative of future production capability we will be deploying in the coming few years. With this latest achievement, we are clearly demonstrating that our CdTe technology is both a high-efficiency and low-cost offering. We continue to see our ability to execute on our technology road map as a key strength and a differentiating factor between First Solar and the competition.
Slides 6 and 7 provide a slightly different view of our technology road map and the expected energy density advantage relative to multicrystalline silicon in the United States. While the energy density slides we have shown in the past have focused on a typical desert southwest environment, this map shows the advantages across the country. As a reminder, energy density takes into account not only module efficiency but also temperature, humidity and shade tolerance advantages inherent in our technology relative to multicrystalline silicon. As we transition from the end of 2015 to the end of 2017, we continue to expect that our module technology advantage over multicrystalline competitors will grow dramatically. As shown on Slide 7, our advantage is expected to be especially strong in the more humid and hot parts of the country. With 1.3 gigawatts of volume either supplied or under contract in the southeastern United States, we are already beginning to see the market appreciate the performance advantages of our technology.
Finally, while the maps shown are specific to the United States, the same fundamental energy density advantage is present internationally and especially in those hot and humid regions that are best suited to solar.
Turning to our current modules in production. Our fleet average efficiency improved in the second quarter to 15.4%, a 70 basis point improvement from the first quarter. Our lead line efficiency averaged 16.2% for the quarter, a 60 basis point improvement quarter-over-quarter and a remarkable 210 basis point improvement versus Q2 2014. The year-over-year increase in our lead line efficiency puts into perspective the astounding pace of our technological improvements. During the second half of 2015 and into 2016, efficiency improvements on our lead line will not be as dramatic as the first half of this year. This is due both to the need to prioritize full production utilization in 2016 as well as the timing of when new programs roll out. The efficiency improvements will accelerate again into 2017, as highlighted on the energy density map.
Lastly, we still expect to see significant improvement in our full fleet average during the second half of this year as our lead line technology is rolled out across our production fleet.
We are encouraged by the progress that we continue to see in our bookings as highlighted on Slide 8. Bookings for the first 2 quarters of the year now total 1.3 gigawatts DC against shipments of 1.3 gigawatts DC during the same time period. Since the end of Q2, we have contracted an additional 80 megawatts of volume to bring our year-to-date bookings to 1.4 gigawatts. We are pleased with our year-to-date bookings in our 1:1 book-to-bill ratio and have visibility into a large number of late-stage booking opportunities. As we indicated previously, we are sold out for the remainder of 2015. As we look to 2016, we have already contracted most of our available supply for the first half of the year. And based on a probabilistic analysis of our pipeline, we have only a few hundred megawatts of supply remaining for the entire year. This could lead to forgoing some bookings and pipeline opportunities due to supply constraints. We see this as a positive result of our improving module technology as well as the ongoing development of our global sales teams. Our recent bookings in late-stage opportunities that are in final negotiations highlight our strengths both in project development and in continued growth internationally. First, in the United States, we were awarded 100-megawatt PPA by NV Energy for our Playa project, which has a COD of 2016. This project award highlights both the competitiveness of solar power with conventional fuel sources and the strength of our cost-reduction road map. The project, as with other such awards, is subject to final approval by the State Public Utility Commission. In addition, we expect to sign in the near future PPAs for several additional projects totaling hundreds of megawatts. While we are not able to discuss these in full detail today, the CODs on these projects are several years in the future. The delivery timing for these projects is a strong indication that solar power will remain an important part of the energy mix for utilities in the future, irrespective of the ITC expiration. We also see this as a positive indication of how our efficiency and cost road map positions us to have an extremely competitive product offering for projects with COD several years away.
As we continue to execute on our road maps, we expect to be in a situation where we can capture a significant share of the market opportunity. Lastly, each of these projects are candidates for an eventual drop-down 8point3.
Internationally, we had tremendous success during the quarter, as highlighted by the signing of our largest non-U.S. module supply agreement for a single project in the history of the company. We have signed an agreement with Aqua Power and TSK to supply 200 megawatts AC of modules to the second phase of the Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum Solar Park in Dubai. This brings our total of completed or contracted projects to over 260 megawatts [ph] AC in the Middle East region and further strengthens the leadership role we are establishing in this key growth market. In addition, the selection of First Solar technology highlights the competitive advantages of our CdTe technology in hot climates in locations with adverse soiling conditions.
In Honduras, we are nearing completion of a 26-megawatt AC power plant that we are constructing for Grupo Terra. Central America is an emerging region for solar power, and this project represents a sign of progress and a growing region for solar. Elsewhere, we added additional bookings in other international locations such as India, Turkey and Japan.
Turning to Slide 9. Our bookings in terms of expected revenue now stands at $7 billion compared to $7.3 billion at the beginning of the year. The decrease is primarily a result of the higher mix of module or module plus deals in our year-to-date bookings.
Turning to Slide 10. I will now cover our potential bookings opportunities, which have further increased to 16.7 gigawatts DC, an increase of approximately 2.7 gigawatts from the prior quarter. Despite over 500 megawatts of bookings, our late-stage opportunities stayed flat at about 3 gigawatts, with the increase coming from early-stage projects. Nearly half of our late-stage opportunities, which we define as projects with a greater than 50% likelihood of converting to a booking, are on international projects.
On Slide 11, we are providing an update for potential bookings opportunities by geography. Our opportunity set outside of North America increased significantly to 10.4 gigawatts or 62% of the total. The latest growth in bookings opportunities since the prior quarter are from the Latin America, India and the Middle East regions. These developments are encouraging signs of our efforts to diversify outside of the U.S.
Turning to Slide 12. We have recently announced some internal organization changes in support of our new Vision 2020 strategy. Vision 2012 is a long-term road map to achieve significant growth objectives and further establish our technology and cost leadership. As part of the strategy, we will focus on key geographic regions that have a market-driven need for utility-scale solar power and where we can compete effectively with fossil fuel generation sources. Executing this plan will require prioritizing global market opportunities based on our core strength and allocating resources appropriately. While we have more details of our Vision 2020 at a later date, I do want to address some of the leadership changes that have occurred in support of this plan. First, we have appointed George Anson as president U.S. and Joe Kishkill as President International. This organizational change will improve our focus on key markets while driving sales growth. Joe will also take on new responsibilities as he joins me and Mark Widmar as members of the newly formed Office of the CEO. The Office of the CEO has been created to facilitate a distributed decision-making architecture for the company. While Mark will also take on additional responsibilities, his role as CFO remains unchanged. As a result of George moving to the U.S. leadership role, Tymen De Jong will assume the role of Chief Operating Officer. Tymen has already been an instrumental part of implementing the technology improvements across our module manufacturing operations, and he will now be able to leverage his experience to achieving even greater cost improvements across all of our operation and execution functions. Tim Rebhorn has been named Senior Vice President, Corporate Development and strategic marketing, with responsibility for competitive positioning of our products and services, institutional development and management of global key account relationships. Lastly, Raffi Garabedian will now report directly to me, and his role as CTO is unchanged. I am very confident that these changes will better align the organization in order to further drive sales and operational excellence.
Finally, as an update, our next Analyst Day will be in 2016. We will provide more specifics around the timing later this year. 
Now I'll turn it over to Mark, who will provide detail on our second quarter financial results and discuss guidance for 2015."

Let me begin on Slide 14 by discussing our second quarter operational performance. Production in the quarter was 563-megawatt DC, an increase of 4% from the prior quarter due to higher module efficiency and increased manufacturing capacity. Production was 26% higher year-over-year due primarily to the restart of manufacturing lines, higher efficiency and new capacity. Our factory capacity utilization declined by 2 percentage points from the first quarter to 85% due to an increase in upgrade activities across the fleet.
As Jim noted, our second quarter average module efficiency for our entire fleet was 15.4%, an increase of 70 basis points quarter-over-quarter and 140 basis points higher year-over-year. Our baseline averaged 16.2% efficiency during the quarter, an increase of 60 basis points from the prior quarter and 210 basis points year-over-year. Putting the year-over-year improvement into perspective, the 210 basis points improvement results in a 15% increase in nameplate watts per module. We are pleased with the rollout of our new module technology across the entire fleet, and we expect the fleet average to approach the best line efficiency later this year.
I'll now turn to Slide 15 to discuss the P&L. Net sales in the second quarter were $896 million, nearly double the prior quarter sales of $469 million. The sharply higher sales resulted primarily from the sale of our majority interest in the North Star and Lost Hills project to the company as well as increased revenue recognized from our Silver State South project. Note that Silver State South revenue recognition is on a percentage of completion basis, while North Star and Lost Hills were sold to Southern near the end of construction, resulting in nearly all of the revenue recognized in Q2. Overall, construction activity and revenue recognition was higher across various EPC projects, which was primarily -- partially offset by lower third-party module sales. As a percent of total sales, our systems revenue, which includes both our EPC revenue and solar modules used in our assistance projects was 98%, an increase of 20 percentage points from the prior quarter. Note, module plus sales, which include the modules in addition to other components such as mounting structures, is a growing part of our business and is included in our systems revenue. Modules Plus revenue totaled approximately $100 million in the second quarter. The decrease in third-party module sales reflects lower shipments to India as compared to the prior quarter.
Gross margin in the second quarter was 18.4% compared to 8.3% in the first quarter. The improved gross margin percent benefited from higher volume and improved sales mix led by the sale of majority interest in Lost Hills and North Star. In addition, gross margin improved from cost reductions across multiple systems projects.
Operating expenses for the second quarter, which includes plant start-up, decreased sequentially by $2 million to $107 million. The decrease was driven by lower R&D expenses, partially offset by higher SG&A expenses associated with higher project development spending that was not able to be capitalized against these project. In Q2, operating expenses included an additional $4 million of expenses associated with the launch of 8point3.
The Second quarter operating profit was $57 million compared to an operating loss of $70 million Q1. The increase in profit was due to higher sales and improved gross margin. There was an overall tax benefit of $33 million in the quarter. This primarily resulted from a $42 million anticipated discrete tax benefit associated with a favorable ruling from a foreign tax authority, which we noted in the last quarter's earning call and included in our guidance for the quarter.
Net income in the second quarter was $94 million or $0.93 per fully diluted share compared to a net loss of $0.62 in the prior quarter. Relative to our guidance for the quarter, our actual earnings were above the high end of our EPS range primarily due to strong cost savings across multiple domestic and international projects. In addition, the percentage of completion of our solar project was higher than forecasted for the quarter, resulting in additional revenue in earnings.
Turning to Slide 16. I'll now discuss the balance sheet and cash flow summary. Cash and marketable securities increased by $291 million to $1.8 billion. Our net cash position now stands at $1.5 billion, an increase from $1.2 billion in the prior quarter. The increase in cash in the quarter resulted from the sale of majority interest in North Star and Lost Hills as well as the $284 million received from the 8point3 IPO. Our net working capital, including changes in non-current project assets and excluding cash and marketable securities, increased slightly by $28 million from the prior quarter. Deferred project cost decreased from the prior quarter due to the North Star and Lost Hills sale, but was offset by an increase in non-current project assets related to projects under construction. Stateline [indiscernible] and Luz Del Norte, which were respectively 26%, 32% and 72% completed at the end of the second quarter, are the major projects that fall into the non-current project asset category. Total debt increased from the prior quarter by $57 million to $300 million. Increase is from an additional draw-down on the project that was associated with our Luz del Norte project in Chile, partially offset by scheduled payments on the related debt.
Cash flow used in operations was $17 million compared to cash flow used in operations of $418 million in Q1. Of the $284 million cash received from 8point3, $239 million was treated as investing proceeds and $45 million was treated as financing proceeds.
Free cash flow was a negative $47 million compared to negative free cash flow of $466 million in the prior quarter. Capital expenditures totaled approximately $39 million, a decrease of $17 million from the prior quarter. Depreciation from the quarter was $63 million, [ph] a slight increase from the prior quarter.
Now turning to Slide 17. I will now address the current impact to First Solar's financials in the second quarter related to the 8point3 IPO transaction. As part of initial portfolio, First Solar contributed 4 projects in return for 31% ownership interest in 8point3. Products contributed included minority interest in Solar Gen, Lost Hills and North Star along with 100% interest of Marilyn Solar. Note for clarity and as a reminder, when the sale of the majority interest in Solar Gen, Lost Hills and North Star occurred, these transactions were recognized through the P&L as revenue cost of sales and gross margin. Specific to Marilyn Solar, the project was leased back to 8point3 in order to preserve the ITC benefit to First Solar and was accounted for a financing transaction due to our continued involvement in that project. Subsequent to the IPO, First Solar received $284 million in cash from 8point3, again approximately $239 million of this amount was accounted towards reduction of First Solar's investment in 8point3, and the remaining $45 million associated with Marilyn Solar was recorded in other liabilities. This should be noted that this transaction was treated as a contribution of assets and return towards equity interest and there was not any -- there was no P&L impact during quarter. Additionally in Q2, First Solar did not receive any earnings related to our 31% ownership share in 8point3 or any future 8point3 earnings were recognized in equity and earnings in our P&L.
Next, let me address the accounting for future drop-downs of assets to 8point3. Note that we do not plan to drop any additional assets to 8point3 during the remainder of this year, but we wanted to provide some guidance on the subject. First, it's important to understand that the GAAP accounting will vary depending on the specific structure of each transaction. However, in general, when we sell an interest in one of our projects to 8point3, there will be a P&L impact. The impact could be to revenue and gross margin or could be to a gain, depending on the timing and circumstances of that transaction. The key point to remember is that while the classification on the P&L may vary, the bottom line's earnings impact is comparable in either situation. In the future, we also sell projects to 8point3 the traditional advice equity structure. In these situations, the accounting may take an even different form. In the case where we do have different accounting arrangements in future drop-downs, we will evaluate what measures are necessary to provide clarity to the investors. Generally, regardless of the structure of the drop-down, the economic substance of the transaction, which is what is most meaningful is the same. We will monetize 100% of the value of the project, either through, a, a sale of the majority interest to a third-party and minority interest to 8point3; or b, through the sale of class attributes to the tax equity partner and the residual value to 8point3. Regarding the project portion sold to 8point3, our expectation, or at least the initial drop-downs is that we will receive 100% of the value of cash from 8point3. Over time, this might change, and the consideration may be a combination of cash and 8point3 shares.
Turning to Slide 18. I will discuss our full year 2015 guidance. First, we expect net sales in the range of $3.5 billion to $3.6 million. As a percentage of our total revenue for the year, we expect systems revenue, which includes both EPC and Solar modules used in our systems projects in the range of 90% to 95%. Next, we expect gross margin in the range of 21% to 22%. This implies a higher gross margin than second half of the year as compared to the first. This is a result of both a favorable mix of systems projects and continuing module and BoS cost improvements. Operating expenses, including plant start-up, are expected to range between $415 million and $425 million. As a reminder, the full year guidance includes a 8point3 transactional [indiscernible] expenses of $8 million, which we incurred in the first half of the year. Our projected effective tax rate is between 2% to 5%. Note that this rate incorporates the $42 million discrete tax benefit recorded in the second quarter results. Excluding this benefit, the tax rate would be approximately 12 percentage points higher. Earnings per share are expected to be between $3.30 and $3.60 per fully diluted share. Included in the earnings per share is approximately $0.16 [ph] of equity and earnings, net of tax, which is comprised mainly of our First Solar ownership interest in 8point3. Our net cash balance is projected to range between $1.2 billion and $1.4 billion. In the second half of the year, we do expect to raise project level debt for the construction of foreign assets in India and Japan. The loan balance to construct the project is also anticipated to increase by year-end. As a result, we expect the year-end total debt to be approximately $400 million.
Capital expenditures are expected to be between $175 million to $200 million. Working capital increase from the end of June 2014 is projected at $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion. The large increase in working capital for the year is a result of continuing the construction projects on balance sheet, primarily in support of the 8point3 identified projects. In addition, it's on emerging markets where we are constructing development assets. We may be required to hold projects on balance sheet, even after construction is completed.
Lastly, we expect shipments to range between 2.8 and 2.9 gigawatts for the full year. And regardless of the guidance for the second half of the year, we anticipate a higher percentage of the remaining revenue and earnings to fall in the third quarter of the year as a result of the timing of expected project sales. It should also be noted that our guidance for the remainder of the year does not include any further drop-down of assets to 8point3.
Moving on to Slide 19. We'll provide some of the parked valuation framework to illustrate how our view of how the investor community should consider value for Solar following the YieldCo launch. First, we see our core business continuing to be valued on EPS multiple or discounted cash flow basis. The stronger guidance for this year, one of the largest contracted pipelines in the industry and rapid technology improvements, we continue to see this as a growth engine of our business.
Next, we have in our $1.5 billion of net cash, which equates to approximately $15 per share as of Q2. Further, we have the value of 8point3 to First Solar through our 31% ownership interest. Finally, our VP ownership in 8point3 should be taken into consideration through future rights and IDRs.
Turning to the next light. I will summarize our progress during this past quarter. First, we believe strong -- we delivered strong financial results for the quarter with sales of $896 million, gross margin of over 18% and earnings of $0.93 per share. Our balance sheet remains strong with a net cash balance of $1.5 billion, and our recent amendment and extension of our revolving credit agreement, which has been increased by $600 million to $700 million with a maturity date of July 2018.

As I said in my comments, we're rapidly approaching a point where we don't have a lot to sell into '16. That doesn't mean we lose the opportunity great value. What we found over the cour",694,"So first, let's talk a bit about what we see going into '16 and '17. As I said in my comments, we're rapidly approaching a point where we don't have a lot to sell into '16. That doesn't mean we lose the opportunity great value. What we found over the course of '15 is that as we get into a fully allocated position, we begin to identify opportunities to move volume around, projects around and change timing and optimize the value creation out of the full production capability of the fleet. So '16, I think as we roll through the next couple of quarters, we will -- we'll book the remainder of the year and then we'll spend a lot of the following year optimizing the deliveries and optimizing the timing of our projects. The final resolution of ITC, and specifically the construction language for ITC, could throw some curveballs at the industry and cause everybody to really look at timing of projects and timing of deliveries, but we'll just deal with those issues as they play out in Washington, D.C. As for 2017, we've got a fairly good book of business post 2016. It is still early. Our sort of -- as we come to understand the rhythm and timing of the industry, we're still probably a couple of quarters away from when projects that are slated for 2017 will begin to aggressively engage on their module and EPC acquisition process. So I think we'll begin to get some visibility. I think our view, as we've stated before, is there will be some softness, some significant softness in the U.S. market. I don't think it disappears to a 0, but it will clearly be softer than in 2016. The effect of the expiration of the ITC has clearly been to accelerate demand from '17 into '16 on the North American front. Having said that, there's no impact on international demand as a result of the ITC. So all of our growing activity outside the U.S. continues to build on the solid base that we have, and we expect that, that will grow on a fairly nice basis through to 2017. As you all may have noticed over the last couple of years, some markets, India in particular, the bookings in that market tend to come very close to deliveries. We don't have a lot of advance visibility. I mean, we can predict based on the programs and our customers' activities, but in terms of them coming in as an actual booking, they tend to come relatively close to deliveries. So we're still a ways away from beginning to reflect that activity in our books. Some of the other markets are looking promising, but it's still a little too early to be able to tell. But generally, we expect a little bit of softness in North America, but we think we're going to see good activity elsewhere in the world. On the technology road map, there's been some recent commentary that is almost like a déjà vu. I feel like I've been magically transported back to 2012 and reading about abating cost advantage, et cetera. I have absolutely no idea then where the commentary is coming from. The modules that we are producing today are higher efficiency, higher quality and lower cost than I think we've ever produced. And as we laid out and showed everybody over the last 2 or 3 years in analyst days, we have a committed technology road map that we continue to deliver on. The -- we have occasionally made adjustments to that road map, but they're primarily to accommodate our need to produce product, they're not because we had any sort of difficulty at any point in converting our technology road map into actual production and performance of the product. So we are as confident today as we have ever been in terms of our ability to compete in the marketplace. And I think the gross margins we're seeing out of all aspects of our business reflect the impact of that technology in the marketplace. So I don't know, Mark, if you have anything you want to add."

So we basically said at 16.3%, 16.2%, the cost of the module was below $0.40 a watt, okay? we also just said that we now have a new module that's certified north of 18%. As we indicated, the 200 basis points improvement that we saw year-on-year from our lead line represents an increase of 15% watts per nameplate label capacity, right? So when you take that all into consideration in our efficiency road map is in such a way that we are able to drive to a higher efficiency and it every -- it scales the cost down, so it's not incremental to the cost structure of the module on a cost-per-watt basis. So it's hard for me to get my head around how that can all translate into it a disadvantage. We're being below $0.40 a watt today and having a road map to get us north of 18% just on a pure cost base, I can't see how that can create a disadvantage. And then when you couple that with the slide that we're showing on an energy density that we're 18-plus percent advantage in some parts of the U.S. on an energy basis in 2017, the combination of higher energy and lower cost, I don't know how conclude otherwise that we have an advantage."

As we said when we were on the road show is we clearly looking at this as a sustainable long-term vehicle that positions us for success and in particular, trying to make sure that we're positioning ourself for success beyond the 2016 horizon in the U.S. And we believe we've done that by putting together an IPO portfolio that in effect enables us to deliver against the growth through 2018 time frame. Now we also said in the road show that we left ourselves some significant degrees of freedom to make decisions over time if rates did increase or environment change. We could look at the growth rate. We could look at the payout ratio. We could look at the leverage. So we'll continue to evaluate all of those levers and try to make an informed decision to what makes the most sense to enable both First Solar and SunPower business model. It's -- as you can tell by the recent announcements for both by SunPower and First Solar, we've continued both be successful in the marketplace not only with PUD dates in the 2016 horizon, which both of us won 100 megawatts within the energy with CODs in 2016. But as Jim indicated, we're we are in negotiations with opportunities for hundreds of megawatts that sit beyond the 2016 horizon, which is a combination of an enabling the strength of 8point3 with our advantage technology road map, we'll continue to position us to gain share in the horizon and when we do that, we'll make a decision around what's the right way to monetize those assets.

The comments around the utilization and the sold out and the $0.40, we got to put all that in perspective. We effectively are running adjusted for downtime to realize upgrades that we need to do to drive those efficiency improvements. We are affecting their running full out right now. We have no real available capacity. We have some discretionary capacity as it relates to the timing of doing the upgrade, and that's why you will see not this year, we're going to continue to roll out the fleet, the lead line efficiency across the entire fleet. But as we enter into 2016, we're making some informed decisions to delay some of the road map enhancements in order to capture as much utilization as we can, given the current demand profile. So it's one of those things. It's a delicate balance. You have to look at where you have with efficiency road map, where you are from the relative competitiveness and while we do believe, obviously, the significant manages that will gain us will continue to roll out a road map, but as we look at it today and it demonstrated in the slide we presented during the discussion today, is that at our current 16-type-percent efficiency as we exit '15, will be advantaged in a number of key markets and so now we've captured the advantage in trying to make sure that we can monetize that efficiently in the '16 and limit the amount of downtime. So you'll see a little bit of delay in the road map, and you'll see more of that activity happening in '17. So again, it's a delicate balance between what we want to for utilization, how do we think that the efficiency road map and where we are relative competitiveness of our technology at that point in time."

I just think it requires thoughtful analysis and dialogue, and I think that the resource planning process, combined with the political process, are kind of tied up in trying to figure those types of things out. And I -- to be honest, don't spend a ton of my time focused on it. We certainly have people within the organization that do, but I wouldn't feel comfortable providing a lot of commentary. On the IDC, there's been a lot of activity and discussion in Washington. As everybody knows, the fact that we are now in the heat of the 2016 presidential race, kind of leads as at a difficult time in terms of making progress and issues that require a lot of bipartisan support. There has been a lot of dialogue in the Senate about conforming the ITC to the same standard applies to the PTC and providing commence construction determination for solar projects or to allow alternatively -- alternatively to allow the solar projects to proceed under the same part as wind, which the net effect of that would actually be the same thing. The House has not taken it up specifically. It would be unlikely to be included in any House legislation. It would get resolved to the extent a tax package moves ahead later this year in conference, and I am -- do not consider myself enough of an expert that I can provide much insight into what the results of that -- of those conference associations would be. I will tell you that there's lots of effort in activity on part of the industry and what we're really seeking with Solar specifically seeking is a glide -- a smooth glide path with no sharp alterations in policy. We're not focused on long-term extensions of the ITC. We're just focus on trying to create a smooth transition and that's where most of our effort is, but I'm not one to provide a lot of prognostication as to what's going to happen or not going to happen in Washington."

This past quarter was marked with great execution across multiple aspects of our business. From the successful launch of 8point3 Energy Partners to the achievement of a new technology milestone and with strong financial results for the quarter, I am very pleased with the progress we are making. I want to recognize the tremendous efforts of the entire First Solar team to achieve these results.
Turning to Slide 4. I will discuss in more detail the benefits of the newly formed 8point3 Energy Partners, which we launched in conjunction with SunPower. The creation of this YieldCo vehicle benefits First Solar and its shareholders in several ways. First, it lowers our cost of capital even further. Next, ownership in 8point3 allows First Solar to retain a residual interest in high-quality solar assets while providing stable future cash flows through IDR rise in dividends. Additionally, the creation of 8point3 provides another competitive buyer for our future projects. Lastly, the $284 million in proceeds received from 8point3, subsequent to the IPO, provides capital for further investment in project development. Mark will discuss more details related to the specifics of the transaction later in the call.
We also achieved a significant milestone this past quarter related to our technology road map. As announced last month, First Solar achieved yet another new cad tel full-size module record of 18.6% aperture area conversion efficiency, which has been certified and recorded by NREL. This equates to a full area efficiency of 18.2%, which exceeds the record multicrystalline PERC module full area conversion efficiency of approximately 17.7%. Our new module record demonstrates our ability to scale our research cell technologies to full production form factor and is indicative of future production capability we will be deploying in the coming few years.
With this latest achievement, we are clearly demonstrating that our cad tel technology is both a high-efficiency and low-cost offering. We continue to see our ability to execute on our technology road map as a key strength and a differentiating factor between First Solar and the competition.
Slides 6 and 7 provide a slightly different view of our technology road map and the expected energy density advantage relative to multicrystalline silicon in the United States. While the energy density slides we have shown in the past have focused on a typical desert southwest environment, this map shows the advantages across the country. As a reminder, energy density takes into account not only module efficiency but also temperature, humidity and shade tolerance advantages inherent in our technology relative to multicrystalline silicon. As we transition from the end of 2015 to the end of 2017, we continue to expect that our module technology advantage over multicrystalline competitors will grow dramatically.
As shown on Slide 7, our advantage is expected to be especially strong in the more humid and hot parts of the country. With 1.3 gigawatts of volume, either supplied or under contract, in the southeastern United States, we are already beginning to see the market appreciate the performance advantages of our technology.
Finally, while the maps shown are specific to the United States, the same fundamental energy density advantage is present internationally and especially in those hot and humid regions that are best suited to solar.
Turning to our current modules in production. Our fleet average efficiency improved in the second quarter to 15.4%, a 70 basis point improvement from the first quarter. Our lead line efficiency averaged 16.2% for the quarter, a 60 basis point improvement quarter-over-quarter and a remarkable 210 basis point improvement versus Q2 2014. The year-over-year increase in our lead line efficiency puts into perspective the astounding pace of our technological improvements.
During the second half of 2015 and into 2016, efficiency improvements on our lead line will not be as dramatic as the first half of this year. This is due both to the need to prioritize full production utilization in 2016 as well as the timing of when new programs roll out. The efficiency improvements will accelerate again into 2017, as highlighted on the energy density map. Lastly, we still expect to see significant improvement in our full fleet average during the second half of this year as our lead line technology is rolled out across our production fleet.
We are encouraged by the progress that we continue to see in our bookings as highlighted on Slide 8. Bookings for the first 2 quarters of the year now total 1.3 gigawatts DC against shipments of 1.3 gigawatts DC during the same time period. Since the end of Q2, we have contracted an additional 80 megawatts of volume to bring our year-to-date bookings to 1.4 gigawatts. We are pleased with our year-to-date bookings in our 1:1 book-to-bill ratio and have visibility into a large number of late-stage booking opportunities.
As we indicated previously, we are sold out for the remainder of 2015. As we look to 2016, we have already contracted most of our available supply for the first half of the year. And based on a probabilistic analysis of our pipeline, we have only a few hundred megawatts of supply remaining for the entire year. This could lead to forgoing some bookings and pipeline opportunities due to supply constraints. We see this as a positive result of our improving module technology as well as the ongoing development of our global sales teams.
Our recent bookings in late-stage opportunities that are in final negotiations highlight our strengths both in project development and in continued growth internationally. First, in the United States, we were awarded 100-megawatt PPA by NV Energy for our Playa project, which has a COD of 2016. This project award highlights both the competitiveness of solar power with conventional fuel sources and the strength of our cost-reduction road map. The project, as with other such awards, is subject to final approval by the state public utility commission.
In addition, we expect to sign in the near future PPAs for several additional projects totaling hundreds of megawatts. While we are not able to discuss these in full detail today, the CODs on these projects are several years in the future. The delivery timing for these projects is a strong indication that solar power will remain an important part of the energy mix for utilities in the future, irrespective of the ITC expiration. We also see this as a positive indication of how our efficiency and cost road map positions us to have an extremely competitive product offering for projects with COD several years away.
As we continue to execute on our road maps, we expect to be in a situation where we can capture a significant share of the market opportunity. Lastly, each of these projects are candidates for an eventual drop-down to 8point3.
Internationally, we had tremendous success during the quarter, as highlighted by the signing of our largest non-U.S. module supply agreement for a single project in the history of the company. We have signed an agreement with ACWA Power and TSK to supply 200 megawatts AC of modules to the second phase of the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park in Dubai. This brings our total of completed or contracted projects to over 260 megawatts AC in the Middle East region and further strengthens the leadership role we are establishing in this key growth market. In addition, the selection of First Solar technology highlights the competitive advantages of our cad tel technology in hot climates and locations with adverse soiling conditions.
In Honduras, we are nearing completion of a 26-megawatt AC power plant that we are constructing for Grupo Terra. Central America is an emerging region for solar power, and this project represents a sign of progress in a growing region for solar. Elsewhere, we added additional bookings in other international locations such as India, Turkey and Japan.
Turning to Slide 9. Our bookings in terms of expected revenue now stands at $7 billion compared to $7.3 billion at the beginning of the year. The decrease is primarily a result of the higher mix of module or module plus deals in our year-to-date bookings.
Turning to Slide 10. I will now cover our potential bookings opportunities, which have further increased to 16.7 gigawatts DC, an increase of approximately 2.7 gigawatts from the prior quarter. Despite over 500 megawatts of bookings, our late-stage opportunities stayed flat at about 3 gigawatts, with the increase coming from early-stage projects. Nearly half of our late-stage opportunities, which we define as projects with a greater than 50% likelihood of converting to a booking, are international projects.
On Slide 11, we are providing an update to our potential bookings opportunities by geography. Our opportunities set outside of North America increased significantly to 10.4 gigawatts or 62% of the total. The latest growth in bookings opportunities, since the prior quarter, are from the Latin America, India and the Middle East regions. These developments are encouraging signs of our efforts to diversify outside of the U.S.
Turning to Slide 12. We have recently announced some internal organization changes in support of our new Vision 2020 strategy. Vision 2020 is a long-term road map to achieve significant growth objectives and further establish our technology and cost leadership. As part of the strategy, we will focus on key geographic regions that have a market-driven need for utility-scale solar power and where we can compete effectively with fossil fuel generation sources. Executing this plan will require prioritizing global market opportunities based on our core strengths and allocating resources appropriately. While we have more details of our Vision 2020 at a later date, I do want to address some of the leadership changes that have occurred in support of this plan.
First, we have appointed Georges Antoun as President – U.S. and Joe Kishkill as President – International. This organizational change will improve our focus on key markets while driving sales growth. Joe will also take on new responsibilities as he joins me and Mark Widmar as members of the newly formed Office of the CEO. The Office of the CEO has been created to facilitate a distributed decision-making architecture for the company. While Mark will also take on additional responsibilities, his role as CFO remains unchanged.
As a result of Georges moving to the U.S. leadership role, Tymen De Jong will assume the role of Chief Operating Officer. Tymen has already been an instrumental part of implementing the technology improvements across our module manufacturing operations, and he will now be able to leverage his experience to achieving even greater cost improvements across all of our operation and execution functions.
Tim Rebhorn has been named Senior Vice President, Corporate Development and Strategic Marketing, with responsibility for competitive positioning of our products and services, institutional development and management of global key account relationships. Lastly, Raffi Garabedian will now report directly to me, and his role as CTO is unchanged. I am very confident that these changes will better align the organization in order to further drive sales and operational excellence.
Finally, as an update, our next Analyst Day will be in 2016. We will provide more specifics around the timing later this year. 
Now I'll turn it over to Mark, who will provide detail on our second quarter financial results and discuss guidance for 2015."

Let me begin on Slide 14 by discussing our second quarter operational performance.

Let me begin on Slide 14 by discussing our second quarter operational performance. Production in the quarter was 563 megawatts DC, an increase of 4% from the prior quarter due to higher module efficiency and increased manufacturing capacity. Production was 26% higher year-over-year due primarily to the restart of manufacturing lines, higher efficiency and new capacity. Our factory capacity utilization declined by 2 percentage points from the first quarter to 85% due to an increase in upgrade activities across the fleet.
As Jim noted, our second quarter average module efficiency for our entire fleet was 15.4%, an increase of 70 basis points quarter-over-quarter and 140 basis points higher year-over-year. Our best line averaged 16.2% efficiency during the quarter, an increase of 60 basis points from the prior quarter and 210 basis points year-over-year. Putting the year-over-year improvement into perspective, the 210 basis points improvement results in a 15% increase in nameplate watts per module. We are pleased with the rollout of our new module technology across the entire fleet, and we expect the fleet average to approach the best line efficiency later this year.
I'll now turn to Slide 15 to discuss the P&L. Net sales in the second quarter were $896 million, nearly double the prior quarter sales of $469 million. The sharply higher sales resulted primarily from the sale of our majority interest in the North Star and Lost Hills project due to Southern Company, as well as increased revenue recognized from our Silver State South project. Note that Silver State South revenue recognition is on a percentage of completion basis, while North Star and Lost Hills were sold to Southern near the end of construction, resulting in nearly all of the revenue recognized in Q2. Overall, construction activity and revenue recognition was higher across various EPC projects, which was primarily -- partially offset by lower third-party module sales.
As a percent of total sales, our systems revenue, which includes both our EPC revenue and solar modules used in our systems projects, was 98%, an increase of 20 percentage points from the prior quarter. Note, Modules Plus sales, which include the modules in addition to other components, such as mounting structures, is a growing part of our business and is included in our systems revenue. Modules Plus revenue totaled approximately $100 million in the second quarter. The decrease in third-party module sales reflects lower shipments to India as compared to the prior quarter.
Gross margin in the second quarter was 18.4% compared to 8.3% in the first quarter. The improved gross margin percent benefited from higher volume and improved sales mix led by the sale of majority interest in Lost Hills and North Star. In addition, gross margin improved from cost reductions across multiple systems projects.
Operating expenses for the second quarter, which includes plant start-up, decreased sequentially by $2 million to $107 million. The decrease was driven by lower R&D expenses, partially offset by higher SG&A expenses associated with higher project development spending that was not able to be capitalized against projects. In Q2, operating expenses included an additional $4 million of expenses associated with the launch of 8point3.
The second quarter operating profit was $57 million compared to an operating loss of $70 million Q1. The increase in profit was due to higher sales and improved gross margin. There was an overall tax benefit of $33 million in the quarter. This primarily resulted from a $42 million anticipated discrete tax benefit associated with a favorable ruling from a foreign tax authority, which we noted in the last quarter's earning call and included in our guidance for the quarter.
Net income in the second quarter was $94 million or $0.93 per fully diluted share compared to a net loss of $0.62 in the prior quarter. Relative to our guidance for the quarter, our actual earnings were above the high end of our EPS range primarily due to strong cost savings across multiple domestic and international projects. In addition, the percentage of completion on our Silver State South project was higher than forecasted for the quarter, resulting in additional revenue in earnings.
Turning to Slide 16. I'll now discuss the balance sheet and cash flow summary. Cash and marketable securities increased by $291 million to $1.8 billion. Our net cash position now stands at $1.5 billion, an increase from $1.2 billion in the prior quarter. The increase in cash in the quarter resulted from the sale of majority interest in North Star and Lost Hills as well as the $284 million received from the 8point3 IPO. Our net working capital, including changes in noncurrent project assets and excluding cash and marketable securities, increased slightly by $28 million from the prior quarter. Deferred project costs decreased from the prior quarter due to the North Star and Lost Hills sale, but was offset by increase in noncurrent project assets related to projects under construction. Stateline, Moapa and Luz del Norte, which were respectively 26%, 32% and 72% completed at the end of the second quarter, are the major projects that fall into the noncurrent project asset category.
Total debt increased from the prior quarter by $57 million to $300 million. Increase is from an additional draw-down on the project level debt associated with our Luz del Norte project in Chile, partially offset by scheduled payments on our Malaysian debt.
Cash flow used in operations was $17 million compared to cash flow used in operations of $418 million in Q1. Of the $284 million cash received from 8point3, $239 million was treated as investing proceeds and $45 million was treated as financing proceeds.
Free cash flow was a negative $47 million compared to negative free cash flow of $466 million in the prior quarter. Capital expenditures totaled approximately $39 million, a decrease of $17 million from the prior quarter. Depreciation from the quarter was $63 million, a slight increase from the prior quarter.
Now turning to Slide 17. I will now address the accounting impact to First Solar's financials in the second quarter related to the 8point3 IPO transaction. As part of initial portfolio, First Solar contributed 4 projects in return for a 31% ownership interest in 8point3. Products contributed included minority interest in Solar Gen, Lost Hills and North Star along with 100% interest of Maryland Solar.
Note for clarity and as a reminder, when the sale of the majority interest in Solar Gen, Lost Hills and North Star occurred, these transactions were recognized through the P&L as revenue cost of sales and gross margin. Specific to Maryland Solar, the project was leased back to 8point3 in order to preserve the ITC benefit to First Solar and was accounted for as a financing transaction due to our continued involvement in that project.
Subsequent to the IPO, First Solar received $284 million in cash from 8point3, again approximately $239 million of this amount was accounted for a reduction of First Solar's investment in 8point3, and the remaining $45 million associated with Maryland Solar was recorded in other liabilities. This should be noted that this transaction was treated as a contribution of assets and return toward equity interest, and there was not any -- there was no P&L impact during the quarter. Additionally, in Q2, First Solar did not receive any earnings related to our 31% ownership share in 8point3 or any future 8point3 earnings we recognized in equity and earnings in our P&L.
Next, let me address the accounting for future drop-downs of assets to 8point3. Note that we do not plan to drop any additional assets to 8point3 during the remainder of this year, but we wanted to provide some guidance on this subject. First, it is important to understand that the GAAP accounting will vary depending on the specific structure of each transaction. However, in general, when we sell an interest in one of our projects to 8point3, there will be a P&L impact. The impact could be to revenue and gross margin or it could be to a gain, depending on the timing and circumstances of that transaction. The key point to remember is that while the classification on the P&L may vary, the bottom line's earnings impact is comparable in either situation.
In the future, we may also sell projects to 8point3 that follow a traditional path equity structure. In these situations, the accounting may take an even different form. In the case where we do have different accounting arrangements on future drop-downs, we will evaluate what measures are necessary to provide clarity to the investors.
Generally, regardless of the structure of the drop-down, the economic substance of the transaction, which is what is most meaningful is the same. We will monetize 100% of the value of the project either through, a, a sale of the majority interest to a third-party and the minority interest to 8point3; or b, through a sale of path attributes to the path equity partner and the residual value to 8point3.
Regarding the project portion sold to 8point3, our expectation, or at least the initial drop-downs is that we will receive 100% of the value of cash from 8point3. Over time, this might change, and the consideration may be a combination of cash and 8point3 shares.
Turning to Slide 18. I will discuss our full year 2015 guidance. First, we expect net sales in the range of $3.5 billion to $3.6 million. As a percentage of our total revenue for the year, we expect systems revenue, which includes both EPC and solar modules used in our systems projects, in the range of 90% to 95%. Next, we expect gross margin in the range of 21% to 22%. This implies a higher gross margins in the second half of the year as compared to the first. This is a result of both a favorable mix of systems projects and continuing module and BoS cost improvements.
Operating expenses, including plant start-up, are expected to range between $415 million and $425 million. As a reminder, the full year guidance includes 8point3 transactional-related expenses of $8 million, which we incurred in the first half of the year. Our projected effective tax rate is between 2% to 5%. Note that this rate incorporates the $42 million discrete tax benefit recorded in the second quarter results. Excluding this benefit, the tax rate would be approximately 12 percentage points higher.
Earnings per share is expected to be between $3.30 and $3.60 per fully diluted share. Included in the earnings per share is approximately $0.16 of equity in earnings, net of tax, which is comprised mainly of our First Solar ownership interest in 8point3. Our net cash balance is projected to range between $1.2 billion and $1.4 billion. In the second half of the year, we do expect to raise project level debt for the construction of our foreign assets in India and Japan. The loan balance to construct our Luz del Norte project is also anticipated to increase by year-end. As a result, we expect our year-end total debt to be approximately $400 million.
Capital expenditures are expected to be between $175 million and $200 million. Working capital increase from the end of June 2014 is projected at $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion. The large increase in working capital for the year is a result of continuing the construction projects on balance sheet, primarily in support of the 8point3 identified ROFO projects. In addition, there's some emerging markets where we have constructing development assets we may be required to hold projects on balance sheet, even after construction is completed.
Lastly, we expect shipments to range between 2.8 and 2.9 gigawatts for the full year. In regards to the guidance for the second half of the year, we anticipate a higher percentage of the remaining revenue and earnings to fall in the third quarter of the year as a result of the timing of expected project sales. It should also be noted that our guidance for the remainder of the year does not include any further drop-down of assets to 8point3.
Moving on to Slide 19. We'll provide the sum of the parts valuation framework to illustrate how our view of how the investor community should consider valuing First Solar following the YieldCo launch. First, we see our core business continuing to be valued on an EPS multiple or discounted cash flow basis. The stronger guidance for this year, one of the largest contracted pipelines in the industry and rapid technology improvements, we continue to see this as a growth engine of our business.
Next, we add in our $1.5 billion of net cash, which equates to approximately $15 per share as of Q2. Further, we add the value of 8point3 to First Solar through our 31% ownership interest. Finally, our DP ownership in an 8point3 should be taken in consideration through future rights to IDRs.
Turning to the next slide. I will summarize our progress during this past quarter. First, we believe strong -- we delivered strong financial results for the quarter with sales of $896 million, gross margin of over 18% and earnings of $0.93 per share. Our balance sheet remains strong with a net cash balance of $1.5 billion, and our recent amendment and extension of our revolving credit agreement, which has been increased from $600 million to $700 million with a maturity date of July 2018. The high end of our guidance ranges $3.6 billion of revenue and $3.60 of earnings per share. Our technology continues to improve rapidly with our record module of 18.6% aperture area conversion efficiency. Our pipeline continues to grow with 1.4 gigawatt of year-to-date booking in several projects in late-stage negotiation. Our potential bookings now stand at 16.7 gigawatts with 3 gigawatts of mid- to late-stage opportunities. Lastly, we successfully launched 8point3 Energy Partners in conjunction with SunPower.
With this, we've concluded our prepared remarks and open the call for questions. Operator?"

As I said in my comments, we're rapidly approaching a point where we don't have a lot to sell in '16. That doesn't mean we lose the opportunity to create value. What we've found over the",697,"So first, let's talk a bit about what we see going into '16 and '17. As I said in my comments, we're rapidly approaching a point where we don't have a lot to sell in '16. That doesn't mean we lose the opportunity to create value. What we've found over the course of '15 is that as we get into a fully allocated position, we begin to identify opportunities to move volume around, move projects around, change timing and optimize the value creation out of the full production capability of the fleet. So '16, I think, as we roll through the next couple of quarters, we will -- we'll book the remainder of the year, and then we'll spend a lot of the following year optimizing the deliveries and optimizing the timing of our projects. The final resolution of ITC, and specifically the commence construction language for ITC could throw some curveballs at the industry and cause everybody to really look at timing of projects and timing of deliveries, but we'll just deal with those issues as they play out in Washington, D.C. As for 2017, we've got a fairly good book of business post 2016. It is still early. Our sort of -- as we come to understand the rhythm and timing of the industry, we're still probably a couple of quarters away from when projects that are slated for 2017 will begin to aggressively engage on their module and EPC acquisition process. So I think we'll begin to get some visibility. I think our view, as we've stated before, is there will be some softness, some significant softness in the U.S. market. I don't think it disappears to a 0, but it will clearly be softer than in 2016. The effect of the expiration of the ITC has clearly been to accelerate demand from '17 into '16 on the North American front. Having said that, there's no impact on international demand as a result of the ITC. So all of our growing activity outside the U.S. continues to build on the solid base that we have, and we expect that, that will grow on a fairly nice basis through to 2017. As you all may have noticed over the last couple of years, some markets, India in particular, the bookings in that market tend to come very close to deliveries. We don't have a lot of advance visibility. I mean, we can predict based on the programs and our customers' activities, but in terms of them coming in as an actual booking, they tend to come relatively close to the deliveries. So we're still a ways away from beginning to reflect that activity in our books. Some of the other markets are looking promising, but it's still a little too early to be able to tell. But generally, we expect a little bit of softness in North America, but we think we're going to see good activity elsewhere in the world. On the technology road map, there's been some recent commentary that is almost like a déjà vu. I feel like I've been magically transported back to 2012 and reading about abating cost advantage, et cetera. I have absolutely no idea, Ben, where that commentary is coming from. The modules that we are producing today are higher efficiency, higher quality and lower cost than I think we've ever produced. And as we laid out and showed everybody over the last 2 or 3 years in Analyst Days, we have a committed technology road map that we continue to deliver on. The -- we have occasionally made adjustments to that road map, but they're primarily to accommodate our need to produce product, they're not because we've had any sort of difficulty at any point in converting our technology road map into actual production and performance of the product. So we are as confident today as we have ever been in terms of our ability to compete in the marketplace. And I think the gross margins we're seeing out of all aspects of our business reflect the impact of that technology in the marketplace. So I don't know, Mark, if you have anything you want to add."

We said with our lead line at that point in time north of 16% that we were -- our cost per module was -- for those products were below $0.40 a watt, right? So we basically said at 16.3%, 16.2%, the cost of the module was below $0.40 a watt, okay? We also did say that we now have a new module that's certified of north of 18%. As we indicated, the 200 basis points improvement that we saw year-on-year from our lead line represents an increase of 15% watts per nameplate label capacity, right? So when you take that all into consideration, and our efficiency road map is in such a way that we're able to drive to a higher efficiency in every -- it scales the cost down. So it's not incremental to the cost structure of the module on a cost per watt basis. So it's hard for me to get my head around how that can all translate into it a disadvantage. We're being below $0.40 a watt today and having a road map to get us north of 18% just on a pure cost basis, I can't see how that can create disadvantage. And then when you couple that with the slide that we're showing on our energy density that we're 18-plus percent advantage in some parts of the U.S. on an energy basis in 2017, the combination of the two, the higher energy and lower cost, I don't know how you conclude otherwise that we have an advantage."

As we said when we were on the road show is, we clearly looking at a sustainable long-term vehicle that positions us for success, and in particular, we're trying to make sure that we're positioning ourself for success beyond the 2016 horizon in the U.S. And we believe we've done that by putting together an ROFO and an IPO portfolio that effectively enables us to deliver against the growth through 2018 time frame. Now we also said on the road show that we left ourselves significant degrees of freedom to make decisions over time, if rates did increase or environment change. We could look at the growth rate, we could look at the payout ratio, we could look at the leverage. So we'll continue to evaluate all of those levers and try to make then informed decision to what makes the most sense to enable both First Solar and SunPower's business model. It's -- as you can tell by the recent announcements for both by SunPower and First Solar, we continued both to be successful in the marketplace not only with PUD dates and the 2016 horizon, which both of us won 100 megawatts within the energy with CODs in 2016. But as Jim indicated, we're in negotiations with opportunities for hundreds of megawatts that sit beyond the 2016 horizon, which is a combination of enabling the strength of 8point3 with our advantage technology road map, we'll continue to position us to gain share in that horizon. And when we do that, we'll make a decision around what's the right way to monetize those assets.

We effectively are running adjusted for downtime to realize upgrades that we need to do to drive those efficiency improvements. We effectively are running full out right now.

But as we enter into 2016, we are making some informed decisions to delay some of the road map enhancements in order to capture as much utilization as we can, given the current demand profile. So it's one of those things. It's a delicate balance. You have to look at where are you at with the efficiency road map, where you are from your relative competitiveness, and while we do believe, obviously, there's significant advantages that we'll gain as we continue to roll out our road map, but as we look at it today and then demonstrated in the slide that we presented during the discussion today, is that at our current 16-type-percent efficiency as we exit '15, we'll be advantaged in a number of key markets and so now we've captured the advantage and we're trying to make sure that we can monetize that efficiently in the '16 and limit the amount of downtime. So you'll see a little bit of a delay in the road map, and you'll see more of that activity happening in '17.

And I -- to be honest, I don't spend a ton of my time focused on it. We certainly have people within the organization that do, but I wouldn't feel comfortable providing a lot of commentary. On the ITC, there has been a lot of activity and a lot of discussion in Washington. As everybody knows, the fact that we are now in the heat of the 2016 presidential race kind of leaves us at a difficult time in terms of making progress on issues that require a lot of bipartisan support. There has been a lot of dialogue in the Senate about conforming the ITC to the same standard that applies to the PTC and providing commence construction determination for solar projects or to allow -- alternatively to allow the solar projects to proceed under the same part as wind, which the net effect of that would actually be the same thing. The House has not taken it up specifically. It would be unlikely to be included in any House legislation. It wouldn't get resolved to the extent a tax package moves ahead later this year in conference, and I am -- do not consider myself enough of an expert that I can provide much insight into what the results of that -- of those conference negotiations would be. I will tell you that there's lots of effort and activity on part of the industry and what we're really seeking -- what First Solar is specifically seeking is a glide -- a smooth glide path with no sharp alterations in policy. We're not focused on long-term extensions of the ITC. We're just focus on trying to create a smooth transition and that's where most of our effort is, but I'm not one to provide a lot of prognostication as to what's going to happen or not going to happen in Washington."

This past quarter was marked with great execution across multiple aspects of our business. From the successful launch of 8point3 Energy Partners to the achievement of a new technology milestone and with strong financial results for the quarter, I am very pleased with the progress we are making. I want to recognize the tremendous efforts of the entire First Solar team to achieve these results.
Turning to Slide 4. I will discuss in more detail the benefits of the newly formed 8point3 Energy Partners, which we launched in conjunction with SunPower. The creation of this YieldCo vehicle benefits First Solar and its shareholders in several ways. First, it lowers our cost of capital even further. Next, ownership in 8point3 allows First Solar to retain a residual interest in high-quality solar assets while providing stable future cash flows through IDR rights in dividends. Additionally, the creation of 8point3 provides another competitive buyer for our future projects. Lastly, the $284 million in proceeds received from 8point3, subsequent to the IPO, provides capital for further investment in project development. Mark will discuss more details related to the specifics of the transaction later in the call.
We also achieved a significant milestone this past quarter related to our technology road map. As announced last month, First Solar achieved yet another new cad tel full-size module record of 18.6% aperture area conversion efficiency, which has been certified and recorded by NREL. This equates to a full area efficiency of 18.2%, which exceeds the record multicrystalline PERC module full area conversion efficiency of approximately 17.7%. Our new module record demonstrates our ability to scale our research cell technologies to full production form factor and is indicative of future production capability we will be deploying in the coming few years.
With this latest achievement, we are clearly demonstrating that our cad tel technology is both a high-efficiency and low-cost offering. We continue to see our ability to execute on our technology road map as a key strength and a differentiating factor between First Solar and the competition.
Slides 6 and 7 provide a slightly different view of our technology road map and the expected energy density advantage relative to multicrystalline silicon in the United States. While the energy density slides we have shown in the past have focused on a typical desert southwest environment, this map shows the advantages across the country. As a reminder, energy density takes into account not only module efficiency but also temperature, humidity and shade tolerance advantages inherent in our technology relative to multicrystalline silicon. As we transition from the end of 2015 to the end of 2017, we continue to expect that our module technology advantage over multicrystalline competitors will grow dramatically.
As shown on Slide 7, our advantage is expected to be especially strong in the more humid and hot parts of the country. With 1.3 gigawatts of volume, either supplied or under contract in the southeastern United States, we are already beginning to see the market appreciate the performance advantages of our technology.
Finally, while the maps shown are specific to the United States, the same fundamental energy density advantage is present internationally and especially in those hot and humid regions that are best suited to solar.
Turning to our current modules in production. Our fleet average efficiency improved in the second quarter to 15.4%, a 70 basis point improvement from the first quarter. Our lead line efficiency averaged 16.2% for the quarter, a 60 basis point improvement quarter-over-quarter and a remarkable 210 basis point improvement versus Q2 2014. The year-over-year increase in our lead line efficiency puts into perspective the astounding pace of our technological improvements.
During the second half of 2015 and into 2016, efficiency improvements on our lead line will not be as dramatic as the first half of this year. This is due both to the need to prioritize full production utilization in 2016 as well as the timing of when new programs roll out. The efficiency improvements will accelerate again into 2017, as highlighted on the energy density map. Lastly, we still expect to see significant improvement in our full fleet average during the second half of this year as our lead line technology is rolled out across our production fleet.
We are encouraged by the progress that we continue to see in our bookings as highlighted on Slide 8. Bookings for the first 2 quarters of the year now total 1.3 gigawatts DC against shipments of 1.3 gigawatts DC during the same time period. Since the end of Q2, we have contracted an additional 80 megawatts of volume to bring our year-to-date bookings to 1.4 gigawatts. We are pleased with our year-to-date bookings in our 1:1 book-to-bill ratio and have visibility into a large number of late-stage booking opportunities.
As we indicated previously, we are sold out for the remainder of 2015. As we look to 2016, we have already contracted most of our available supply for the first half of the year. And based on a probabilistic analysis of our pipeline, we have only a few hundred megawatts of supply remaining for the entire year. This could lead to forgoing some bookings and pipeline opportunities due to supply constraints. We see this as a positive result of our improving module technology as well as the ongoing development of our global sales teams.
Our recent bookings in late-stage opportunities that are in final negotiations highlight our strengths both in project development and in continued growth internationally. First, in the United States, we were awarded 100-megawatt PPA by NV Energy for our Playa project, which has a COD of 2016. This project award highlights both the competitiveness of solar power with conventional fuel sources and the strength of our cost-reduction road map. The project, as with other such awards, is subject to final approval by the state public utility commission.
In addition, we expect to sign in the near future PPAs for several additional projects totaling hundreds of megawatts. While we are not able to discuss these in full detail today, the CODs on these projects are several years in the future. The delivery timing for these projects is a strong indication that solar power will remain an important part of the energy mix for utilities in the future, irrespective of the ITC expiration. We also see this as a positive indication of how our efficiency and cost road map positions us to have an extremely competitive product offering for projects with COD several years away.
As we continue to execute on our road maps, we expect to be in a situation where we can capture a significant share of the market opportunity. Lastly, each of these projects are candidates for an eventual drop-down to 8point3.
Internationally, we had tremendous success during the quarter, as highlighted by the signing of our largest non-U.S. module supply agreement for a single project in the history of the company. We have signed an agreement with ACWA Power and TSK to supply 200 megawatts AC of modules to the second phase of the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park in Dubai. This brings our total of completed or contracted projects to over 260 megawatts AC in the Middle East region and further strengthens the leadership role we are establishing in this key growth market. In addition, the selection of First Solar technology highlights the competitive advantages of our cad tel technology in hot climates and locations with adverse soiling conditions.
In Honduras, we are nearing completion of a 26-megawatt AC power plant that we are constructing for Grupo Terra. Central America is an emerging region for solar power, and this project represents a sign of progress in a growing region for solar. Elsewhere, we added additional bookings in other international locations such as India, Turkey and Japan.
Turning to Slide 9. Our bookings in terms of expected revenue now stands at $7 billion compared to $7.3 billion at the beginning of the year. The decrease is primarily a result of the higher mix of module or module plus deals in our year-to-date bookings.
Turning to Slide 10. I will now cover our potential bookings opportunities, which have further increased to 16.7 gigawatts DC, an increase of approximately 2.7 gigawatts from the prior quarter. Despite over 500 megawatts of bookings, our late-stage opportunities stayed flat at about 3 gigawatts, with the increase coming from early-stage projects. Nearly half of our late-stage opportunities, which we define as projects with a greater than 50% likelihood of converting to a booking, are international projects.
On Slide 11, we are providing an update to our potential bookings opportunities by geography. Our opportunities set outside of North America increased significantly to 10.4 gigawatts or 62% of the total. The latest growth in bookings opportunities since the prior quarter are from the Latin America, India and the Middle East regions. These developments are encouraging signs of our efforts to diversify outside of the U.S.
Turning to Slide 12. We have recently announced some internal organization changes in support of our new Vision 2020 strategy. Vision 2020 is a long-term road map to achieve significant growth objectives and further establish our technology and cost leadership. As part of the strategy, we will focus on key geographic regions that have a market-driven need for utility-scale solar power and where we can compete effectively with fossil fuel generation sources. Executing this plan will require prioritizing global market opportunities based on our core strengths and allocating resources appropriately. While we will have more details of our Vision 2020 at a later date, I do want to address some of the leadership changes that have occurred in support of this plan.
First, we have appointed Georges Antoun as President – U.S. and Joe Kishkill as President – International. This organizational change will improve our focus on key markets while driving sales growth. Joe will also take on new responsibilities as he joins me and Mark Widmar as members of the newly formed Office of the CEO. The Office of the CEO has been created to facilitate a distributed decision-making architecture for the company. While Mark will also take on additional responsibilities, his role as CFO remains unchanged.
As a result of Georges moving to the U.S. leadership role, Tymen De Jong will assume the role of Chief Operating Officer. Tymen has already been an instrumental part of implementing the technology improvements across our module manufacturing operations, and he will now be able to leverage his experience to achieving even greater cost improvements across all of our operation and execution functions.
Tim Rebhorn has been named Senior Vice President, Corporate Development and Strategic Marketing, with responsibility for competitive positioning of our products and services, institutional development and management of global key account relationships. Lastly, Raffi Garabedian will now report directly to me, and his role as CTO is unchanged. I am very confident that these changes will better align the organization in order to further drive sales and operational excellence.
Finally, as an update, our next Analyst Day will be in 2016. We will provide more specifics around the timing later this year. 
Now I'll turn it over to Mark, who will provide detail on our second quarter financial results and discuss guidance for 2015."

Let me begin on Slide 14 by discussing our second quarter operational performance.

Let me begin on Slide 14 by discussing our second quarter operational performance. Production in the quarter was 563 megawatts DC, an increase of 4% from the prior quarter due to higher module efficiency and increased manufacturing capacity. Production was 26% higher year-over-year due primarily to the restart of manufacturing lines, higher efficiency and new capacity. Our factory capacity utilization declined by 2 percentage points from the first quarter to 85% due to an increase in upgrade activities across the fleet.
As Jim noted, our second quarter average module efficiency for our entire fleet was 15.4%, an increase of 70 basis points quarter-over-quarter and 140 basis points higher year-over-year. Our best line averaged 16.2% efficiency during the quarter, an increase of 60 basis points from the prior quarter and 210 basis points year-over-year. Putting the year-over-year improvement into perspective, the 210 basis points improvement results in a 15% increase in nameplate watts per module. We are pleased with the rollout of our new module technology across the entire fleet, and we expect the fleet average to approach the best line efficiency later this year.
I'll now turn to Slide 15 to discuss the P&L. Net sales in the second quarter were $896 million, nearly double the prior quarter sales of $469 million. The sharply higher sales resulted primarily from the sale of our majority interest in the North Star and Lost Hills project to the Southern Company, as well as increased revenue recognized from our Silver State South project. Note that Silver State South revenue recognition is on a percentage of completion basis, while North Star and Lost Hills were sold to Southern near the end of construction, resulting in nearly all of the revenue recognized in Q2. Overall, construction activity and revenue recognition was higher across various EPC projects, which was primarily -- partially offset by lower third-party module sales.
As a percent of total sales, our systems revenue, which includes both our EPC revenue and solar modules used in our systems projects, was 98%, an increase of 20 percentage points from the prior quarter. Note, Modules Plus sales, which include the modules in addition to other components, such as mounting structures, is a growing part of our business and is included in our systems revenue. Modules Plus revenue totaled approximately $100 million in the second quarter. The decrease in third-party module sales reflects lower shipments to India as compared to the prior quarter.
Gross margin in the second quarter was 18.4% compared to 8.3% in the first quarter. The improved gross margin percent benefited from higher volume and improved sales mix led by the sale of the majority interest in Lost Hills and North Star. In addition, gross margin improved from cost reductions across multiple systems projects.
Operating expenses for the second quarter, which includes plant start-up, decreased sequentially by $2 million to $107 million. The decrease was driven by lower R&D expenses, partially offset by higher SG&A expenses associated with higher project development spending that was not able to be capitalized against projects. In Q2, operating expenses included an additional $4 million of expenses associated with the launch of 8point3.
The second quarter operating profit was $57 million compared to an operating loss of $70 million Q1. The increase in profit was due to higher sales and improved gross margin. There was an overall tax benefit of $33 million in the quarter. This primarily resulted from a $42 million anticipated discrete tax benefit associated with a favorable ruling from a foreign tax authority, which we noted in the last quarter's earning call and included in our guidance for the quarter.
Net income in the second quarter was $94 million or $0.93 per fully diluted share compared to a net loss of $0.62 in the prior quarter. Relative to our guidance for the quarter, our actual earnings were above the high end of our EPS range primarily due to strong cost savings across multiple domestic and international projects. In addition, the percentage of completion on our Silver State South project was higher than forecasted for the quarter, resulting in additional revenue in earnings.
Turning to Slide 16. I'll now discuss the balance sheet and cash flow summary. Cash and marketable securities increased by $291 million to $1.8 billion. Our net cash position now stands at $1.5 billion, an increase from $1.2 billion in the prior quarter. The increase in cash in the quarter resulted from the sale of majority interest in North Star and Lost Hills as well as the $284 million received from the 8point3 IPO. Our net working capital, including changes in noncurrent project assets and excluding cash and marketable securities, increased slightly by $28 million from the prior quarter. Deferred project costs decreased from the prior quarter due to the North Star and Lost Hills sales, but was offset by increase in noncurrent project assets related to projects under construction. Stateline, Moapa and Luz del Norte, which were respectively 26%, 32% and 72% completed at the end of the second quarter, are the major projects that fall into the noncurrent project asset category.
Total debt increased from the prior quarter by $57 million to $300 million. The increase is from an additional draw-down on the project level debt associated with our Luz del Norte project in Chile, partially offset by scheduled payments on our Malaysian debt.
Cash flow used in operations was $17 million compared to cash flow used in operations of $418 million in Q1. Of the $284 million cash received from 8point3, $239 million was treated as investing proceeds and $45 million was treated as financing proceeds.
Free cash flow was a negative $47 million compared to negative free cash flow of $466 million in the prior quarter. Capital expenditures totaled approximately $39 million, a decrease of $17 million from the prior quarter. Depreciation from the quarter was $63 million, a slight increase from the prior quarter.
Now turning to Slide 17. I will now address the accounting impact to First Solar's financials in the second quarter related to the 8point3 IPO transaction. As part of the initial portfolio, First Solar contributed 4 projects in return for a 31% ownership interest in 8point3. Products contributed included minority interest in Solar Gen, Lost Hills and North Star along with 100% interest of Maryland Solar.
Note for clarity and as a reminder, when the sale of the majority interest in Solar Gen, Lost Hills and North Star occurred, these transactions were recognized through the P&L as revenue cost of sales and gross margin. Specific to Maryland Solar, the project was leased back to 8point3 in order to preserve the ITC benefit to First Solar and was accounted for as a financing transaction due to our continuing involvement in that project.
Subsequent to the IPO, First Solar received $284 million in cash from 8point3, again approximately $239 million of this amount was accounted for as reduction of First Solar's investment in 8point3, and the remaining $45 million associated with Maryland Solar was recorded in other liabilities. It should be noted that this transaction was treated as a contribution of assets and return toward equity interest, and there was not any -- there was no P&L impact during the quarter. Additionally, in Q2, First Solar did not receive any earnings related to our 31% ownership share in 8point3 or any future 8point3 earnings we recognized in equity and earnings in our P&L.
Next, let me address the accounting for future drop-downs of assets to 8point3. Note that we do not plan to drop any additional assets to 8point3 during the remainder of this year, but we wanted to provide some guidance on this subject. First, it is important to understand that the GAAP accounting will vary depending on the specific structure of each transaction. However, in general, when we sell an interest in one of our projects to 8point3, there will be a P&L impact. The impact could be to revenue and gross margin or it could be to a gain, depending on the timing and circumstances of that transaction. The key point to remember is that while the classification on the P&L may vary, the bottom line's earnings impact is comparable in either situation.
In the future, we may also sell projects to 8point3 that follow a traditional path equity structure. In these situations, the accounting may take an even different form. In the case where we do have different accounting arrangements on future drop-downs, we will evaluate what measures are necessary to provide clarity to the investors.
Generally, regardless of the structure of the drop-down, the economic substance of the transaction, which is what is most meaningful is the same. We will monetize 100% of the value of the project either through, a, a sale of the majority interest to a third-party and the minority interest to 8point3; or b, through a sale of tax attributes to a tax equity partner and the residual value to 8point3.
Regarding the project portion sold to 8point3, our expectation, or at least the initial drop-downs is that we will receive 100% of the value of cash from 8point3. Over time, this might change, and the consideration may be a combination of cash and 8point3 shares.
Turning to Slide 18. I will discuss our full year 2015 guidance. First, we expect net sales in the range of $3.5 billion to $3.6 billion. As a percentage of our total revenue for the year, we expect systems revenue, which includes both EPC and solar modules used in our systems projects, in the range of 90% to 95%. Next, we expect gross margin in the range of 21% to 22%. This implies a higher gross margin in the second half of the year as compared to the first. This is a result of both a favorable mix of systems projects and continuing module and BoS cost improvements.
Operating expenses including plant start-ups are expected to range between $415 million and $425 million. As a reminder, the full year guidance includes 8point3 transactional-related expenses of $8 million, which we incurred in the first half of the year. Our projected effective tax rate is between 2% to 5%. Note that this rate incorporates the $42 million discrete tax benefit recorded in the second quarter results. Excluding this benefit, the tax rate would be approximately 12 percentage points higher.
Earnings per share is expected to be between $3.30 and $3.60 per fully diluted share. Included in the earnings per share is approximately $0.16 of equity in earnings, net of tax, which is comprised mainly of our First Solar ownership interest in 8point3. Our net cash balance is projected to range between $1.2 billion and $1.4 billion. In the second half of the year, we do expect to raise project level debt for the construction of our foreign assets in India and Japan. The loan balance to construct our Luz del Norte project is also anticipated to increase by year-end. As a result, we expect our year-end total debt to be approximately $400 million.
Capital expenditures are expected to be between $175 million and $200 million. Working capital increase from the end of 2014 is projected at $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion. The large increase in working capital for the year is a result of continuing the construction projects on balance sheet, primarily in support of the 8point3 identified ROFO projects. In addition, in some emerging markets where we are constructing development assets, we may be required to hold projects on balance sheet, even after construction is completed.
Lastly, we expect shipments to range between 2.8 and 2.9 gigawatts for the full year. In regards to the guidance for the second half of the year, we anticipate a higher percentage of the remaining revenue and earnings to fall in the third quarter of the year as a result of the timing of expected project sales. It should also be noted that our guidance for the remainder of the year does not include any further drop-down of assets to 8point3.
Moving on to Slide 19. We'll provide the sum of the parts valuation framework to illustrate how our view of how the investor community should consider valuing First Solar following the YieldCo launch. First, we see our core business continuing to be valued on an EPS multiple or discounted cash flow basis. The strong guidance for this year, one of the largest contracted pipelines in the industry and rapid technology improvements, we continue to see this as a growth engine of our business.
Next, we add in our $1.5 billion of net cash, which equates to approximately $15 per share as of Q2. Further, we add the value of 8point3 to First Solar through our 31% ownership interest. Finally, our DP ownership in an 8point3 should be taken in consideration through future rights to IDRs.
Turning to the next slide. I will summarize our progress during this past quarter. First, we believe strong -- we delivered strong financial results for the quarter with sales of $896 million, gross margin of over 18% and earnings of $0.93 per share. Our balance sheet remains strong with a net cash balance of $1.5 billion, and our recent amendment and extension of our revolving credit agreement, which has been increased from $600 million to $700 million with a maturity date of July 2018. The high end of our guidance range is $3.6 billion of revenue and $3.60 of earnings per share. Our technology continues to improve rapidly with our record module of 18.6% aperture area conversion efficiency. Our pipeline continues to grow with 1.4 gigawatts of year-to-date bookings in several projects in late-stage negotiations. Our potential bookings now stand at 16.7 gigawatts with 3 gigawatts of mid- to late-stage opportunities. Lastly, we have successfully launched 8point3 Energy Partners in conjunction with SunPower.
With this, we've concluded our prepared remarks and open the call for questions."

As I said in my comments, we're rapidly approaching a point where we don't have a lot to sell in '16. That doesn't mean we lose the opportunity to create value. What we've found over the",694,"So first, let's talk a bit about what we see going into '16 and '17. As I said in my comments, we're rapidly approaching a point where we don't have a lot to sell in '16. That doesn't mean we lose the opportunity to create value. What we've found over the course of '15 is that as we get into a fully allocated position, we begin to identify opportunities to move volume around, move projects around, change timing and optimize the value creation out of the full production capability of the fleet. So '16, I think, as we roll through the next couple of quarters, we will -- we'll book the remainder of the year, and then we'll spend a lot of the following year optimizing the deliveries and optimizing the timing of our projects. The final resolution of ITC, and specifically the commence construction language for ITC could throw some curveballs at the industry and cause everybody to re-look at timing of projects and timing of deliveries, but we'll just deal with those issues as they play out in Washington, D.C. As for 2017, we've got a fairly good book of business post 2016. It is still early. Our sort of -- as we've come to understand the rhythm and timing of the industry, we're still probably a couple of quarters away from when projects that are slated for 2017 will begin to aggressively engage on their module and EPC acquisition process. So I think we'll begin to get some visibility. I think our view, as we've stated before, is there will be some softness, some significant softness in the U.S. market. I don't think it disappears to a 0, but it will clearly be softer than in 2016. The effect of the expiration of the ITC has clearly been to accelerate demand from '17 into '16 on the North American front. Having said that, there's no impact on international demand as a result of the ITC. So all of our growing activity outside the U.S. continues to build on the solid base that we have, and we expect that, that will grow on a fairly nice basis through 2017. As you all may have noticed over the last couple of years, some markets, India in particular, the bookings in that market tend to come very close to deliveries. We don't have a lot of advance visibility. I mean, we can predict based on the programs and our customers' activities, but in terms of them coming in as an actual booking, they tend to come relatively close to the deliveries. So we're still a ways away from beginning to reflect that activity in our books. Some of the other markets are looking promising, but it's still a little too early to be able to tell. But generally, we expect a little bit of softness in North America, but we think we're going to see good activity elsewhere in the world. On the technology road map, there's been some recent commentary that is almost like a déjà vu. I feel like I've been magically transported back to 2012 and reading about abating cost advantage, et cetera. I have absolutely no idea, Ben, where that commentary is coming from. The modules that we are producing today are higher efficiency, higher quality and lower cost than anything we've ever produced. And as we laid out and showed everybody over the last 2 or 3 years in Analyst Days, we have a committed technology road map that we continue to deliver on. The -- we have occasionally made adjustments to that road map, but they're primarily to accommodate our need to produce product, they're not because we've had any sort of difficulty at any point in converting our technology road map into actual production and performance of the product. So we are as confident today as we have ever been in terms of our ability to compete in the marketplace. And I think the gross margins we're seeing out of all aspects of our business reflect the impact of that technology in the marketplace. So I don't know, Mark, if you have anything you want to add."

We said with our lead line at that point in time north of 16% that we were -- our cost per module was -- for those products were below $0.40 a watt, right? So we basically said at 16.3%, 16.2%, the cost of the module was below $0.40 a watt, okay? We also just said that we now have a new module that's certified of north of 18%. As we indicated, the 200 basis points improvement that we saw year-on-year from our lead line represents an increase of 15% watts per nameplate label capacity, right? So when you take that all into consideration, and our efficiency road map is in such a way that we're able to drive to a higher efficiency in every -- it scales the cost down. So it's not incremental to the cost structure of the module on a cost per watt basis. So it's hard for me to get my head around how that can all translate into a disadvantage. We're being below $0.40 a watt today and having a road map to get us north of 18% just on a pure cost basis, I can't see how that can create a disadvantage. And then when you couple that with the slide that we're showing on an energy density that we're 18-plus percent advantage in some parts of the U.S. on an energy basis in 2017, the combination of the two, the higher energy and lower cost, I don't know how you conclude otherwise that we have an advantage."

Obviously, within that, you're going to use a greater degree of conservatism versus your road map the further out in time you are. But we do -- we are continuously applying in the marketplace our view of the road map. And we do so through extremely rigorous processes and only commit technology to the promise that we're willing to make in the marketplace once we feel like we have a high degree of confidence that we have moved from any sort of R&D type of circumstance to where it is simply a matter of executing on the production side.

As we said when we were on the road show is, we clearly looking at this as a sustainable long-term vehicle that positions us for success, and in particular, we're trying to make sure that we're positioning ourself for success beyond the 2016 horizon in the U.S. And we believe we've done that by putting together a ROFO and an IPO portfolio that effectively enables us to deliver against that growth through 2018 time frame. Now we also said on the road show that we left ourselves significant degrees of freedom to make decisions over time, if rates did increase or environment change. We could look at the growth rate, we could look at the payout ratio, we could look at the leverage. So we'll continue to evaluate all of those levers and try to make then informed decision of what makes the most sense to enable both First Solar and SunPower's business model. It's -- as you can tell by the recent announcements for both by SunPower and First Solar, we continued both to be successful in the marketplace not only with PUD dates and the 2016 horizon, which both of us won 100 megawatts within the energy with CODs in 2016. But as Jim indicated, we're in negotiations with opportunities for hundreds of megawatts that sit beyond the 2016 horizon, which is a combination of enabling the strength of 8point3 with our advantage technology road map, we'll continue to position us to gain share in that horizon. And when we do that, we'll make a decision around what's the right way to monetize those assets. And it may mean to drop those assets down into 8point3, and it may mean we'll evaluate the growth rate over time.

The comments around the utilization and the sold out and the $0.40, we'll try to put that all in perspective. We effectively are running -- adjusted for downtime to realize upgrades that we need to do to drive those efficiency improvements, we effectively are running full out right now. We have no real available capacity. We have some discretionary capacity as it relates to the timing of doing the upgrade, and that's why you will see not this year, we're going to continue to roll out the fleet, the lead line efficiency across the entire fleet. But as we enter into 2016, we are making some informed decisions to delay some of the road map enhancements in order to capture as much utilization as we can, given the current demand profile. So it's one of those things. It's a delicate balance. You have to look at where you're at with the efficiency road map, where you are from your relative competitiveness, and while we do believe, obviously, there's significant advantages that we'll gain as we continue to roll out our road map. But as we look at it today and as demonstrated in the slide that we presented during the discussion today, is that at our current 16-type-percent efficiency as we exit '15, we'll be advantaged in a number of key markets and so now we've captured the advantage and we're trying to make sure that we can monetize that efficiently in '16 and limit the amount of downtime. So you'll see a little bit of a delay in the road map, and you'll see more of that activity happening in '17. So again, it's a delicate balance between what do we run for utilization, how do we think through the efficiency road map and where we're at relative to competitiveness of our technology at that point in time."

There's a little bit of overlap on the engineering side that, by and large, those are independent skill sets and independently staffed teams and organizations. We have a fairly regional structure on the development side. We further committed to a regional focus with the reorganization and the appointment of Georges as the U.S. president and Joe as the international president. So it doesn't really present us with an either/or. We're going to pursue development in both the U.S., other OECD countries as well as emerging market countries based upon the market specifics and the ability to create value out of the development process, the availability of a liquid market to monetize those activities on the back end, and it's not -- we don't really -- have not found ourselves in a position where we've had to think about or talk about an either/or in terms of evaluating those opportunities."

And I -- to be honest, I don't spend a ton of my time focused on it. We certainly have people within the organization that do, but I wouldn't feel comfortable providing a lot of commentary. On the ITC, there has been a lot of activity and a lot of discussion in Washington. As everybody knows, the fact that we are now in the heat of the 2016 presidential race kind of leaves us at a difficult time in terms of making progress on issues that require a lot of bipartisan support. There has been a lot of dialogue in the Senate about conforming the ITC to the same standard that applies to the PTC and providing commence construction determination for solar projects or to allow -- alternatively to allow the solar projects to proceed under the same part as wind, which the net effect of that would actually be the same thing. The House has not taken it up specifically. It would be unlikely to be included in any House legislation. It would get resolved to the extent a tax package moves ahead later this year in conference, and I am -- do not consider myself enough of an expert that I can provide much insight into what the results of that -- of those conference negotiations would be. I will tell you that there's lots of effort and activity on part of the industry and what we're really seeking -- what First Solar is specifically seeking is a glide -- a smooth glide path with no sharp alterations in policy. We're not focused on long-term extensions of the ITC. We're just focused on trying to create a smooth transition and that's where most of our effort is, but I'm not one to provide a lot of prognostication as to what's going to happen or not going to happen in Washington."

This past quarter was marked with great execution across multiple aspects of our business. From the successful launch of 8point3 Energy Partners to the achievement of a new technology milestone and with strong financial results for the quarter, I am very pleased with the progress we are making. I want to recognize the tremendous efforts of the entire First Solar team to achieve these results.
Turning to Slide 4. I will discuss in more detail the benefits of the newly formed 8point3 Energy Partners, which we launched in conjunction with SunPower. The creation of this YieldCo vehicle benefits First Solar and its shareholders in several ways. First, it lowers our cost of capital even further. Next, ownership in 8point3 allows First Solar to retain a residual interest in high-quality solar assets while providing stable future cash flows through IDR rights in dividends. Additionally, the creation of 8point3 provides another competitive buyer for our future projects. Lastly, the $284 million in proceeds received from 8point3, subsequent to the IPO, provides capital for further investment in project development. Mark will discuss more details related to the specifics of the transaction later in the call.
We also achieved a significant milestone this past quarter related to our technology road map. As announced last month, First Solar achieved yet another new cad tel full-size module record of 18.6% aperture area conversion efficiency, which has been certified and recorded by NREL. This equates to a full area efficiency of 18.2%, which exceeds the record multicrystalline PERC module full area conversion efficiency of approximately 17.7%. Our new module record demonstrates our ability to scale our research cell technologies to full production form factor and is indicative of future production capability we will be deploying in the coming few years.
With this latest achievement, we are clearly demonstrating that our cad tel technology is both a high-efficiency and low-cost offering. We continue to see our ability to execute on our technology road map as a key strength and a differentiating factor between First Solar and the competition.
Slides 6 and 7 provide a slightly different view of our technology road map and the expected energy density advantage relative to multicrystalline silicon in the United States. While the energy density slides we have shown in the past have focused on a typical desert southwest environment, this map shows the advantages across the country. As a reminder, energy density takes into account not only module efficiency but also temperature, humidity and shade tolerance advantages inherent in our technology relative to multicrystalline silicon. As we transition from the end of 2015 to the end of 2017, we continue to expect that our module technology advantage over multicrystalline competitors will grow dramatically.
As shown on Slide 7, our advantage is expected to be especially strong in the more humid and hot parts of the country. With 1.3 gigawatts of volume, either supplied or under contract in the southeastern United States, we are already beginning to see the market appreciate the performance advantages of our technology.
Finally, while the maps shown are specific to the United States, the same fundamental energy density advantage is present internationally and especially in those hot and humid regions that are best suited to solar.
Turning to our current modules in production. Our fleet average efficiency improved in the second quarter to 15.4%, a 70 basis point improvement from the first quarter. Our lead line efficiency averaged 16.2% for the quarter, a 60 basis point improvement quarter-over-quarter and a remarkable 210 basis point improvement versus Q2 2014. The year-over-year increase in our lead line efficiency puts into perspective the astounding pace of our technological improvements.
During the second half of 2015 and into 2016, efficiency improvements on our lead line will not be as dramatic as the first half of this year. This is due both to the need to prioritize full production utilization in 2016 as well as the timing of when new programs roll out. The efficiency improvements will accelerate again into 2017, as highlighted on the energy density map. Lastly, we still expect to see significant improvement in our full fleet average during the second half of this year as our lead line technology is rolled out across our production fleet.
We are encouraged by the progress that we continue to see in our bookings as highlighted on Slide 8. Bookings for the first 2 quarters of the year now total 1.3 gigawatts DC against shipments of 1.3 gigawatts DC during the same time period. Since the end of Q2, we have contracted an additional 80 megawatts of volume to bring our year-to-date bookings to 1.4 gigawatts. We are pleased with our year-to-date bookings in our 1:1 book-to-bill ratio and have visibility into a large number of late-stage booking opportunities.
As we indicated previously, we are sold out for the remainder of 2015. As we look to 2016, we have already contracted most of our available supply for the first half of the year. And based on a probabilistic analysis of our pipeline, we have only a few hundred megawatts of supply remaining for the entire year. This could lead to forgoing some bookings and pipeline opportunities due to supply constraints. We see this as a positive result of our improving module technology as well as the ongoing development of our global sales teams.
Our recent bookings in late-stage opportunities that are in final negotiations highlight our strengths both in project development and in continued growth internationally. First, in the United States, we were awarded 100-megawatt PPA by NV Energy for our Playa project, which has a COD of 2016. This project award highlights both the competitiveness of solar power with conventional fuel sources and the strength of our cost-reduction road map. The project, as with other such awards, is subject to final approval by the state public utility commission.
In addition, we expect to sign in the near future PPAs for several additional projects totaling hundreds of megawatts. While we are not able to discuss these in full detail today, the CODs on these projects are several years in the future. The delivery timing for these projects is a strong indication that solar power will remain an important part of the energy mix for utilities in the future, irrespective of the ITC expiration. We also see this as a positive indication of how our efficiency and cost road map positions us to have an extremely competitive product offering for projects with COD several years away.
As we continue to execute on our road maps, we expect to be in a situation where we can capture a significant share of the market opportunity. Lastly, each of these projects are candidates for an eventual drop-down to 8point3.
Internationally, we had tremendous success during the quarter, as highlighted by the signing of our largest non-U.S. module supply agreement for a single project in the history of the company. We have signed an agreement with ACWA Power and TSK to supply 200 megawatts AC of modules to the second phase of the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park in Dubai. This brings our total of completed or contracted projects to over 260 megawatts AC in the Middle East region and further strengthens the leadership role we are establishing in this key growth market. In addition, the selection of First Solar technology highlights the competitive advantages of our cad tel technology in hot climates and locations with adverse soiling conditions.
In Honduras, we are nearing completion of a 26-megawatt AC power plant that we are constructing for Grupo Terra. Central America is an emerging region for solar power, and this project represents a sign of progress in a growing region for solar. Elsewhere, we added additional bookings in other international locations such as India, Turkey and Japan.
Turning to Slide 9. Our bookings in terms of expected revenue now stands at $7 billion compared to $7.3 billion at the beginning of the year. The decrease is primarily a result of the higher mix of module or module plus deals in our year-to-date bookings.
Turning to Slide 10. I will now cover our potential bookings opportunities, which have further increased to 16.7 gigawatts DC, an increase of approximately 2.7 gigawatts from the prior quarter. Despite over 500 megawatts of bookings, our late-stage opportunities stayed flat at about 3 gigawatts, with the increase coming from early-stage projects. Nearly half of our late-stage opportunities, which we define as projects with a greater than 50% likelihood of converting to a booking, are international projects.
On Slide 11, we are providing an update to our potential bookings opportunities by geography. Our opportunities set outside of North America increased significantly to 10.4 gigawatts or 62% of the total. The latest growth in bookings opportunities since the prior quarter are from the Latin America, India and the Middle East regions. These developments are encouraging signs of our efforts to diversify outside of the U.S.
Turning to Slide 12. We have recently announced some internal organization changes in support of our new Vision 2020 strategy. Vision 2020 is a long-term road map to achieve significant growth objectives and further establish our technology and cost leadership. As part of the strategy, we will focus on key geographic regions that have a market-driven need for utility-scale solar power and where we can compete effectively with fossil fuel generation sources. Executing this plan will require prioritizing global market opportunities based on our core strengths and allocating resources appropriately. While we will have more details of our Vision 2020 at a later date, I do want to address some of the leadership changes that have occurred in support of this plan.
First, we have appointed Georges Antoun as President – U.S. and Joe Kishkill as President – International. This organizational change will improve our focus on key markets while driving sales growth. Joe will also take on new responsibilities as he joins me and Mark Widmar as members of the newly formed Office of the CEO. The Office of the CEO has been created to facilitate a distributed decision-making architecture for the company. While Mark will also take on additional responsibilities, his role as CFO remains unchanged.
As a result of Georges moving to the U.S. leadership role, Tymen De Jong will assume the role of Chief Operating Officer. Tymen has already been an instrumental part of implementing the technology improvements across our module manufacturing operations, and he will now be able to leverage his experience to achieving even greater cost improvements across all of our operation and execution functions.
Tim Rebhorn has been named Senior Vice President, Corporate Development and Strategic Marketing, with responsibility for competitive positioning of our products and services, institutional development and management of global key account relationships. Lastly, Raffi Garabedian will now report directly to me, and his role as CTO is unchanged. I am very confident that these changes will better align the organization in order to further drive sales and operational excellence.
Finally, as an update, our next Analyst Day will be in 2016. We will provide more specifics around the timing later this year. 
Now I'll turn it over to Mark, who will provide detail on our second quarter financial results and discuss guidance for 2015."

Let me begin on Slide 14 by discussing our second quarter operational performance.

Let me begin on Slide 14 by discussing our second quarter operational performance. Production in the quarter was 563 megawatts DC, an increase of 4% from the prior quarter due to higher module efficiency and increased manufacturing capacity. Production was 26% higher year-over-year due primarily to the restart of manufacturing lines, higher efficiency and new capacity. Our factory capacity utilization declined by 2 percentage points from the first quarter to 85% due to an increase in upgrade activities across the fleet.
As Jim noted, our second quarter average module efficiency for our entire fleet was 15.4%, an increase of 70 basis points quarter-over-quarter and 140 basis points higher year-over-year. Our best line averaged 16.2% efficiency during the quarter, an increase of 60 basis points from the prior quarter and 210 basis points year-over-year. Putting the year-over-year improvement into perspective, the 210 basis points improvement results in a 15% increase in nameplate watts per module. We are pleased with the rollout of our new module technology across the entire fleet, and we expect the fleet average to approach the best line efficiency later this year.
I'll now turn to Slide 15 to discuss the P&L. Net sales in the second quarter were $896 million, nearly double the prior quarter sales of $469 million. The sharply higher sales resulted primarily from the sale of our majority interest in the North Star and Lost Hills project to the Southern Company as well as increased revenue recognized from our Silver State South project. Note that Silver State South revenue recognition is on a percentage of completion basis, while North Star and Lost Hills were sold to Southern near the end of construction, resulting in nearly all of the revenue recognized in Q2. Overall, construction activity and revenue recognition was higher across various EPC projects, which was primarily -- partially offset by lower third-party module sales.
As a percent of total sales, our systems revenue, which includes both our EPC revenue and solar modules used in our systems projects, was 98%, an increase of 20 percentage points from the prior quarter. Note, Modules Plus sales, which include the modules in addition to other components, such as mounting structures, is a growing part of our business and is included in our systems revenue. Modules Plus revenue totaled approximately $100 million in the second quarter. The decrease in third-party module sales reflects lower shipments to India as compared to the prior quarter.
Gross margin in the second quarter was 18.4% compared to 8.3% in the first quarter. The improved gross margin percent benefited from higher volume and improved sales mix led by the sale of the majority interest in Lost Hills and North Star. In addition, gross margin improved from cost reductions across multiple systems projects.
Operating expenses for the second quarter, which includes plant start-up, decreased sequentially by $2 million to $107 million. The decrease was driven by lower R&D expenses, partially offset by higher SG&A expenses associated with higher project development spending that was not able to be capitalized against projects. In Q2, operating expenses included an additional $4 million of expenses associated with the launch of 8point3.
The second quarter operating profit was $57 million compared to an operating loss of $70 million Q1. The increase in profit was due to higher sales and improved gross margin. There was an overall tax benefit of $33 million in the quarter. This primarily resulted from a $42 million anticipated discrete tax benefit associated with a favorable ruling from a foreign tax authority, which we noted in the last quarter's earning call and included in our guidance for the quarter.
Net income in the second quarter was $94 million or $0.93 per fully diluted share compared to a net loss of $0.62 in the prior quarter. Relative to our guidance for the quarter, our actual earnings were above the high end of our EPS range primarily due to strong cost savings across multiple domestic and international projects. In addition, the percentage of completion on our Silver State South project was higher than forecasted for the quarter, resulting in additional revenue in earnings.
Turning to Slide 16. I'll now discuss the balance sheet and cash flow summary. Cash and marketable securities increased by $291 million to $1.8 billion. Our net cash position now stands at $1.5 billion, an increase from $1.2 billion in the prior quarter. The increase in cash in the quarter resulted from the sale of majority interest in North Star and Lost Hills as well as the $284 million received from the 8point3 IPO. Our net working capital, including changes in noncurrent project assets and excluding cash and marketable securities, increased slightly by $28 million from the prior quarter. Deferred project costs decreased from the prior quarter due to the North Star and Lost Hills sales, but was offset by increase in noncurrent project assets related to projects under construction. Stateline, Moapa and Luz del Norte, which were respectively 26%, 32% and 72% completed at the end of the second quarter, are the major projects that fall into the noncurrent project asset category.
Total debt increased from the prior quarter by $57 million to $300 million. The increase is from an additional draw-down on the project level debt associated with our Luz del Norte project in Chile, partially offset by scheduled payments on our Malaysian debt.
Cash flow used in operations was $17 million compared to cash flow used in operations of $418 million in Q1. Of the $284 million cash received from 8point3, $239 million was treated as investing proceeds and $45 million was treated as financing proceeds.
Free cash flow was a negative $47 million compared to negative free cash flow of $466 million in the prior quarter. Capital expenditures totaled approximately $39 million, a decrease of $17 million from the prior quarter. Depreciation from the quarter was $63 million, a slight increase from the prior quarter.
Now turning to Slide 17. I will now address the accounting impact to First Solar's financials in the second quarter related to the 8point3 IPO transaction. As part of the initial portfolio, First Solar contributed 4 projects in return for a 31% ownership interest in 8point3. Products contributed included minority interest in Solar Gen, Lost Hills and North Star along with 100% interest of Maryland Solar.
Note for clarity and as a reminder, when the sale of the majority interest in Solar Gen, Lost Hills and North Star occurred, these transactions were recognized through the P&L as revenue cost of sales and gross margin. Specific to Maryland Solar, the project was leased back to 8point3 in order to preserve the ITC benefit to First Solar and was accounted for as a financing transaction due to our continuing involvement in that project.
Subsequent to the IPO, First Solar received $284 million in cash from 8point3, again approximately $239 million of this amount was accounted for as reduction of First Solar's investment in 8point3, and the remaining $45 million associated with Maryland Solar was recorded in other liabilities. It should be noted that this transaction was treated as a contribution of assets and return toward equity interest, and there was not any -- there was no P&L impact during the quarter. Additionally, in Q2, First Solar did not receive any earnings related to our 31% ownership share in 8point3 or any future 8point3 earnings we recognized in equity and earnings in our P&L.
Next, let me address the accounting for future drop-downs of assets to 8point3. Note that we do not plan to drop any additional assets to 8point3 during the remainder of this year, but we wanted to provide some guidance on this subject. First, it is important to understand that the GAAP accounting will vary depending on the specific structure of each transaction. However, in general, when we sell an interest in one of our projects to 8point3, there will be a P&L impact. The impact could be to revenue and gross margin or it could be to a gain, depending on the timing and circumstances of that transaction. The key point to remember is that while the classification on the P&L may vary, the bottom line's earnings impact is comparable in either situation.
In the future, we may also sell projects to 8point3 that follow a traditional path equity structure. In these situations, the accounting may take an even different form. In the case where we do have different accounting arrangements on future drop-downs, we will evaluate what measures are necessary to provide clarity to the investors.
Generally, regardless of the structure of the drop-down, the economic substance of the transaction, which is what is most meaningful is the same. We will monetize 100% of the value of the project either through, a, a sale of the majority interest to a third-party and the minority interest to 8point3; or b, through a sale of tax attributes to a tax equity partner and the residual value to 8point3.
Regarding the project portion sold to 8point3, our expectation, or at least the initial drop-downs is that we will receive 100% of the value of cash from 8point3. Over time, this might change, and the consideration may be a combination of cash and 8point3 shares.
Turning to Slide 18. I will discuss our full year 2015 guidance. First, we expect net sales in the range of $3.5 billion to $3.6 billion. As a percentage of our total revenue for the year, we expect systems revenue, which includes both EPC and solar modules used in our systems projects, in the range of 90% to 95%. Next, we expect gross margin in the range of 21% to 22%. This implies a higher gross margin in the second half of the year as compared to the first. This is a result of both a favorable mix of systems projects and continuing module and BoS cost improvements.
Operating expenses including plant start-ups are expected to range between $415 million and $425 million. As a reminder, the full year guidance includes 8point3 transactional-related expenses of $8 million, which we incurred in the first half of the year. Our projected effective tax rate is between 2% to 5%. Note that this rate incorporates the $42 million discrete tax benefit recorded in the second quarter results. Excluding this benefit, the tax rate would be approximately 12 percentage points higher.
Earnings per share is expected to be between $3.30 and $3.60 per fully diluted share. Included in the earnings per share is approximately $0.16 of equity in earnings, net of tax, which is comprised mainly of our First Solar ownership interest in 8point3. Our net cash balance is projected to range between $1.2 billion and $1.4 billion. In the second half of the year, we do expect to raise project level debt for the construction of our foreign assets in India and Japan. The loan balance to construct our Luz del Norte project is also anticipated to increase by year-end. As a result, we expect our year-end total debt to be approximately $400 million.
Capital expenditures are expected to be between $175 million and $200 million. Working capital increase from the end of 2014 is projected at $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion. The large increase in working capital for the year is a result of continuing the construction projects on balance sheet, primarily in support of the 8point3 identified ROFO projects. In addition, in some emerging markets where we are constructing development assets, we may be required to hold projects on balance sheet, even after construction is completed.
Lastly, we expect shipments to range between 2.8 and 2.9 gigawatts for the full year. In regards to the guidance for the second half of the year, we anticipate a higher percentage of the remaining revenue and earnings to fall in the third quarter of the year as a result of the timing of expected project sales. It should also be noted that our guidance for the remainder of the year does not include any further drop-down of assets to 8point3.
Moving on to Slide 19. We'll provide the sum of the parts valuation framework to illustrate how our view of how the investor community should consider valuing First Solar following the YieldCo launch. First, we see our core business continuing to be valued on an EPS multiple or discounted cash flow basis. The strong guidance for this year, one of the largest contracted pipelines in the industry and rapid technology improvements, we continue to see this as a growth engine of our business.
Next, we add in our $1.5 billion of net cash, which equates to approximately $15 per share as of Q2. Further, we add the value of 8point3 to First Solar through our 31% ownership interest. Finally, our DP ownership in an 8point3 should be taken in consideration through future rights to IDRs.
Turning to the next slide. I will summarize our progress during this past quarter. First, we believe strong -- we delivered strong financial results for the quarter with sales of $896 million, gross margin of over 18% and earnings of $0.93 per share. Our balance sheet remains strong with a net cash balance of $1.5 billion, and our recent amendment and extension of our revolving credit agreement, which has been increased from $600 million to $700 million with a maturity date of July 2018. The high end of our guidance range is $3.6 billion of revenue and $3.60 of earnings per share. Our technology continues to improve rapidly with our record module of 18.6% aperture area conversion efficiency. Our pipeline continues to grow with 1.4 gigawatts of year-to-date bookings in several projects in late-stage negotiations. Our potential bookings now stand at 16.7 gigawatts with 3 gigawatts of mid- to late-stage opportunities. Lastly, we have successfully launched 8point3 Energy Partners in conjunction with SunPower.
With this, we've concluded our prepared remarks and open the call for questions."

As I said in my comments, we're rapidly approaching a point where we don't have a lot to sell in '16. That doesn't mean we lose the opportunity to create value. What we've found over the",694,"So first, let's talk a bit about what we see going into '16 and '17. As I said in my comments, we're rapidly approaching a point where we don't have a lot to sell in '16. That doesn't mean we lose the opportunity to create value. What we've found over the course of '15 is that as we get into a fully allocated position, we begin to identify opportunities to move volume around, move projects around, change timing and optimize the value creation out of the full production capability of the fleet. So '16, I think, as we roll through the next couple of quarters, we will -- we'll book the remainder of the year, and then we'll spend a lot of the following year optimizing the deliveries and optimizing the timing of our projects. The final resolution of ITC, and specifically the commence construction language for ITC could throw some curveballs at the industry and cause everybody to re-look at timing of projects and timing of deliveries, but we'll just deal with those issues as they play out in Washington, D.C. As for 2017, we've got a fairly good book of business post 2016. It is still early. Our sort of -- as we've come to understand the rhythm and timing of the industry, we're still probably a couple of quarters away from when projects that are slated for 2017 will begin to aggressively engage on their module and EPC acquisition process. So I think we'll begin to get some visibility. I think our view, as we've stated before, is there will be some softness, some significant softness in the U.S. market. I don't think it disappears to a 0, but it will clearly be softer than in 2016. The effect of the expiration of the ITC has clearly been to accelerate demand from '17 into '16 on the North American front. Having said that, there's no impact on international demand as a result of the ITC. So all of our growing activity outside the U.S. continues to build on the solid base that we have, and we expect that, that will grow on a fairly nice basis through 2017. As you all may have noticed over the last couple of years, some markets, India in particular, the bookings in that market tend to come very close to deliveries. We don't have a lot of advance visibility. I mean, we can predict based on the programs and our customers' activities, but in terms of them coming in as an actual booking, they tend to come relatively close to the deliveries. So we're still a ways away from beginning to reflect that activity in our books. Some of the other markets are looking promising, but it's still a little too early to be able to tell. But generally, we expect a little bit of softness in North America, but we think we're going to see good activity elsewhere in the world. On the technology road map, there's been some recent commentary that is almost like a déjà vu. I feel like I've been magically transported back to 2012 and reading about abating cost advantage, et cetera. I have absolutely no idea, Ben, where that commentary is coming from. The modules that we are producing today are higher efficiency, higher quality and lower cost than anything we've ever produced. And as we laid out and showed everybody over the last 2 or 3 years in Analyst Days, we have a committed technology road map that we continue to deliver on. The -- we have occasionally made adjustments to that road map, but they're primarily to accommodate our need to produce product, they're not because we've had any sort of difficulty at any point in converting our technology road map into actual production and performance of the product. So we are as confident today as we have ever been in terms of our ability to compete in the marketplace. And I think the gross margins we're seeing out of all aspects of our business reflect the impact of that technology in the marketplace. So I don't know, Mark, if you have anything you want to add."

We said with our lead line at that point in time north of 16% that we were -- our cost per module was -- for those products were below $0.40 a watt, right? So we basically said at 16.3%, 16.2%, the cost of the module was below $0.40 a watt, okay? We also just said that we now have a new module that's certified of north of 18%. As we indicated, the 200 basis points improvement that we saw year-on-year from our lead line represents an increase of 15% watts per nameplate label capacity, right? So when you take that all into consideration, and our efficiency road map is in such a way that we're able to drive to a higher efficiency in every -- it scales the cost down. So it's not incremental to the cost structure of the module on a cost per watt basis. So it's hard for me to get my head around how that can all translate into a disadvantage. We're being below $0.40 a watt today and having a road map to get us north of 18% just on a pure cost basis, I can't see how that can create a disadvantage. And then when you couple that with the slide that we're showing on an energy density that we're 18-plus percent advantage in some parts of the U.S. on an energy basis in 2017, the combination of the two, the higher energy and lower cost, I don't know how you conclude otherwise that we have an advantage."

Obviously, within that, you're going to use a greater degree of conservatism versus your road map the further out in time you are. But we do -- we are continuously applying in the marketplace our view of the road map. And we do so through extremely rigorous processes and only commit technology to the promise that we're willing to make in the marketplace once we feel like we have a high degree of confidence that we have moved from any sort of R&D type of circumstance to where it is simply a matter of executing on the production side.

Now we also said on the road show that we left ourselves significant degrees of freedom to make decisions over time, if rates did increase or environment change. We could look at the growth rate, we could look at the payout ratio, we could look at the leverage.

But as Jim indicated, we're in negotiations with opportunities for hundreds of megawatts that sit beyond the 2016 horizon, which is a combination of enabling the strength of 8point3 with our advantage technology road map, we'll continue to position us to gain share in that horizon. And when we do that, we'll make a decision around what's the right way to monetize those assets.

So first off, Pat, just to make sure the comment was made during the call, if you caught it, is that we envision that we'll be running the entire fleet at the current lead line efficiency by the end of the year. So the 16.2% on the lead line, you would expect the entire fleet as we exit the year to be at that 16.2% from that perspective. The comments around the utilization and the sold out and the $0.40, we'll try to put that all in perspective. We effectively are running -- adjusted for downtime to realize upgrades that we need to do to drive those efficiency improvements, we effectively are running full out right now. We have no real available capacity. We have some discretionary capacity as it relates to the timing of doing the upgrade, and that's why you will see not this year, we're going to continue to roll out the fleet, the lead line efficiency across the entire fleet. But as we enter into 2016, we are making some informed decisions to delay some of the road map enhancements in order to capture as much utilization as we can, given the current demand profile. So it's one of those things. It's a delicate balance. You have to look at where you're at with the efficiency road map, where you are from your relative competitiveness, and while we do believe, obviously, there's significant advantages that we'll gain as we continue to roll out our road map. But as we look at it today and as demonstrated in the slide that we presented during the discussion today, is that at our current 16-type-percent efficiency as we exit '15, we'll be advantaged in a number of key markets and so now we've captured the advantage and we're trying to make sure that we can monetize that efficiently in '16 and limit the amount of downtime. So you'll see a little bit of a delay in the road map, and you'll see more of that activity happening in '17. So again, it's a delicate balance between what do we run for utilization, how do we think through the efficiency road map and where we're at relative to competitiveness of our technology at that point in time."

On the ITC, there has been a lot of activity and a lot of discussion in Washington. As everybody knows, the fact that we are now in the heat of the 2016 presidential race kind of leaves us at a difficult time in terms of making progress on issues that require a lot of bipartisan support. There has been a lot of dialogue in the Senate about conforming the ITC to the same standard that applies to the PTC and providing commence construction determination for solar projects or to allow -- alternatively to allow the solar projects to proceed under the same part as wind, which the net effect of that would actually be the same thing. The House has not taken it up specifically. It would be unlikely to be included in any House legislation. It would get resolved to the extent a tax package moves ahead later this year in conference, and I am -- do not consider myself enough of an expert that I can provide much insight into what the results of that -- of those conference negotiations would be. I will tell you that there's lots of effort and activity on part of the industry and what we're really seeking -- what First Solar is specifically seeking is a glide -- a smooth glide path with no sharp alterations in policy. We're not focused on long-term extensions of the ITC. We're just focused on trying to create a smooth transition and that's where most of our effort is, but I'm not one to provide a lot of prognostication as to what's going to happen or not going to happen in Washington."

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. As indicated in our press release, we have issued preliminary financial results for the third quarter while we completed an analysis of the discrete income tax matter related to a foreign tax jurisdiction. While Mark will discuss this matter on more detail later, I wish to emphasize that this matter does not have any adverse impact on the ongoing operations of the company. We are working towards a full and timely resolution of the issues. Now let me turn to an update on the business and the outstanding performance of this past quarter. 
In the third quarter, we had tremendous execution across all parts of the organization, which has resulted in strong results from a financial bookings and technology standpoint. Before further discussing these points, it is worth taking a moment to reflect on the progress we have made as a company over the past several years. 
In 2012, First Solar and the entire solar industry faced a period of disruption resulting from declines in unsustainable subsidized solar markets. At our Q1 2012 earnings call, we laid out a 5-year plan and identify key 2016 financial targets that focus the organization and create value for our shareholders. As we near the end of year 4 of this plan, with year-to-date bookings of 3.1 gigawatts, earnings guidance of over $4 per share and the strongest technology position in our company's history, we have to recognize the tremendous progress that has been made towards these objectives since 2012. 
With the vision 2020 plan that we introduced last quarter, we will continue this pattern of setting challenging goals and working to achieve them. 
Turning to our technology performance in the third quarter. Our fleet average efficiency improved to 15.8%, a 40-basis-point improvement from the second quarter. Our lead line efficiency averaged 16.4%, a 20-basis-point improvement quarter-over-quarter and a 210-basis-point improvement versus Q3 2014. A more modest improvement in the sequential lead line efficiency relative to prior quarters is a reflection of an intentional and temporary new technology implementations. As we have stated previously, we are completing the rollout of our technology upgrade across the entire fleet this year. 
In the first half of 2016, we will prioritize full production utilization in order to meet strong demands and then resume the implementation of new module efficiency programs thereafter. 
Next, we are very pleased with our progress in securing the business for the future. Slide 5 highlights our year-to-date bookings, which now stand at 3.1 gigawatts. With 2 months left in the year, we have already set a new annual bookings records and anticipate adding to this total before the end of the year. With at least 3.1 gigawatts of bookings for the year and projected full year shipments of approximately 2.9 gigawatts, we will once again exceed our goal of a 1:1 book-to-bill ratio. 
Our total 1.7 gigawatts of bookings since last earnings call are not only impressive in size, but also reflects some positive indications of utility scale solar demand in the U.S. after 2016. Approximately 60% or over 1 gigawatt DC of the total 1.7 gigawatt DC growth are projects in the U.S. that has commercial operations dates after 2016. Approximately 630 megawatts DC of this volume represent PPAs that have been signed with a leading utility in the Western United States and span across 4 projects, which are anticipated to commence delivering power into utilities late in 2019. 
As with other PPA awards, these projects are subject to utility commission approval. More details will be made public at a later date regarding these projects. 
We also signed an incremental 400 megawatt DC model supply improvement with Strata Solar all of these volumes scheduled for delivery to Strata in 2017 and 2018. We have now signed agreements with Strata for over 1 gigawatt of volume, which signifies the growing importance of our relationship and also demonstrates the strength of demand for solar in the Southeastern United States. 
We are encouraged by these bookings with longer dated CODs and see this as an initial positive indication, particularly with respect to volumes. We still remain cautious on expectations regarding margins after 2016, given the limited visibility we have into the total business segment mix and the systems margins, given recent uncertainties and volatilities in respect to profit capital for solar projects. 
However, we continue to believe that the growing affordability of solar, which is enabled by our cost road map, is an attractive value proposition for utilities. We also believe that characteristics of utilities still solar plants as long-term contracted assets with no commodity price risk will increasingly represent a compelling investment opportunity for a wide variety of investors and continue to drive low cost of capital for the industry. 
Looking at the remaining portion of the 1.7 gigawatts of new bookings since last call, approximately 650 megawatts are for projects for CODs during 2016. With the addition of these projects, we have nearly 2 gigawatts of 2016 volume fully contracted. When taking into account significant number of mid-to late-stage opportunities, on a probability-weighted basis, all of our supply is fully allocated for 2016. 
The 650 megawatts of bookings are for projects that are primarily in the United States but had a diverse geographical dispersion. In Texas, we have signed a 119 megawatts 8 CPPA with Austin Energy. This is encouraging progress in a state with excellent solar resources and significant growth potential. Additionally, this is our first major domestic PPA award outside the Western United States and is evidence of the high priority we are placing on development activities in the South and Eastern portions of the country. 
With a number of other potential bookings opportunities that we continue to pursue, we expect more success in this region in the future. 
Going further east from Texas, we are continuing to see even more success across the South and Southeast. Under a nearly 200 megawatts DC module plus agreement with Silicone Range, we will be supplying projects across stats, such as Georgia, Mississippi and Tennessee. 
In Florida, we will be supplying 163 megawatts DC of modules to for 3 projects that will each utilize land leased from the military. These new bookings, in addition to the volume we have contracted with Strata, is growing evidence that customers recognize the strength of First Solar module technology in hot and specially humid environments. 
As we highlighted on last quarter's call, at the end of 2015, we expect to have a total energy density advantage as compared to multicrystalline silicon of around 5% in parts of the South and Southeast. This synergy density advantage represents a real increase in solar power plants output, which in turn, translates to greater value to our customers. 
Also highlighting the increasing interest in solar across the United States is the signing of EPC agreements to construct 3 projects in Indiana with American Electric Power. While the combined volume of these sites is smaller relative to other bookings in the quarter, it is significant in that we are seeing utilities demand for solar continuing to spread across new regions of the country. It also marks the beginning of a new relationship with another leading utility. 
Earlier this month, we announced the supply agreement with Clean Energy Selected to provide modules and other equipment to 4 projects in Colorado and Texas. Combined together, these projects introduce the concept of committee solar to nearly 1 million new potential residential users. 
Last December, we entered into a strategic partnership with CEC, and this is a further step in our ongoing relationship. With a superior as compared to solar and in an offering that greatly expands the potential for residential or business users to access solar power, in collaboration with their electric utility, we remain extremely optimistic about the long-term potential of Community Solar. 
Finally, international bookings this past quarter included third-party modules, fly agreements in India, Vietnam, Turkey and Malaysia. Moving onto Slide 6. Our bookings in terms of expected revenue have increased to $7.4 billion. The revenue increase is due to the strong bookings for the year partially offset by a higher mix of module and module plus deals in the new bookings as compared to the year-to-date revenue, which has a higher systems project mix. 
Turning to Slide 7, I will now cover our potential bookings opportunities, which have further increased to 17.4 gigawatts DC, an increase of approximately 700 megawatts from the prior quarter. The increase in potential bookings is especially in process in light of a couple of factors. 
First, our bookings opportunities were reduced by the  1.7 gigawatts of projects contracted. Second, we removed projects from the potential bookings list that we will not be able to contract due to supply constraints in 2016. The fact that our bookings opportunities is still increased despite these other items is a testament to the intense effort of our global sales team. 
Continuing on, our mid- to late stage bookings now stand at 3.9 gigawatts DC, an increase of 900 megawatts and a record number of advance stage opportunities. International bookings now make up over 85% of the potential mid-to late-stage bookings. 
Moving on to Slide 8, our updated potential bookings opportunities by geography show a significant mix shift to international opportunity. The opportunity outside of North America are now 13 gigawatts or 75% of the total. The largest growth of bookings opportunities since the prior quarter were in India and Latin America. Lastly, as we mentioned on our last call, we are planning to hold our next Analyst Day in 2016. We expect that timing to be in the first quarter of next year, following our Q4 earnings release. The specific date and webcast availability of the event will be shared at a later date. 
Now I'll turn it over to Mark who will provide detail on our preliminary third quarter financial results and discuss updated guidance for 2015."

As Jim indicated, there is a discrete income tax matter related to a holding company we have in a foreign jurisdiction. This item has recently come to our attention, and we are working to complete our assessment as quickly as possible. It's important to note, this is not subject of inactive audit or controversy with authorities. Rather, this is an internal evaluation of required mainly administrative compliance. Based on our preliminary analysis, the tax matter could have an adverse impact of up to $40 million. This issue is discrete, and doesn't have an impact on our ongoing operations. 
Finally, it is important to highlight that this matter does not affect any of our foreign tax holidays in place. We anticipate releasing complete financial results and filing our Form 10-Q on or prior to the filing deadline of November 9. 
Now turning to Slide 10. I'll discuss our third quarter operational performance. Production in the quarter was 654 megawatts DC, an increase of 15% from the prior quarter, due to higher module efficiency, increased manufacturing capacity and less downtime for technology upgrades. Production was 46% higher year-over-year, due to the restart of manufacturing lines, higher efficiency in the addition of new capacity. Our capacity utilization increased by 9 percentage points from the second quarter to 94%, due to lower upgrade activity across the fleet. Our best line average efficiency was 16.4% during the quarter, an increase of 20 basis points from the prior quarter and 210 basis points year-over-year. 
Going forward, our lead line efficiency will remain essentially at this level until the next scheduled technology upgrades are rolled out after the first half of 2016. 
Our third quarter average module efficiency for the entire fleet was 15.8%, an increase of 40 basis points quarter-over-quarter and 160 basis points higher year-over-year. 
Second quarter end -- since quarter end, we have made good progress rolling out the efficiency improvements across our production line, and currently, the fleet average efficiency is 16.1%. I'll now turn to slide 11 to discuss their primarily P&L. We have record quarterly net sales in the third quarter of $1.27 billion, an increase of $375 million from the prior quarter. The increase in sales resulted primarily from the sale of majority interest in the partially constructed Desert Stateline project to Southern. This is the first quarter we have recognized revenue on Desert, and all revenues since the project inception was recognized in Q2. Essentially, approximately 45% of the total project revenue was recognized in Q3. Going forward, revenue recognition will continue on a percentage of completion basis, and our results will reflect the specific quarterly project activity until COD, which anticipated to be Q3 of 2016. 
Revenue was off to a higher across multiple other systems projects and third-party module sales. As a percent of total sales, our solar power systems revenue, which includes both our EPC revenue and solar modules use and systems projects, was 95%, a decrease of 3 percentage points from the prior quarter. 
Module plus sales, which also include our solar power systems, revenue totaled approximately $130 million in Q3, approximately 30% higher quarter-over-quarter. The increase in third-party module sales was related to volume shipped to India and revenue recognized on module sales to projects in the U.K. 
Gross margin for the quarter was 38.1% compared to 18.4% in the second quarter. The significantly higher gross margin percentage resulted from a sale of majority interest in Desert Stateline, improvements in system project costs and a $70 million benefit from a decrease in our module collection recycling obligation. 
Since the inception of the module end-of-life program, we have continued to pursue engineering and process improvements to reduce the cost of collecting and recycling the molecules. Our continuous improvement efforts have resulted in an automated and continuous flow process, which has significantly lowered the cost of the end-of-life program. 
In Q3, we completed a cost study for our module collection recycling program and determined the estimated future EOL obligation should be reduced based on our new continuous flow cycling process. While the reduction of the current -- in the current period, primarily related to module shifting in prior fiscal years, the improved process represent a significant cost savings that benefit both for solar and shareholders. 
Additionally, in the third quarter, we achieved significant reduction in our fleet average module cost per watt. While we no longer provide specific module cost per watt information, the impact of continued efficiency and throughput improvements are resulting in a substantial benefit. This can be seen in our Q3 component segment gross margins of 22%, excluding the impact of the EOL change. 
Third quarter operating expenses, including plant start ups, decreased by $20 million from Q2 to $87 million. In addition to benefiting cost of goods sold, the reduction of our EOL obligation previously discussed benefited Q3 operating expenses by $10 million. In addition, start up expenses decreased associated with the TetraSun production ramp. Lastly, G&A expenses were also lower versus prior quarter. 
The third quarter operating profit was $398 million compared to operating profit of $57 million in Q2. The improvement was driven by higher revenue, improved gross margin and lower operating expenses. The preliminary tax rate for the quarter was 13%. We have preliminary quarterly earnings of $3.38 per fully diluted share, on net income of $346 million. This compares to earnings of $0.93 per share in the prior quarter. 
Moving onto Slide 12, I'll now discuss the selected balance sheet items and cash flow summary. Cash and marketable securities increased slightly by $34 million and remained at $1.8 billion. Our net cash position was unchanged at $1.5 billion. The increase in cash during the quarter resulted from the sale of majority interest in Desert Stateline, partially offset by cash used for the ongoing contraction of the projects that are being built on balance sheet. 
Note, on balance sheet, we are currently constructing 1.2 gigawatts AC of projects, which will achieve commercial operation over the next 5 quarters. 
Our net working capital, including the change in noncurrent project assets and excluding cash and marketable securities, increased by $55 million from the prior quarter. The increase was attributed to the increase in trade and unbilled accounts receivables, partially offset by reductions in inventory and payables. 
Total debt decreased from the prior quarter by $14 million to $286 million, primarily due to the scheduled payments on our Malaysian loan, partially offset by an increase in debt of $16 million. Cash flow from operations was $21 million compared to cash flow used in operations of $17 million in the quarter. Free cash flow was a negative $17 million compared to negative free cash flow of $47 million in Q2. Capital expenditures were $45 million, an increase of $6 million from the prior quarter. Depreciation for the quarter was $61 million or $2 million lower than the prior quarter. 
Turning to Slide 13, I will now discuss our updated and preliminary full year 2015 guidance. The following guidance is preliminary, pending the determination and financial impacts of the tax that I discussed previously. First, we have left our net sales range of $3.5 billion to $3.6 billion unchanged. We continue to expect our systems revenue, which includes both EPC and solar modules used in systems projects, to be in the range of 90% to 95% of total revenue for the year. We are raising gross margin guidance 300 basis points to a revised range of 24% to 10 25%. This is a result of the favorable cost improvements achieved in Q3, as well as the benefit from the decrease in our obligations. Operating expenses, including plant start up, have been lowered by $20 million, the revised range of $395 million to $405 million. 
In addition to the $10 million reduction from the decreased in the obligations, we are lowering operating expense guidance to reflect lower R&D testing costs and greater cost control focus. in our projected effective tax rate have increased to a range of 4% to 6%, reflecting our latest view of income mix. 
Note that this rate incorporates on a full year basis of a $28 million net tax benefit associated with the payables ruling from a foreign tax authority. As discussed on our last call, the benefit of favorable ruling in Q2 was $42 million. However, on a full year basis, the benefit it is now $28 million, due to the decrease in our EU obligation recognized in Q3. 
Preliminary earnings per share guidance at the midpoint has increased by nearly $1 per share to a revised range of $4.30 to $4.50 for fully diluted share. The increased earnings guidance reflects the $57 million benefit net of tax power lawyer obligation, balance of the higher guidance is from operational improvements realized in Q3 results and included in our Q4 forecast. 
Capital expenditure guidance is unchanged at $175 million to $200 million. The guidance range for our net ending cash and changing working capital have changed slightly as we have narrowed the previously range provided. Shipping guidance is unchanged from our prior expectation. Lastly, consistent with prior indications, our guidance for the remainder of the year does not anticipate any drop-down of assets into 8.3. 
Looking forward to 2016, we are planning to host a mid-December call to provide guidance for the 2016 calendar year. Given the level of visibility we have in 2016 at this point, we fell this would be an appropriate time to share our outlook with the investment community. The date and specific details of the call will be made available in the coming weeks. 
Turning to the next slide, I'll summarize our progress during the past quarter. First, we delivered outstanding financial results for the quarter, with sales of $1.3 billion, gross margin of over 38% and preliminary earnings of $3.38 per share. We have raised our full year preliminary guidance range to $4.30 to $4.50 on the strength of our Q3 earnings and ongoing operational improvements. Our technology continues to improve rapidly, with the Q3 fleet average efficiency of 15.8% and best line of lined 16.4%. Our pipeline continues to grow with record year-to-date bookings of 3.1 gigawatts. And the book-to-bill ratio for the year will be greater than 1:1. Potential bookings is of 17.4 gigawatts is going approximately 700 megawatts even as we reported record bookings. Our mid-to late-stage opportunities are also the strongest they've ever been with 3.9 gigawatts of project. With this, we conclude our prepared remarks and open up the call for questions. Operator?"

And with the dislocation we've seen in markets recently, I think my frank view is that sort of through the end of this year, there's going to be a degree of uncertainty on that so I don't think we would want to comment. I think as we move into 2016, capital markets should come down and we should begin to get some visibility on where those are going to end up and that will give us with a better visibility into the margins on the systems business."

We've left that in our capacity in 8.3 to manage those anticipated drop downs with the revolver, the late the term loan plus the efficiencies that we have embedded in the term structure. So what I would say, we're still moving forward and we believe we will be able to drop-down those assets to the right value equation to the sponsors and create accretions to 8.3. We'll continue to evaluate how the equity trades over time and will continue to assess how would structure assets beyond the first half of '16 the grass we said before, we made the to put leverage on these assets, which would then allow us to create a leverage yield to the 8.3 shareholder that is accretive. so there's other structuring options that we do have, that we're continuing to look at.

That clearly has no impact upon the bookings side of the equation, which was the strongest quarter in our history from that standpoint. In terms of can we continue to drive margin and competitiveness through cost reductions. As I have stated regularly, that the religion around here and we have a cost road map that will remain committed to, that extends well beyond where we are today. We've never backed away from that roadmap and we've continued to hit the road map that we laid out several years ago. Further, we continue to spend robustly on R&D, and we continue to build opportunities that will allow us that roadmap to extend beyond the commitments that we have today, particularly outside of the module and into the balance of system. And then at the corporate level, we continue to have a focus on growing the business while at the same time, getting leaner. And so, let's see our OpEx come down not only on a unit basis but also on an aggregate basis. And so, given how radically we've changed the business, the fact that we've maintained cost control from an OpEx standpoint, I think is a notable accomplishment for the organization. So there's no doubt on our part that we have the ability to continue to drive competitiveness and not in some narrow fashion, but broadly across the entire business, being very reflective of the decision to be vertically integrated and to give us the ability to target all aspects of the value chain."

I think there's a broad set that reasons. It has less to do with and more to do with cost structures getting down to a point where they represent a compelling value within the energy mix in that part of the country. As I have consistently said, there's a broad awakening on the part of utilities to the value that solar represents, and in particular, as they look forward to the clean power plant, as they look forward to constraints on the ability to operate existing coal plants or constructs new coal plants, they see an increase in shift towards natural gas, and accordingly, a significant exposure to natural gas commodities. And while natural gas is really very, very inexpensive today, everybody remains cautious and worried about future increases in that commodity. So it's broadly the ability to diversify their generation mix into a technology that is cost effective and affordable in the context of today's prices and also offers a significant hedge against future commodity prices. I think that it's that broad package of characteristics that is really what is compelling people to procure utilities, in particular, to include portable generation mix. Your other question."

We've chosen to partner with strategic with tax capacity. So I would say that one of the market is still very robust, as you can see with our ability to sell down Stateline into with Southern. Now what that means now is that more and more people will be looking to try to engage with the Dominion, the Berkshire, you can go down the line because they may be the most active buyers in the market. And what position of strength that we're in is that we have very strong relationships with a number of those parties.

We think we're in a fortunate position because we have very strong relationship with a number of those parties. But the other thing I would say is that these assets are very attractive.

One of the learning server the last several years is you cannot generalize about even within the same region, even neighboring countries, often times you can't generalize about what the basis makes for us is going to look like. So the way we think about development is, if we do development, we want to get paid for it. And when we say that what that means is we want to earn a return, that's above and beyond what we believe the margin or module plus type of would be if we're going to engage in the development process. And narrow markets where we go and we see the opportunity to get paid for being the developer. And there are markets where we absolutely do not see that opportunity. So when you look across the world, Japan is a market where we have felt that we can get paid for being the developer and we are very active in the development. India is a market where we feel we can get paid for being the developer and we are at this as a developer. What's difference is there are capital constraints in India that don't exist in other markets that limits how much development we're going to be able to do so we also are very aggressive on the module and module plus front in India. As we look at new and different markets around the world, there is an initial process that it takes us a little while to get on the ground and spend enough time in the markets to really whether this entitlement is going to just about development. I think it's fair to say that at this point, our method of operation is with the module. And then, as we began establish the market share, get some resource on the ground and get it market, we'll look hard at whether this is development opportunity. But I don't think you can generalize -- I don't think you could say all of the incremental demand internationally is going to be module only. That's certainly not a pretty thing about. But also think it's safe to say, it's not all going to be development. Development is OpEx and it is always complicated in a new market. And so can only take on some many new markets at a time without driving our OpEx to unacceptable levels. And so, it's going to be a balance between let's take the OpEx resources that we chose to live within and let's apply those in the markets we're going to development standpoint. And then, let's go with a lesser in other markets where we can capture market share on an OpEx like basis, admittedly, at probably lower margins but still accretive to the overall outcome for the company."

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. As indicated in our press release, we have issued preliminary financial results for the third quarter while we complete an analysis of the discrete income tax matter related to a foreign tax jurisdiction. While Mark will discuss this matter in more detail later, I wish to emphasize that this matter does not have any adverse impact on the ongoing operations of the company. We are working towards a full and timely resolution of the issue. Now let me turn to an update on the business and the outstanding performance of this past quarter. 
In the third quarter, we had tremendous execution across all parts of the organization, which has resulted in strong results from a financial bookings and technology standpoint. Before further discussing these points, it is worth taking a moment to reflect on the progress we have made as a company over the past several years. 
In 2012, First Solar and the entire solar industry faced a period of disruption, resulting from declines in unsustainable subsidized solar markets. At our Q1 2012 earnings call, we laid out a 5-year plan and identify key 2016 financial targets to focus the organization and create value for our shareholders. As we near the end of year 4 of this plan, with year-to-date bookings of 3.1 gigawatts, earnings guidance of over $4 per share and the strongest technology position in our company's history, it warrants recognizing the tremendous progress that has been made towards these objectives since 2012. 
With the vision 2020 plan that we introduced last quarter, we will continue this pattern of setting challenging goals and working to achieve them. 
Turning to our technology performance in the third quarter. Our fleet average efficiency improved to 15.8%, a 40-basis-point improvement from the second quarter. Our lead line efficiency averaged 16.4%, a 20-basis-point improvement quarter-over-quarter and a 210-basis-point improvement versus Q3 2014. A more modest improvement in the sequential lead line efficiency relative to prior quarters is a reflection of an intentional and temporary pole of the new technology implementations. As we have stated previously, we are completing the rollout of our technology upgrades across the entire fleet this year. 
In the first half of 2016, we will prioritize full production utilization in order to meet strong demands and then resume the implementation of new module efficiency programs thereafter. 
Next, we are very pleased with our progress in securing new business for the future. Slide 5 highlights our year-to-date bookings, which now stand at 3.1 gigawatts. With 2 months left in the year, we have already set a new annual bookings records and anticipate adding to this total before the end of the year. With at least 3.1 gigawatts of bookings for the year and projected full year shipments of approximately 2.9 gigawatts, we will once again exceed our goal of a 1:1 book-to-bill ratio. 
Our total 1.7 gigawatts of bookings since last earnings call are not only impressive in size, but also reflects some positive indications of utility scale solar demand in the U.S. after 2016. Approximately 60% or over 1 gigawatt DC of the total 1.7 gigawatt DC growth to our projects in the U.S. that has commercial operation dates after 2016. Approximately 630 megawatts DC of this volume represent PPAs that have been signed with a leading utility in the Western United States and span across 4 projects, which are anticipated to commence delivering power into the utilities here in late 2019. 
As with other PPA awards, these projects are subject to final utility commission approval. More details will be made public at a later date regarding these projects. 
We also signed an incremental 400 megawatt DC module supply agreement with Strata Solar. All of these volumes scheduled for delivery to Strata in 2017 and 2018. We have now signed agreements with Strata for over 1 gigawatt of volume, which signifies the growing importance of our relationship and also demonstrates the strength of demand for solar in the Southeastern United States. 
We are encouraged by these bookings with longer dated CODs and see this as an initial positive indication, particularly with respect to volumes. We still remain cautious on expectations regarding margins after 2016, given the limited visibility we have into the total business segment mix and the systems margins, given recent uncertainties and volatility in respect to profit capital for solar projects. 
However, we continue to believe that the growing affordability of solar, which is enabled by our cost road map, is an attractive value proposition for the utilities. We also believe that the characteristics of utilities still solar plants as long-term contracted assets with no commodity price risk will increasingly represent a compelling investment opportunity for a wide variety of investors and continue to drive low cost of capital for the industry. 
Looking at the remaining portion of the 1.7 gigawatts of new bookings since last call, approximately 650 megawatts are for projects for CODs during 2016. With the addition of these projects, we have nearly 2 gigawatts of 2016 volume fully contracted. When taking into account the significant number of mid- to late-stage opportunities, on a probability-weighted basis, all of our supply is fully allocated for 2016. 
The 650 megawatts of bookings are for projects that are primarily in the United States, but had a diverse geographical dispersion. In Texas, we have signed in a 119 megawatts AC PPA with Austin Energy. This is encouraging progress in a state with excellent solar resources and significant growth potential. Additionally, this is our first major domestic PPA award outside the Western United States and is evidence of the high priority we are placing on development activities in the South and Eastern portions of the country. 
With a number of other potential bookings opportunities that we continue to pursue, we expect more success in this region in the future.
Going further east from Texas, we are continuing to see even more success across the South and Southeast. Under a nearly 200 megawatts DC module plus agreement with Silicon Ranch, we will be supplying projects across states such as Georgia, Mississippi and Tennessee. 
In Florida, we will be supplying 163 megawatts DC of modules to [indiscernible] for 3 projects that will each utilize land leased from the military. These new bookings, in addition to the volume we have contracted with Strata, is growing evidence that customers recognize the strength of First Solar module technology in hot and especially humid environments. 
As we highlighted on last quarter's call, at the end of 2015, we expect having a total energy density advantage as compared to multicrystalline silicon of around 5% in parts of the South and Southeast. This synergy density advantage represents a real increase in solar power plants output, which, in turn, translates to greater value to our customers. 
Also highlighting the increasing interest in solar across the United States is our signing of EPC agreements to construct 3 projects in Indiana with American Electric Power. While this combined volume of these sites is smaller relative to other bookings in the quarter, it is significant in that we are seeing utilities demand for solar continuing to spread across new regions of the country. It also marks the beginning of a new relationship with another leading utility. 
Earlier this month, we announced the supply agreement with Clean Energy Collective to provide modules and other equipment to 4 projects in Colorado and Texas. Combined together, these projects introduce the concept of committee solar to nearly 1 million new potential residential users. 
Last December, we entered into a strategic partnership with CEC, and this is a further step in our ongoing relationship. With a superior cost structure as compared to RESOP solar and an offering may greatly expand the potential for residential or business users to access solar power, in collaboration with their electric utility. We remain extremely optimistic about the long-term potential of Community Solar. 
Finally, international bookings this past quarter included third-party modules, fly agreements in India, Vietnam, Turkey and Malaysia.
Moving onto Slide 6. Our bookings in terms of expected revenue have increased to $7.4 billion. The revenue increase is due to the strong bookings for the year, partially offset by a higher mix of Module and Modules Plus deals in the new bookings as compared to the year-to-date revenue, which has a higher systems project mix. 
Turning to Slide 7, I will now cover our potential bookings opportunities, which have further increased to 17.4 gigawatts DC, an increase of approximately 700 megawatts from the prior quarter. The increase in potential bookings is especially in process in light of a couple of factors. First, our bookings opportunities were reduced by the 1.7 gigawatts of projects contracted. Second, we removed projects from the potential bookings list that we will not be able to contract due to supply constraints in 2016. The fact that our bookings opportunities is still increased despite these other items is a testament to the intense effort by our global sales team. 
Continuing on, our mid- to late-stage bookings now stand at 3.9 gigawatts DC, an increase of 900 megawatts and a record number of advanced stage opportunities. International bookings now make up over 85% of the potential mid- to late-stage bookings. 
Moving on to Slide 8, our updated potential bookings opportunities by geography show a significant mix shift to international opportunities. The opportunities outside of North America are now 13 gigawatts or 75% of the total. The largest growth of bookings opportunities since the prior quarter were in India and Latin America. Lastly, as we mentioned on our last call, we are planning to hold our next Analyst Day in 2016. We expect that timing to be in the first quarter of next year, following our Q4 earnings release. The specific date and webcast availability of the event will be shared at a later date. 
Now I'll turn it over to Mark who will provide detail on our preliminary third quarter financial results and discuss updated guidance for 2015."

As Jim indicated, there is a discrete income tax matter related to a holding company we have in a foreign jurisdiction. This item has recently come to our attention, and we are working to complete our assessment as quickly as possible. It's important to note, this item is not a subject of an active audit or controversy with tax authorities. Rather, this is an internal evaluation of required mainly administrative compliance. Based on our preliminary analysis, the tax matter could have an adverse impact of up to $40 million. This issue is discrete, and does not have an impact on our ongoing operations. 
Finally, it is important to highlight that this matter does not affect any of our foreign tax holidays in place. We anticipate releasing complete financial results and filing our Form 10-Q on or prior to the filing deadline of November 9. 
Now turning to Slide 10. I'll discuss our third quarter operational performance. Production in the quarter was 654 megawatts DC, an increase of 16% from the prior quarter, due to higher module efficiency, increased manufacturing capacity and less downtime for technology upgrades. Production was 46% higher year-over-year, due to the restart of manufacturing lines, higher efficiency and the addition of new capacity. Our factory capacity utilization increased by 9 percentage points from the second quarter to 94%, due to the lower upgrade activity across the fleet. Our best line average efficiency was 16.4% during the quarter, an increase of 20 basis points from the prior quarter and 210 basis points year-over-year. 
Going forward, our lead line efficiency will remain essentially at this level, until the next scheduled technology upgrades are rolled out after the first half of 2016. 
Our third quarter average module efficiency for the entire fleet was 15.8%, an increase of 40 basis points quarter-over-quarter and 160 basis points higher year-over-year. 
Second quarter end -- since quarter end, we have made good progress rolling out the efficiency improvements across our production line, and currently, the fleet average efficiency is 16.1%.
I'll now turn to slide 11 to discuss the preliminary P&L. We have record quarterly net sales in the third quarter of $1.27 billion, an increase of $375 million from the prior quarter. The increase in sales resulted primarily from the sale of majority interests in the partially constructed Desert Stateline project to Southern. This is the first quarter we have recognized revenue on Desert Stateline, and all revenues since the project inception was recognized in Q3. Potentially, approximately 45% of the total project revenue was recognized in Q3. Going forward, revenue recognition will continue on a percentage of completion basis, and our results will reflect a specific quarterly project activity until COD, which is anticipated to be Q3 of 2016. 
Revenue was also higher across multiple other systems projects and third-party module sales. As a percent of total sales, our solar power systems revenue, which includes both our EPC revenue and solar modules use and systems projects, was 95%, a decrease of 3 percentage points from the prior quarter. 
Module Plus sales, which also include our solar power systems, revenue totaled approximately $130 million in Q3, approximately 30% higher quarter-over-quarter. The increase in third-party module sales was related to volume shipped to India and revenue recognized on module sales to projects in the U.K. 
Gross margin for the quarter was 38.1%, compared to 18.4% in the second quarter. The significantly higher gross margin percentage resulted from a sale of majority interest in Desert Stateline, improvements in system project costs and a $70 million benefit from a decrease in our module collection recycling obligation. 
Since the inception of the module end-of-life program, we have continued to pursue engineering and process improvement to reduce the cost of collecting and recycling the modules. Our continuous improvement efforts have resulted in an automated and continuous flow process, which has significantly lowered the cost of the end-of-life program. 
In Q3, we completed a cost study for our module collection recycling program and determined the estimated future EOL obligation should be reduced based on our new continuous flow cycling process. While the reduction of the current -- in the current period, primarily related to module shift in prior fiscal years, the improved process represent significant cost savings that benefit both First Solar and its shareholders. 
Additionally, in the third quarter, we achieved significant reduction in our fleet average module cost per watt. While we no longer provide specific module cost per watt information, the impact of continued efficiency and throughput improvements are resulting in a substantial benefit. This can be seen in our Q3 component segment gross margin of 22%, excluding the impact of the EOL change. 
Third quarter operating expenses, including plant start-up, decreased by $20 million from Q2 to $87 million. In addition to benefiting cost of goods sold, the reduction in our EOL obligation previously discussed benefited Q3 operating expenses by $10 million. In addition, start-up expenses decreased associated with the TetraSun production ramp. Lastly, G&A expenses were also lower versus the prior quarter. 
The third quarter operating profit was $398 million compared to operating profit of $57 million in Q2. The improvement was driven by higher revenue, improved gross margin and lower operating expenses. The preliminary tax rate for the quarter was 13%. We had preliminary quarterly earnings of $3.38 per a fully diluted share, on net income of $346 million. This compares to earnings of $0.93 per share in the prior quarter. 
Moving onto Slide 12, I'll now discuss the selected balance sheet items and cash flow summary. Cash and marketable securities increased slightly by $34 million and remained at $1.8 billion. Our net cash position was unchanged at $1.5 billion. The increase in cash during the quarter resulted from the sale of majority interest in Desert Stateline, partially offset by cash used for the ongoing contraction of the projects that are being built on balance sheet. 
Note, on balance sheet, we are currently constructing 1.2 gigawatts AC of projects, which will achieve commercial operation over the next 5 quarters. 
Our net working capital, including the change in noncurrent project assets and excluding cash and marketable securities, increased by $55 million from the prior quarter. The increase was attributed to the increase in trade and unbilled accounts receivables, partially offset by reductions in inventories and payables. 
Total debt decreased from the prior quarter by $14 million to $286 million, primarily due to the scheduled payments on our Malaysian loan, partially offset by an increase [indiscernible] debt of $16 million. Cash flow from operations was $21 million compared to cash flow used in operations of $17 million in the quarter. Free cash flow was a negative $17 million compared to negative free cash flow of $47 million in Q2. Capital expenditures were $45 million, an increase of $6 million from the prior quarter. Free cash for the quarter was $61 million or $2 million lower than the prior quarter. 
Turning to Slide 13, I will now discuss our updated and preliminary full year 2015 guidance. The following guidance is preliminary, pending the determination and financial impacts of the tax that I discussed previously. First, we have left our net sales range of $3.5 billion to $3.6 billion unchanged. We continue to expect our systems revenue, which includes both EPC and solar modules used in systems projects, to be in the range of 90% to 95% of total revenue for the year. We are raising gross margin guidance 300 basis points to a revised range of 24% to 25%. This is a result of the favorable cost improvements achieved in Q3, as well as the benefit from the decrease in our EOL obligations. Operating expenses, including plant start-up, have been lowered by $20 million, the revised range of $395 million up to $405 million. 
In addition to the $10 million reduction from a decrease in EOL obligations, we are lowering operating expense guidance to reflect lower R&D testing costs and greater cost control focus. Our full year projected effective tax rate has increased to a range of 4% to 6%, reflecting our latest view of jurisdictional income mix. 
Note that this rate incorporates on a full year basis, a $28 million net tax benefit associated with the payables ruling from a foreign tax authority. As discussed on our last call, the benefit of favorable ruling in Q2 was $42 million. However, on a full year basis, the benefit it is now estimated to be $28 million, due to the decrease in our EOL obligation recognized in Q3. 
Preliminary earnings per share guidance at the midpoint has increased by nearly $1 per share to a revised range of $4.30 to $4.50 for fully diluted share. The increased earnings guidance reflects the $0.60 benefit, net of tax from our lower EOL obligation. Balance of the higher guidance is from operational improvements realized in Q3 results and included in our Q4 forecast. 
Capital expenditure guidance is unchanged at $175 million to $200 million. The guidance range for our net ending cash and changing working capital have changed slightly as we have narrowed the previously range provided. Shipping guidance is unchanged from our prior expectation. Lastly, consistent with prior indications, our guidance for the remainder of the year does not anticipate any drop-down of assets into 8.3. 
Looking forward to 2016, we are planning to host a mid-December call to provide guidance for the 2016 calendar year. Given the level of visibility we have in 2016 at this point, we feel that this would be an appropriate time to share our outlook with the investment community. The date and specific details of the call will be made available in the coming weeks. 
Turning to the next slide, I'll summarize our progress during the past quarter. First, we delivered outstanding financial results for the quarter, with sales of $1.3 billion, gross margin of over 38% and preliminary earnings of $3.38 per share. We have raised our full year preliminary guidance range to $4.30 to $4.50 on the strength of our Q3 earnings and ongoing operational improvements. Our technology continues to improve rapidly, with the Q3 fleet average efficiency of 15.8% and the best line of 16.4%. Our pipeline continues to grow with record year-to-date bookings of 3.1 gigawatts. And the book-to-bill ratio for the year will be greater than 1:1. Potential bookings of 17.4 gigawatts is going approximately 700 megawatts, even as we reported record bookings. Our mid- to late-stage opportunities are also the strongest they've ever been, with 3.9 gigawatts of project. With this, we conclude our prepared remarks and open up the call for questions.

And primarily because with respect to the systems business, that's going to be dependent upon ultimate realization of those projects, which is going to depend upon the relevant discount rates and/or cost of capital. And with the dislocation we've seen in markets recently, I think my frank view is that sort of through the end of this year, there's going to be a degree of uncertainty on that. So I don't think we would want to comment. I think as we move into 2016, capital markets should calm down, and we should begin to get some visibility on where those discount rates are going to end up, and that will give us better visibility into the margins on the systems business."

So we feel confident with the long-term margin capture that will capture all of that.

We've also indicated that we did not have need to raise capital at this point in time. We've left that in our capacity in 8.3 to manage those anticipated drop-downs with the revolver to later on the term loan the efficiencies that we have embedded in the term structure. So what I would say, we're still moving forward, and we believe we will be able to drop down those assets to the right value equation to the sponsors and create accretions to 8.3. We'll continue to evaluate how the equity trades over time and will continue to assess how we would structure assets beyond the first half of '16, as we said before, we may live to put leverage on these assets, which would then allow us to create a leverage yield to the 8.3 shareholder that is accretive. so there's other structuring options that we do have, that we're continuing to look at. But beyond the first half of '16, we would say we're committed on the drop-downs. We'll continue to evaluate from the market and ensure that the drop-downs makes sense in the latter half of '16."

And on the other -- clearly, we benefited from a project that's been part of the portfolio for a long time, and everybody's known about the operational performance. This quarter clearly extends well beyond that. That clearly had no impact upon the bookings side of the equation, which was the strongest quarter in our history from that standpoint. In terms of can we continue to drive margin and competitiveness through cost reductions, as I have stated regularly that the religion around here and we have a cost road map that we remain committed to, that extends well beyond where we are today, we've never backed away from that roadmap and we've continued to hit the road map that we laid out several years ago. Further, we continue to spend robustly on R&D, and we continue to build opportunities that will allow that roadmap to extend beyond the commitments that we have today, particularly outside of the module and into the balance of system. And then at the corporate level, we continue to have a focus on growing the business while, at the same time, getting leaner. And so, we want to see our OpEx come down, not only on a unit basis, but also on an aggregate basis. And so given how radically we've changed the business, the fact that we've maintained cost control from an OpEx standpoint, I think is a notable accomplishment for the organization. So there's no doubt on our part that we have the ability to continue to drive competitiveness and not in some narrow fashion, but broadly across the entire business, being very reflective of the decision to be vertically integrated and to give us the ability to target all aspects of the value chain."

I think there's a broad set of reasons. It has less to do with state rags and more to do with cost structures getting down to a point where they represent a compelling value within the energy mix in that part of the country. As I have consistently said, there's a broad awakening on the part of utilities to the value that solar represents, and in particular, as they look forward to the clean power plant, as they look forward to constraints on the ability to operate existing coal plants or construct new coal plants, they see an increasing shift towards natural gas and, accordingly, a significant exposure to natural gas commodities. And while natural gas is very, very inexpensive today, everybody remains cautious and worried about future increases in that commodity. So it's broadly the ability to diversify their generation mix into a technology that is cost effective and affordable in the context of today's prices and also offers a significant hedge against future commodity prices. I think that it's that broad package of characteristics that is really what is compelling people to procure utilities, in particular, to include probable take in their generation mix.

It also speaks to the fact that as our product has improved, as our efficiency has improved, as our spectral response has improved, we're just increasingly competitive across the broader set of geographies, and that makes it possible for us to go out and compete in these geographies.

It's the balance of system, and it's all aspects of the balance of system, from the structures to materials to material costs to the means and methods of construction.

So as we drive up the efficiency of the module effectively, it reduces the variable balance of system that is needed to install every megawatt of energy that we put into the system. So you can look at as an isolation, but as we continue to drive efficiency, it will naturally drive down the balance of system cost. And that will help us move towards the cost road map that we've laid out."

In some cases, they've indicated it could be over in the next year, it could be longer. But we have, historically, not sold to any YieldCos or traditional tax equity structures, right. We've chosen to partner with -- strategics with tax capacity. So I would say that part of the market is still very robust, as you can see with our ability to sell down Stateline into live with the Southern. Now what that means, though, is that more and more people will be looking to try to engage with the Dominion, the Southern, the Berkshire, you can go down the line, because they may be the most active buyers in the market. And what position of strength that we're in is that we have very strong relationships with a number of those parties. They obviously love the First Solar brand, they love the First Solar relationships, they love the comfort. And so I'm sure that there will be some impact in the market. I think we think we're in a fortunate position, because we have very strong relationship with a number of those parties. But the other thing I would say is that these assets are very attractive. I mean, there's a number of parties that want to have solar assets, long-dated contracted assets with investment-grade counterparties, and the ability to acquire or that will come to market in '16 relative to potentially what could be in the market in '17 and '18 is there's a window that may be closing in terms of the number of projects that can be acquired.

So each -- we look at each market discreetly. One of the, I think, learnings over the last several years is that you cannot generalize about -- even within the same region, even neighboring countries, often times you can't generalize about what the business mix for us is going to look like. So the way we think about development is, if we do development, we want to get paid for it. And when we say that, what that means is that we want to earn a return that's above and beyond whatever we believe the margin or module plus type of entitlement would be, if we're going to engage in the development process. And there are markets where we go and we see the opportunity to get paid for being the developer. And there are markets where we absolutely do not see that opportunity. So when you look across the world, Japan is a market where we have felt that we can get paid for being the developer, and we are very active in the development. India is a market where we feel we can get paid for being a developer, and we are at this as a developer. What's difference is there are capital constraints in India that don't exist in other markets. There is a limits how much development we're going to be able to do, so we also are very aggressive on the module and module plus fronts in India. As we look at new and different markets around the world, there is an initial process that it takes us a little while to get on the ground and spend enough time in the markets to really figure out whether there is an entitlement that is going to justify development. I think it's fair to say that at this point, our method of operation is let's lead with the module. And then, as we begin to establish the market share, get some resource on the ground and get a greater understanding of the market, we'll look hard at whether we think there is a development opportunity. But I don't think you can generalize. I don't think you could say all of the incremental demand internationally is going to be module only. That's certainly not what we're thinking about it. But I also think it's safe to say, it's not all going to be development. Development is OpEx and census. It is always complicated in a new market. And so we can only take on so many new markets at a time without driving our OpEx to unacceptable levels. And so, it's going to be a balance between -- okay, let's take the OpEx resources that we chose to live within and let's apply those in the markets we're going to get greater saving [ph] for our work from a development standpoint. And then, let's go with a lesser stealth [ph] in other markets where we can capture market share on an OpEx like basis, admittedly, at probably lower margins, but still accretive to the overall outcome for the company."

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. As indicated in our press release, we have issued preliminary financial results for the third quarter while we complete an analysis of a discrete income tax matter related to a foreign tax jurisdiction. While Mark will discuss this matter in more detail later, I wish to emphasize that this matter does not have any adverse impact on the ongoing operations of the company. We are working towards a full and timely resolution of the issue. 
Now let me turn to an update on the business and the outstanding performance of this past quarter.  In the third quarter, we had tremendous execution across all parts of the organization, which has resulted in strong results from a financial bookings and technology standpoint. Before further discussing these points, it is worth taking a moment to reflect on the progress we have made as a company over the past several years. 
In 2012, First Solar and the entire solar industry faced a period of disruption, resulting from declines in unsustainable subsidized solar markets. 
At our Q1 2012 earnings call, we laid out a 5-year plan and identify key 2016 financial targets to focus the organization and create value for our shareholders. As we near the end of year 4 of this plan, with year-to-date bookings of 3.1 gigawatts, earnings guidance of over $4 per share and the strongest technology position in our company's history, it warrants recognizing the tremendous progress that has been made towards these objectives since 2012. 
With the vision 2020 plan that we introduced last quarter, we will continue this pattern of setting challenging goals and working to achieve them. 
Turning to our technology performance in the third quarter. Our fleet average efficiency improved to 15.8%, a 40-basis-point improvement from the second quarter. Our lead line efficiency averaged 16.4%, a 20-basis-point improvement quarter-over-quarter and a 210-basis-point improvement versus Q3 2014. A more modest improvement in the sequential lead line efficiency relative to prior quarters is a reflection of an intentional and temporary pause in new technology implementations. As we stated previously, we are completing the rollout of our technology upgrades across the entire fleet this year. 
In the first half of 2016, we will prioritize full production utilization in order to meet strong demand and then resume the implementation of new module efficiency programs thereafter. 
Next, we are very pleased with our progress in securing new business for the future. Slide 5 highlights our year-to-date bookings, which now stand at 3.1 gigawatts. With 2 months left in the year, we have already set a new annual bookings record and anticipate adding to this total before the end of the year. With at least 3.1 gigawatts of bookings for the year and projected full year shipments of approximately 2.9 gigawatts, we will once again exceed our goal of a 1:1 book-to-bill ratio. 
Our total 1.7 gigawatts of bookings since last earnings call are not only impressive in size, but also reflects some positive indications of utility scale solar demand in the U.S. after 2016. 
Approximately 60% or over 1 gigawatt DC of the total 1.7 gigawatt DC booked are projects in the U.S. that has commercial operation dates after 2016. Approximately 630 megawatts DC of this volume represent PPAs that have been signed with a leading utility in the Western United States and span across 4 projects, which are anticipated to commence delivering power into the utilities grid in late 2019. 
As with other PPA awards, these projects are subject to final utility commission approval. More details will be made public at a later date regarding these projects. 
We also signed an incremental 400 megawatt DC module supply agreement with Strata Solar. All of this volume is scheduled for delivery to Strata in 2017 and 2018. We have now signed agreements with Strata for over 1 gigawatt of volume, which signifies the growing importance of our relationship and also demonstrates the strength of demand for solar in the Southeastern United States. 
We are encouraged by these bookings with longer dated CODs and see this as an initial positive indication, particularly with respect to volumes. We still remain cautious on expectations regarding margins after 2016, given the limited visibility we have into the total business segment mix and the systems margins, given recent uncertainties and volatility in respect to cost of capital for solar projects. 
However, we continue to believe that the growing affordability of solar, which is enabled by our cost road map, is an attractive value proposition for utilities. We also believe that the characteristics of utilities still solar plants as long-term contracted assets with no commodity price risk will increasingly represent a compelling investment opportunity for a wide variety of investors and continue to drive low cost of capital for the industry. 
Looking at the remaining portion of the 1.7 gigawatts of new bookings since last call, approximately 650 megawatts are for projects with CODs during 2016. With the addition of these projects, we have nearly 2 gigawatts of 2016 volume fully contracted. When taking into account the significant number of mid- to late-stage opportunities, on a probability-weighted basis, all of our supply is fully allocated for 2016. 
The 650 megawatts of bookings are for projects that are primarily in the United States, but had a diverse geographical dispersion. In Texas, we have signed in a 119 megawatts AC PPA with Austin Energy. 
This is encouraging progress in a state with excellent solar resources and significant growth potential. Additionally, this is our first major domestic PPA award outside the Western United States and is evidence of the high priority we are placing on development activities in the South and Eastern portions of the country. 
With a number of other potential bookings opportunities that we continue to pursue, we expect more success in this region in the future.
Going further east from Texas, we are continuing to see even more success across the South and Southeast. Under a nearly 200 megawatts DC module plus agreement with Silicon Ranch, we will be supplying projects across states such as Georgia, Mississippi and Tennessee. 
In Florida, we will be supplying 163 megawatts DC of modules to [indiscernible] for 3 projects that will each utilize land leased from the military. These new bookings, in addition to the volume we have contracted with Strata, is growing evidence that customers recognize the strength of First Solar module technology in hot and especially humid environments. 
As we highlighted on last quarter's call, at the end of 2015, we expect having a total energy density advantage as compared to multicrystalline silicon of around 5% in parts of the South and Southeast. This energy density advantage represents a real increase in solar power plants output, which, in turn, translates to greater value to our customers. 
Also highlighting the increasing interest in solar across the United States is our signing of EPC agreements to construct 3 projects in Indiana with American Electric Power. While the combined volume of these sites is smaller relative to other bookings in the quarter, it is significant in that we are seeing utilities demand for solar continuing to spread across new regions of the country. It also marks the beginning of a new relationship with another leading utility. 
Earlier this month, we announced the supply agreement with Clean Energy Collective to provide modules and other equipment to 4 projects in Colorado and Texas. Combined together, these projects introduce the concept of community solar to nearly 1 million new potential residential users. 
Last December, we entered into a strategic partnership with CEC, and this is a further step in that ongoing relationship. With a superior cost structure, as compared to RESOP solar, and an offering that greatly expands the potential for residential or business users to access solar power, in collaboration with their electric utility, we remain extremely optimistic about the long-term potential of Community Solar. 
Finally, international bookings this past quarter included third-party modules, supply agreements in India, Vietnam, Turkey and Malaysia.
Moving onto Slide 6. Our bookings in terms of expected revenue have increased to $7.4 billion. The revenue increase is due to the strong bookings for the year, partially offset by a higher mix of Module and Modules Plus deals in the new bookings as compared to the year-to-date revenue, which has a higher systems project mix. 
Turning to Slide 7, I will now cover our potential bookings opportunities, which have further increased to 17.4 gigawatts DC, an increase of approximately 700 megawatts from the prior quarter. The increase in potential bookings is especially impressive in light of a couple of factors. 
First, our bookings opportunities were reduced by the 1.7 gigawatts of projects contracted. Second, we removed projects from the potential bookings list that we will not be able to contract due to supply constraints in 2016. The fact that our bookings opportunities still increased despite these other items is a testament to the intense effort by our global sales team. 
Continuing on, our mid- to late-stage bookings now stand at 3.9 gigawatts DC, an increase of 900 megawatts and a record number of advanced stage opportunities. International bookings now make up over 85% of the potential mid- to late-stage bookings. 
Moving on to Slide 8, our updated potential bookings opportunities by geography show a significant mix shift to international opportunities. The opportunities outside of North America are now 13 gigawatts or 75% of the total. The largest growth of bookings opportunities since the prior quarter were in India and Latin America. 
Lastly, as we mentioned on our last call, we are planning to hold our next Analyst Day in 2016. We expect that timing to be in the first quarter of next year, following our Q4 earnings release. The specific date and webcast availability of the event will be shared at a later date. 
Now I'll turn it over to Mark who will provide detail on our preliminary third quarter financial results and discuss updated guidance for 2015."

As Jim indicated, there is a discrete income tax matter related to a holding company we have in a foreign jurisdiction. This item has recently come to our attention, and we are working to complete our assessment as quickly as possible. 
It's important to note, this item is not a subject of an active audit or controversy with tax authorities. Rather, this is an internal evaluation of required mainly administrative compliance. Based on our preliminary analysis, the tax matter could have an adverse impact of up to $40 million. This issue is discrete, and does not have an impact on our ongoing operations. 
Finally, it is important to highlight that this matter does not affect any of our foreign tax holidays in place. We anticipate releasing complete financial results and filing our Form 10-Q on or prior to the filing deadline of November 9. 
Now turning to Slide 10. I'll discuss our third quarter operational performance. Production in the quarter was 654 megawatts DC, an increase of 16% from the prior quarter, due to higher module efficiency, increased manufacturing capacity and less downtime for technology upgrades. 
Production was 46% higher year-over-year, due to the restart of manufacturing lines, higher efficiency and the addition of new capacity. Our factory capacity utilization increased by 9 percentage points from the second quarter to 94%, due to the lower upgrade activity across the fleet. 
Our best line average efficiency was 16.4% during the quarter, an increase of 20 basis points from the prior quarter and 210 basis points year-over-year. 
Going forward, our lead line efficiency will remain essentially at this level, until the next scheduled technology upgrades are rolled out after the first half of 2016. 
Our third quarter average module efficiency for the entire fleet was 15.8%, an increase of 40 basis points quarter-over-quarter and 160 basis points higher year-over-year. 
Second quarter end -- since quarter end, we have made good progress rolling out the efficiency improvements across our production line, and currently, the fleet average efficiency is 16.1%.
I'll now turn to slide 11 to discuss the preliminary P&L. We had record quarterly net sales in the third quarter of $1.27 billion, an increase of $375 million from the prior quarter. The increase in sales resulted primarily from the sale of majority interests in the partially constructed Desert Stateline project to Southern. 
This is the first quarter we have recognized revenue on Desert Stateline, and all revenues since the project inception was recognized in Q3. Potentially, approximately 45% of the total project revenue was recognized in Q3. 
Going forward, revenue recognition will continue on a percentage of completion basis, and our results will reflect the specific quarterly project activity until COD, which is anticipated to be Q3 of 2016. 
Revenue was also higher across multiple other systems projects and third-party module sales. As a percent of total sales, our solar power systems revenue, which includes both our EPC revenue and solar modules used in systems projects was 95%, a decrease of 3 percentage points from the prior quarter. 
Module Plus sales, which also include our solar power systems, revenue totaled approximately $130 million in Q3, approximately 30% higher quarter-over-quarter. The increase in third-party module sales was related to volume shipped to India and revenue recognized on module sales to projects in the U.K. 
Gross margin for the quarter was 38.1%, compared to 18.4% in the second quarter. The significantly higher gross margin percentage resulted from a sale of majority interest in Desert Stateline, improvements in system project costs and a $70 million benefit from a decrease in our module collection recycling obligation. 
Since the inception of the module end-of-life program, we have continued to pursue engineering and process improvements to reduce the cost of collecting and recycling the modules. Our continuous improvement efforts have resulted in an automated and continuous flow process, which has significantly lowered the cost of the end-of-life program. 
In Q3, we completed a cost study for our module collection recycling program and determined the estimated future EOL obligation should be reduced based on our new continuous flow cycling process. 
While the reduction of the current -- in the current period, primarily related to module shift in prior fiscal years, the improved process represent significant cost savings that benefit both First Solar and its shareholders. 
Additionally, in the third quarter, we achieved significant reduction in our fleet average module cost per watt. While we no longer provide specific module cost per watt information, the impact of continued efficiency and throughput improvements are resulting in a substantial benefit. This can be seen in our Q3 component segment gross margin of 22%, excluding the impact of the EOL change. 
Third quarter operating expenses, including plant start-ups, decreased by $20 million from Q2 to $87 million. In addition to benefiting cost of goods sold, the reduction of our EOL obligation previously discussed benefited Q3 operating expenses by $10 million. In addition, start-up expenses decreased associated with the TetraSun production ramp. Lastly, G&A expenses were also lower versus the prior quarter. 
The third quarter operating profit was $398 million compared to operating profit of $57 million in Q2. The improvement was driven by higher revenue, improved gross margin and lower operating expenses. The preliminary tax rate for the quarter was 13%. We had preliminary quarterly earnings of $3.38 per fully diluted share, on net income of $346 million. This compares to earnings of $0.93 per share in the prior quarter. 
Moving onto Slide 12, I'll now discuss the selected balance sheet items and cash flow summary. Cash and marketable securities increased slightly by $34 million and remained at $1.8 billion. Our net cash position was unchanged at $1.5 billion. The increase in cash during the quarter resulted from the sale of majority interest in Desert Stateline, partially offset by cash used for the ongoing contraction of the projects that are being built on balance sheet. 
Note, on balance sheet, we are currently constructing 1.2 gigawatts AC of projects, which will achieve commercial operation over the next 5 quarters. 
Our net working capital, including the change in noncurrent project assets and excluding cash and marketable securities, increased by $55 million from the prior quarter. The increase was attributed to the increase in trade and unbilled accounts receivables, partially offset by reductions in inventories and payables. 
Total debt decreased from the prior quarter by $14 million to $286 million, primarily due to the scheduled payments on our Malaysian loan, partially offset by an increase [indiscernible] debt of $16 million. Cash flow from operations was $21 million compared to cash flow used in operations of $17 million in the quarter. Free cash flow was a negative $17 million compared to negative free cash flow of $47 million in Q2. Capital expenditures were $45 million, an increase of $6 million from the prior quarter. Free cash in for the quarter was $61 million or $2 million lower than the prior quarter. 
Turning to Slide 13, I will now discuss our updated and preliminary full year 2015 guidance. The following guidance is preliminary, pending the determination and financial impacts of the tax that I discussed previously. First, we have left our net sales range of $3.5 billion to $3.6 billion unchanged. 
We continue to expect our systems revenue, which includes both EPC and solar modules used in systems projects, to be in the range of 90% to 95% of total revenue for the year. We are raising gross margin guidance 300 basis points to a revised range of 24% to 25%. This is a result of the favorable cost improvements achieved in Q3, as well as the benefit from the decrease in our EOL obligations. Operating expenses, including plant start-up, have been lowered by $20 million, to a revised range of $395 million to $405 million. 
In addition to the $10 million reduction from a decrease in EOL obligations, we are lowering operating expense guidance to reflect lower R&D testing costs and greater cost control focus. 
Our full year projected effective tax rate has increased to a range of 4% to 6%, reflecting our latest view of jurisdictional income mix. 
Note that this rate incorporates on a full year basis, a $28 million net tax benefit associated with a payable ruling from a foreign tax authority. As discussed on our last call, the benefit of favorable ruling in Q2 was $42 million. However, on a full year basis, the benefit it is now estimated to be $28 million, due to the decrease in our EOL obligation recognized in Q3. 
Preliminary earnings per share guidance at the midpoint has increased by nearly $1 per share to a revised range of $4.30 to $4.50 for fully diluted share. The increased earnings guidance reflects the $0.60 benefit, net of tax from our lower EOL obligation. Balance of the higher guidance is from operational improvements realized in Q3 results and included in our Q4 forecast. 
Capital expenditure guidance is unchanged at $175 million to $200 million. The guidance range for our net ending cash and changing working capital have changed slightly as we have narrowed the previous range provided. Shipping guidance is unchanged from our prior expectation. Lastly, consistent with prior indications, our guidance for the remainder of the year does not anticipate any drop-down of assets into 8.3. 
Looking forward to 2016, we are planning to host a mid-December call to provide guidance for the 2016 calendar year. Given the level of visibility we have in 2016 at this point, we feel that this would be an appropriate time to share our outlook with the investment community. The date and specific details of the call will be made available in the coming weeks. 
Turning to the next slide, I'll summarize our progress during the past quarter. First, we delivered outstanding financial results for the quarter, with sales of $1.3 billion, gross margin of over 38% and preliminary earnings of $3.38 per share. We have raised our full year preliminary guidance range to $4.30 to $4.50 on the strength of our Q3 earnings and ongoing operational improvements.  
Our technology continues to improve rapidly, with the Q3 fleet average efficiency of 15.8% and the best line of 16.4%. Our pipeline continues to grow with record year-to-date bookings of 3.1 gigawatts. And the book-to-bill ratio for the year will be greater than 1:1. 
Potential bookings of 17.4 gigawatts has grown going approximately 700 megawatts, even as we reported record bookings. Our mid- to late-stage opportunities are also the strongest they've ever been, with 3.9 gigawatts of projects. With this, we conclude our prepared remarks and open up the call for questions.

And primarily because with respect to the systems business, that's going to be dependent upon ultimate realization of those projects, which is going to depend upon the relevant discount rates and/or cost of capital. And with the dislocation we've seen in markets recently, I think my frank view is that sort of through the end of this year, there's going to be a degree of uncertainty on that. So I don't think we would want to comment. I think as we move into 2016, the capital markets should calm down, and we should begin to get some visibility on where those discount rates are going to end up, and that will give us better visibility into the margins on the systems business."

So we feel confident with the long-term margin capture that will capture all of that. It's just a matter of, as Jim indicated, understanding how cost of capital evolves and how things in the market evolve over the next year or so will probably create a better picture for how we realize margin on those assets out further in the decade."

From a YieldCo standpoint, as we said on the 8.3 call a month or so ago, is both sponsors at this point in time are committed to the drop-downs that we would envision in the first half of '16. We've also indicated that we do not have need to raise capital at this point in time. We've left enough capacity, in 8.3, to manage those anticipated drop-downs with the revolver, the delayed draw on the term loan, plus the accordion features that we have embedded in the term structure. So what I would say, we're still moving forward, and we believe we will be able to drop down those assets to the right value equation to the sponsors and create accretions to 8.3. We'll continue to evaluate how the equity trades over time and will continue to assess how we would structure assets beyond the first half of '16, as we said before, we may live to put leverage on these assets, which would then allow us to create a levered yield to the 8.3 shareholder that is accretive. So there's other structuring options that we do have, that we're continuing to look at. But beyond the first half of '16, we would say we're committed on the drop-downs. We'll continue to evaluate the market and ensure that the drop-downs makes sense in the latter half of '16."

And on the other -- while clearly, we benefited from a project that's been part of the portfolio for a long time, and everybody's known about, the operational performance this quarter clearly extends well beyond that. That's clearly had no impact upon the bookings side of the equation, which was the strongest quarter in our history from that standpoint. In terms of, can we continue to drive margin and competitiveness through cost reductions? As I have stated regularly that's the religion around here. And we have a cost road map that we remain committed to, that extends well beyond where we are today. We've never backed away from that roadmap and we've continued to hit the road map that we laid out several years ago. Further, we continue to spend robustly on R&D, and we continue to build opportunities that will allow that roadmap to extend beyond the commitments that we have today, particularly outside of the module and into the balance of system. And then at the corporate level, we continue to have a focus on growing the business while, at the same time, getting leaner. And so, we want to see our OpEx come down, not only on a unit basis, but also on an aggregate basis. And so given how radically we've changed the business, the fact that we've maintained cost control from an OpEx standpoint, I think is a notable accomplishment for the organization. So there's no doubt on our part that we have the ability to continue to drive competitiveness and not in some narrow fashion, but broadly across the entire business, being very reflective of the decision to be vertically integrated and to give us the ability to target all aspects of the value chain."

I think there's a broad set of reasons. It has less to do with state reqs and more to do with cost structures getting down to a point where they represent a compelling value within the energy mix in that part of the country. As I have consistently said, there's a broad awakening on the part of utilities to the value that solar represents, and in particular, as they look forward to the clean power plant, as they look forward to constraints on the ability to operate existing coal plants or construct new coal plants, they see an increasing shift towards natural gas and, accordingly, significant exposure to natural gas commodities. And while natural gas is very, very inexpensive today, everybody remains cautious and worried about future increases in that commodity. So it's broadly the ability to diversify their generation mix into a technology that is cost effective and affordable in the context of today's prices and also offers a significant hedge against future commodity prices. I think that it's that broad package of characteristics that is really what is compelling people to procure -- utilities, in particular -- to include photo-voltaic in their generation mix.

And if you want to build a smooth, steadier business profile, you need to participate in multiple geographies, multiple economies, so that you have the ability to shift to whatever happens to be the area of greatest need. So it's less about the U.S. and more about the desire to grow, the desire to diversify to markets in which we can play. It also speaks to the fact that as our product has improved, as our efficiency has improved, as our spectral response has improved, we're just increasingly competitive across a broader set of geographies, and that makes it possible for us to go out and compete in these geographies. So it's not one single discrete reason. It's part of a broader strategy to build what we believe will be a robust, growing and steady business in the future."

And it's all aspects of the balance of system, from the structures to materials to material costs to the means and methods of construction. There are -- when you look across labor and materials, they are both significant contributors to the balance of system costs, and we are spending a lot of time and effort on reducing labor, not just in terms of labor rates, but actually changing the means and methods of construction to reduce the number of actions and amount of time it takes to install, and reducing materials on the rest of the balance of systems.

In some cases, they've indicated it could be over in the next year, it could be longer. But we have, historically, not sold to YieldCos or traditional tax equity structures, right? We've chosen to partner with -- strategics with tax capacity. So I would say that part of the market is still very robust, as you can see with our ability to sell down Stateline into -- with Southern. Now what that means, though, is that more and more people will be looking to try to engage with the Dominions, the Southerns, the Berkshires, you can go down the line. Because they may be the most active buyers in the market. And what position of strength that we're in is that we have very strong relationships with a number of those parties. They obviously love the First Solar brand, they love the First Solar relationships, they love the comfort. And so I'm sure that there will be some impact in the market. I think we think we're in a fortunate position, because we have very strong relationship with a number of those parties. But the other thing I would say is that these assets are very attractive. I mean, there's a number of parties that want to have solar assets, long-dated contracted assets with investment-grade counter-parties, and the ability to acquire or what will come to market in '16 relative to potentially what could be in the market in '17 and '18 is there's a window that may be closing in terms of the number of projects that can be acquired. And I would expect, at least a lot of our traditional buyers strategic with tax capacity will be very aggressive throughout 2016."

As you think about the international mix here, can you comment about the module versus [indiscernible] projects, particularly in the new geographies? And how you think about the incremental margin on those geographies? I know you kind of got that a little bit before, but are you thinking about these? Have you added new contracts as being truly development opportunities or to the most part, should we be thinking about, especially India has more of a module or module plus kind of opportunity? And then perhaps as a second unrelated question, I'll throw it out there now, the Southeast activity, et cetera, is that -- how much of that is EPP driven and how much of an overhang is the early action credit, being all the way out in 2020, limiting procurement? Just wanted to get your thoughts on that."

So each -- we look at each market discreetly. One of the, I think, learnings over the last several years is that you cannot generalize about -- even within the same region, even neighboring countries, often times you can't generalize about what the business mix for us is going to look like. So the way we think about development is, if we do development, we want to get paid for it. And when we say that, what that means is that we want to earn a return that's above and beyond whatever we believe the margin or module plus type of entitlement would be, if we're going to engage in the development process. And there are markets where we go and we see the opportunity to get paid for being the developer. And there are markets where we absolutely do not see that opportunity. So when you look across the world, Japan is a market where we have felt that we can get paid for being the developer, and we are very active in the development. India is a market where we feel we can get paid for being a developer, and we active as a developer. What's different is there are capital constraints in India that don't exist in other markets. There are limits to how much development we're going to be able to do. So we also are very aggressive on the module and module plus fronts in India. As we look at new and different markets around the world, there is an initial process that it takes us a little while to get on the ground and spend enough time in the markets to really figure out whether there is an entitlement that is going to justify development. I think it's fair to say that at this point, our method of operation is let's lead with the module. And then, as we begin to establish the market share, get some resource on the ground and get a greater understanding of the market, we'll look hard at whether we think there is a development opportunity. But I don't think you can generalize. I don't think you could say all of the incremental demand internationally is going to be module only. That's certainly not how we're thinking about it. But I also think it's safe to say, it's not all going to be development. Development is OpEx intensive. It is always complicated in a new market. And so we can only take on so many new markets at a time without driving our OpEx to unacceptable levels. And so, it's going to be a balance between -- okay, let's take the OpEx resources that we chose to live within and let's apply those in the markets where we're going to get the greatest bang for our buck, from a development standpoint. And then, let's go with a lesser scope in other markets where we can capture market share on an OpEx like basis, admittedly, at probably lower margins, but still accretive to the overall outcome for the company."

All of our conversations in the U.S. are 25, 15 -- between 15- and 30-year PPAs. So the utilities are looking at -- in their integrated resource planning at their long-term curves. And I don't think their longer term analysis has changed. If you assume that these low prices are going to pull rig counts down, when you look at the production cost and stack up the basins against that production cost, I think everybody gets to the same kind of level when you get out 5 to 10 years. And that is the point on the curve that is more impactful. If you got to a position in the United States where people believed that $2, $2.50 gas prices were going to be the norm for the next 15 years, then I think that might change the discussion. But I don't think that's what people have in their mind at this point."
