Good morning, and thank you for joining us. 
2014 was a watershed year for NiSource. It was anchored by focused execution of a record infrastructure investment program and the initiation of strategic and transformational growth plans. Those notably included the creation of Columbia Pipeline Partners and the announcement of the Columbia Pipeline Group's spinoff. If you'll turn to Slide 3 in the supplemental deck that was posted online this morning, you'll see a few of the year's highlights. 
The NiSource team delivered yet another year of solid operational performance and industry-leading financial results. 
In 2014, we generated net operating earnings from continuing operations, non-GAAP of $1.72 per share, exceeding our guidance range of $1.61 to $1.71%, and up nearly 9% from 2013. And we delivered total returns to our shareholders of 32%, which outperformed the major utility indices for the sixth consecutive year. 
Our team executed on a record $2.2 billion capital investment program, made significant progress on various regulatory and legislative programs and originated several transformational growth projects at CPG. These initiatives sync closely with our companywide modernization initiatives; delivered significant value to our customers by facilitating the development of significant shale resources; and providing more modern, safe, efficient and environmentally friendly infrastructure. We also benefit our communities through job creation and economic development, and our shareholders through sustainable long-term returns. 
During the year, we also expanded our projected long-term inventory of infrastructure investments, which is now targeted at $12 billion to $15 billion at CPG over the next 10 years, and $30 billion at NiSource's utilities over 20-plus years. 
As I noted at the top of the call, 2014 marked the launch of 2 important strategic initiatives: the separation of CPG and the creation of Columbia Pipeline Partners. On that note, our team was pleased with Columbia Pipeline Partners' $1.2 billion initial public offering in early February. The partnership's offering was enthusiastically received by investors, and Steve will provide a brief update on the partnership as part of this morning's call. 
We remain on track with the NiSource CPG separation process. A couple of weeks ago, we thought our initial Form 10 registration statement with the SEC, have announced key board members and the majority of our executive team members for both companies. Following the separation, both companies are expected to move forward as independent, investment-grade pure-play entities with experienced teams focusing on executing and elevating well-established platforms for growth. 
As we look ahead to NiSource and CPG operating the independent companies, I wanted to briefly highlight their growth expectations. As we first announced at our 2014  Investor Day, NiSource is a pure-play utility, expects its average annual long-term earnings and dividend to grow at 4% to 6% over the long term. As a pure play pipeline company with an MLP, CPG is targeting its annual adjusted EBITDA growth in the mid- to upper-teens over the next several years. It's annual dividend growth is expected to be commensurate with this robust EBITDA growth. 
With these very strong growth rates and deep investment inventories, both companies will be positioned in the top tier of their  peer groups. As the separation date gets closer, both NiSource and CPG will conduct roadshows to provide additional details on their projected performance profiles. 
And just expand of the growth for one moment, we wanted to be absolutely clear on the fundamental baseline commitments of each company, therefore, we provided earnings and dividend outlooks as well as capital expenditure outlooks. 
We wanted to be clear on what long-term drivers are for each of the businesses. We wanted to be helpful versus academic. And as you know, 2015 will be a split year for NiSource and CPG. With significant developments unfolding during the first half of the year, including the IPO of CPPL, the recapitalization of CPG and NiSource, as well as the separation itself and the ongoing development of Mountaineer Express and Gulf Express. Again, we wanted to provide what was helpful, what was most constructive, therefore, our key commitments, our key fundamental drivers. As we mentioned roadshows will occur prior to separation to provide additional detail on 15, '16 and the long term. 
Now with that, let me turn the call over to Steve Smith to review our 2014 financial results highlighted on Page 4, our supplemental slides."
292092,283238666,764399,"NiSource Inc., Columbia Pipeline Partners LP, Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 18, 2015",2015-02-18,"Earnings Calls","NiSource Inc.","Executives","Good morning, everyone.

On an operating",446,"Good morning, everyone. As Bob mentioned, we exceeded our guidance range for the year by generating non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $545 million or $1.72 per share, which compares to about $495 million or $1.58 per share in 2013. On an operating earnings basis, NiSource was up about $125 million. On a GAAP comparison, our income from continuing operations was about $530 million for 2014 versus about $490 million for 2013. At the segment level, you will see in today's release that each of our 3 core business units delivered solid financial results. CPG delivered operating earnings of about $491 million compared to about $441 million in 2013. CPG's net revenues, excluding the impact of trackers, were up about $80 million. NIPSCO's electric operations delivered about $288 million in operating earnings compared to about $265 million for the prior year. Net revenues, excluding trackers, were up about $47 million. And finally, our Gas Distribution business unit came in at about $517 million compared to about $449 million in 2013. 
Net revenues, again, excluding the impact of trackers, were up about $126 million. As our numbers attest, it was another strong year for the NiSource team. Full details of our results are available in our earnings release issued and posted online this morning. 
Now turning to Slide 5. I'd like to briefly touch on our financing and liquidity position. We retained a strong liquidity position with approximately $720 million of net available liquidity at the end of the year. Of our record $2.2 billion capital investment program, approximately 76% of these investments were focused on revenue-generating opportunities. Our debt to capitalization came in at about 62% at the end of the year. And as Bob mentioned, we remain on track with the NiSource CPG separation. In that regard, we have taken several key steps establish a strong financial foundation for both companies. The first step was to secure 2 separate credit facilities that will become effective at the separation. We entered into 2 $1.5 billion 5-year credit facilities, one for NiSource and the other for CPG. These facilities will replace NiSource's existing $2 billion agreement. At the same time, we entered these agreements, we also entered into a $500 million 5-year facility at Columbia Pipeline Partners, which went into effect at the time of the IPO. The next major step in this process is the recapitalization, which is on schedule to commence in the second quarter. We will provide additional updates on this process on our first quarter earnings update and through other public announcements. With that, I'll turn the call back to Bob to discuss a few execution highlights from each of our business units."
292092,283238666,764399,"NiSource Inc., Columbia Pipeline Partners LP, Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 18, 2015",2015-02-18,"Earnings Calls","NiSource Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Steve. Let's start with CPG highlights on Slide 6. The CPG team continues to advance a steady stream of transformational growth and modernization projects. As I noted earlier, CPG expects to invest up to $15 billion in growth capital over the next",1320,"Thanks, Steve. Let's start with CPG highlights on Slide 6. The CPG team continues to advance a steady stream of transformational growth and modernization projects. As I noted earlier, CPG expects to invest up to $15 billion in growth capital over the next 10 years, with most major projects currently in execution or in advanced stages of development. During 2014, CPG placed more than $300 million in system expansion projects and service, adding approximately 1.1 billion cubic feet of system capacity. An additional $200 million in midstream projects were put in service during the year, and CPG's modernization work approached $320 million. So in total for 2014, we added more than $800 million in new revenue-generating assets in service all on time and on budget. Meanwhile, the CPG team is in full execution mode on several on going and transformational growth projects. In December, the FERC approved the construction of the East Side Expansion project, which will provide approximately 315 million cubic feet per day of additional capacity for Marcellus supplies to reach the growing Mid-Atlantic markets. That $275 million project is expected to be pleased in service later of this year. In addition to the East Side expansion, CPG has more than $3 billion of growth projects in progress to add approximately 4 billion cubic feet of transportation capacity. 
These projects include the Leach and Rayne XPress projects, the WB XPress project and the Cameron Access Project. The Rayne and Leach projects collectively involve about $1.8 billion of system expansion, creating a major new pathway for transportation shale production to attractive markets and liquid trading points. Both projects are expected to be in service by the end of 2017. WB XPress is almost a $900 million project to transport about 1.3 billion cubic feet of shale gas to East Coast markets and various pipeline interconnects, including access to the Cove point LNG terminal. 
And Cameron Acces is a roughly $300 million investment and involves new pipeline facilities to connect with Cameron LNG terminal in Southern Louisiana. The project will offer initial capacity of up to 800 million cubic feet per day. Our Colombia Midstream team also is continuing to capitalize on CPG's strong asset position in the Marcellus and Utica regions. Midstream projects currently in progress include $120 million Washington gathering project and the $65 million Big Pine expansion project. 
Big Pine in the first phase. Washington County will be placed in service before the end of the year. As you may recall during our prior discussions, we've outlined plans for the potential Mountaineer XPress project. We're now in advanced commercial discussions with customers on this major project as well as a complementary project called, Gulf Xpress. If implemented, these projects would provide substantial transportation capacity out of the Marcellus and Utica shale regions. These 2 projects can involve an investment as large $2 billion to $2.5 billion. We have to compete commercial terms and clear all contractual outs by July. As you can see on all fronts, the CPG team is executing against some impressive and indeed, transformational growth agenda. In 2015, we're targeting an investment capital level of approximately $1.1 billion in CPG. As you've heard us say before, our intent is to cripple our net asset base over the next 5 years. 
With that, let's now shift to our utility businesses, starting with NIPSCO, our Indiana Electric and Natural Gas business, summarized on Slide 7. NIPSCO is continuing to deliver on its commercial and customer strategy with an inventory investment opportunities approaching $10 billion for electric infrastructure and $5 billion for gas infrastructure over the next 20-plus years. 2014 was a strong year for NIPSCO as well. In the first half of '14, NIPSCO commenced its 7-year natural gas and electric infrastructure modernization programs, now expected to reach an investment level of nearly $2 billion. The team competed approximately $120 million of projects in 2014. These investments will help to improve reliability and maintain system safety for the next generation. 
On the environmental front, in December, NIPSCO placed the final FTD unit shaper generating facility. This unit, like the one placed in service during the fourth quarter of 2013, was delivered on time and on budget. A third FTD unit at Michigan city generation facility is on schedule to be placed in service by the end of 2015. Following the completion of the Michigan City unit, all of NIPSCO's coal burning facilities will be fully scrubbed. On the growth side, progress also continued on 2 major NIPSCO electric transmission projects. Right away acquisition and permitting are underway for both projects and preliminary construction will begin on the 3 45 KV Reynolds to Topeka line in the first half of this year. You'll recall these projects involve an investment of about $0.5 billion for NIPSCO and are anticipated to be in service by the end of 2018. And finally, in addition to the continuation of NIPSCO's electric energy efficiency programs, the IURC approved the extension of the be in power rate program. NIPSCO also reached a settlement on the continuation of its feed in tariff program. 
NIPSCO's agenda in 2015 remains focused on enhancing the reliability and environmental performance of its systems, their modernization and replacement investments. In addition to delivering customer programs that help reduce energy usage of managed bills, these investments expected to reach nearly $400 million in 2015, deliver significant economic development and job creation activity in Northern Indiana while at the same time delivering value to our investors. 
Turning to our Gas Distribution operations on Slide 8. You can see a similar story of large-scale infrastructure investment paired with complementary regulatory and customer initiatives. 
Touching on a few highlights from the year. In November, the Pennsylvania Commission approved a settlement of Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania's phase rate case. The case provides for a recovery of CPAs investments and it's well established infrastructure modernization program and will increase annual revenues by approximately $33 million. New rates went into effect in December. Also in December, Columbia Gas of Virginia reached a settlement with customers for its rate case, which if approved will increase base rates by about $25 million. Notably, in January, the hearing examiner in the case recommended approval of the settlement. Final commission decision is expected by the end of the first quarter. 
These rate cases along with one completed in Massachusetts provide for continued recovery of investments related to our well-established infrastructure programs, which are designed to maintain and improve the safety and reliability of our systems. 
Also in the fourth quarter, Columbia Gas of Massachusetts filed its 2015 system -- gas system enhancement plan. Under new legislation authorizing accelerated recovery of gas infrastructure modernization investments. If approved as filed, cost recovery would increase annual revenues by approximately $2.6 million. Across our gas utilities, we expect to invest almost $900 million in 2015. Together, NiSource's industry-leading platform for utility growth provides significant reliability, safety and environmental benefits to our existing and new customers while also delivering shareholder returns through transparent recovery mechanism. 
Shifting to Slide 9. Our key takeaways for 2015. We plan to execute our current business and customer plans while at the same time delivering the CPG spinoff on schedule in mid 2015. We're moving ahead with another year of record capital investments targeted at $2.4 billion across our utilities and pipelines, and a complementary regulatory and customer service agenda. As for the separation, we're well on our way to standing up 2 premier companies, management and directors at both companies. CPG and NiSource will be well-financed and strongly positioned to execute on their distinct strategies, and deliver enhanced long-term earnings and dividend growth. As I mentioned, both NiSource and CPG will conduct roadshows prior to separation to provide detailed business profiles. With those highlights for NiSource, we'll now shift to Slide 11 in the NiSource deck, and Steve will discuss Columbia Pipeline Partners' IPO and its predecessor results. Steve?"

With the launch of CPPL, we do to stay best in class MLP to the market. One with a strong supportive sponsor, stable and predictable cash flows that are virtually on sensitive to fluctuations and commodity prices and volumes; a robust growth profile with the deep inventory of long-term infrastructure investments; a strategic footprint over there the Marcellus and Utica shale production areas; financial strength and flexibility; and a premier execution focus and experienced leadership team. Our offering was very well received, and we're very pleased with the continued positive response. I'll quickly touch on our IPO and predecessor results on Page 12. The offering of approximately 54 million units at $23 per share raised nearly $1.2 billion. The pricing offering on February 5 and subsequently began today at the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol CPPL the following day. These units include the full allotment executed by the underwriters. And as I mentioned previously, a $500 million 5-year revolving credit facility we entered into in December came effective on the IPO. Now let's turn to our predecessor results issued this morning for periods prior to the IPO. As we outlined during the earlier NiSource remarks, all of the piping group executed on din and placed into service wide variety deal by value projects during the year. These projects were core to CPPL's predecessor growth and will serve as the model for partnerships growth in 2015 and beyond. The predecessor reported net income of about $269 million for 2014 compared to about $267 million for 2013. The increase is primarily a result of new growth projects placed in service, new firm contracts of higher mineral rights royalties. On an adjusted EBITDA basis, the predecessor reported about $599 million in 2014 versus about $543 million in 2013. These results provide us with a solid footing as we move forward with the CPPL's strategies. Bob?"

So that starting point quite frankly is somewhat sensitive somewhat dependent on credit considerations. The other is the huge CapEx we have been so it's balancing credit CapEx and financing coming out of the gate. Those are the key considerations for starting point."

Good morning, and thank you for joining us. 2014 was a watershed year for NiSource. It was anchored by focused execution of a record infrastructure investment program and the initiation of strategic and transformational growth plans. Those notably included the creation of Columbia Pipeline Partners and the announcement of the Columbia Pipeline Group spinoff.
If you'll turn to Slide 3 in the supplemental deck that was posted online this morning, you'll see a few of the year's highlights. The NiSource team delivered yet another year of solid operational performance and industry-leading financial results. In 2014, we generated net operating earnings from continuing operations, non-GAAP, of $1.72 per share, exceeding our guidance range of $1.61 to $1.71 per share, and up nearly 9% from 2013. And we delivered total returns to our shareholders of 32%, which outperformed the major utility indices for the sixth consecutive year. 
Our team executed on a record $2.2 billion capital investment program, made significant progress on various regulatory and legislative programs, and originated several transformational growth projects at CPG. These initiatives sync closely with our company-wide modernization initiatives, deliver significant value to our customers by facilitating the development of significant shale resources, and providing more modern, safe, efficient and environmentally friendly infrastructure. They also benefit our communities through job creation and economic development, and our shareholders through sustainable long-term returns. 
During the year, we also expanded our projected long-term inventory of infrastructure investments, which is now targeted at $12 billion to $15 billion at CPG over the next 10 years and $30 billion at NiSource's utilities over 20-plus years. 
As I noted at the top of the call, 2014 marked the launch of 2 important strategic initiatives: the separation of CPG and the creation of Columbia Pipeline Partners. On that note, our team was pleased with Columbia Pipeline Partners' $1.2 billion initial public offering in early February. The partnership's offering was enthusiastically received by investors, and Steve will provide a brief update on the partnership as part of this morning's call. 
We remain on track with the NiSource CPG separation process. A couple of weeks ago, we filed our initial Form 10 registration statement with the SEC, have announced key expected board members and the majority of executive team members for both companies. Following the separation, both companies are expected to move forward as independent, investment-grade, pure-play entities with experienced teams focusing on executing and elevating well-established platforms for growth. 
As we look ahead to NiSource and CPG operating the independent companies, I wanted to briefly highlight their growth expectations. As we first announced at our 2014 Investor Day, NiSource is a pure-play utility, expects its average annual long-term earnings and dividend to grow at 4% to 6% over the long term. As a pure-play pipeline company with an MLP, CPG is targeting its annual adjusted EBITDA growth in the mid- to upper teens over the next several years. It's annual dividend growth is expected to be commensurate with this robust EBITDA growth. 
With these very strong growth rates and deep investment inventories, both companies will position -- will be positioned in the top tier of their peer groups. As the separation date gets closer, both NiSource and CPG will conduct road shows to provide additional details on their projected performance profiles. 
And just to expand on the growth for one moment, we wanted to be absolutely clear on the fundamental baseline commitments of each company; therefore, we provided earnings and dividend outlooks, as well as capital expenditure outlooks. We wanted to be clear on what long-term drivers are for each of the businesses. We wanted to be helpful versus academic.
And as you know, 2015 will be a split year for NiSource and CPG. With significant developments unfolding during the first half of the year, including the IPO of CPPL, the recapitalization of CPG and NiSource, as well as the separation itself and the ongoing development of Mountaineer XPress and Gulf XPress. Again, we wanted to provide what was helpful, what was most constructive; therefore, our key commitments, our key fundamental drivers. As we mentioned, the roadshows will occur prior to separation to provide additional detail on '15, '16 and the long term. 
Now with that, let me turn the call over to Steve Smith to review our 2014 financial results highlighted on Page 4 of our supplemental slides."

As Bob mentioned, we exceeded our guidance range for the year by generating non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $545 million or $1.72 per share, which compares to about $495 million or $1.58 per share in 2013. On an operating",445,"Good morning, everyone. As Bob mentioned, we exceeded our guidance range for the year by generating non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $545 million or $1.72 per share, which compares to about $495 million or $1.58 per share in 2013. On an operating earnings basis, NiSource was up about $125 million. On a GAAP comparison, our income from continuing operations was about $530 million for 2014 versus about $490 million for 2013.
At the segment level, you will see in today's release that each of our 3 core business units delivered solid financial results. CPG delivered operating earnings of about $491 million compared to about $441 million in 2013. CPG's net revenues, excluding the impact of trackers, were up about $80 million. NIPSCO's electric operations delivered about $288 million in operating earnings compared to about $265 million for the prior year. Net revenues, excluding trackers, were up about $47 million.
And finally, our Gas Distribution business unit came in at about $517 million compared to about $449 million in 2013. Net revenues, again, excluding the impact of trackers, were up about $126 million. As our numbers attest, it was another strong year for the NiSource team. Full details of our results are available in our earnings release issued and posted online this morning. 
Now turning to Slide 5, I'd like to briefly touch on our financing and liquidity position. We retained a strong liquidity position with approximately $720 million of net available liquidity at the end of the year. Of our record $2.2 billion capital investment program, approximately 76% of these investments were focused on revenue-generating opportunities. Our debt to capitalization came in at about 62% at the end of the year. And as Bob mentioned, we remain on track with the NiSource-CPG separation.
In that regard, we have taken several key steps establish a strong financial foundation for both companies. The first step was to secure 2 separate credit facilities that will become effective at the separation. We entered into 2 $1.5 billion 5-year credit facilities, one for NiSource and the other for CPG. These facilities will replace NiSource's existing $2 billion agreement. At the same time, we entered these agreements, we also entered into a $500 million 5-year facility at Columbia Pipeline Partners, which went into effect at the time of the IPO. The next major step in this process is the recapitalization, which is on schedule to commence in the second quarter. We will provide additional updates on this process on our first quarter earnings update and through other public announcements.
With that, I'll turn the call back to Bob to discuss a few execution highlights from each of our business units."
292092,283238666,764589,"NiSource Inc., Columbia Pipeline Partners LP, Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 18, 2015",2015-02-18,"Earnings Calls","NiSource Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Steve. Let's start with CPG highlights on Slide 6. The CPG team continues to advance a steady stream of transformational growth and modernization projects. As I noted earlier, CPG expects to invest up to $15 billion in growth capital over the next",1323,"Thanks, Steve. Let's start with CPG highlights on Slide 6. The CPG team continues to advance a steady stream of transformational growth and modernization projects. As I noted earlier, CPG expects to invest up to $15 billion in growth capital over the next 10 years, with most major projects currently in execution or in advanced stages of development.
During 2014, CPG placed more than $300 million in system expansion projects and service, adding approximately 1.1 billion cubic feet of system capacity. An additional $200 million in midstream projects were put in service during the year, and CPG's modernization work approached $320 million. So in total, for 2014, we added more than $800 million in new revenue-generating assets in service, all on time and on budget. 
Meanwhile, the CPG team is in full execution mode on several ongoing and transformational growth projects. In December, the FERC approved the construction of the East Side Expansion project, which will provide approximately 315 million cubic feet per day of additional capacity for Marcellus supplies to reach the growing Mid-Atlantic markets. This $275 million project is expected to be placed in service later of this year.
In addition to the East Side expansion, CPG has more than $3 billion of growth projects in progress, to add approximately 4 billion cubic feet of transportation capacity. These projects include the Leach and Rayne XPress projects, the WB XPress project and the Cameron Access Project. The Rayne and Leach projects collectively involve about $1.8 billion in system expansion, creating a major new pathway for transporting shale production to attractive markets and liquid trading points. Both projects are expected to be in service by the end of 2017.
WB XPress is almost a $900 million project to transport about 1.3 billion cubic feet of shale gas to East Coast markets and various pipeline interconnects, including access to the Cove Point LNG terminal. And Cameron Access is a roughly $300 million investment and involves new pipeline facilities to connect with Cameron LNG terminal in Southern Louisiana. The project will offer initial capacity of up to 800 million cubic feet per day.
Our Colombia Midstream team also is continuing to capitalize on CPG's strong asset position in the Marcellus and Utica regions. Midstream projects currently in progress include the $120 million Washington County Gathering project and the $65 million Big Pine Expansion project. Big Pine and the first phase of Washington County will be placed in service before the end of the year.
As you may recall during our prior discussions, we've outlined plans for the potential Mountaineer XPress project. We're now in advanced commercial discussions with customers on this major project, as well as a complementary project called Gulf XPress. If implemented, these projects would provide substantial transportation capacity out of the Marcellus and Utica shale regions. These 2 projects could involve an investment as large $2 billion to $2.5 billion. We have to complete commercial terms and clear all contractual outs by July.
As you can see, on all fronts, the CPG team is executing against an impressive and, indeed, transformational growth agenda. In 2015, we're targeting a capital investment level of approximately $1.1 billion in CPG. As you've heard us say before, our intent is to triple our net asset base over the next 5 years. 
With that, let's now shift to our utility businesses, starting with NIPSCO, our Indiana Electric and Natural Gas business, summarized on Slide 7. NIPSCO is continuing to deliver on its commercial and customer strategy with an inventory of investment opportunities approaching $10 billion for electric infrastructure and $5 billion for gas infrastructure over the next 20-plus years.
2014 was a strong year for NIPSCO as well. In the first half of '14, NIPSCO commenced its 7-year natural gas and electric infrastructure modernization programs, now expected to reach an investment level of nearly $2 billion. The team competed approximately $120 million of projects in 2014. These investments will help to improve reliability and maintain system safety for the next generation. 
On the environmental front, in December, NIPSCO placed the final FGD unit in service at the Schahfer Generating Facility. This unit, like the one placed in service during the fourth quarter of 2013, was delivered on time and on budget. A third FGD unit at NIPSCO's Michigan City Generation Facility is on schedule to be placed in service by the end of 2015. Following the completion of the Michigan City unit, all of NIPSCO's coal-burning facilities will be fully scrubbed.
On the growth side, progress also continued on 2 major NIPSCO electric transmission projects. Right of away acquisition and permitting are underway for both projects, and preliminary construction will begin on the 345-kV Reynolds to Topeka line in the first half of this year. You'll recall these projects involve an investment of about $0.5 billion for NIPSCO and are anticipated to be in service by the end of 2018.
And finally, in addition to the continuation of NIPSCO's electric energy efficiency programs, the IURC approved the extension of the Green Power Rate program. NIPSCO also reached a settlement on the continuation of its feed-in tariff program. 
NIPSCO's agenda in 2015 remains focused on enhancing the reliability and environmental performance of its systems, their modernization and replacement investments. In addition to delivering customer programs that help reduce energy usage and manage bills, these investments, expected to reach nearly $400 million in 2015, deliver significant economic development and job creation activity in Northern Indiana, while at the same time delivering value to our investors. 
Turning to our Gas Distribution operations on Slide 8. You can see a similar story of large-scale infrastructure investment paired with complementary regulatory and customer initiatives. Touching on a few highlights from the year. In November, the Pennsylvania Commission approved a settlement in Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania's base rate case. The case provides for a recovery of CPAs investments in its well-established infrastructure modernization program and will increase annual revenues by approximately $33 million. New rates went into effect in December.
Also in December, Columbia Gas of Virginia reached a settlement with customers for its rate case, which, if approved, will increase base rates by about $25 million. Notably, in January, the hearing examiner in the case recommended approval of the settlement. Final commission decision is expected by the end of the first quarter. These rate cases, along with one completed in Massachusetts, provide for continued recovery of investments related to our well-established infrastructure programs, which are designed to maintain and improve the safety and reliability of our systems. 
Also in the fourth quarter, Columbia Gas of Massachusetts filed its 2015 system -- Gas System Enhancement Plan under new legislation authorizing accelerated recovery of gas infrastructure modernization investment. If approved as filed, cost recovery would increase annual revenues by approximately $2.6 million. Across our gas utilities, we expect to invest almost $900 million in 2015. Together, NiSource's industry-leading platform for utility growth provides significant reliability, safety and environmental benefits to our existing and new customers, while also delivering shareholder returns through transparent recovery mechanism. 
Shifting to Slide 9, our key takeaways for 2015. We plan to execute our current business and customer plans, while at the same time delivering the CPG spinoff on schedule in mid-2015. We're moving ahead with another year of record capital investments targeted at $2.4 billion across our utilities and pipelines, and a complementary regulatory and customer service agenda.
As for the separation, we're well on our way to standing up 2 premier companies, management and directors at both companies. CPG and NiSource will be well financed and strongly positioned to execute on their distinct strategies, and deliver enhanced long-term earnings and dividend growth. As I mentioned, both NiSource and CPG will conduct roadshows prior to separation to provide detailed business profiles.
With those highlights for NiSource, we'll now shift to Slide 11 in the NiSource deck, and Steve will discuss Columbia Pipeline Partners' IPO and its predecessor results. Steve?"

With the launch of CPPL, we've introduced a best-in-class MLP to the market. One, with a strong supportive sponsor; stable and predictable cash flows that are virtually insensitive to fluctuations and commodity prices and volumes; a robust growth profile with a deep inventory of long-term infrastructure investments; a strategic footprint overlaying the Marcellus and Utica shale production areas; financial strength and flexibility; and a premier execution-focused and experienced leadership team. Our offering was very well received, and we're very pleased with the continued positive response.
Let's quickly touch on our IPO and predecessor results on Page 12. The offering of approximately 54 million units at $23 per share raised nearly $1.2 billion. We priced the offering on February 5 and subsequently began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol CPPL the following day. These units include the full greenshoe allotment executed by the underwriters. And as I mentioned previously, a $500 million 5-year revolving credit facility we entered into in December came effective upon the IPO.
Now let's turn to our predecessor results issued this morning for periods prior to the IPO. As we outlined during our earlier NiSource remarks, Columbia Pipeline Group executed on and placed into service a wide variety of high-value projects during the year. These projects were core to CPPL's predecessor growth and will serve as the model for partnerships growth in 2015 and beyond. The predecessor reported net income of about $269 million for 2014 compared to about $267 million for 2013. The increase is primarily a result of new growth projects placed in service, new firm contracts of higher mineral rights royalties. On an adjusted EBITDA basis, the predecessor reported about $599 million in 2014 versus about $543 million in 2013. These results provide us with a solid footing as we move forward with CPPL's strategies. Bob?"

Good morning, and thank you for joining us. 2014 was a watershed year for NiSource. It was anchored by focused execution of a record infrastructure investment program and the initiation of strategic and transformational growth plans. Those notably included the creation of Columbia Pipeline Partners and the announcement of the Columbia Pipeline Group spinoff.
If you'll turn to Slide 3 in the supplemental deck that was posted online this morning, you'll see a few of the year's highlights. The NiSource team delivered yet another year of solid operational performance and industry-leading financial results. In 2014, we generated net operating earnings from continuing operations, non-GAAP, of $1.72 per share, exceeding our guidance range of $1.61 to $1.71 per share, and up nearly 9% from 2013. And we delivered total returns to our shareholders of 32%, which outperformed the major utility indices for the sixth consecutive year. 
Our team executed on a record $2.2 billion capital investment program, made significant progress on various regulatory and legislative programs, and originated several transformational growth projects at CPG. These initiatives sync closely with our company-wide modernization initiatives, deliver significant value to our customers by facilitating the development of significant shale resources, and providing more modern, safe, efficient and environmentally friendly infrastructure. They also benefit our communities through job creation and economic development, and our shareholders through sustainable long-term returns. 
During the year, we also expanded our projected long-term inventory of infrastructure investments, which is now targeted at $12 billion to $15 billion at CPG over the next 10 years and $30 billion at NiSource's utilities over 20-plus years. 
As I noted at the top of the call, 2014 marked the launch of 2 important strategic initiatives: the separation of CPG and the creation of Columbia Pipeline Partners. On that note, our team was pleased with Columbia Pipeline Partners' $1.2 billion initial public offering in early February. The partnership's offering was enthusiastically received by investors, and Steve will provide a brief update on the partnership as part of this morning's call. 
We remain on track with the NiSource CPG separation process. A couple of weeks ago, we filed our initial Form 10 registration statement with the SEC, have announced key expected board members and the majority of executive team members for both companies. Following the separation, both companies are expected to move forward as independent, investment-grade, pure-play entities with experienced teams focusing on executing and elevating well-established platforms for growth. 
As we look ahead to NiSource and CPG operating the independent companies, I wanted to briefly highlight their growth expectations. As we first announced at our 2014 Investor Day, NiSource is a pure-play utility, expects its average annual long-term earnings and dividend to grow at 4% to 6% over the long term. As a pure-play pipeline company with an MLP, CPG is targeting its annual adjusted EBITDA growth in the mid- to upper teens over the next several years. Its annual dividend growth is expected to be commensurate with this robust EBITDA growth. 
With these very strong growth rates and deep investment inventories, both companies will position -- will be positioned in the top tier of their peer groups. As the separation date gets closer, both NiSource and CPG will conduct road shows to provide additional details on their projected performance profiles. 
And just to expand on the growth for one moment, we wanted to be absolutely clear on the fundamental baseline commitments of each company; therefore, we provided earnings and dividend outlooks, as well as capital expenditure outlooks. We wanted to be clear on what long-term drivers are for each of the businesses. We wanted to be helpful versus academic.
And as you know, 2015 will be a split year for NiSource and CPG. With significant developments unfolding during the first half of the year, including the IPO of CPPL, the recapitalization of CPG and NiSource, as well as the separation itself and the ongoing development of Mountaineer XPress and Gulf XPress. Again, we wanted to provide what was helpful, what was most constructive; therefore, our key commitments, our key fundamental drivers. As we mentioned, the roadshows will occur prior to separation to provide additional detail on '15, '16 and the long term. 
Now with that, let me turn the call over to Steve Smith to review our 2014 financial results highlighted on Page 4 of our supplemental slides."
292092,283238666,764664,"NiSource Inc., Columbia Pipeline Partners LP, Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 18, 2015",2015-02-18,"Earnings Calls","NiSource Inc.","Executives","Good morning, everyone. As Bob mentioned, we exceeded our guidance range for the year by generating non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $545 million or $1.72 per share, which compares to about $495 million or $1.58 per share in 2013. On an operating",446,"Good morning, everyone. As Bob mentioned, we exceeded our guidance range for the year by generating non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $545 million or $1.72 per share, which compares to about $495 million or $1.58 per share in 2013. On an operating earnings basis, NiSource was up about $125 million. On a GAAP comparison, our income from continuing operations was about $530 million for 2014 versus about $490 million for 2013.
At the segment level, you will see in today's release that each of our 3 core business units delivered solid financial results. CPG delivered operating earnings of about $491 million compared to about $441 million in 2013. CPG's net revenues, excluding the impact of trackers, were up about $80 million. NIPSCO's electric operations delivered about $288 million in operating earnings compared to about $265 million for the prior year. Net revenues, excluding trackers, were up about $47 million.
And finally, our Gas Distribution business unit came in at about $517 million compared to about $449 million in 2013. Net revenues, again, excluding the impact of trackers, were up about $126 million. As our numbers attest, it was another strong year for the NiSource team. Full details of our results are available in our earnings release issued and posted online this morning. 
Now turning to Slide 5, I'd like to briefly touch on our financing and liquidity position. We retained a strong liquidity position with approximately $720 million of net available liquidity at the end of the year. Of our record $2.2 billion capital investment program, approximately 76% of these investments were focused on revenue-generating opportunities. Our debt to capitalization came in at about 62% at the end of the year. And as Bob mentioned, we remain on track with the NiSource-CPG separation.
In that regard, we have taken several key steps to establish a strong financial foundation for both companies. The first step was to secure 2 separate credit facilities that will become effective at the separation. We entered into 2 $1.5 billion 5-year credit facilities, one for NiSource and the other for CPG. These facilities will replace NiSource's existing $2 billion agreement. At the same time we entered these agreements, we also entered into a $500 million 5-year facility at Columbia Pipeline Partners, which went into effect at the time of the IPO. The next major step in this process is the recapitalization, which is on schedule to commence in the second quarter. We will provide additional updates on this process on our first quarter earnings update and through other public announcements.
With that, I'll turn the call back to Bob to discuss a few execution highlights from each of our business units."
292092,283238666,764664,"NiSource Inc., Columbia Pipeline Partners LP, Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 18, 2015",2015-02-18,"Earnings Calls","NiSource Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Steve. Let's start with CPG highlights on Slide 6. The CPG team continues to advance a steady stream of transformational growth and modernization projects. As I noted earlier, CPG expects to invest up to $15 billion in growth capital over the next",1324,"Thanks, Steve. Let's start with CPG highlights on Slide 6. The CPG team continues to advance a steady stream of transformational growth and modernization projects. As I noted earlier, CPG expects to invest up to $15 billion in growth capital over the next 10 years, with most major projects currently in execution or in advanced stages of development.
During 2014, CPG placed more than $300 million in system expansion projects in service, adding approximately 1.1 billion cubic feet of system capacity. An additional $200 million in midstream projects were put in service during the year, and CPG's modernization work approached $320 million. So in total, for 2014, we added more than $800 million in new revenue-generating assets in service, all on time and on budget. 
Meanwhile, the CPG team is in full execution mode on several ongoing and transformational growth projects. In December, the FERC approved the construction of the East Side Expansion project, which will provide approximately 315 million cubic feet per day of additional capacity for Marcellus supplies to reach the growing Mid-Atlantic markets. This $275 million project is expected to be placed in service later this year.
In addition to the East Side expansion, CPG has more than $3 billion of growth projects in progress that will add approximately 4 billion cubic feet of transportation capacity. These projects include the Leach and Rayne XPress projects, the WB XPress project and the Cameron Access Project. The Rayne and Leach projects collectively involve about $1.8 billion in system expansion, creating a major new pathway for transporting shale production to attractive markets and liquid trading points. Both projects are expected to be in service by the end of 2017.
WB XPress is almost a $900 million project to transport about 1.3 billion cubic feet of shale gas to East Coast markets and various pipeline interconnects, including access to the Cove Point LNG terminal. And Cameron Access is a roughly $300 million investment and involves new pipeline facilities to connect with the Cameron LNG terminal in Southern Louisiana. The project will offer initial capacity of up to 800 million cubic feet per day.
Our Colombia Midstream team also is continuing to capitalize on CPG's strong asset position in the Marcellus and Utica regions. Midstream projects currently in progress include the $120 million Washington County Gathering project and the $65 million Big Pine Expansion project. Big Pine and the first phase of Washington County will be placed in service before the end of the year.
As you may recall during our prior discussions, we've outlined plans for the potential Mountaineer XPress project. We're now in advanced commercial discussions with customers on this major project, as well as a complementary project called Gulf XPress. If implemented, these projects would provide substantial transportation capacity out of the Marcellus and Utica shale regions. These 2 projects could involve an investment as large $2 billion to $2.5 billion. We hope to complete commercial terms and clear all contractual outs by July.
As you can see, on all fronts, the CPG team is executing against an impressive and, indeed, transformational growth agenda. In 2015, we're targeting a capital investment level of approximately $1.1 billion in CPG. As you've heard us say before, our intent is to triple our net asset base over the next 5 years. 
With that, let's now shift to our utility businesses, starting with NIPSCO, our Indiana Electric and Natural Gas business, summarized on Slide 7. NIPSCO is continuing to deliver on its commercial and customer strategy with an inventory of investment opportunities approaching $10 billion for electric infrastructure and $5 billion for gas infrastructure over the next 20-plus years.
2014 was a strong year for NIPSCO as well. In the first half of '14, NIPSCO commenced its 7-year natural gas and electric infrastructure modernization programs, now expected to reach an investment level of nearly $2 billion. The team competed approximately $120 million of projects in 2014. These investments will help to improve reliability and maintain system safety for the next generation. 
On the environmental front, in December, NIPSCO placed the final FGD unit in service at the Schahfer Generating facility. This unit, like the one placed in service during the fourth quarter of 2013, was delivered on time and on budget. A third FGD unit at NIPSCO's Michigan City Generation Facility is on schedule to be placed in service by the end of 2015. Following the completion of the Michigan City unit, all of NIPSCO's coal-burning facilities will be fully scrubbed.
On the growth side, progress also continued on 2 major NIPSCO electric transmission projects. Right of way acquisition and permitting are underway for both projects, and preliminary construction will begin on the 345-kV Reynolds to Topeka line in the first half of this year. You'll recall these projects involve an investment of about $0.5 billion for NIPSCO and are anticipated to be in service by the end of 2018.
And finally, in addition to the continuation of NIPSCO's electric energy efficiency programs, the IURC approved the extension of the Green Power Rate program. NIPSCO also reached a settlement on the continuation of its feed-in tariff program. 
NIPSCO's agenda in 2015 remains focused on enhancing the reliability and environmental performance of its systems, their modernization and replacement investments. In addition to delivering customer programs that help reduce energy usage and manage bills, these investments, expected to reach nearly $400 million in 2015, deliver significant economic development and job creation activity in Northern Indiana, while at the same time delivering value to our investors. 
Turning to our Gas Distribution operations on Slide 8. You can see a similar story of large-scale infrastructure investment paired with complementary regulatory and customer initiatives. Touching on a few highlights from the year. In November, the Pennsylvania Commission approved a settlement in Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania's base rate case. The case provides for a recovery of CPAs investments in its well-established infrastructure modernization program and will increase annual revenues by approximately $33 million. New rates went into effect in December.
Also in December, Columbia Gas of Virginia reached a settlement with customers for its rate case, which, if approved, will increase base rates by about $25 million. Notably, in January, the hearing examiner in the case recommended approval of the settlement. Final commission decision is expected by the end of the first quarter. These rate cases, along with one completed in Massachusetts, provide for continued recovery of investments related to our well-established infrastructure programs, which are designed to maintain and improve the safety and reliability of our systems. 
Also in the fourth quarter, Columbia Gas of Massachusetts filed its 2015 system -- Gas System Enhancement Plan under new legislation authorizing accelerated recovery of gas infrastructure modernization investment. If approved as filed, cost recovery would increase annual revenues by approximately $2.6 million. Across our gas utilities, we expect to invest almost $900 million in 2015. Together, NiSource's industry-leading platform for utility growth provides significant reliability, safety and environmental benefits to our existing and new customers, while also delivering shareholder returns through transparent recovery mechanisms. 
Shifting to Slide 9, our key takeaways for 2015. We plan to execute our current business and customer plans, while at the same time delivering the CPG spinoff on schedule in mid-2015. We're moving ahead with another year of record capital investments targeted at $2.4 billion across our utilities and pipelines, and a complementary regulatory and customer service agenda.
As for the separation, we're well on our way to standing up 2 premier companies, management and directors at both companies. CPG and NiSource will be well financed and strongly positioned to execute on their distinct strategies, and deliver enhanced long-term earnings and dividend growth. As I mentioned, both NiSource and CPG will conduct roadshows prior to separation to provide detailed business profiles.
With those highlights for NiSource, we'll now shift to Slide 11 in the NiSource deck, and Steve will discuss Columbia Pipeline Partners' IPO and its predecessor results. Steve?"

With the launch of CPPL, we've introduced a best-in-class MLP to the market. One with a strong supportive sponsor; stable and predictable cash flows that are virtually insensitive to fluctuations in commodity prices and volumes; a robust growth profile with a deep inventory of long-term infrastructure investments; a strategic footprint overlaying the Marcellus and Utica shale production areas; financial strength and flexibility; and a premier execution-focused and experienced leadership team. Our offering was very well received, and we're very pleased with the continued positive response.
Let's quickly touch on our IPO and predecessor results on Page 12. The offering of approximately 54 million units at $23 per share raised nearly $1.2 billion. We priced the offering on February 5 and subsequently began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol CPPL the following day. These units include the full greenshoe allotment executed by the underwriters. And as I mentioned previously, our $500 million 5-year revolving credit facility we entered into in December came effective upon the IPO.
Now let's turn to our predecessor results issued this morning for periods prior to the IPO. As we outlined during our earlier NiSource remarks, Columbia Pipeline Group executed on and placed into service a wide variety of high-value projects during the year. These projects were core to CPPL's predecessor growth and will serve as the model for the partnership's growth in 2015 and beyond. The predecessor reported net income of about $269 million for 2014 compared to about $267 million for 2013. The increase is primarily a result of new growth projects placed in service, new firm contracts and higher mineral rights royalties. On an adjusted EBITDA basis, the predecessor reported about $599 million in 2014 versus about $543 million in 2013. These results provide us with a solid footing as we move forward with CPPL's strategies. Bob?"

Good morning, and thank you for joining us. 2014 was a watershed year for NiSource. It was anchored by focused execution of a record infrastructure investment program and the initiation of strategic and transformational growth plans. Those notably included the creation of Columbia Pipeline Partners and the announcement of the Columbia Pipeline Group spinoff.
If you'll turn to Slide 3 in the supplemental deck that was posted online this morning, you'll see a few of the year's highlights. The NiSource team delivered yet another year of solid operational performance and industry-leading financial results. In 2014, we generated net operating earnings from continuing operations, non-GAAP, of $1.72 per share, exceeding our guidance range of $1.61 to $1.71 per share, and up nearly 9% from 2013. And we delivered total returns to our shareholders of 32%, which outperformed the major utility indices for the sixth consecutive year. 
Our team executed on a record $2.2 billion capital investment program, made significant progress on various regulatory and legislative programs, and originated several transformational growth projects at CPG. These initiatives sync closely with our company-wide modernization initiatives, deliver significant value to our customers by facilitating the development of significant shale resources, and providing more modern, safe, efficient and environmentally friendly infrastructure. They also benefit our communities through job creation and economic development, and our shareholders through sustainable long-term returns. 
During the year, we also expanded our projected long-term inventory of infrastructure investments, which is now targeted at $12 billion to $15 billion at CPG over the next 10 years and $30 billion at NiSource's utilities over 20-plus years. 
As I noted at the top of the call, 2014 marked the launch of 2 important strategic initiatives: the separation of CPG and the creation of Columbia Pipeline Partners. On that note, our team was pleased with Columbia Pipeline Partners' $1.2 billion initial public offering in early February. The partnership's offering was enthusiastically received by investors, and Steve will provide a brief update on the partnership as part of this morning's call. 
We remain on track with the NiSource CPG separation process. A couple of weeks ago, we filed our initial Form 10 registration statement with the SEC, have announced key expected board members and the majority of executive team members for both companies. Following the separation, both companies are expected to move forward as independent, investment-grade, pure-play entities with experienced teams focusing on executing and elevating well-established platforms for growth. 
As we look ahead to NiSource and CPG operating the independent companies, I wanted to briefly highlight their growth expectations. As we first announced at our 2014 Investor Day, NiSource is a pure-play utility, expects its average annual long-term earnings and dividend to grow at 4% to 6% over the long term. As a pure-play pipeline company with an MLP, CPG is targeting its annual adjusted EBITDA growth in the mid- to upper teens over the next several years. Its annual dividend growth is expected to be commensurate with this robust EBITDA growth. 
With these very strong growth rates and deep investment inventories, both companies will position -- will be positioned in the top tier of their peer groups. As the separation date gets closer, both NiSource and CPG will conduct road shows to provide additional details on their projected performance profiles. 
And just to expand on the growth for one moment, we wanted to be absolutely clear on the fundamental baseline commitments of each company; therefore, we provided earnings and dividend outlooks, as well as capital expenditure outlooks. We wanted to be clear on what long-term drivers are for each of the businesses. We wanted to be helpful versus academic.
And as you know, 2015 will be a split year for NiSource and CPG. With significant developments unfolding during the first half of the year, including the IPO of CPPL, the recapitalization of CPG and NiSource, as well as the separation itself and the ongoing development of Mountaineer XPress and Gulf XPress. Again, we wanted to provide what was helpful, what was most constructive; therefore, our key commitments, our key fundamental drivers. As we mentioned, the roadshows will occur prior to separation to provide additional detail on '15, '16 and the long term. 
Now with that, let me turn the call over to Steve Smith to review our 2014 financial results highlighted on Page 4 of our supplemental slides."
292092,283238666,765202,"NiSource Inc., Columbia Pipeline Partners LP, Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 18, 2015",2015-02-18,"Earnings Calls","NiSource Inc.","Executives","Good morning, everyone. As Bob mentioned, we exceeded our guidance range for the year by generating non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $545 million or $1.72 per share, which compares to about $495 million or $1.58 per share in 2013. On an operating",446,"Good morning, everyone. As Bob mentioned, we exceeded our guidance range for the year by generating non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $545 million or $1.72 per share, which compares to about $495 million or $1.58 per share in 2013. On an operating earnings basis, NiSource was up about $125 million. On a GAAP comparison, our income from continuing operations was about $530 million for 2014 versus about $490 million for 2013.
At the segment level, you will see in today's release that each of our 3 core business units delivered solid financial results. CPG delivered operating earnings of about $491 million compared to about $441 million in 2013. CPG's net revenues, excluding the impact of trackers, were up about $80 million. NIPSCO's electric operations delivered about $288 million in operating earnings compared to about $265 million for the prior year. Net revenues, excluding trackers, were up about $47 million.
And finally, our Gas Distribution business unit came in at about $517 million compared to about $449 million in 2013. Net revenues, again, excluding the impact of trackers, were up about $126 million. As our numbers attest, it was another strong year for the NiSource team. Full details of our results are available in our earnings release issued and posted online this morning. 
Now turning to Slide 5, I'd like to briefly touch on our financing and liquidity position. We retained a strong liquidity position with approximately $720 million of net available liquidity at the end of the year. Of our record $2.2 billion capital investment program, approximately 76% of these investments were focused on revenue-generating opportunities. Our debt to capitalization came in at about 62% at the end of the year. And as Bob mentioned, we remain on track with the NiSource-CPG separation.
In that regard, we have taken several key steps to establish a strong financial foundation for both companies. The first step was to secure 2 separate credit facilities that will become effective at the separation. We entered into 2 $1.5 billion 5-year credit facilities, one for NiSource and the other for CPG. These facilities will replace NiSource's existing $2 billion agreement. At the same time we entered these agreements, we also entered into a $500 million 5-year facility at Columbia Pipeline Partners, which went into effect at the time of the IPO. The next major step in this process is the recapitalization, which is on schedule to commence in the second quarter. We will provide additional updates on this process on our first quarter earnings update and through other public announcements.
With that, I'll turn the call back to Bob to discuss a few execution highlights from each of our business units."
292092,283238666,765202,"NiSource Inc., Columbia Pipeline Partners LP, Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 18, 2015",2015-02-18,"Earnings Calls","NiSource Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Steve. Let's start with CPG highlights on Slide 6. The CPG team continues to advance a steady stream of transformational growth and modernization projects. As I noted earlier, CPG expects to invest up to $15 billion in growth capital over the next",1324,"Thanks, Steve. Let's start with CPG highlights on Slide 6. The CPG team continues to advance a steady stream of transformational growth and modernization projects. As I noted earlier, CPG expects to invest up to $15 billion in growth capital over the next 10 years, with most major projects currently in execution or in advanced stages of development.
During 2014, CPG placed more than $300 million in system expansion projects in service, adding approximately 1.1 billion cubic feet of system capacity. An additional $200 million in midstream projects were put in service during the year, and CPG's modernization work approached $320 million. So in total, for 2014, we added more than $800 million in new revenue-generating assets in service, all on time and on budget. 
Meanwhile, the CPG team is in full execution mode on several ongoing and transformational growth projects. In December, the FERC approved the construction of the East Side Expansion project, which will provide approximately 315 million cubic feet per day of additional capacity for Marcellus supplies to reach the growing Mid-Atlantic markets. This $275 million project is expected to be placed in service later this year.
In addition to the East Side expansion, CPG has more than $3 billion of growth projects in progress that will add approximately 4 billion cubic feet of transportation capacity. These projects include the Leach and Rayne XPress projects, the WB XPress project and the Cameron Access Project. The Rayne and Leach projects collectively involve about $1.8 billion in system expansion, creating a major new pathway for transporting shale production to attractive markets and liquid trading points. Both projects are expected to be in service by the end of 2017.
WB XPress is almost a $900 million project to transport about 1.3 billion cubic feet of shale gas to East Coast markets and various pipeline interconnects, including access to the Cove Point LNG terminal. And Cameron Access is a roughly $300 million investment and involves new pipeline facilities to connect with the Cameron LNG terminal in Southern Louisiana. The project will offer initial capacity of up to 800 million cubic feet per day.
Our Colombia Midstream team also is continuing to capitalize on CPG's strong asset position in the Marcellus and Utica regions. Midstream projects currently in progress include the $120 million Washington County Gathering project and the $65 million Big Pine Expansion project. Big Pine and the first phase of Washington County will be placed in service before the end of the year.
As you may recall during our prior discussions, we've outlined plans for the potential Mountaineer XPress project. We're now in advanced commercial discussions with customers on this major project, as well as a complementary project called Gulf XPress. If implemented, these projects would provide substantial transportation capacity out of the Marcellus and Utica shale regions. These 2 projects could involve an investment as large $2 billion to $2.5 billion. We hope to complete commercial terms and clear all contractual outs by July.
As you can see, on all fronts, the CPG team is executing against an impressive and, indeed, transformational growth agenda. In 2015, we're targeting a capital investment level of approximately $1.1 billion in CPG. As you've heard us say before, our intent is to triple our net asset base over the next 5 years. 
With that, let's now shift to our utility businesses, starting with NIPSCO, our Indiana Electric and Natural Gas business, summarized on Slide 7. NIPSCO is continuing to deliver on its commercial and customer strategy with an inventory of investment opportunities approaching $10 billion for electric infrastructure and $5 billion for gas infrastructure over the next 20-plus years.
2014 was a strong year for NIPSCO as well. In the first half of '14, NIPSCO commenced its 7-year natural gas and electric infrastructure modernization programs, now expected to reach an investment level of nearly $2 billion. The team competed approximately $120 million of projects in 2014. These investments will help to improve reliability and maintain system safety for the next generation. 
On the environmental front, in December, NIPSCO placed the final FGD unit in service at the Schahfer Generating facility. This unit, like the one placed in service during the fourth quarter of 2013, was delivered on time and on budget. A third FGD unit at NIPSCO's Michigan City Generation Facility is on schedule to be placed in service by the end of 2015. Following the completion of the Michigan City unit, all of NIPSCO's coal-burning facilities will be fully scrubbed.
On the growth side, progress also continued on 2 major NIPSCO electric transmission projects. Right of way acquisition and permitting are underway for both projects, and preliminary construction will begin on the 345-kV Reynolds to Topeka line in the first half of this year. You'll recall these projects involve an investment of about $0.5 billion for NIPSCO and are anticipated to be in service by the end of 2018.
And finally, in addition to the continuation of NIPSCO's electric energy efficiency programs, the IURC approved the extension of the Green Power Rate program. NIPSCO also reached a settlement on the continuation of its feed-in tariff program. 
NIPSCO's agenda in 2015 remains focused on enhancing the reliability and environmental performance of its systems, their modernization and replacement investments. In addition to delivering customer programs that help reduce energy usage and manage bills, these investments, expected to reach nearly $400 million in 2015, deliver significant economic development and job creation activity in Northern Indiana, while at the same time delivering value to our investors. 
Turning to our Gas Distribution operations on Slide 8. You can see a similar story of large-scale infrastructure investment paired with complementary regulatory and customer initiatives. Touching on a few highlights from the year. In November, the Pennsylvania Commission approved a settlement in Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania's base rate case. The case provides for a recovery of CPAs investments in its well-established infrastructure modernization program and will increase annual revenues by approximately $33 million. New rates went into effect in December.
Also in December, Columbia Gas of Virginia reached a settlement with customers for its rate case, which, if approved, will increase base rates by about $25 million. Notably, in January, the hearing examiner in the case recommended approval of the settlement. Final commission decision is expected by the end of the first quarter. These rate cases, along with one completed in Massachusetts, provide for continued recovery of investments related to our well-established infrastructure programs, which are designed to maintain and improve the safety and reliability of our systems. 
Also in the fourth quarter, Columbia Gas of Massachusetts filed its 2015 system -- Gas System Enhancement Plan under new legislation authorizing accelerated recovery of gas infrastructure modernization investment. If approved as filed, cost recovery would increase annual revenues by approximately $2.6 million. Across our gas utilities, we expect to invest almost $900 million in 2015. Together, NiSource's industry-leading platform for utility growth provides significant reliability, safety and environmental benefits to our existing and new customers, while also delivering shareholder returns through transparent recovery mechanisms. 
Shifting to Slide 9, our key takeaways for 2015. We plan to execute our current business and customer plans, while at the same time delivering the CPG spinoff on schedule in mid-2015. We're moving ahead with another year of record capital investments targeted at $2.4 billion across our utilities and pipelines, and a complementary regulatory and customer service agenda.
As for the separation, we're well on our way to standing up 2 premier companies, management and directors at both companies. CPG and NiSource will be well financed and strongly positioned to execute on their distinct strategies, and deliver enhanced long-term earnings and dividend growth. As I mentioned, both NiSource and CPG will conduct roadshows prior to separation to provide detailed business profiles.
With those highlights for NiSource, we'll now shift to Slide 11 in the NiSource deck, and Steve will discuss Columbia Pipeline Partners' IPO and its predecessor results. Steve?"

With the launch of CPPL, we've introduced a best-in-class MLP to the market. One with a strong supportive sponsor; stable and predictable cash flows that are virtually insensitive to fluctuations in commodity prices and volumes; a robust growth profile with a deep inventory of long-term infrastructure investments; a strategic footprint overlaying the Marcellus and Utica shale production areas; financial strength and flexibility; and a premier execution-focused and experienced leadership team. Our offering was very well received, and we're very pleased with the continued positive response.
Let's quickly touch on our IPO and predecessor results on Page 12. The offering of approximately 54 million units at $23 per share raised nearly $1.2 billion. We priced the offering on February 5 and subsequently began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol CPPL the following day. These units include the full greenshoe allotment executed by the underwriters. And as I mentioned previously, our $500 million 5-year revolving credit facility we entered into in December came effective upon the IPO.
Now let's turn to our predecessor results issued this morning for periods prior to the IPO. As we outlined during our earlier NiSource remarks, Columbia Pipeline Group executed on and placed into service a wide variety of high-value projects during the year. These projects were core to CPPL's predecessor growth and will serve as the model for the partnership's growth in 2015 and beyond. The predecessor reported net income of about $269 million for 2014 compared to about $267 million for 2013. The increase is primarily a result of new growth projects placed in service, new firm contracts and higher mineral rights royalties. On an adjusted EBITDA basis, the predecessor reported about $599 million in 2014 versus about $543 million in 2013. These results provide us with a solid footing as we move forward with CPPL's strategies. Bob?"

If you'll turn to Slide 3 on the supplemental deck that was posted online this morning, you'll see a few key takeaways for the quarter as well as an update of the separation of NiSource and Columbia Pipeline Group. For the quarter, results were solidly in line with our plans, and NiSource team delivered $0.85 per share non-GAAP in the first quarter versus $0.82 per share in 2014. Our teams also continue to execute on core infrastructure investment plans at all of our businesses and capital expenditures across our utility and pipeline segments remain on track. It's a reminder for 2015, we expect record spend of $2.4 billion. We also remain on track to complete the separation of NiSource and CPG, which we anticipate will happen on July 1, 2015. At the time of the separation, shareholders are expected to receive 1 share of Columbia Pipeline Group common stock for each share of NiSource common stock. As you know, the transaction is expected to be tax-free for shareholders and the company. In preparation for the separation, experienced leadership teams have been named for both companies, and just recently, the respective NiSource and CPG executive teams discussed their go-forward financial plans with the 3 major credit rating agencies.
As we said when we announced the separation, we expect both companies will be investment grade. Current expectations are that CPG will be formally rated prior to its May debt recapitalization transaction. And the NiSource's credit rating -- credit ratings will be addressed at or about the time of separation. With each step of the separation process, including the debt recapitalization process, we're positioning NiSource and CPG to be ranked among the leaders in the respective business segments. We expect both will be well-capitalized and have robust and transparent long-term growth plans, growing dividends and solid leadership and the capacity and focused to deliver enhanced long-term growth. To profile the business strategies and growth plans of the respective companies, we've scheduled 2 separate webcast on Thursday, May 14. First, Joe Hamrock and team will provide an overview of NiSource is pure play utility business, including its investment opportunities and his commitment to customers and the communities it serves. Following the NiSource call, CPG's executive team will host a similar call. The team will highlight CPG's solid core business, it's strategically located assets and its portfolio of transformational modernization in growth opportunities. The NiSource webcast will start at 9 a.m. and the CPG webcast will begin at 10:30 a.m., both Eastern Time. The event with the company presentations will be available at www.nisource.com. In addition to the May 14 webcast, we'll maintain regular communication regarding the separation process through our normal channels, including press releases and filings with the SEC. Now I'll turn the call over to Steve Smith to review our first quarter financial results highlighted on Page 4 of our supplemental slides."

As Bob mentioned, we delivered non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $268 million or $0.85 per share, which compares to about $258 million or $0.82 per share in the first quarter of 2014. On operating earnings basis, NiSource was up about $20 million. On a GAAP comparison, our income from continuing operations was about $268 million for the first quarter versus about $266 million for the same period in 2014. At the segment level, you will see in today's release, that each of our 3 core business segments delivered financial results in line with our expectations during the first quarter. CPG delivered operating earnings of about $163 million compared to about $159 million in 2014. CPG's net revenues, excluding the impact of trackers were up about $22 million, primarily, due to new growth projects placed into service a new firm capacity contracts. NIPSCO's electric operations delivered about $66 million in operating earnings compared to about $74 million same period in 2014.
Net revenues, again, excluding tractors, were 1 relatively flat due primarily, to lower all system sales. And finally, our Gas Distribution business came in at about $306 million compared to about $280 million in 2014. Net revenues, again, excluding the impact of trackers were up about $43 million. As the numbers have passed, we continue to deliver solid financial results. Full details of our results are available in our next release issued and posted online this morning.
Now turning to Slide 5. I'd like to briefly touch on our financing and liquidity position. We retained a strong liquidity position with approximately $2 billion of net available capacity as of March 31. Of our $2.4 billion capital investment program planned for 2015 at NiSource and CPG, approximately 80% of these investments are focused on revenue generating opportunities. Our debt to capitalization agreement solid at about 54% as of March 31. And as Bob mentioned, we remain on track with the NiSource, CPG separation. Including establishing a strong financial foundation with expected investment grade credit ratings. A CPG long-term debt offering of $2.75 billion and the NiSource tender transaction will begin soon. As we've noted previously, the proceeds of CPG's debt offering will be used to fund a one-time cash distribution to NiSource prior to the separation. With that, I'll turn the call back to Bob and Joe to discuss a few execution highlights from our business segments."

The CPG team continues to advance the steady stream of transformational growth projects, which are in addition to its landmark modernization program. The latest news on that front includes the completion of an open season for 2 major regulated transmission projects and the development of a new midstream project. We're happy to report that we have a critical mass of firm customer commitments in place following the binding open season for Mountaineer and XPress projects, which concluded on April 23. So reminder these 2 projects will involve an investment of approximately $2.6 billion and would add 2.7 billion cubic feet per day of transportation capacity on Columbia Gas Transmission, nearly 900 million cubic feet per day of transportation capacity on the Columbia Gulf System. And on the midstream front, our team discussions with major producer on another dry gas gathering trunk line in southwestern Pennsylvania. Once we have all the details confirmed, we will provide an update on this exciting new project. All of CPG's other in progress modernization, growth in midstream projects remain on track. You'll recall that CPG's targeted capital investment level for 2015 is approximately $1.1 billion. A full highlight of our employee growth projects can be found on pages 13 and 14 for the supplemental deck. With that, let me welcome Joe Hamrock to the call. Joe?"

Let shift first to NIPSCO, our Indiana electric and natural gas business, summarized on Slide 7.

Let shift first to NIPSCO, our Indiana electric and natural gas business, summarized on Slide 7. The NIPSCO team is continuing to deliver on our customer-focused strategy of investment opportunities approaching $10 billion for electric infrastructure and $5 billion for gas infrastructure over the next 20-plus years. The FGD unit under construction that NIPSCO's Michigan City Generating Facility is on scheduled to be placed in service by the end of 2015. Following the completion of the Michigan city unit and with those we placed in service over the past 2 years, all of NIPSCO's facilities will be fully scrubbed. NIPSCO's 2 major electric transmission projects are also progressing as planned. Right-of-way acquisition and permitting are underway for both projects, and preliminary construction began on a 345 kV rentals to pick a line. You'll recall these projects involve an investment of about $500 million for NIPSCO and are anticipated to be in service by the end of 2018. We remain on track and committed to our Indiana electric and gas modernization programs. As set forth in our plan, we had about $190 million in plant spend this year. These investment help ensure continued safe, reliable and affordable service to customers. And as you likely saw earlier this month, the Indiana Court of Appeals issued a ruling regarding some of the elements of the approved electric modernization plan. The court upheld key components of the commission's order, and 1 item related to the level of investment detailed within the order we need to be revisited as part of the regulatory and legal process.
As the first utility to file a plan under the key disk stature, we recognized the potential for temporary delay. We're evaluating the rule and remain committed to our modernization investments, which are essential to our ongoing plan for upgrading our system to serve now and into the future. NIPSCO's agenda remains focused on customer service and high-value aggregate programs that enhance the reliability and environmental performance of its systems. Investments in our electric infrastructure are expected to reach nearly $400 million in 2015.
Turning to our Gas Distribution operations on Slide 8. You can see a similar story of large scale infrastructure investment paired with complementary, regulatory and customer programs. Touching on a few regulatory highlights in recent months. In March, Columbia Gas Pennsylvania filed a rate case with Pennsylvania PUC to support continuation of a well-established infrastructure modernization of safety programs. If a proof is filed, the case would increase annual revenues by approximately $46 million. We expect a decision in that case later this year. Columbia Gas of Massachusetts spot a rate case on April 16 with the Massachusetts Department of Public utilities, seeking an annual revenue increase of approximately $49 million. The filing reflects the company's commitment to maintain natural gas safety, customer service and reliability. The decision is expected in the first quarter of 2016 in that case. Also in Massachusetts, later today, we expect the decision from the DPU for our 2015 Gas System Enhancement Plan. Cost recovery associated with the 2015 investments outlined in the plan would begin tomorrow, and annual revenues by approximately $2.6 million.
And Columbia Gas Virginia settled rate case remains pending before the commission. A final order on the $25 million revenue increased as expected later this year. In more recent news, just last week, the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio approved Columbia Gas of Ohio's annual infrastructure replacements and demand side management rider. The rider provides for recovery of its well-established pipeline replacement program and energy efficiency program investments. So overall, we expect to invest approximately $900 million during 2015 across our company's Gas Distribution businesses. These investments help improve reliability and safety for our customers and communities, provide additional customer access to natural gas service and reduced commissions. Through well-established recovering mechanisms in all 7 states, these investments are expected to generate incremental revenue and sustainable returns for shareholders. So in summary, NiSource gas and electric utilities are in full expansion mode on all fronts and very well-positioned for the future. Thanks, again, Bob. And I'll hand things back to you."

We remain focused on and on our track with our current business customer plans. We remain on track with the CPG separation scheduled for July 1. We expect both companies will be well-financed and very well-positioned to execute on their distinct strategies. And now, a couple of days and actions related to the separation that I should highlight once again. We expect to receive our CPG credit ratings in a matter of days, and after securing these ratings, we initiate the debt recapitalization process, including CPG issuing its own long-term debt and a separate tender offer for NiSource debt.
On May 14, as I mentioned earlier, NiSource and CPG will host separate webcast to outline their respective growth strategies and associated infrastructure investment opportunities.

We look forward it diving deeper into these dates and actions during our May 14th webcast. With those highlights, Steve will now briefly discuss Columbia Pipeline Partners' results."

We have a crisp agenda today. I'll touch on several key strategic takeaways. Steve will review our financial results, and then Joe and I will share key execution highlights for NiSource's utilities and CPG. 
If you'll turn to Slide 3 on the supplemental deck that was posted online this morning, you'll see a few key takeaways for the quarter as well as an update of the separation of NiSource and Columbia Pipeline Group. 
For the quarter, results were solidly in line with our plan. The NiSource team delivered $0.85 per share non-GAAP in the first quarter versus $0.82 per share in 2014. Our teams also continued to execute on core infrastructure investment plans at all of our businesses, and capital expenditures across our utility and pipeline segments remain on track. As a reminder, for 2015, we expect a record spend of $2.4 billion. We also remain on track to complete the separation of NiSource and CPG, which we anticipate will happen on July 1, 2015. At the time of the separation, shareholders are expected to receive 1 share of Columbia Pipeline Group common stock for each share of NiSource common stock. As you know, the transaction is expected to be tax free for shareholders and the company. In preparation for the separation, experienced leadership teams have been named for both companies, and just recently, the respective NiSource and CPG executive teams discussed their go-forward financial plans with the 3 major credit-rating agencies.
As we said when we announced the separation, we expect both companies will be investment grade. Current expectations are that CPG will be formally rated prior to its May debt recapitalization transaction. And the NiSource's credit ratings will be addressed at or about the time of separation. With each step in the separation process, including the debt recapitalization process, we're positioning NiSource and CPG to be ranked among the leaders in their respective business segments. We expect both will be well capitalized and have robust and transparent, long-term growth plans, growing dividends and solid leadership and the capacity and focus to deliver enhanced, long-term growth. 
To profile the business strategies and growth plans of the respective companies, we've scheduled 2 separate webcasts on Thursday, May 14. First, Joe Hamrock and team will provide an overview of NiSource's pure play utility business, including its investment opportunities and its commitment to customers and the communities it serves. 
Following the NiSource call, CPG's executive team will host a similar call. The team will highlight CPG's solid core business, its strategically located assets and its portfolio of transformational modernization and growth opportunities. The NiSource webcast will start at 9 a.m. and the CPG webcast will begin at 10:30 a.m., both Eastern Time. The event with the company presentations will be available at www.nisource.com. In addition to the May 14 webcast, we'll maintain regular communication regarding the separation process through our normal channels, including press releases and filings with the SEC. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Steve Smith to review our first quarter financial results highlighted on Page 4 of our supplemental slides."

On an operating earning",402,"Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. As Bob mentioned, we delivered non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $268 million or $0.85 per share, which compares to about $258 million or $0.82 per share in the first quarter of 2014. On an operating earnings basis, NiSource was up about $20 million. On a GAAP comparison, our income from continuing operations was about $268 million for the first quarter versus about $266 million for the same period in 2014. At the segment level, you will see in today's release that each of our 3 core business segments delivered financial results in line with our expectations during the first quarter. CPG delivered operating earnings of about $163 million compared to about $159 million in 2014. CPG's net revenues, excluding the impact of trackers, were up about $22 million, primarily due to new growth projects placed into service and new firm capacity contracts. NIPSCO's electric operations delivered about $67 million in operating earnings compared to about $74 million in the same period in 2014.
Net revenues, again excluding trackers, were relatively flat, due primarily to lower off-system sales. 
And finally, our Gas Distribution business came in at about $306 million compared to about $280 million in 2014. Net revenues, again excluding the impact of trackers, were up about $43 million. As the numbers have passed, we continue to deliver solid financial results. Full details of our results are available in our earnings release issued and posted online this morning.
Now turning to Slide 5. I'd like to briefly touch on our financing and liquidity position. We retained a strong liquidity position with approximately $2 billion of net available capacity as of March 31. Of our $2.4 billion capital investment program planned for 2015 at NiSource and CPG, approximately 80% of these investments are focused on revenue-generating opportunities. Our debt to capitalization remains solid at about 54% as of March 31. And as Bob mentioned, we remain on track with the NiSource, CPG separation, including establishing a strong financial foundation with expected investment-grade credit ratings. A CPG long-term debt offering of $2.75 billion and the NiSource tender transaction will begin soon. As we've noted previously, the proceeds of CPG's debt offering will be used to fund a one-time cash distribution to NiSource prior to the separation. 
With that, I'll turn the call back to Bob and Joe to discuss a few execution highlights from our business segments."

I'll start with highlights for CPG on Slide 6, and then Joe will cover highlights for NIPSCO and our gas utilities. The CPG team continues to advance the steady stream of transformational growth projects, which are in addition to its landmark modernization program. The latest news on that front includes the completion of an open season for 2 major regulated transmission projects and the development of a new midstream project. We're happy to report that we have a critical mass of firm customer commitments in place following the binding open season for Mountaineer and Gulf XPress projects which concluded on April 23. As a reminder, these 2 projects would involve an investment of approximately $2.6 billion and would add 2.7 billion cubic feet per day of transportation capacity on Columbia Gas Transmission and nearly 900 million cubic feet per day of transportation capacity on the Columbia Gulf System. And on the midstream front, our team commenced discussions with a major producer on another dry gas gathering trunk line in southwestern Pennsylvania. Once we have all the details confirmed, we'll provide an update on this exciting new project. All of CPG's other in-progress modernization, growth and midstream projects remain on track. You'll recall that CPG's targeted capital investment level for 2015 is approximately $1.1 billion. A full highlight of our in-flight growth projects can be found on Pages 13 and 14 of the supplemental deck. 
With that, let me welcome Joe Hamrock to the call. Joe?"

Let's shift first to NIPSCO, our Indiana electric and natural gas business, summarized on Slide 7. The NIPSCO team is continuing to deliver on our customer-focused strategy of investment opportunities approaching $10 billion for electric infrastructure and $5 billion for gas infrastructure over the next 20-plus years. The FGD unit under construction at NIPSCO's Michigan City Generating Facility is on schedule to be placed in service by the end of 2015. Following the completion of the Michigan City unit and with those we placed in service over the past 2 years, all of NIPSCO's coal-burning facilities will be fully scrubbed. NIPSCO's 2 major electric transmission projects are also progressing as planned. Right-of-way acquisition and permitting are underway for both projects, and preliminary construction began on a 345-kv Reynolds-Topeka line. You'll recall these projects involve an investment of about $500 million for NIPSCO and are anticipated to be in service by the end of 2018. 
We remain on track and committed to our Indiana electric and gas modernization programs. As set forth in our TEDUS [ph] plan, we have about $190 million in plan to spend this year. These investments help ensure continued safe, reliable and affordable service to customers. And as you likely saw earlier this month, the Indiana Court of Appeals issued a ruling regarding some of the elements of the approved electric modernization plan. The court upheld key components of the commission's order, and one item related to the level of investment detail within the order will need to be revisited as part of the regulatory and legal process.
As the first utility to file a plan under TEDUS [ph]  statute, we recognized the potential for temporary delay. We're evaluating the rule and remain committed to our modernization investments, which are essential to our ongoing plan for upgrading our system to serve [indiscernible] now and into the future. NIPSCO's agenda remains focused on customer service and high-value targeted programs that enhance the reliability and environmental performance of its systems. Investments in our electric infrastructure are expected to reach nearly $400 million in 2015.
Turning to our Gas Distribution operations on Slide 8. You can see a similar story of large scale infrastructure investment paired with complementary, regulatory and customer programs. Touching on a few regulatory highlights in recent months. In March, Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania filed a rate case with the Pennsylvania PUC to support continuation of our well-established infrastructure modernization and safety programs. If approved as filed, the case would increase annual revenues by approximately $46 million. We expect a decision in that case later this year. Columbia Gas of Massachusetts filed a rate case on April 16 with the Massachusetts Department of Public utilities, seeking an annual revenue increase of approximately $49 million. The filing reflects the company's commitment to maintain natural gas safety, customer service and reliability. The decision is expected in the first quarter of 2016 in that case. Also in Massachusetts, later today, we expect the decision from the DPU for our 2015 Gas System Enhancement Plan. Cost recovery associated with the 2015 investments outlined in the plan would begin tomorrow and increase annual revenues by approximately $2.6 million.
And Columbia Gas Virginia settled rate case remains pending before the commission. A final order on the $25 million revenue increase is expected later this year. In more recent news, just last week, the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio approved Columbia Gas of Ohio's annual infrastructure replacements and demand side management rider. The rider provides for recovery of its well-established pipeline replacement program and energy efficiency program investments. So overall, we expect to invest approximately $900 million during 2015 across our company's Gas Distribution businesses. These investments help improve reliability and safety for our customers and communities, provide additional customer access to natural gas service and reduce emissions. Through well-established recovering mechanisms in all 7 states, these investments are expected to generate incremental revenue and sustainable returns for shareholders. So in summary, NiSource gas and electric utilities are in full execution mode on all fronts and very well positioned for the future. Thanks, again, Bob. And I'll hand things back to you."

As you can see, continued solid performance on a strong, well-established growth strategy. Before briefly discussing the results of Columbia Pipeline Partners and opening the call to your questions, let me reiterate several key points. We remain focused on and are on track with our current business and customer plans. We remain on track with the CPG separation scheduled for July 1. We expect both companies will be well financed and very well positioned to execute on their distinct strategies. And now, a couple of dates and actions related to the separation that I should highlight once again. We expect to receive our CPG credit ratings in a matter of days, and after securing these ratings, we'll initiate the debt recapitalization process, including CPG issuing its own long-term debt and a separate tender offer for NiSource debt.
On May 14, as I mentioned earlier, NiSource and CPG will host separate webcast to outline their respective growth strategies and associated infrastructure investment opportunities. In early June, we anticipate that we'll confirm the distribution record date, the effectiveness of the Form 10 and the so-called when issued trading period. All of these would culminate with the planned distribution of shares on July 1, 2015, and CPG trading on its own the following day. We look forward to diving deeper into these dates and actions during our May 14 webcast. With those highlights, Steve will now briefly discuss Columbia Pipeline Partners' results."

And NiSource is going to take that payment, both the dividend and the repayment of intercompany debt and use that to execute a tender offer for approximately $750 million or so of NiSource's debt over the next 30 days or so.

We have a crisp agenda today. I'll touch on several key strategic takeaways.

If you'll turn to Slide 3 in the supplemental deck that was posted online this morning, you'll see a few key takeaways for the quarter as well as an update of the separation of NiSource and Columbia Pipeline Group. 
For the quarter, results were solidly in line with our plan. The NiSource team delivered $0.85 per share non-GAAP in the first quarter versus $0.82 per share in 2014. Our teams also continued to execute on core infrastructure investment plans at all of our businesses, and capital expenditures across our utility and pipeline segments remain on track. As a reminder, for 2015, we expect a record spend of $2.4 billion. We also remain on track to complete the separation of NiSource and CPG, which we anticipate will happen on July 1, 2015. At the time of the separation, shareholders are expected to receive 1 share of Columbia Pipeline Group common stock for each share of NiSource common stock. As you know, the transaction is expected to be tax free for shareholders and the company. In preparation for the separation, experienced leadership teams have been named for both companies, and just recently, the respective NiSource and CPG executive teams discussed their go-forward financial plans with the 3 major credit-rating agencies.
As we said when we announced the separation, we expect both companies will be investment grade. Current expectations are that CPG will be formally rated prior to its May debt recapitalization transaction. And the NiSource's credit ratings will be addressed at or about the time of separation. With each step in the separation process, including the debt recapitalization process, we're positioning NiSource and CPG to be ranked among the leaders in their respective business segments. We expect both will be well capitalized and have robust and transparent, long-term growth plans, growing dividends and solid leadership and the capacity and focus to deliver enhanced, long-term growth. 
To profile the business strategies and growth plans of the respective companies, we've scheduled 2 separate webcasts on Thursday, May 14. First, Joe Hamrock and team will provide an overview of NiSource's pure play utility business, including its investment opportunities and its commitment to customers and the communities it serves. 
Following the NiSource call, CPG's executive team will host a similar call. The team will highlight CPG's solid core business, its strategically located assets and its portfolio of transformational modernization and growth opportunities. The NiSource webcast will start at 9 a.m. and the CPG webcast will begin at 10:30 a.m., both Eastern Time. The event with the company presentations will be available at www.nisource.com. In addition to the May 14 webcast, we'll maintain regular communication regarding the separation process through our normal channels, including press releases and filings with the SEC. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Steve Smith to review our first quarter financial results highlighted on Page 4 of our supplemental slides."

As Bob mentioned, we delivered non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $268 million or $0.85 per share, which compares to about $258 million or $0.82 per share in the first quarter of 2014. On an operating earnings basis, NiSource was up about $20 million. On a GAAP comparison, our income from continuing operations was about $268 million for the first quarter versus about $266 million for the same period in 2014. At the segment level, you will see in today's release that each of our 3 core business segments delivered financial results in line with our expectations during the first quarter. CPG delivered operating earnings of about $163 million compared to about $159 million in 2014. CPG's net revenues, excluding the impact of trackers, were up about $22 million, primarily due to new growth projects placed into service and new firm capacity contracts. NIPSCO's electric operations delivered about $67 million in operating earnings compared to about $74 million in the same period in 2014.
Net revenues, again excluding trackers, were relatively flat, due primarily to lower off-system sales. 
And finally, our Gas Distribution business came in at about $306 million compared to about $280 million in 2014. Net revenues, again excluding the impact of trackers, were up about $43 million. As the numbers attest, we continue to deliver solid financial results. Full details of our results are available in our earnings release issued and posted online this morning.
Now turning to Slide 5. I'd like to briefly touch on our financing and liquidity position. We retained a strong liquidity position with approximately $2 billion of net available capacity as of March 31. Of our $2.4 billion capital investment program planned for 2015 at NiSource and CPG, approximately 80% of these investments are focused on revenue-generating opportunities. Our debt to capitalization remains solid at about 54% as of March 31. And as Bob mentioned, we remain on track with the NiSource, CPG separation, including establishing a strong financial foundation with expected investment-grade credit ratings. A CPG long-term debt offering of $2.75 billion and the NiSource tender transaction will begin soon. As we've noted previously, the proceeds of CPG's debt offering will be used to fund a one-time cash distribution to NiSource prior to the separation. 
With that, I'll turn the call back to Bob and Joe to discuss a few execution highlights from our business segments."

I'll start with highlights for CPG on Slide 6, and then Joe will cover highlights for NIPSCO and our gas utilities. The CPG team continues to advance the steady stream of transformational growth projects, which are in addition to its landmark modernization program. The latest news on that front includes the completion of an open season for 2 major regulated transmission projects and the development of a new midstream project. We're happy to report that we have a critical mass of firm customer commitments in place following the binding open season for the Mountaineer and Gulf XPress projects which concluded on April 23. As a reminder, these 2 projects would involve an investment of approximately $2.6 billion and would add 2.7 billion cubic feet per day of transportation capacity on Columbia Gas Transmission and nearly 900 million cubic feet per day of transportation capacity on the Columbia Gulf System. And on the midstream front, our team commenced discussions with a major producer on another dry gas gathering trunk line in southwestern Pennsylvania. Once we have all the details confirmed, we'll provide an update on this exciting new project. All of CPG's other in-progress modernization, growth and midstream projects remain on track. You'll recall that CPG's targeted capital investment level for 2015 is approximately $1.1 billion. A full highlight of our in-flight growth projects can be found on Pages 13 and 14 of the supplemental deck. 
With that, let me welcome Joe Hamrock to the call. Joe?"

Let's shift first to NIPSCO, our Indiana electric and natural gas business, summarized on Slide 7. The NIPSCO team is continuing to deliver on our customer-focused strategy of investment opportunities approaching $10 billion for electric infrastructure and $5 billion for gas infrastructure over the next 20-plus years. The FGD unit under construction at NIPSCO's Michigan City Generating Facility is on schedule to be placed in service by the end of 2015. Following the completion of the Michigan City unit and with those we placed in service over the past 2 years, all of NIPSCO's coal-burning facilities will be fully scrubbed. NIPSCO's 2 major electric transmission projects are also progressing as planned. Right-of-way acquisition and permitting are underway for both projects, and preliminary construction began on a 345-kv Reynolds-Topeka line. You'll recall these projects involve an investment of about $500 million for NIPSCO and are anticipated to be in service by the end of 2018. 
We remain on track and committed to our Indiana electric and gas modernization programs. As set forth in our TEDUS [ph] plan, we have about $190 million in planned spend this year. These investments help ensure continued safe, reliable and affordable service to customers. And as you likely saw earlier this month, the Indiana Court of Appeals issued a ruling regarding some of the elements of the approved electric modernization plan. The court upheld key components of the commission's order, and one item related to the level of investment detail within the order will need to be revisited as part of the regulatory and legal process.
As the first utility to file a plan under the TEDUS [ph]  Statute, we recognized the potential for temporary delay. We're evaluating the rule and remain committed to our modernization investments, which are essential to our ongoing plan for upgrading our system to serve [indiscernible] now and into the future. NIPSCO's agenda remains focused on customer service and high-value targeted programs that enhance the reliability and environmental performance of its systems. Investments in our electric infrastructure are expected to reach nearly $400 million in 2015.
Turning to our Gas Distribution operations on Slide 8. You can see a similar story of large scale infrastructure investment paired with complementary, regulatory and customer programs. Touching on a few regulatory highlights in recent months. In March, Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania filed a rate case with the Pennsylvania PUC to support continuation of our well-established infrastructure modernization and safety programs. If approved as filed, the case would increase annual revenues by approximately $46 million. We expect a decision in that case later this year. Columbia Gas of Massachusetts filed a rate case on April 16 with the Massachusetts Department of Public utilities, seeking an annual revenue increase of approximately $49 million. The filing reflects the company's commitment to maintain natural gas safety, customer service and reliability. A decision is expected in the first quarter of 2016 in that case. Also in Massachusetts, later today, we expect the decision from the DPU for our 2015 Gas System Enhancement Plan. Cost recovery associated with the 2015 investments outlined in the plan would begin tomorrow and increase annual revenues by approximately $2.6 million.
And Columbia Gas Virginia settled rate case remains pending before the commission. A final order on the $25 million revenue increase is expected later this year. In more recent news, just last week, the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio approved Columbia Gas of Ohio's annual infrastructure replacements and demand side management rider. The rider provides for recovery of its well-established pipeline replacement program and energy efficiency program investments. So overall, we expect to invest approximately $900 million during 2015 across our company's Gas Distribution businesses. These investments help improve reliability and safety for our customers and communities, provide additional customer access to natural gas service and reduce emissions. Through well-established recovering mechanisms in all 7 states, these investments are expected to generate incremental revenue and sustainable returns for shareholders. So in summary, NiSource gas and electric utilities are in full execution mode on all fronts and very well positioned for the future. Thanks, again, Bob. And I'll hand things back to you."

We remain focused on and are on track with our current business and customer plans. We remain on track with the CPG separation scheduled for July 1. We expect both companies will be well financed and very well positioned to execute on their distinct strategies. And now, a couple of dates and actions related to the separation that I should highlight once again. We expect to receive our CPG credit ratings in a matter of days, and after securing these ratings, we'll initiate the debt recapitalization process, including CPG issuing its own long-term debt and a separate tender offer for NiSource debt.
On May 14, as I mentioned earlier, NiSource and CPG will host separate webcast to outline a respective growth strategies and associated infrastructure investment opportunities. In early June, we anticipate that we'll confirm the distribution record date, the effectiveness of the Form 10 and the so-called when issued trading period. All of these would culminate with the planned distribution of shares on July 1, 2015, and CPG trading on its own the following day.

We have a crisp agenda today. I'll touch on several key strategic takeaways.

If you'll turn to Slide 3 in the supplemental deck that was posted online this morning, you'll see a few key takeaways for the quarter as well as an update of the separation of NiSource and Columbia Pipeline Group. 
For the quarter, results were solidly in line with our plan. The NiSource team delivered $0.85 per share non-GAAP in the first quarter versus $0.82 per share in 2014. Our teams also continued to execute on core infrastructure investment plans at all of our businesses, and capital expenditures across our utility and pipeline segments remain on track. As a reminder, for 2015, we expect a record spend of $2.4 billion. We also remain on track to complete the separation of NiSource and CPG, which we anticipate will happen on July 1, 2015. At the time of the separation, shareholders are expected to receive 1 share of Columbia Pipeline Group common stock for each share of NiSource common stock. As you know, the transaction is expected to be tax free for shareholders and the company. In preparation for the separation, experienced leadership teams have been named for both companies, and just recently, the respective NiSource and CPG executive teams discussed their go-forward financial plans with the 3 major credit-rating agencies.
As we said when we announced the separation, we expect both companies will be investment grade. Current expectations are that CPG will be formally rated prior to its May debt recapitalization transaction. And the NiSource's credit ratings will be addressed at or about the time of separation. With each step in the separation process, including the debt recapitalization process, we're positioning NiSource and CPG to be ranked among the leaders in their respective business segments. We expect both will be well capitalized and have robust and transparent, long-term growth plans, growing dividends and solid leadership and the capacity and focus to deliver enhanced, long-term growth. 
To profile the business strategies and growth plans of the respective companies, we've scheduled 2 separate webcasts on Thursday, May 14. First, Joe Hamrock and team will provide an overview of NiSource's pure play utility business, including its investment opportunities and its commitment to customers and the communities it serves. 
Following the NiSource call, CPG's executive team will host a similar call. The team will highlight CPG's solid core business, its strategically located assets and its portfolio of transformational modernization and growth opportunities. The NiSource webcast will start at 9 a.m. and the CPG webcast will begin at 10:30 a.m., both Eastern Time. The event with the company presentations will be available at www.nisource.com. In addition to the May 14 webcast, we'll maintain regular communication regarding the separation process through our normal channels, including press releases and filings with the SEC. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Steve Smith to review our first quarter financial results highlighted on Page 4 of our supplemental slides."

On an operating earning",401,"Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. As Bob mentioned, we delivered non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $268 million or $0.85 per share, which compares to about $258 million or $0.82 per share in the first quarter of 2014. On an operating earnings basis, NiSource was up about $20 million. On a GAAP comparison, our income from continuing operations was about $268 million for the first quarter versus about $266 million for the same period in 2014. At the segment level, you will see in today's release that each of our 3 core business segments delivered financial results in line with our expectations during the first quarter. CPG delivered operating earnings of about $163 million compared to about $159 million in 2014. CPG's net revenues, excluding the impact of trackers, were up about $22 million, primarily due to new growth projects placed into service and new firm capacity contracts. NIPSCO's electric operations delivered about $67 million in operating earnings compared to about $74 million in the same period in 2014.
Net revenues, again excluding trackers, were relatively flat, due primarily to lower off-system sales. 
And finally, our Gas Distribution business came in at about $306 million compared to about $280 million in 2014. Net revenues, again excluding the impact of trackers, were up about $43 million. As the numbers attest, we continue to deliver solid financial results. Full details of our results are available in our earnings release issued and posted online this morning.
Now turning to Slide 5. I'd like to briefly touch on our financing and liquidity position. We retained a strong liquidity position with approximately $2 billion of net available capacity as of March 31. Of our $2.4 billion capital investment program planned for 2015 at NiSource and CPG, approximately 80% of these investments are focused on revenue-generating opportunities. Our debt to capitalization remains solid at about 54% as of March 31. And as Bob mentioned, we remain on track with the NiSource, CPG separation, including establishing a strong financial foundation with expected investment-grade credit ratings. A CPG long-term debt offering of $2.75 billion and the NiSource tender transaction will begin soon. As we've noted previously, the proceeds of CPG's debt offering will be used to fund a one-time cash distribution to NiSource prior to the separation. 
With that, I'll turn the call back to Bob and Joe to discuss a few execution highlights from our business segments."

I'll start with highlights for CPG on Slide 6, and then Joe will cover highlights for NIPSCO and our gas utilities. The CPG team continues to advance the steady stream of transformational growth projects, which are in addition to its landmark modernization program. The latest news on that front includes the completion of an open season for 2 major regulated transmission projects and the development of a new midstream project. We're happy to report that we have a critical mass of firm customer commitments in place following the binding open season for the Mountaineer and Gulf XPress projects which concluded on April 23. As a reminder, these 2 projects would involve an investment of approximately $2.6 billion and would add 2.7 billion cubic feet per day of transportation capacity on Columbia Gas Transmission and nearly 900 million cubic feet per day of transportation capacity on the Columbia Gulf System. And on the midstream front, our team commenced discussions with a major producer on another dry gas gathering trunk line in southwestern Pennsylvania. Once we have all the details confirmed, we'll provide an update on this exciting new project. All of CPG's other in-progress modernization, growth and midstream projects remain on track. You'll recall that CPG's targeted capital investment level for 2015 is approximately $1.1 billion. A full highlight of our in-flight growth projects can be found on Pages 13 and 14 of the supplemental deck. 
With that, let me welcome Joe Hamrock to the call. Joe?"

Let's shift first to NIPSCO, our Indiana electric and natural gas business, summarized on Slide 7.

Let's shift first to NIPSCO, our Indiana electric and natural gas business, summarized on Slide 7. The NIPSCO team is continuing to deliver on our customer-focused strategy of investment opportunities approaching $10 billion for electric infrastructure and $5 billion for gas infrastructure over the next 20-plus years. The FGD unit under construction at NIPSCO's Michigan City Generating Facility is on schedule to be placed in service by the end of 2015. Following the completion of the Michigan City unit and with those we placed in service over the past 2 years, all of NIPSCO's coal-burning facilities will be fully scrubbed. NIPSCO's 2 major electric transmission projects are also progressing as planned. Right-of-way acquisition and permitting are underway for both projects, and preliminary construction began on a 345-kv Reynolds-Topeka line. You'll recall these projects involve an investment of about $500 million for NIPSCO and are anticipated to be in service by the end of 2018. 
We remain on track and committed to our Indiana electric and gas modernization programs. As set forth in our TEDUS [ph] plan, we have about $190 million in planned spend this year. These investments help ensure continued safe, reliable and affordable service to customers. And as you likely saw earlier this month, the Indiana Court of Appeals issued a ruling regarding some of the elements of the approved electric modernization plan. The court upheld key components of the commission's order, and one item related to the level of investment detail within the order will need to be revisited as part of the regulatory and legal process.
As the first utility to file a plan under the TEDUS [ph] Statute, we recognized the potential for temporary delay. We're evaluating the rule and remain committed to our modernization investments, which are essential to our ongoing plan for upgrading our system to serve [indiscernible] now and into the future. NIPSCO's agenda remains focused on customer service and high-value targeted programs that enhance the reliability and environmental performance of its systems. Investments in our electric infrastructure are expected to reach nearly $400 million in 2015.
Turning to our Gas Distribution operations on Slide 8. You can see a similar story of large scale infrastructure investment paired with complementary, regulatory and customer programs. Touching on a few regulatory highlights in recent months. In March, Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania filed a rate case with the Pennsylvania PUC to support continuation of our well-established infrastructure modernization and safety programs. If approved as filed, the case would increase annual revenues by approximately $46 million. We expect a decision in that case later this year. Columbia Gas of Massachusetts filed a rate case on April 16 with the Massachusetts Department of Public utilities, seeking an annual revenue increase of approximately $49 million. The filing reflects the company's commitment to maintain natural gas safety, customer service and reliability. A decision is expected in the first quarter of 2016 in that case. Also in Massachusetts, later today, we expect the decision from the DPU for our 2015 Gas System Enhancement Plan. Cost recovery associated with the 2015 investments outlined in the plan would begin tomorrow and increase annual revenues by approximately $2.6 million.
And Columbia Gas Virginia settled rate case remains pending before the commission. A final order on the $25 million revenue increase is expected later this year. In more recent news, just last week, the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio approved Columbia Gas of Ohio's annual infrastructure replacements and demand side management rider. The rider provides for recovery of its well-established pipeline replacement program and energy efficiency program investments. So overall, we expect to invest approximately $900 million during 2015 across our company's Gas Distribution businesses. These investments help improve reliability and safety for our customers and communities, provide additional customer access to natural gas service and reduce emissions. Through well-established recovering mechanisms in all 7 states, these investments are expected to generate incremental revenue and sustainable returns for shareholders. So in summary, NiSource gas and electric utilities are in full execution mode on all fronts and very well positioned for the future. Thanks, again, Bob. And I'll hand things back to you."

As you can see, continued solid performance on a strong, well-established growth strategy. Before briefly discussing the results of Columbia Pipeline Partners and opening the call to your questions, let me reiterate several key points. We remain focused on and are on track with our current business and customer plans. We remain on track with the CPG separation scheduled for July 1. We expect both companies will be well financed and very well positioned to execute on their distinct strategies. And now, a couple of dates and actions related to the separation that I should highlight once again. We expect to receive our CPG credit ratings in a matter of days, and after securing these ratings, we'll initiate the debt recapitalization process, including CPG issuing its own long-term debt and a separate tender offer for NiSource debt.
On May 14, as I mentioned earlier, NiSource and CPG will host separate webcast to outline a respective growth strategies and associated infrastructure investment opportunities. In early June, we anticipate that we'll confirm the distribution record date, the effectiveness of the Form 10 and the so-called when issued trading period. All of these would culminate with the planned distribution of shares on July 1, 2015, and CPG trading on its own the following day. We look forward to diving deeper into these dates and actions during our May 14 webcast. With those highlights, Steve will now briefly discuss Columbia Pipeline Partners' results."

So it's $2.75 billion, and that's going to be used largely for 2 things: to pay an intercompany dividend of around $1.5 billion to NiSource, and then to pay off intercompany debt with NiSource in $1 billion range. And NiSource is going to take that payment, both the dividend and the repayment of intercompany debt and use that to execute a tender offer for approximately $750 million or so of NiSource's debt over the next 30 days or so. So that's the high-level plan on the recapitalization front."

I'd like to welcome you to our NiSource quarterly investor call. Joining me this morning is Joe Hamrock, CEO; and Donald Brown, CFO.
As you know, the primary focus of today's call is to review NiSource's second quarter 2015 financial performance as well as provide an overall business update. Following our prepared comments, we will open the call to your questions. At times during the call, we will refer to supplemental slides available on our website. 
Just a reminder, on July 1, NiSource successfully completed the separation of Columbia Pipeline Group or CPG, into an independent publicly traded company. As a result, NiSource no longer maintains any ownership interest in either CPG or Columbia Pipeline Partners. However, the financial information presented today does include CPG segment results as it was part of NiSource's through June 30. 
I would note, future NiSource financial results will report CPG as discontinued operations. 
Therefore, our business segment discussion today will focus solely on NiSource's utilities. As an independent company, CPG is hosting its quarterly call later this morning at 10:00 a.m. Eastern. 
And finally, before I turn the call over to Joe, I'd like to remind everyone that some of the statements made on this call will be forward-looking. And the statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these statements. Information concerning such risks and uncertainties is included in the MD&A and Risk Factors section of our periodic SEC filings.
Having covered all those reminders, I'd like to now turn the call over to Joe."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for this first NiSource call since the separation of CPG. 
Today, we'll briefly cover our second quarter results and earnings drivers before discussing execution highlights at our utilities. And we'll close with our overview of our investment proposition and our future business plan as a premier, pure-play utility company. And we'll leave plenty of time for your questions. 
Before we get into the details, though, let me just say how excited I am about the path ahead for NiSource. We set a solid foundation for continued long-term growth and enhanced customer value, guided by an experienced management team, with a proven record of execution. And it's a privilege to represent our team today in sharing some of our highlights of our performance as well as our outlook for the future.
As Randy noted, I will be referencing a few slides in the supplemental deck that was posted online this morning. First, the few key takeaways for the quarter. For the second quarter, results were solidly in line with our plan. The NiSource team delivered $0.18 per share non-GAAP in the recently completed quarter versus $0.25 per share in 2014. Across the board, we had continued solid execution of our infrastructure investments, customer programs and regulatory initiatives. 
As Randy mentioned, we finalized the tax-free separation of CPG on July 1. After the market closed on July 1, shareholders received one share of CPG common stock for each share of NiSource common stock. Our commitments through the separation were met, including disciplined cost effective execution, our ongoing focus on customer service and our commitment to investment-grade credit. In fact, following the separation, our credit ratings at the 3 major agencies have either remained the same or improved. Standard & Poor's upgraded our credit rating to BBB+ from BBB-. Fitch Ratings revised its outlook to BBB- with a positive outlook from BBB- with a stable outlook. And Moody's reaffirmed its rating of a BAA2. These ratings had a strong foundation for us as a pure play utility with significant long term infrastructure investment opportunity.
One of the key value drivers NiSource will continue to offer investors is a solid and growing dividend, which we expect to increase by 4% to 6% annually. 
We Announced Our first post separation quarterly dividend of $0.155, $0.155 per share on a July 2, which is consistent with the company's intention announced in May to increase the initial combined NiSource and CPG dividend by nearly 8%.
As we also announced in May, we expect to deliver non-GAAP earnings per share of $1 to $1.10 in 2016, with planned infrastructure enhancements of approximately $1.4 billion. 
Now let me turn the call over to Donald to review our second quarter financial results highlighted on Page 4 of our supplemental slides."
292092,307208164,846244,"NiSource Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2015",2015-08-03,"Earnings Calls","NiSource Inc.","Executives","Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us. As Joe mentioned, we delivered non-GAAP, net operating earnings of about $57 million or $0.18 per share, which compares to about $78 million or $0.25 per share in the second quarter of 2014. On an operatin",340,"Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us. As Joe mentioned, we delivered non-GAAP, net operating earnings of about $57 million or $0.18 per share, which compares to about $78 million or $0.25 per share in the second quarter of 2014. On an operating earnings basis, NiSource was down about $7 million. 
As a reminder, these results include CPG reportable segment financials. 
Two factors impacted our net operating earnings compared to 2014. One was additional interest expense related to Columbia Pipeline Group's long-term debt issuance prior to the separation. The other  was NiSource's noncontrolling interest in Columbia Pipeline Partners, which was formed in February 2015. Combined, these items add up to nearly $0.06 for the quarter. 
On a GAAP comparison, our loss from continuing operations was about $36 million for the second quarter versus income of about $79 million for the same period in 2014. This decrease was primarily, as you would expect, attributable to a loss from the early extinguishment of long-term debt and separation costs. 
At the segment level, each of the 3 pre-separation business segments delivered financial results well in line with our expectations during the second quarter. Full details of our results are available in our earnings release issued and posted online this morning.
Now, turning to Slide 5, I'd like to briefly touch on our debt and credit profile following the separation, which, as you will see, is consistent with our May 14 webcast. Following the recapitalization, our total debt level was reduced to $6.7 billion with the weighted average maturity of approximately 14 years and average coupon of approximately 5.86%. 
On the liquidity front, our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility went in to place at separation. And as of a July 1, we maintained net available liquidity of about $2 billion.
Our financial foundation for our continued growth as a pure play utility is solid, on track and consistent with our commitment. 
Now, I'll turn the call back to Joe to discuss a few customer, infrastructure investment and regulatory highlights eyelets across our utilities."

Our teams remain on track to invest approximately $1.3 billion during 2015, which is part of our $30 billion of long term regulated utility infrastructure investment opportunities. These investments further improve reliability and safety, enhance customer service and reduce emissions, all while generating sustainable long term growth. 
Let's turn to a few highlights in our gas operations business segment on Slide 6. We're continuing our disciplined execution on core infrastructure investment and modernization programs, supported by complimentary, regulatory and customer initiatives. In fact, just last week, Columbia Gas of Massachusetts reached a settlement in principle with the Massachusetts Attorney General in its base rate case. The settlement agreement is expected to be finalized and filed for approval with the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities later this month. The case, as you recall, seeks to recover costs to support CMA's multiyear modernization plan to maintain the safety and reliability of natural gas service for customers. 
Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania's base rate case is progressing on schedule. The $46 million request supports continued investment in our well-established modernization programs that enhance safety and reliability. A decision in that case is expected by the end of this year.
Turning to the pending base rate case at Columbia Gas of Virginia. On June 30, the hearing examiner recommended specific fixed customer charges for each rate class addressing the final outstanding issue in the case. The commission had previously found that the stipulated annual revenue increase of $25.2 million is reasonable. A final order in this case is expected later this year. 
And back to Massachusetts. As an update to what we shared in our first quarter call, we received the Department of Public Utilities approval of 2015 Gas System Enhancement Plan on April 30. Cost recovery began on May 1, and is projected to increase annual revenues by approximately $2.6 million. 
And at NIPSCO gas, we continue executing on our 7-year natural gas system modernization program. Our 2015 projects, which include enhancement of existing infrastructure and extension of gas service to rural customers are well underway, and we expect to file our program and tracker update by September 1. 
Now let's turn to our Electric Operations on Slide 7. On May 26, NIPSCO, the Indiana Office of Utility Consumer Counselor and some of NIPSCO's largest investor customers reached a settlement agreement resolving all concerns raised by the parties in an Indiana Court of Appeals proceeding, surrounding the company's long term electric infrastructure modernization plan. As part of the agreement, NIPSCO will file a base rate case followed by a new 7-year plan. We expect to file the base rate case on or about October 1 of this year. 
The FGD units under construction at NIPSCO's Michigan City Generating Facility is on schedule to be placed in service by the end of 2015. Following the completion of the Michigan city unit and with those we placed in service over the past 2 years, all of NIPSCO's coal burning facilities will be fully scrubbed.
NIPSCO's 2 major electric transmission projects are also progressing as planned. Right-of-way acquisition, permitting and substation construction are underway for both projects. 
You will recall these projects involve an investment of about $500 million for NIPSCO and are anticipated to be in service by the end of 2018.
As you can see, our teams continue to execute on our well-established infrastructure, customer and regulatory plans. Before turning to your questions, I'd like to reaffirm the value proposition that we believe differentiates NiSource. 
Following the separation of CPG, we are well-aligned with our aspiration to be a premier regulated utility company. Our plan represents a best-in-class, risk-adjusted total return proposition, with $30 billion of long term 100% regulated utility infrastructure investment opportunities, significant scale across 7 states, transparent earnings drivers and constructive regulatory environments. We're focused on leading in the areas that matter most in our industry, those are enhancing value to our customers and communities, stewarding our assets to ensure a safe reliable, affordable and efficient service, engaging and investing in the communities we serve and ensuring through disciplined execution that we deliver on our financial and other stakeholder commitments. This transparent sustainable growth is expected to drive shareholder value. 
As we first announced in May, we expect to deliver non-GAAP earnings per share of between $1 and $1.10 per share in 2016. We expect our capital program will grow to about $1.4 billion annually starting next year. 
And finally, we expect to grow our non-GAAP EPS and our dividend by 4% to 6% per year. 
Thank you all for participating today and for your ongoing interest in support for NiSource. We look forward to sharing continued updates on our progress. Now, Michelle, let's open the call for questions."

I'd like to welcome you to our NiSource quarterly investor call. Joining me this morning is Joe Hamrock, CEO; and Donald Brown, CFO.
As you know, the primary focus of today's call is to review NiSource's second quarter 2015 financial performance as well as provide an overall business update. Following our prepared comments, we will open the call for your questions. At times during the call, we will refer to supplemental slides available on our website. 
Just a reminder, on July 1, NiSource successfully completed the separation of Columbia Pipeline Group, or CPG, into an independent publicly traded company. As a result, NiSource no longer maintains any ownership interest in either CPG or Columbia Pipeline Partners. However, the financial information presented today does include CPG segment results, as it was part of NiSource's through June 30.  I would note, future NiSource financial results will report CPG as discontinued operations. 
Therefore, our business segment discussion today will focus solely on NiSource's utilities. As an independent company, CPG is hosting its quarterly call later this morning at 10:00 a.m. Eastern. 
And finally, before I turn the call over to Joe, I'd like to remind everyone that some of the statements made on this call will be forward-looking, and these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these statements. Information concerning such risks and uncertainties is included in the MD&A and Risk Factors section of our periodic SEC filings.
Having covered all those reminders, I'd like to now turn the call over to Joe."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for this first NiSource call since the separation of CPG.
Today, we'll briefly cover our second quarter results and earnings drivers before discussing execution highlights at our utilities. And we'll close with an overview of our investment proposition and our future business plan as a premier, pure-play utility company, and we'll leave plenty of time for your questions. 
Before we get into the details, though, let me just say how excited I am about the path ahead for NiSource. We've set a solid foundation for continued long-term growth and enhanced customer value, guided by an experienced management team with a proven record of execution. This approval is to represent our team today in sharing some of our highlights of our performance as well as our outlook for the future.
As Randy noted, I'll be referencing a few slides in the supplemental deck that was posted online this morning; first, the few key takeaways for the quarter. 
For the second quarter, results were solidly in line with our plan. The NiSource team delivered $0.18 per share, non-GAAP, in the recently completed quarter versus $0.25 per share in 2014. Across the board, we had continued solid execution of our infrastructure investments, customer programs and regulatory initiatives. 
As Randy mentioned, we finalized the tax-free separation of CPG on July 1. After the market close on July 1, shareholders received one share of CPG common stock for each share of NiSource common stock. 
Our commitments through the separation were met, including disciplined cost effective execution, our ongoing focus on customer service and our commitment to investment-grade credit. 
In fact, following the separation, our credit ratings at the 3 major agencies have either remained the same or improved. Standard & Poor's upgraded our credit rating to BBB+ from BBB-. Fitch Ratings revised its outlook to BBB- with a positive outlook from BBB- with a stable outlook. And Moody's reaffirmed its rating of a Baa2. These ratings set a strong foundation for us as a pure-play utility with significant long-term infrastructure investment opportunities.
One of the key value drivers NiSource will continue to offer investors is a solid and growing dividend, which we expect to increase by 4% to 6% annually. 
We announced Our first post-separation quarterly dividend of $0.155 per share on a July 2, which is consistent with the company's intention announced in May to increase the initial combined NiSource and CPG dividend by nearly 8%.
As we also announced in May, we expect to deliver non-GAAP earnings per share of $1 to $1.10 in 2016, with planned infrastructure enhancements of approximately $1.4 billion. 
Now let me turn the call over to Donald to review our second quarter financial results highlighted on Page 4 of our supplemental slides."
292092,307208164,846325,"NiSource Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2015",2015-08-03,"Earnings Calls","NiSource Inc.","Executives","Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us.

On an operatin",336,"Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. As Joe mentioned, we delivered non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $57 million or $0.18 per share, which compares to about $78 million or $0.25 per share in the second quarter of 2014. On an operating earnings basis, NiSource was down about $7 million.  As a reminder, these results include CPG reportable segment financials. 
Two factors impacted our net operating earnings compared to 2014. One was additional interest expense related to Columbia Pipeline Group's long-term debt issuance prior to the separation, the other  was NiSource's noncontrolling interest in Columbia Pipeline Partners, which was formed in February 2015. Combined, these items add up to nearly $0.06 for the quarter. 
On a GAAP comparison, our loss from continuing operations was about $36 million for the second quarter versus income of about $79 million for the same period in 2014. This decrease was primarily, as you would expect, attributable to a loss from early extinguishment of long-term debt and separation costs.
At the segment level, each of the 3 pre-separation business segments delivered financial results well in line with our expectations during the second quarter. Full details of our results are available in our earnings release issued and posted online this morning.
Now, turning to Slide 5, I'd like to briefly touch on our debt and credit profile following the separation, which, as you will see, is consistent with our May 14 webcast. Following the recapitalization, our total debt level was reduced to $6.7 billion with the weighted average maturity of approximately 14 years and an average coupon of approximately 5.86%.
On the liquidity front, our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility went into place at separation. And as of July 1, we maintained net available liquidity of about $2 billion.
Our financial foundation for our continued growth as a pure-play utility is solid, on track and consistent with our commitment.
Now, I'll turn the call back to Joe to discuss a few customer, infrastructure investment and regulatory highlights across our utilities."

Our teams remain on track to invest approximately $1.3 billion during 2015, which is part of our $30 billion of long-term, regulated utility infrastructure investment opportunities. These investments further improve reliability and safety, enhance customer service and reduce emissions, all while generating sustainable long-term growth. 
Let's turn to the few highlights in our gas operations business segment on Slide 6. We're continuing our disciplined execution on core infrastructure investment and modernization programs, supported by complementary regulatory and customer initiatives. In fact, just last week, Columbia Gas of Massachusetts reached a settlement in principle with the Massachusetts Attorney General in its base rate case. The settlement agreement is expected to be finalized and filed for approval with the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities later this month. The case, as you recall, seeks to recover costs to support CMA's multi-year modernization plan to maintain the safety and reliability of natural gas service for customers.
Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania's base rate case is progressing on schedule. The $46 million request supports continued investment in our well-established modernization programs that enhance safety and reliability. A decision in that case is expected by the end of this year.
Turning to the pending base rate case at Columbia Gas of Virginia. On June 30, the hearing examiner recommended specific fixed customer charges for each rate class addressing the final outstanding issue in the case. The commission had previously found that the stipulated annual revenue increase of $25.2 million is reasonable. A final order in this case is expected later this year.
And back to Massachusetts, as an update to what we shared in our first quarter call, we received Department of Public Utilities' approval of 2015 Gas System Enhancement Plan on April 30. Cost recovery began on May 1 and is projected to increase annual revenues by approximately $2.6 million. 
And at NIPSCO Gas, we continue executing on our 7-year natural gas system modernization program. Our 2015 projects, which include enhancement of existing infrastructure and extension of gas service to rural customers are well underway, and we expect to file our program and tracker update by September 1.
Now let's turn to our Electric Operations on Slide 7. On May 26, NIPSCO, the Indiana Office of Utility Consumer Counselor, and some of NIPSCO's largest industrial customers reached a settlement agreement resolving all concerns raised by the parties in an Indiana Court of Appeals proceeding, surrounding the company's long-term electric infrastructure modernization plan. As part of the agreement, NIPSCO will file a base rate case followed by a new 7-year plan. We expect to file the base rate case on or about October 1 of this year. 
The FGD unit under construction at NIPSCO's Michigan City Generating Facility is on schedule to be placed in service by the end of 2015. Following the completion of the Michigan city unit and with those we placed in service over the past 2 years, all of NIPSCO's coal-burning facilities will be fully scrubbed.
NIPSCO's 2 major electric transmission projects are also progressing as planned. Right-of-way acquisition, permitting and substation construction are underway for both projects.  You'll recall these projects involve an investment of about $500 million for NIPSCO and are anticipated to be in service by the end of 2018.
As you can see, our teams continue to execute on our well-established infrastructure, customer and regulatory plans. Before turning to your questions, I'd like to reaffirm the value proposition that we believe differentiates NiSource.
Following the separation of CPG, we are well-aligned with our aspiration to be a premier regulated utility company. Our plan represents a best-in-class, risk-adjusted total return proposition, with $30 billion of long-term, 100% regulated utility infrastructure investment opportunities, significant scale across 7 states, transparent earnings drivers and constructive regulatory environments. We're focused on leading in the areas that matter most in our industry, those are enhancing value to our customers and communities, stewarding our assets to ensure safe reliable, affordable and efficient service, engaging and investing in the communities we serve and ensuring through disciplined execution that we deliver on our financial and other stakeholder commitments. This transparent sustainable growth is expected to drive shareholder value.
As we've first announced in May, we expect to deliver non-GAAP earnings per share of between $1 and $1.10 per share in 2016. We expect our capital program will grow to about $1.4 billion annually, starting next year.  And finally, we expect to grow our non-GAAP EPS and our dividend by 4% to 6% per year.
Thank you all for participating today and for your ongoing interest in support for NiSource. We look forward to sharing continued updates on our progress. 
Now, Michelle, let's open the call for questions."

You'll recall these projects involve an investment of about $500 million for NIPSCO and are anticipated to be in service by the end of 2018.
As you can see, our teams continue to execute on our well-established infrastructure, customer and regulatory plans. Before turning to your questions, I'd like to reaffirm the value proposition that we believe differentiates NiSource.
Following the separation of CPG, we are well-aligned with our aspiration to be a premier regulated utility company. Our plan represents a best-in-class, risk-adjusted total return proposition, with $30 billion of long-term, 100% regulated utility infrastructure investment opportunities, significant scale across 7 states, transparent earnings drivers and constructive regulatory environments. We're focused on leading in the areas that matter most in our industry. Those are: enhancing value to our customers and communities, stewarding our assets to ensure safe reliable, affordable and efficient service, engaging and investing in the communities we serve, and ensuring through disciplined execution that we deliver on our financial and other stakeholder commitments. This transparent sustainable growth is expected to drive shareholder value.
As we first announced in May, we expect to deliver non-GAAP earnings per share of between $1 and $1.10 per share in 2016. We expect our capital program will grow to about $1.4 billion annually, starting next year.  And finally, we expect to grow our non-GAAP EPS on our dividend by 4% to 6% per year.
Thank you all for participating today and for your ongoing interest in support for NiSource. We look forward to sharing continued updates on our progress.

Today, we'll briefly cover our third quarter 2015 results and earnings drivers before discussing specific highlights for several of our utilities. We'll close with the review of our investment proposition and long-range business plan and we'll leave plenty of time for your questions.
As you'll hear throughout today's call, our results and our look ahead reinforce the strength of our 100% regulated utility business model. During the quarter, we continued our disciplined execution of infrastructure and environmental investments, complemented by regulatory initiatives, which are providing long-term safety, reliability and environmental benefits for our customers and the communities we are privileged to serve.
Let's first highlight a few key takeaways for the quarter on Slide 3. Our results were solidly in line with our expectations. The NiSource team delivered net operating earnings of $0.06 per share in the recently completed quarter versus a loss of $0.03 per share in the same period in 2014. In addition to the successful separation of Columbia Pipeline Group, the NiSource team sustained execution of our well-established plan during the quarter.
For example, on the regulatory front, in Massachusetts, we received the final order from the DPU approving base rates case settlement. The approved settlement supports our effort to modernize and replace aging pipeline infrastructure to ensure continued safe and reliable service.
In addition, we reached a settlement agreement with parties in our Pennsylvania base rate case filed earlier this year, and also received final commission approval of the settlement in our Virginia base rate case as well as approval of a 5-year extension of our infrastructure modernization program in Virginia.
And in Indiana, we filed our first electric base rate case in 5 years. I'll provide additional details on these regulatory developments later in today's call.
On the capital investment front, across all of our companies, we remain on track with our planned total capital spend of approximately $1.3 billion in 2015. Before turning the call over to Donald to highlight our financial results in more detail, I want to reinforce our 2016 guidance and long-term outlook.
As previously announced, we expect to deliver non-GAAP net earnings per share of $1 to $1.10 in 2016, with planned infrastructure enhancement investments of approximately $1.4 billion. And in the years ahead, we remain committed to our annual projected dividend and earnings growth-for-growth range of 4% to 6%.
Now let me turn the call over to Donald to review our financial results in more detail, which are highlighted on Page 4 of our supplemental slides."

As Joe mentioned, we delivered non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $19 million or $0.06 per share, which compares to a loss of about $9 million or $0.03 per share in the third quarter of 2014.

As Joe mentioned, we delivered non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $19 million or $0.06 per share, which compares to a loss of about $9 million or $0.03 per share in the third quarter of 2014. On an operating earnings basis, NiSource was up about $31 million. As a reminder, these results no longer include the CPG reportable segment financials, which are classified as discontinued operations. The continued solid financial performance you see today is driven exclusively by our utility businesses.
On a GAAP comparison, our income from continuing operations was about $15 million for the third quarter versus a loss of about $17 million for the same period in 2014.
Now let's take a closer look at the third quarter operating earnings performance at our 2 business segments. Our gas distribution segment came in at about $22 million compared with $1 million for 2014. Net revenue, excluding the impact of trackers, were up nearly $19 million, primarily to increases in regulatory and service program in Ohio, Virginia and Pennsylvania. Operating expenses, excluding the impact of trackers, decreased about $2 million.
Our Electric Operations delivered nearly $102 million in operating earnings compared to about $90 million for the prior year period. Net revenue excluding trackers were relatively flat due to increased infrastructure investment revenues, offset by lower industrial load. Operating expenses, excluding the impact of trackers, decreased by about $12 million, primarily due to lower employee and administrative cost. As Joe mentioned, these results are solidly in line with our expectations. Full details of our results are available in our earnings release issued and posted online this morning.
Now turning to Slide 5, let I'd like to briefly touch on
[Audio Gap]
in an interest rate of 5.86%. On the liquidity of front, our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility went into effect at separation. And at the end of third quarter, we maintained net available liquidity of about $1.6 billion.
Our credit ratings at the 3 major agencies are solidly investment grade, something we remain committed to as we continued to execute on our $30 billion infrastructure investment opportunities. As you can see, the financial foundation for our continued growth as a pure-play utility is strong, on track and consistent with our investment proposition.
Now, I'll turn the call back to Joe to discuss a  few customer, infrastructure and regulatory highlights across our utilities."

Let's turn to a few highlights from our gas operations on Slide 6. As I mentioned at the start of the call in early October, the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities approved the settlement that Columbia Gas of Massachusetts reached with parties in its 2015 base rate case. Rates went into effect on November 1 and the approved settlement provides for an annual revenue increase of approximately $33 million with an additional $3.6 million annual increase expected in November 2016.
In August, Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania reached a settlement in its base rate case pending before the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission. The settlement provides for a $28 million increase in annual revenues and no addition is expected to authorize new rates by the end of this year.
Also in August, Columbia Gas of Virginia received final approval of its 2014 base rate case. The Virginia Commission reaffirmed the $25 million annual revenue
[Audio Gap]
the difference between the settled amount and the as-filed rates is now being refunded to customers following the final order. The order supports continued capital investments by CVA to modernize its system and accommodate customer growth as well as initiatives to enhance safety and reliability.
More recently, the Virginia Commission approved a 5-year extension of our SAVE program with our proposed 20% increase in annual investments. As a reminder, the SAVE program is our infrastructure modernization plan in the state. One item worth noting on CVA's modernization plan, in the past few weeks, the team completed all planned cast-iron pipe replacement in the state.
At NIPSCO gas, we filed our semiannual tracker update in August, which provides support for the remain 5 years of our 7-year $817 million natural gas system modernization program. This program involves enhancing existing gas infrastructure and extending gas service to rural areas.
Before moving on from gas operations, I'd like to say how encouraged we are by our strong performance across-the-board on the recent J.D. Power Natural Gas Customer Satisfaction surveys. In fact, Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania is a J.D. Power award winner for the second year in a row, and Columbia Gas of Virginia was recognized as one of the most improved brands in the nation. They also ranked as a top brand nationally in communications. This strong performance is a demonstration that our ongoing infrastructure programs are designed to benefit customers and that our team of approximately 7,500 employees is focused on the right things, and that's serving our customers and safely and reliably each day.
Now let's turn to our Electric Operations on Slide 7. Consistent with the May 26 settlement NIPSCO reached with Indiana Office of Utility Consumer Counselor and NIPSCO's largest and is expected to file a new 7-year electric infrastructure modernization plan with the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission, or IURC, by early 2016. NIPSCO's first electric rate case in 5 years seeks to recover the current cost of generating and distributing power, plus ongoing investments, which are delivering substantial benefits to customers, including a 40% reduction in the duration of power outages. The request also seeks to create a Bill Payment Assistance program for low income electric customers during the summer cooling season. A decision by the IURC is expected in the third quarter of 2016.
NIPSCO's flu gas desulfurization unit at its Michigan City generating facility is set to be placed in service by the end of the year, on schedule and on budget. The approximately $255 million project, supported with cost recovery, improves the air quality and helps ensure NIPSCO's generation fleet remains in compliance with current environmental regulations. It also helps ensure that NIPSCO can continue offering low-cost, reliable and efficient generating capacity for its customers.
Progress also continued on 2 major electric transmission projects designed to enhance regionwide system flexibility and reliability, right away acquisition permitting and substation construction are underway for both projects. These projects involve an investment of approximately $500 million for NIPSCO and are anticipated to be in-service by the end of 2018. We believe our investments are paying off for our customers in northern Indiana and we saw evidence of that in the recent J.D. Power residential electric customer survey. NIPSCO's and electric overall customer satisfaction index score increased 30 points over 2014 and was among the most improved electric utilities in the Midwest.
So as you can see, our teams continue to execute on our well-established infrastructure, environmental customer and regulatory plans.
Before turning to your questions, I'd like to reaffirm the value proposition that we believe differentiates NiSource. Following the separation of Columbia Pipeline Group, we are well aligned with our aspiration to be a premier regulated utility company. Our plan represents the best-in-class, risk-adjusted total return proposition with continued progress on our $30 billion of long-term, 100% regulated utility infrastructure investment opportunities, with significant scale across 7 states, transparent earnings drivers and constructive regulatory environments.

This transparent, sustainable growth is expected to drive enhanced shareholder value well into the future.

Today, we'll briefly cover our third quarter 2015 results and earnings drivers before discussing specific highlights for several of our utilities. We'll close with the review of our investment proposition and long-range business plan and we'll leave plenty of time for your questions.
As you'll hear throughout today's call, our results and our look ahead reinforce the strength of our 100% regulated utility business model. During the quarter, we continued our disciplined execution of infrastructure and environmental investments, complemented by regulatory initiatives, which are providing long-term safety, reliability and environmental benefits for our customers and the communities we are privileged to serve.
Let's first highlight a few key takeaways for the quarter on Slide 3. Our results were solidly in line with our expectations. The NiSource team delivered net operating earnings of $0.06 per share in the recently completed quarter versus a loss of $0.03 per share in the same period in 2014. In addition to the successful separation of Columbia Pipeline Group, the NiSource team sustained execution of our well-established plan during the quarter.
For example, on the regulatory front, in Massachusetts, we received a final order from the DPU approving our base rate case settlement. The approved settlement supports our effort to modernize and replace aging pipeline infrastructure to ensure continued safe and reliable service.
In addition, we reached a settlement agreement with parties in our Pennsylvania base rate case filed earlier this year, and also received final commission approval of the settlement in our Virginia base rate case as well as approval of a 5-year extension of our infrastructure modernization program in Virginia.
And in Indiana, we filed our first electric base rate case in 5 years. I'll provide additional details on these regulatory developments later in today's call.
On the capital investment front, across all of our companies, we remain on track with our planned total capital spend of approximately $1.3 billion in 2015. Before turning the call over to Donald to highlight our financial results in more detail, I want to reinforce our 2016 guidance and long-term outlook.
As previously announced, we expect to deliver non-GAAP net earnings per share of $1 to $1.10 in 2016, with planned infrastructure enhancement investments of approximately $1.4 billion. And in the years ahead, we remain committed to our annual projected dividend and earnings growth-for-growth range of 4% to 6%.
Now let me turn the call over to Donald to review our financial results in more detail, which are highlighted on Page 4 of our supplemental slides."

As Joe mentioned, we delivered non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $19 million or $0.06 per share, which compares to a loss of about $9 million or $0.03 per share in the third quarter of 2014. On an operating earnings basis, N",393,"Good morning, everyone. As Joe mentioned, we delivered non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $19 million or $0.06 per share, which compares to a loss of about $9 million or $0.03 per share in the third quarter of 2014. On an operating earnings basis, NiSource was up about $31 million. As a reminder, these results no longer include the CPG reportable segment financials, which are classified as discontinued operations. The continued solid financial performance you see today is driven exclusively by our utility businesses.
On a GAAP comparison, our income from continuing operations was about $15 million for the third quarter versus a loss of about $17 million for the same period in 2014.
Now let's take a closer look at the third quarter operating earnings performance at our 2 business segments. Our Gas Distribution segment came in at about $22 million compared with $1 million for 2014. Net revenues, excluding the impact of trackers, were up nearly $19 million, primarily to increases in regulatory and service programs in Ohio, Virginia and Pennsylvania. Operating expenses, excluding the impact of trackers, decreased about $2 million.
Our Electric Operations delivered nearly $102 million in operating earnings compared to about $90 million for the prior year period. Net revenues excluding trackers were relatively flat due to increased infrastructure investment revenues offset by lower industrial load. Operating expenses, excluding the impact of trackers, decreased by about $12 million, primarily due to lower employee and administrative costs. As Joe mentioned, these results are solidly in line with our expectations. Full details of our results are available in our earnings release issued and posted online this morning.
Now turning to Slide 5,  I'd like to briefly touch 
in an interest rate of 5.86%. On the liquidity front, our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility went into effect at separation. And at the end of third quarter, we maintained net available liquidity of about $1.6 billion.
Our credit ratings at the 3 major agencies are solidly investment grade, something we remain committed to as we continued to execute on our $30 billion in infrastructure investment opportunities. As you can see, the financial foundation for our continued growth as a pure-play utility is strong, on track and consistent with our investment proposition.
Now, I'll turn the call back to Joe to discuss a  few customer, infrastructure and regulatory highlights across our utilities."

As noted, our teams remain on track with our utility investments.

Let's turn to a few highlights from our gas operations on Slide 6. As I mentioned at the start of the call in early October, the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities approved the settlement that Columbia Gas of Massachusetts reached with parties in its 2015 base rate case. Rates went into effect on November 1 and the approved settlement provides for an annual revenue increase of approximately $33 million with an additional $3.6 million annual increase expected in November 2016.
In August, Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania reached a settlement in its base rate case pending before the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission. The settlement provides for a $28 million increase in annual revenues and no addition is expected to authorize new rates by the end of this year.
Also in August, Columbia Gas of Virginia received final approval of its 2014 base rate case. The Virginia Commission reaffirmed the $25 million annual revenue, the difference between the settled amount and as-filed rates is now being refunded to customers following the final order. The order supports continued capital investments by CVA to modernize its system and accommodate customer growth as well as initiatives to enhance safety and reliability.
More recently, the Virginia Commission approved a 5-year extension of our SAVE program with our proposed 20% increase in annual investments. As a reminder, the SAVE program is our infrastructure modernization plan in the state. One item worth noting on CVA's modernization plan, in the past few weeks, the team completed all planned cast-iron pipe replacement in the state.
At NIPSCO Gas, we filed our semiannual tracker update in August, which provides support for the remaining 5 years of our 7-year $817 million natural gas system modernization program. This program involves enhancing existing gas infrastructure and extending gas service to rural areas.
Before moving on from gas operations, I'd like to say how encouraged we are by our strong performance across-the-board on the recent J.D. Power Natural Gas Customer Satisfaction surveys. In fact, Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania is a J.D. Power award winner for the second year in a row, and Columbia Gas of Virginia was recognized as one of the most improved brands in the nation. They also ranked as a top brand nationally in communications. This strong performance is a demonstration that our ongoing infrastructure programs are designed to benefit customers and that our team of approximately 7,500 employees is focused on the right things, and that's serving our customers safely and reliably each day.
Now let's turn to our Electric Operations on Slide 7. Consistent with the May 26 settlement NIPSCO reached with Indiana Office of Utility Consumer Counselor and NIPSCO's largest and is expected to file a new 7-year electric infrastructure modernization plan with the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission or IURC by early 2016. NIPSCO's first electric rate case in 5 years seeks to recover the current cost of generating and distributing power, plus ongoing investments, which are delivering substantial benefits to customers, including a 40% reduction in the duration of power outages. The request also seeks to create a Bill Payment Assistance program for low income electric customers during the summer cooling season. A decision by the IURC is expected in the third quarter of 2016.
NIPSCO's flue gas desulfurization unit at its Michigan City Generating Facility is set to be placed in service by the end of the year, on schedule and on budget. The approximately $255 million project, supported with cost recovery, improves the air quality and helps ensure NIPSCO's generation fleet remains in compliance with current environmental regulations. It also helps ensure that NIPSCO can continue offering, low cost, reliable and efficient generating capacity for its customers.
Progress also continued on 2 major electric transmission projects designed to enhance region-wide system flexibility and reliability, right away acquisition permitting and substation construction are underway for both projects. These projects involve an investment of approximately $500 million for NIPSCO and are anticipated to be in service by the end of 2018. We believe our investments are paying off for our customers in northern Indiana and we saw evidence of that in the recent J.D. Power Residential Electric customer survey. NIPSCO's Electric overall customer satisfaction index score increased 30 points over 2014 and was among the most improved electric utilities in the Midwest.
So as you can see, our teams continue to execute on our well-established infrastructure, environmental customer and regulatory plans.
Before turning to your questions, I'd like to reaffirm the value proposition that we believe differentiates NiSource. Following the separation of Columbia Pipeline Group, we are well aligned with our aspiration to be a premier regulated utility company. Our plan represents the best-in-class, risk-adjusted total return proposition with continued progress on our $30 billion of long-term, 100% regulated utility infrastructure investment opportunities, with significant scale across 7 states, transparent earnings drivers and constructive regulatory environments.
To that end, we are focused on leading in the areas that matter most in our industry, enhancing value to our customers and communities, stewarding our assets to ensure safe, reliable, affordable and efficient service, engaging and investing in the communities we serve and ensuring through disciplined execution that we deliver on our financial and other stakeholder commitments. This transparent, sustainable growth is expected to drive enhanced shareholder value well into the future.
Thank you, all, for participating today and for your ongoing interest in and support of NiSource. We look forward to sharing continued updates on our progress.

Those are, as you know, very important customers to us, a critical part of the Northwest Indiana economy and our national trade and have seen signs of moderation in that this year. But still a very flat low-profile on the industrial, particularly the steel side. It's important to note that 2014 was a bit of an anomaly in terms of the load from that sector with them depending more on our generation than their own internal generation in that year due to weather conditions and operating conditions. But nonetheless, on 1% or so, on a year-to-date basis, on the steel load, in Northwest Indiana and would expect slow recovery, slow and steady recovery. The other side of that though, Paul, is we're seeing really strong signs of economic development in other parts of the Northwest Indiana economy that, while not completely offsetting the steel issues, certainly provide some stability for us."

Today, we'll briefly cover our third quarter 2015 results and earnings drivers before discussing specific highlights for several of our utilities. We'll close with the review of our investment proposition and long-range business plan and we'll leave plenty of time for your questions.
As you'll hear throughout today's call, our results and our look ahead reinforce the strength of our 100% regulated utility business model. During the quarter, we continued our disciplined execution of infrastructure and environmental investments, complemented by regulatory initiatives, which are providing long-term safety, reliability and environmental benefits for our customers and the communities we are privileged to serve.
Let's first highlight a few key takeaways for the quarter on Slide 3. Our results were solidly in line with our expectations. The NiSource team delivered net operating earnings of $0.06 per share in the recently completed quarter versus a loss of $0.03 per share in the same period in 2014. In addition to the successful separation of Columbia Pipeline Group, the NiSource team sustained execution of our well-established plan during the quarter.
For example, on the regulatory front, in Massachusetts, we received a final order from the DPU approving our base rate case settlement. The approved settlement supports our effort to modernize and replace aging pipeline infrastructure to ensure continued safe and reliable service.
In addition, we reached a settlement agreement with parties in our Pennsylvania base rate case filed earlier this year, and also received final commission approval of the settlement in our Virginia base rate case as well as approval of a 5-year extension of our infrastructure modernization program in Virginia.
And in Indiana, we filed our first electric base rate case in 5 years. I'll provide additional details on these regulatory developments later in today's call.
On the capital investment front, across all of our companies, we remain on track with our planned total capital spend of approximately $1.3 billion in 2015. Before turning the call over to Donald to highlight our financial results in more detail, I want to reinforce our 2016 guidance and long-term outlook.
As previously announced, we expect to deliver non-GAAP net earnings per share of $1 to $1.10 in 2016, with planned infrastructure enhancement investments of approximately $1.4 billion. And in the years ahead, we remain committed to our annual projected dividend and earnings growth-for-growth range of 4% to 6%.
Now let me turn the call over to Donald to review our financial results in more detail, which are highlighted on Page 4 of our supplemental slides."

As Joe mentioned, we delivered non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $19 million or $0.06 per share, which compares to a loss of about $9 million or $0.03 per share in the third quarter of 2014.

As Joe mentioned, we delivered non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $19 million or $0.06 per share, which compares to a loss of about $9 million or $0.03 per share in the third quarter of 2014. On an operating earnings basis, NiSource was up about $31 million. As a reminder, these results no longer include the CPG reportable segment financials, which are classified as discontinued operations. The continued solid financial performance you see today is driven exclusively by our utility businesses.
On a GAAP comparison, our income from continuing operations was about $15 million for the third quarter versus a loss of about $17 million for the same period in 2014.
Now let's take a closer look at the third quarter operating earnings performance at our two business segments. Our Gas Distribution segment came in at about $22 million compared with $1 million for 2014. Net revenues, excluding the impact of trackers, were up nearly $19 million, primarily to increases in regulatory and service programs in Ohio, Virginia and Pennsylvania. Operating expenses, excluding the impact of trackers, decreased about $2 million.
Our Electric Operations delivered nearly $102 million in operating earnings compared to about $90 million for the prior year period. Net revenues excluding trackers were relatively flat due to increased infrastructure investment revenues offset by lower industrial load. Operating expenses, excluding the impact of trackers, decreased by about $12 million, primarily due to lower employee and administrative costs. As Joe mentioned, these results are solidly in line with our expectations. Full details of our results are available in our earnings release issued and posted online this morning.
Now turning to Slide 5,  I'd like to briefly touch 
[audio gap]in an interest rate of 5.86%. On the liquidity front, our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility went into effect at separation. And at the end of third quarter, we maintained net available liquidity of about $1.6 billion.
Our credit ratings at the three major agencies are solidly investment grade, something we remain committed to as we continued to execute on our $30 billion in infrastructure investment opportunities. As you can see, the financial foundation for our continued growth as a pure-play utility is strong, on track and consistent with our investment proposition.
Now, I'll turn the call back to Joe to discuss a  few customer, infrastructure and regulatory highlights across our utilities."

As noted, our teams remain on track with our utility investments. These investments further improve reliability and safety, enhance customer service and reduce emissions, all while generating sustainable long-term shareholder value.
Let's turn to a few highlights from our gas operations on Slide 6. As I mentioned at the start of the call, in early October the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities approved the settlement that Columbia Gas of Massachusetts reached with parties in its 2015 base rate case. Rates went into effect on November 1 and the approved settlement provides for an annual revenue increase of approximately $33 million with an additional $3.6 million annual increase expected in November 2016.
In August, Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania reached a settlement in its base rate case pending before the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission. The settlement provides for a $28 million increase in annual revenues and [indiscernible] is expected to authorize new rates by the end of this year.
Also in August, Columbia Gas of Virginia received final approval of its 2014 base rate case. The Virginia Commission reaffirmed the $25 million annual revenue, the difference between the settled amount and as-filed rates is now being refunded to customers following the final order. The order supports continued capital investments by CVA to modernize its system and accommodate customer growth as well as initiatives to enhance safety and reliability.
More recently, the Virginia Commission approved a 5-year extension of our SAVE program with our proposed 20% increase in annual investments. As a reminder, the SAVE program is our infrastructure modernization plan in the state. One item worth noting on CVA's modernization plan, in the past few weeks, the team completed all planned cast-iron pipe replacement in the state.
At NIPSCO Gas, we filed our semiannual tracker update in August, which provides support for the remaining 5 years of our 7-year $817 million natural gas system modernization program. This program involves enhancing existing gas infrastructure and extending gas service to rural areas.
Before moving on from gas operations, I'd like to say how encouraged we are by our strong performance across-the-board on the recent J.D. Power Natural Gas Customer Satisfaction surveys. In fact, Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania is a J.D. Power award winner for the second year in a row, and Columbia Gas of Virginia was recognized as one of the most improved brands in the nation. They also ranked as a top brand nationally in communications. This strong performance is a demonstration that our ongoing infrastructure programs are designed to benefit customers and that our team of approximately 7,500 employees is focused on the right things, and that's serving our customers safely and reliably each day.
Now let's turn to our Electric Operations on Slide 7. Consistent with the May 26 settlement NIPSCO reached with Indiana Office of Utility Consumer Counselor and NIPSCO's largest[audio gap]and is expected to file a new 7-year electric infrastructure modernization plan with the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission or IURC by early 2016. NIPSCO's first electric rate case in 5 years seeks to recover the current cost of generating and distributing power, plus ongoing investments, which are delivering substantial benefits to customers, including a 40% reduction in the duration of power outages. The request also seeks to create a Bill Payment Assistance program for low income electric customers during the summer cooling season. A decision by the IURC is expected in the third quarter of 2016.
NIPSCO's flue gas desulfurization unit at its Michigan City Generating Facility is set to be placed in service by the end of the year, on schedule and on budget. The approximately $255 million project, supported with cost recovery, improves the air quality and helps ensure NIPSCO's generation fleet remains in compliance with current environmental regulations. It also helps ensure that NIPSCO can continue offering, low cost, reliable and efficient generating capacity for its customers.
Progress also continued on two major electric transmission projects designed to enhance region-wide system flexibility and reliability. Right of way acquisition, permitting and substation construction are underway for both projects. These projects involve an investment of approximately $500 million for NIPSCO and are anticipated to be in service by the end of 2018. We believe our investments are paying off for our customers in northern Indiana and we saw evidence of that in the recent J.D. Power Residential Electric customer survey. NIPSCO's Electric overall customer satisfaction index score increased 30 points over 2014 and was among the most improved electric utilities in the Midwest.
So as you can see, our teams continue to execute on our well-established infrastructure, environmental customer and regulatory plans.
Before turning to your questions, I'd like to reaffirm the value proposition that we believe differentiates NiSource. Following the separation of Columbia Pipeline Group, we are well aligned with our aspiration to be a premier regulated utility company. Our plan represents the best-in-class, risk-adjusted total return proposition with continued progress on our $30 billion of long-term, 100% regulated utility infrastructure investment opportunities, with significant scale across seven states, transparent earnings drivers and constructive regulatory environments.
To that end, we are focused on leading in the areas that matter most in our industry, enhancing value to our customers and communities, stewarding our assets to ensure safe, reliable, affordable and efficient service, engaging and investing in the communities we serve and ensuring through disciplined execution that we deliver on our financial and other stakeholder commitments. This transparent, sustainable growth is expected to drive enhanced shareholder value well into the future.
Thank you, all, for participating today and for your ongoing interest in and support of NiSource. We look forward to sharing continued updates on our progress.

But still a very flat low-profile on the industrial, particularly the steel side. It's important to note that 2014 was a bit of an anomaly in terms of the load from that sector with them depending more on our generation than their own internal generation in that year due to weather conditions and operating conditions. But nonetheless, on 1% or so, on a year-to-date basis [audio gap] on the steel load, in Northwest Indiana and would expect slow recovery, slow and steady recovery.
