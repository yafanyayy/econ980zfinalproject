91031,281624853,754827,"Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2015",2015-02-04,"Earnings Calls","TFCF Corporation","Executives","All right. Thanks, Reed. As you have seen in today's earnings release, we reported another good quarter of financial results led by double-digit revenue and EBITDA growth at our Cable Networks. Note that due to the sale in November of our DBS businesses t",1515,"All right. Thanks, Reed. As you have seen in today's earnings release, we reported another good quarter of financial results led by double-digit revenue and EBITDA growth at our Cable Networks. Note that due to the sale in November of our DBS businesses to Sky, our reported financial results include the consolidation of these businesses this year for our partial quarter of ownership as compared to a full quarter consolidation the year ago. So to provide a more meaningful comparative analysis, we are providing total company adjusted revenue and adjusted EBITDA that excludes the DBS businesses in all periods. Most of the comments that follow will be on this adjusted basis, and there are press release provides the reconciliations between the reported results and this adjusted basis.
So second quarter adjusted total company revenues were $7.4 billion, up 10% compared to the second quarter a year ago, reflecting double-digit increases in our Cable Network and Film segments. 
Adjusted total segment EBITDA for the second quarter was $1.7 billion, up 12% over the $1.51 billion from the year ago. This increase reflects strong results of the Cable Network segment, improvements led by costs at the Television segment and similar film contributions to a year ago. Note that unfavorable foreign currency movements reduced our overall total EBITDA growth rate in the quarter by 6 percentage points.
From a bottom-line perspective, we reported income from continuing operations attributable to stockholders of $6.2 billion as compared to the $982 million we reported in the second quarter a year ago. This year's results include $5 billion of gains reported in Other net, which was principally from the company's sale of the DBS businesses to Sky. Also included in this year's equity earnings of affiliate results is net after-tax income of approximately $100 million related to Sky's gains on the sales of certain of its investments, partially offset by their purchase price amortization and expenses related to their acquisition of Sky Italia and Sky Deutschland.
Excluding net income effect of these net equity gains and last year's gain for participating in Sky share repurchase program as well as the amounts reflected in Other net, second quarter adjusted earnings per share was $0.53 this year versus $0.33 in the prior year. This quarter's adjusted earnings per share includes the recognition of various tax benefits of approximately $250 million or $0.12 per share. For the remainder of the fiscal year, we expect our tax rate to approximate 31%. Also note that the net income and EPS contributions of the DBS segment in each year were not significant.
Now let me provide some additional context at the performance -- on the performance of a few of our businesses, and let's start with the Cable Network segment, where overall total segment revenues increased 14% from last year, highlighted by a 16% increase in affiliate revenues and 8% advertising revenue growth.
With respect to affiliate revenues, domestic affiliate fees increased 19%, primarily from higher average rates led by the RSNs, FX and FOX News, as well as increases from the conversion of our new channels, FS1 and FXX. The inclusion of the YES Network this year also contributed to our growth, and excluding the contribution from YES, we had a low double-digit domestic affiliate fee increase. Our reported international affiliate fees were up 7%, reflecting strong underlying local currency growth of about 20%.
The second quarter Cable segment advertising revenue growth of 8% reflects domestic advertising increases of 11%, led by the FX Network's, FS1 and FXX. Reported international advertising grew 5%, but we had 10% growth on a local currency basis driven by strong year-over-year increases at STAR.
Total cable segment EBITDA in the second quarter of $1.16 billion was up 12% over the prior year, reflecting the strong revenue growth, which was partially offset by a planned 16% increase in expenses, primarily related to higher sports rights and entertainment programming costs. The negative impact from the strengthening U.S. dollar impacted the segment growth rate by 6%.
EBITDA at our domestic channels increased 13% from higher contributions at our established networks, as well as the impact of consolidating the YES Network this year.
EBITDA at Fox Sports 1 was below last year, reflecting the planned increased programming costs associated with the inaugural broadcast of the major league baseball playoffs.
Reported international channel EBITDA contributions increased 8% as strong double-digit local currency growth at both FIC and the STAR entertainment channels was partially offset by the continued investment we're making in STAR Sports and the negative impact from foreign exchange rates.
At our Television segment, second quarter EBITDA was $290 million, an increase of $72 million as compared to the prior-year result. This higher contribution is primarily due to lower programming costs reflecting the absence of X Factor this year, the movement of Glee into the March quarter and the shift of the baseball league championship series to Fox Sports 1. Total segment revenues were consistent with the year ago quarter as strong retransmission consent revenue growth was offset by a 3% decline in advertising revenues. This ad revenue decline is primarily due to lower general entertainment ratings at the broadcast network and stations, offset in part by higher local political ad revenues related to the midterm elections.
Turning to our Film segment. We reported second quarter EBITDA of $336 million, a similar result to that of a year ago, as higher film studio contributions were offset by fewer Television series deliveries. Total segment revenues in the quarter increased $276 million or 11%, driven by several successful theatrical releases, including Gone Girl and The Maze Runner. The majority of these higher theatrical revenues were offset by increased releasing cost for both these films as well as Exodus and Night at the Museum 3.
Before I turn to guidance, let me make a couple of capital-related comments. We ended the quarter with $10.1 billion in cash and $19.1 billion in gross debt, and the cash position reflects the net proceeds from the sale of Sky Italia and Sky Deutschland during the quarter.
With regard to the stock buyback, we repurchased approximately $2.9 billion of FOXA shares from July 1 through today, and we're on plan to complete the $6 billion buyback within the 12-month time frame we previously announced.
And today, the company increased its dividend and declared a semiannual dividend of $0.15 per share. This translates to a $0.30 dividend on an annual basis, a 20% increase over the previous dividend payout.
Now let me address our guidance update for fiscal 2015. As a reminder, for guidance purposes, we are excluding the DBS businesses for the entirety of all periods, resulting in a base EBITDA for fiscal 2014 of $6.29 billion.
On last quarter's earnings call, we mentioned that we had seen some puts and takes as against our original expectations for fiscal 2015 with the negative variances at that time primarily relating to the strengthening dollar and underperformance at the broadcast network as against our original expectations. Since that update, these trends have continued and at levels above what we expected.
Over the last 3 months, the U.S. dollar has appreciated significantly, further reducing the translated U.S. dollar earnings from our international businesses, most notably from the FOX International Channels. Assuming exchange rates stay where they are today, the strength in dollar has now further reduced our fiscal 2015 EBITDA expectations by an additional $100 million plus, resulting in a total full year effect across the company of around $250 million versus last year.
At our Television Broadcast business, the network and the stations, we now know that market and rating challenges were more significant than we expected. 
On the entertainment side, Empire and American Idol are doing well competitively, but our ratings overall have underperformed and our expectation that the national and local ad markets would gain momentum going into calendar 2015 has not occurred. 
On the sports side, our biggest college football games in the quarter were all lopsided wins, with an average score of 52 to 10, thereby impacting the viewership.
At our Film segment, we continue to anticipate the full year contributions will exceed our original expectations, but now by a lesser amount than we thought 3 months ago, primarily reflecting lower-than-anticipated box office results from our holiday releases, as well as closing on the transfer of our Shine business to the Endemol joint venture earlier than we expected. This will result in the elimination of Shine's EBITDA contribution for the rest of the year as it moves to our Equity Affiliate line.
Despite our change in expectations around currencies, broadcast TV and our Film segment, our domestic cable network businesses continue to perform right in line with our expectations.
So considering these factors and based on all of the assumptions inherent in our current projections, we now expect that our total segment EBITDA percentage growth rate for fiscal 2015 will be toward the lower end of the mid-single-digit range, above the $6.29 billion total segment EBITDA base level for fiscal 2014.
With that, let me turn it over to Chase."

Looking forward to 2016 
[Technical Difficulty]
I'll start again, so I don't know what -- whether any of that came on. Let me begin by expanding on John's comments on fiscal 2015 guidance. The reality is that the majority of our businesses and key initiatives are on track and our competitive position is as strong as ever in almost every area. However, 2 issues, foreign currency and broadcast advertising shortfalls, simply became too large to offset. Let me address these issues first and talk about the larger picture.
There isn't a lot to add to what John said about the currency issues, we are practical, we are addressing hedging strategies to help manage the risk, but hedging will only mitigate further fluctuations, not the currency impact to date.
On the broadcast side, network and stations, the issue is primarily entertainment rating shortfalls at our network, exacerbated by adverse industry trends and linear network ratings in the Television advertising markets, which, combined, leave our expected ad revenues well short of plan.
Looking forward to 2016, we expect these same themes to continue. The majority of our businesses are strong and on track, however, currency moves this year will adversely impact 2016 profits by about $200 million, which is on top of the approximately $250 million hit to expected 2016 profits from currency shifts last year, a total hit of about $450 million to our original 2016 projection in August 2013.
We also expect the next 12 months to be a period of investment in new programming at our broadcast network. In addition, we anticipate the industry trends backing advertising will be slightly larger than previously expected, as both advertising and viewership continues to migrate to digital platforms.
Our original target for 2016 profits was $9 billion, which adjusted for the deconsolidation of the Sky's and Shine, will be about $8 billion. Clearly, our Broadcast business is not where we expected it to be at this time, and external market forces like currency have been more unfavorable than expected. While we still expect solid double-digit growth overall next year due to the strength of most of our businesses, the challenges in currency and broadcasting now lead us to an expected 2016 profit in the mid-$7 billion range.
We're obviously disappointed to fall short of our targets for this year and next, we take these targets seriously. However, our overall goal is not to get a short-term profit target but to build shareholder value, which will be determined by the overall momentum and competitive strengths of our businesses and how well they're positioned to grow and succeed in light of broader economic technological and global trends. If our goal will to hit the short-term profit target, we'd pursue efforts like cutting marketing and programming cost at the expense of future profits. We'll not do that because we believe shareholder value is built through long-term growth.
In terms of that overall goal, we could not be more excited about the future. First, as noted earlier, most of our businesses and key initiatives are on target and competitively as strong as ever. Affiliate revenues and retransmission fees, which are the foundation for future growth, are on or ahead of our plans. Among key initiatives, we begun to once again reset the FOX News rate to reflect its importance in the market with new agreements now in place with 4 MVPDs represent over 1/4 of the market and Fox Sports 1 now its affiliation agreements in place with all major MVPDs reflect the new FS1 rate.
Our domestic and international cable channels group, which represent about 70% of our profit, are on track on a local currency basis, as with the new channel initiatives launched in the last few years. 
Our new sports and entertainment channels continue to build in their leadership position with truly unique and focused brands around the world. For example, FX has really left competing basic cable networks behind with programming that makes it appear the premium networks, while FXX is at an exciting new dimension to that group as the fastest-growing networking cable.
Our Film and Television businesses had great momentum and continue to distinguish themselves as industry leaders. Our Film business finished calendar 2014 with record-breaking worldwide box office. We've locked up key sports content around the world through the rest of this decade to assure access to this critical content and provide cost stability.
Even in the earlier noted areas where we face challenges, we're excited about the future. At our Broadcast business, our issues have been ones of execution, not structure. The foundation is in place with retransmission revenues ahead of plan with significant room to grow and our major sports rights are in place under long-term contracts.
Our challenges in the networks entertainment programming. After a few tough years, we believe we've turned the corner with a new network management team who inherited our current broadcast issues that has brought fresh momentum and energy to the business. It's always a tough business to predict, but we are excited about new hits like Empire and Gotham, as well as the dynamic slate of new event programming. Our competitors have already shown what a difference a couple of hits can make.
While I think in time to get the Broadcast business to where it should be in terms of profitability. The next year plus will be a period of investment, with the priority focused on building hit shows, not maximizing profit. The profits will follow. We still believe our Broadcast business has a strategic and financial future that is as promising as ever. The time when the value of hit programming continues to grow exponentially, our broadcast network plays a unique role in launching defining events like Empire.
Turning to the broader industry issues. The digital transition continues to be a glass half-full story for us. The movement of advertising dollars and shift our consumer viewing is clearly going to continue as I think it is fair to say that this trend recently has been a bit faster than many expected. These issues will put short-term pressure on our business but represent longer-term exciting growth opportunities that we were able to deliver more efficient and effective capabilities to advertisers, better monetize viewership on digital platforms and create new offers consumers -- for consumers on these platforms. Our content and brands are the ones consumers and advertisers want to access to first and foremost, and we are committed to building the capabilities to meet that demand.
Recent initiatives like the restructuring of our ad sales organization and the acquisition of True X are focused on that goal.
In closing, let me touch on the return on capital and our balance sheet. We are well aware that the recent completion of the Sky transaction once again has our balance sheet at an overly liquid position. We will complete our $6 billion buyback as planned, although that will still leave us with excess liquidity. Between now and fiscal year, our board will continue to consider next steps. Our priorities for capital remain the same: Invest in our core businesses to grow long-term value, opportunistic flexibility and return of capital to shareholders. We continue to pursue our goal of achieving an efficient balance sheet, but we'll do so in a deliberate manner. Quite simply, our goal continues to be building shareholder value by growing our businesses while returning capital to shareholders, and we believe we are on track to achieve that goal. Thank you. I'll turn it back to Reed."

I think a while ago you guys had laid out a plan for EBITDA growth there but the currencies have moved against you.

It sounds like you're planning to sort of double down, I don't know if that's the right phrase, but invest more in content entertainment and push the programming.

I think the last time when we talked about sort of the profit to the pathway for the Indian business, actually since then the currency has been reasonably stable over the last sort of 7 or I guess 9 months now. So I don't think that's had an additional impact going forward from what we saw then. But essentially, the STAR entertainment business, the local language business and the regional language business there, is a very profitable business today, a very attractive business. And really we're investing a lot of those profits to build the sports business alongside that, which we think really have a transformational effect on the business since the acquisition of the half interest of ESPN STAR Sports that we didn't own previously. And I think what we're seeing now is really the peak year of investment. In fact, these coming quarters, with the Cricket World Cup and a series of events, really making that heavy investment right now. But we see that turning reasonably quickly, and we have pretty good certainty on what those rights costs look like for the STAR Sports business. We're launching 2 new sports channels, 2 HD channels, actually just in the next month, to continue to grow the portfolio. And we think over 5-year basis, this business at STAR India is a very, very profitable business, we think it can get to north of -- I've said in the past, certainly north of $500 million to profit and do it with some pace and some velocity. And I think investing in programming and investing on for our customers is a theme that you'll see everywhere around the business. We really think that's the business that we're in and something that is super important for us, it's going to deliver a lot of long-term growth domestically here as well as around the world."

I think our priority is really building hits first and foremost and I guess it's why I made the comment. If we wanted just improved profits, we'd squeeze programming and squeeze marketing and we don't think it's the right move. So I don't get me in many ways. I think it is making sure we've got a bench of programming as we try and develop these hits. I think this year we felt we were a little thin in terms of having programming available. I think we always know every show is not going to work and we got to make sure we have appropriate flexibility to build. But I think what we're really talking about is stabilizing the Broadcast business and providing a platform to grow. But I think that real growth comes in the next couple of years, not the next 12 months. So I think the next year will be a period of more stabilizing that business and putting it on a path to grow. But I think I'm talking more priorities. And I think to the degree it's pending in reality, some of our more expensive programming, something like Glee is ending its run. So obviously there are some costs that will go away, will not recur, as we invest in new shows. But I think if what the investment is probably having a bit more flexibility and a bit more the bench of programming to launch next year to enable us to have a few more shots at creating the hits that are the foundation for future. Obviously Empire and Gotham give us some exciting building blocks to grow off, but it's not significant increase in cost. Again, I'm probably speaking more to what we think is the priority for the coming year."

I think we'll announce something when essentially we're ready to do it. I expect this to be an area where we are busy and do move forward, but we're not going to sort of make press releases. I think what's most important and I'm not sure offers that sort of resonate with the consumer. I mean I think a lot of what's been out there so far seems to be, whether it's driven by transactions or deals or something or other considerations, I think we want to see can we bring things that are additive to our business, and I think at the start we have to make sure what we do in this space as we do in other places, is that additive to our business, but brings new opportunities and interesting experiences to consumers. And whether that's through a richer experience, a better interface, more choice. Again, I think what we offer consumers today in many ways is a pretty attractive proposition. But clearly there's segments we are not reaching in the right way and there are opportunities for us to expand and grow that pie. And we are going to be active there. But we're going to be thoughtful about it as well and make sure it's done in a way that is additive to our business as a whole is the way that we go forward. And on TCFTV, I think it's an important part, one of the core strategic reasons for putting it together is increasingly I think it's we're not alone in this. A lot of the upside of what a network represents in terms of launching programming is realized on the products, on the content side of it. So the real win-win for us is to launch content that we own. It doesn't mean we're not going to have third-party content on our network, we will, because realistically we want to have the best content possible. It doesn't mean we're not going to sell content to third-party networks, we will do that as well. But clearly, the sweet spot is using our network to be able to create assets that we own. And I think by putting them together under one roof, we think we certainly create, it makes those opportunities more available to us and certainly I think streamline that decision-making, make the ability to identify needs and ensure we're doing everything possible to maximize the opportunities to launch a hit show is done by having that studio and the network together. But it is one of the core benefits that we look to in putting the studio and the network under Gary and Dana's leadership."

I mean, in all -- and that's obviously certainly applies to some of the newer initiatives like FS1 or sports internationally, but I cited I think upfront talked about FOX News, which I think just get stronger and we are once again resetting that business. FOX business, I think, we're just really moving to now to really full competitive distribution. So when I look at our portfolio of channels, both the established ones and the newer ones, I think a lot of growth in international marketplace clearly as you look at it around the world, has got -- is certainly somewhere midstream in terms of reaching any reaching its full potential, varies by region, but there's an enormous amount of growth, we talked before about India, where that is in terms of what we think that business can be as we move through this decade. I think, ultimately, I really mean what I said when I talked about the digital platforms and us taking advantage of those, both directly and through outher parties. I think for those who have -- we really believe must-have content is going to sweet spot in the digital world. People it's the content people want to Rochester refer the RSNs. The reality ends up being sports comes at a cost but are also the product that's most in demand. And I think hit product is going to grow exponentially in value and importance and I think those that have the heavy breadth that hit unique content will be ideally positioned to take advantage of all these platforms and create new offers and new compositions for consumers. And opportunities to engage more directly with consumers in terms of developing those offers, monetizing the viewership, developing databases and the like. So I think in many ways, I think it will a lot of it is short-term pressure because the pressure short-term it will take time to build the vehicles to replace the short-term pressures. But as we go forward, I think it's an area of tremendous growth for us. I mean, I think those with -- and again, get unique content brands at that scale have a really in the sweet spot to take advantage of these things. So I think our core businesses have a lot of growth left here and overseas in their traditional models, not that some of those models are maturing, but our business is clearly, when we look at what we're doing with FOX News, look at where we are with retransmission rates and the potential there, we think the value of our content holds up. Yes, you'll still certainly as we said, I think the cable bundle really is pretty much in line with our expectations. I said before, probably spring. But I think it's got real legs to it and still is going to be a cornerstone for a long time. But as we go forward, these digital platforms really open up a whole new dimension in growth on top of the opportunities we have within the traditional model."

And then for Chase, you noted the strong ad growth domestically from the FX Network's in the quarter. Does seem like ratings at FXX have picked up nicely, but FX ratings themselves have seen to hit a soft spot. So I know you guys have moved some content from FX to FXX, but just wondering is there any concern on those networks? And can they establish their own distinct identities from each other?"

It's James here. First of all, I would say our bias generally is to and particularly given the position we have in markets outside the U.S. today, is generally to invest in ourselves and to continue to execute and operate these businesses where we have a reasonable position. I think it's fair to say that we're pretty happy with the mix that we have around the place. It's a -- we've completed a number of transactions over the last number of years from the acquisition of the Asianet business and local regional -- local regional languages in India, which really gave us a new dimension to that business, through the acquisition of our partner stakes in ESPN STAR Sports and Fox Pan-America Sports and so on. And I think we'll continue to look at acquisitions where we can simplify our business, where we can really a dimension and really add velocity and pace to the business. But we're not looking to fill a whole bunch of gaps,  if you will. I think we have a good position internationally. And to Chase's point before about long-term growth, I think it's really one of the drivers of our long-term growth when we look at our emerging markets position, particularly in India, i n parts of Asia and other parts of Asia. And in Latin America, we feel very, very strong about the position. That's not to say that we will rule things out. We'll look opportunistic publicity at a variety right of things, as you would expect. But we generally, at this point, I think would have a bias towards investing in ourselves other than kind of bolt-on kind of tactical things that can help us accelerate."

I think FX has held up really well, and I think actually i's programming continues to if anything, distinguish itself from certainly its basic cable competitors more and more.

And as we see the screening share of time shift to viewing continue to grow, vis-à-vis DVRs, really you have to remember that we're really just in very, very foothills of monetizing that viewership and that viewership is very, very large. It's a material percentage, above what our life plus 3 or life plus 7 viewing is. So it's really about monetizing the streaming environment and being able to accelerate with new ad products for other clients, other broadcasters as well as for ourselves, but there'll be more on that going forward. Fundamentally, it's about the acquisition capability within the networks group and we think it can move the dial over time."

Looking at the solidness of your subscriber revenue streams that showed itself in the first half, when you look at the back half of the year given the reduction in full year guidance, can you just give us a sense, you talked about the currency, but what type of domestic ad market are you looking at for broadcast networks, stations and cable? Can you just give us some color on just it sounds like those numbers obviously down pretty substantially at least for the broadcast stations and networks, but just some sense of order of magnitude? And will cable also feel that effect versus the strength you had this quarter? And then just kind of a big picture question for I don't know for all of you. When you look at the rationale for the Time Warner acquisition attempt over the summer, it seemed to us that a direct consumer business with all of the content the combined companies would have had versus selling your content to Netflix was a huge potential benefit. As you look at kind of what's going on in advertising and you look at the kind of the strength that Netflix keeps growing, does it make it that much important to kind of revisit that transaction, work out some form of relationship with Time Warner, just because both of you could both in this ad market and the change in consumer, you both could use each other more than ever before?"

What I'd say side of the ad markets we look at that them today. Nationally, I guess they're okay, probably not where we might have hoped them. I think we came into this quarter hoping there'll be up, probably a bit more, of renewed budgets and the like probably this quarter feel probably like the fourth quarter, like the December quarter, maybe some rays of light to gives you a little  hope the national market to be a little better. But I guess I'd say it's not as robust as we would've hoped in terms of a rebound, but it's okay. Upfront pricing is still a premium to the scat. The scatter pricing is a premium to the upfront pricing. So it's okay. I would say the local markets are probably softer than the national markets. I think the local markets, from a market perspective as we look at what our expectations are for this year, I think the local markets took up the market factors had a bigger hit. I guess what as you look at sort of what surprised a little more visibility to sort of the adjusted guidance, I mean there's really sort of probably 3 buckets in aggregate that are sort of changes from when we last looked at it and it's currency, it's the Broadcast business and the content piece John touched on and they're probably all about equal, I mean sort of probably the better part of how these round numbers about probably $100 million in each. So I think we talk about the currency being $100 million, I think broadcast. Again the content which is a combination of Shine being clearly a significant event and then to a lesser extent, the Christmas releases that didn't pan out. In the broadcast piece, it's sort of it's probably our biggest rating it was already took. In the first quarter we knew our ratings were short. And to a large degree, our content upside offset the ratings shortfalls. Probably ratings are a little bit worse, but that our expectations in the quarter. But that sort of $100 million is probably a bit of ratings, sports as John touched on was a little soft. I mean our 2 big conference championship games were blowouts, the 2 biggest regular season games, I mean John gave each average clearly all didn't pan out, the NFL was attach behind in our big 4 gains in the last quarter, that was the $100 million is up a little bit. And clearly, the station market, we are expecting sort of and I think we talked about it going into the year, low single -- we weren't expecting much, but we were sort of expecting a low single-digit 1% to 2% market growth and probably looks like now a low to mid decline -- no, low mid-decline percentage. We do $1 billion in 6 months in that business, so if you got a 5% swing, it's $50 million. So if you had the broadcast pieces up and say it's $50 million in stations and $20 million to $25 million in the sorts and the biggest piece being the college games and another piece on the ratings on top of what really was largely we anticipated in the September quarter, that sort of give you the pieces and the offset we had in content went the other way, with Shine being pulled out and a couple of Christmas pictures not being what we thought they'd be."

I do mean I think we have what we have a breadth of content that enables us to navigate the space. You talked about Netflix, I think from the get-go, our approach to the SVOD space, Netflix in particular, specifically, the SVOD space in general, has been to be disciplined about it, to make sure we participate in that business, adhering to sort of rules that first and foremost defend the value, enable us to continue to grow our core businesses, which is the networks and make sure we're enlarging our overall pie and not cannibalizing our core businesses in an adverse way to the extent of short-term dollars. So we have been disciplined in terms of which we do it. The reality, our recent SVOD deals had been actually with Amazon or Hulu plus. So I think that's a positive, that you've got a more competitive marketplace than you've had there. But we will and will continue to ensure that we are not going to take actions that would prioritize short-term profits from a sale at the expense of the health of our long-term businesses. I think we've been through to that to date in these things and we will continue to ensure that we grow our overall business, and that's certainly the -- a rule, principal we'll stay true to as we develop the opportunities of the digital platforms. We think they're real opportunities to develop ways to offer our products in new and exciting ways and we have to figure out what are the right models for those, we're doing a lot of work on it. We're obviously engagingly with some third parties. We did announce we concluded a deal with Sony. We are talking to others. But in all these cases, we're going to ensure we do things that enables us to grow our overall business, not cannibalize it. And we think we have the franchises and the content that puts us in a leadership position to be must-have content with essentially not carrying meeting, at great package that doesn't have a content in, but I think our content at its core is content that really is central to the video business.

I mean I think it's less driven by the SVOD services, it's really just driven by cable network programmers getting into dramatic series production by and large and increasing volumes, and the numbers are still going up. But I think it's really important to remember that one hour of scripted television is very, very different from another hour of scripted Television. So the total volume isn't really the question, the right question is what are you making, how do you make it great, how do you stand out? And can you be a place that can attract the great show runners, the great writers, the great talent to come into incredible work? And I think we are very, very confident that creatively the teams across 21st Century Fox companies can continue to execute, they've been executing very well, but it's not really a question of a volume game, it's a question of how do you make stuff that's genuinely distinctive in that environment where you have so much consumer choice. And I think the thing that exacerbates the competitive kind of dynamic around it is that with the availability of streaming platforms and the availability of vast libraries of scripted programming, you're really competing with not just what's on in the same hour but you're competing with everything that's come before. And that's something that's it's a great creative talents but one that we feel is our core business to try to write to and to try to get great people to do that."

I mean certainly sitting here, we're not going to be projections about the upfront, but I don't think sort of 4 months away from now you'll be dramatically different approach what we have. But we are certainly changing how we're approaching the ad market. I mean as I touched on, we have restructured our entire ad sales organization. And in many ways, the primary reason for doing that was to position us to deal with the world going forward. I mean, the rust comp costs that came out but the objective is that secondary consideration that those were just efficiency moves. Our objective in reorganizing and restructuring the ad sales organization was to position us to deal with the world we expect to be competing in, which again has this viewership moving at places and advertisers. Not surprisingly wanting a lot of the attributes of efficiency and effectiveness that come with additional platforms. We estimate have to make sure we are positioned to take advantage of that. So I think that's a priority. I'm not sure our will be doing it starting today, not even the upfront, the upfront is part of that process. But certainly, the way we are approaching the entire ad market is in the state of transition. I will say in the digital, why lot of money is clearly a lot of desire there. I think 1 of the things we hope to do and I think our content because it would put it and help is still unclear to what degree our advertisers are getting value out of the digital market place. In many ways, that may be R&D spending which probably has a logic to it. But I think it's unclear in many places are they getting value for that spending? Or are they chasing just sort of goals in terms of attributes without knowing where they're getting the value for it? So I think I hope we can add dimension that sort of enables them to ensure by having content that really a sweet spot, that we're able to really deliver on the value that gets associated with those digital platforms."

91031,281624853,755002,"Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2015",2015-02-04,"Earnings Calls","TFCF Corporation","Executives","All right. Thanks, Reed. As you will have seen in today's earnings release, we reported another good quarter of financial results led by double-digit revenue and EBITDA growth at our Cable Networks. Note that due to the sale in November of our DBS busines",1518,"All right. Thanks, Reed. As you will have seen in today's earnings release, we reported another good quarter of financial results led by double-digit revenue and EBITDA growth at our Cable Networks. Note that due to the sale in November of our DBS businesses to Sky, our reported financial results include the consolidation of these businesses this year for our partial quarter of ownership as compared to a full quarter consolidation the year ago. So to provide a more meaningful comparative analysis, we're providing total company adjusted revenue and adjusted EBITDA that excludes the DBS businesses in all periods. Most of the comments that follow will be on as adjusted basis, and their press release provides the reconciliations between the reported results on as adjusted basis.
So second quarter adjusted total company revenues were $7.4 billion, up 10% compared to the second quarter a year ago, reflecting double digit increases in our Cable Network and Film segments. 
Adjusted total segment EBITDA for the second quarter was $1.7 billion, up 12% over the $1.51 billion from the year ago. This increase reflects strong results of the Cable Network segment, improvements led by costs at the Television segment and similar film contributions to a year ago. Note that unfavorable foreign currency movements reduced our overall total EBITDA growth rate in the quarter by 6 percentage points.
From a bottom line perspective, we reported income from continuing operations attributable to stockholders of $6.2 billion as compared to the $982 million we reported in the second quarter a year ago. This year's results include $5 billion of gains reported in Other net, which was principally from the company's sale of the DBS businesses to Sky. Also included in this year's equity earnings of affiliate results is net after-tax income of approximately $100 million related to Sky's gains on the sales of certain of its investments, partially offset by their purchase price amortization and expenses related to their acquisition of Sky Italia and Sky Deutschland.
Excluding net income effect of these net equity gains and last year's gain from participating in Sky's share repurchase program as well as the amounts reflected in Other net, second quarter adjusted earnings per share was $0.53 this year versus $0.33 in the prior year. This quarter's adjusted earnings per share includes the recognition of various tax benefits of approximately $250 million or $0.12 per share. For the remainder of the fiscal year, we expect our tax rate to approximate 31%. Also note that the net income and EPS contributions of the DBS segment in each year were not significant.
Now let me provide some additional context at the performance -- on the performance of a few of our businesses, and let's start with the Cable Network segment, where overall total segment revenues increased 14% from last year, highlighted by a 16% increase in affiliate revenues and 8% advertising revenue growth.
With respect to affiliate revenues, domestic affiliate fees increased 19%, primarily from higher average rates led by the RSNs, FX and FOX News, as well as increases from the conversion of our new channels, FS1 and FXX. The inclusion of the YES Network this year also contributed to our growth, and excluding the contribution from YES, we had a low double digit domestic affiliate fee increase. Our reported international affiliate fees were up 7%, reflecting strong underlying local currency growth of about 20%.
The second quarter Cable segment advertising revenue growth of 8% reflects domestic advertising increases of 11%, led by the FX Network's FS1 and FXX. Reported international advertising grew 5%, but we had 10% growth on a local currency basis driven by strong year-over-year increases at STAR.
Total cable segment EBITDA in the second quarter of $1.16 billion was up 12% over the prior year, reflecting the strong revenue growth, which was partially offset by a planned 16% increase in expenses, primarily related to higher sports rights and entertainment programming costs. The negative impact from the strengthening U.S. dollar impacted the segment growth rate by 6%.
EBITDA at our domestic channels increased 13% from higher contributions at our established networks as well as the impact of consolidating the YES Network this year.
EBITDA at Fox Sports 1 was below last year, reflecting the planned increased programming costs associated with the inaugural broadcast of the Major League Baseball playoffs.
Reported international channel EBITDA contributions increased 8% as strong double digit local currency growth at both FIC and the STAR entertainment channels was partially offset by the continued investment we're making in STAR Sports and the negative impact from foreign exchange rates.
At our Television segment, second quarter EBITDA was $290 million, an increase of $72 million as compared to the prior-year result. This higher contribution is primarily due to lower programming costs reflecting the absence of X Factor this year, the movement of Glee into the March quarter and the shift of the baseball League Championship Series to Fox Sports 1. Total segment revenues were consistent with the year ago quarter as strong retransmission consent revenue growth was offset by a 3% decline in advertising revenues. This ad revenue decline is primarily due to lower general entertainment ratings at the broadcast network and stations, offset in part by higher local political ad revenues related to the midterm elections.
Turning to our Film segment. We reported second quarter EBITDA of $336 million, a similar result to that of a year ago, as higher film studio contributions were offset by fewer television series deliveries. Total segment revenues in the quarter increased $276 million or 11%, driven by several successful theatrical releases, including Gone Girl and The Maze Runner. The majority of these higher theatrical revenues were offset by increased releasing cost for both these films as well as Exodus and Night at the Museum 3.
Before I turn to guidance, let me make a couple of capital-related comments. We ended the quarter with $10.1 billion in cash and $19.1 billion in gross debt, and the cash position reflects the net proceeds from the sale of Sky Italia and Sky Deutschland during the quarter.
With regard to the stock buyback, we repurchased approximately $2.9 billion of FOXA shares from July 1 through today, and we're on plan to complete the $6 billion buyback within the 12-month timeframe we previously announced.
And today, the company increased its dividend and declared a semiannual dividend of $0.15 per share. This translates to a $0.30 dividend on an annual basis, a 20% increase over the previous dividend payout.
Now let me address our guidance update for fiscal 2015. As a reminder, for guidance purposes, we are excluding the DBS businesses for the entirety of all periods, resulting in a base EBITDA for fiscal 2014 of $6.29 billion.
On last quarter's earnings call, we mentioned that we had seen some puts and takes as against our original expectations for fiscal 2015, with the negative variances at that time primarily relating to the strengthening dollar and underperformance at the broadcast network as against our original expectations. Since that update, these trends have continued and at levels above what we expected.
Over the last 3 months, the U.S. dollar has appreciated significantly, further reducing the translated U.S. dollar earnings from our international businesses, most notably from the FOX International Channels. Assuming exchange rates stay where they are today, the strength in dollar has now further reduced our fiscal 2015 EBITDA expectations by an additional $100 million plus, resulting in a total full year effect across the company of around $250 million versus last year.
At our Television Broadcast business, the network and the stations, we now know that market and rating challenges were more significant than we expected. 
On the entertainment side, Empire and American Idol are doing well competitively, but our ratings overall have underperformed and our expectation that the national and local ad markets would gain momentum going into calendar 2015 has not occurred. 
On the sports side, our biggest college football games in the quarter were all lopsided wins, with an average score of 52 to 10, thereby impacting the viewership.
At our Film segment, we continue to anticipate that the full year contributions will exceed our original expectations, but now by a lesser amount than we thought 3 months ago, primarily reflecting lower-than-anticipated box office results from our holiday releases, as well as closing on the transfer of our Shine business to the Endemol joint venture earlier than we expected. This will result in the elimination of Shine's EBITDA contributions for the rest of the year as it moves to our Equity Affiliate line.
Despite our change in expectations around currencies, broadcast TV and our Film segment, our domestic cable network businesses continue to perform right in line with our expectations.
So considering these factors and based on all of the assumptions inherent in our current projections, we now expect that our total segment EBITDA percentage growth rate for fiscal 2015 will be toward the lower end of the mid-single-digit range, above the $6.29 billion total segment EBITDA base level for fiscal 2014.
With that, let me turn it over to Chase."

There isn't a lot to add to what John said about the currency issue. We are practical. We are addressing hedging strategies to help manage the risk, but hedging will only mitigate further fluctuations, not the currency impact to date. On the broadcast side, network and stations, the issue is primarily entertainment rating shortfalls at our network, exacerbated by adverse industry trends, the linear network rating and the television advertising market, which, combined, leave our expected ad revenues well short of plan.

There isn't a lot to add to what John said about the currency issues, we are practical, we are addressing hedging strategies to help manage the risk, but hedging will only mitigate further fluctuations, not the currency impact to date.
On the broadcast side, network and stations, the issue is primarily entertainment rating shortfalls at our network, exacerbated by adverse industry trends and linear network ratings in the Television advertising markets, which, combined, leave our expected ad revenues well short of plan.
Looking forward to 2016, we expect these same themes to continue. The majority of our businesses are strong and on track, however, currency moves this year will adversely impact 2016 profits by about $200 million, which is on top of the approximately $250 million hit to expected 2016 profits from currency shifts last year, a total hit of about $450 million to our original 2016 projection in August 2013.
We also expect the next 12 months to be a period of investment in new programming at our broadcast network. In addition, we anticipate the industry trends impacting advertising will be slightly larger than previously expected, as both advertising and viewership continues to migrate to digital platforms.
Our original target for 2016 profits was $9 billion, which adjusted for the deconsolidation of the Sky's and Shine, will be about $8 billion. Clearly, our Broadcast business is not where we expected it to be at this time, and external market forces like currency have been more unfavorable than expected. While we still expect solid double-digit growth overall next year due to the strength of most of our businesses, the challenges in currency and broadcasting now lead us to an expected 2016 profit in the mid-$7 billion range.
We're obviously disappointed to fall short of our targets for this year and next, we take these targets seriously. However, our overall goal is not to hit a short-term profit target but to build shareholder value, which will be determined by the overall momentum and competitive strengths of our businesses and how well they're positioned to grow and succeed in light of broader economic technological and global trends. If our goal was to hit a short-term profit target, we'd pursue efforts like cutting marketing and programming cost at the expense of future profits. We'll not do that because we believe shareholder value is built through long-term growth.
In terms of that overall goal, we could not be more excited about the future. First, as noted earlier, most of our businesses and key initiatives are on target and competitively as strong as ever. Affiliate revenues and retransmission fees, which are the foundation for future growth, are on or ahead of our plans. Among key initiatives, we begun to once again reset the FOX News rate to reflect its importance in the market with new agreements now in place, with 4 MVPDs represent over 1/4 of the market, and Fox Sports 1 now has affiliation agreements in place with all major MVPDs that reflect the new FS1 rate.
Our domestic and international cable channels grew, represent about 70% of our profit, are on track on a local currency basis, as with the new channel initiatives launched in the last few years. 
Our new sports and entertainment channels continue to build in their leadership position with truly unique and focused brands around the world. For example, FX has really left competing basic cable networks behind with programming that makes it appear to premium networks, while FXX is at an exciting new dimension to that group as the fastest-growing networking cable.
Our Film and Television businesses had great momentum and continue to distinguish themselves as industry leaders. Our Film business finished calendar 2014 with record-breaking worldwide box office. We've locked up key sports content around the world through the rest of this decade to assure us access to this critical content and provide cost stability.
Even in the earlier noted areas where we faced challenges, we're excited about the future. At our Broadcast business, our issues have been ones of execution, not structure. The foundation is in place with retransmission revenues ahead of plan with significant room to grow and our major sports rights are in place under long-term contracts.
Our challenge has been the networks entertainment programming. After a few tough years, we believe we've turned the corner with a new network management team who inherited our current broadcast issues that has brought fresh momentum and energy to the business. It's always a tough business to predict, but we are excited about new hits like Empire and Gotham, as well as the dynamic slate of new event programming. Our competitors have already shown what difference a couple of hits can make.
It will take us time to get the Broadcast business to where it should be in terms of profitability. The next year plus will be a period of investment, with the priority focused on building hit shows, not maximizing profits. The profits will follow. We still believe our Broadcast business has a strategic and financial future that is as promising as ever. The time when the value of hit programming continues to grow exponentially, our broadcast network plays a unique role in launching defining events like Empire.
Turning to the broader industry issues. The digital transition continues to be a glass half full story for us. The movement of advertising dollars and shift to our consumer viewing is clearly going to continue. I think, it is fair to say that this trend recently has been a bit faster than many expected. These issues will put short-term pressure on our business but represent longer-term exciting growth opportunities as we're able to deliver more efficient and effective capabilities to advertisers, better monetize viewership on digital platforms and create new offers consumers -- for consumers on these platforms. Our content and brands are the ones consumers and advertisers want to access to first and foremost, and we're committed to building the capabilities to meet that demand.
Recent initiatives like the restructuring of our ad sales organization and the acquisition of trueX are focused on that goal.
In closing, let me touch on return of capital on our balance sheet. We're well-aware that the recent completion of the Sky transaction once again has our balance sheet at an overly liquid position. We will complete our $6 billion buyback as planned, although that will still leave us with excess liquidity. Between now and fiscal year end, our board will continue to consider next steps. Our priorities for capital remain the same: Invest in our core businesses to grow long-term value; opportunistic flexibility; and return of capital to shareholders. We continue to pursue our goal of achieving an efficient balance sheet, but we'll do so in a deliberate manner. Quite simply, our goal continues to be building shareholder value by growing our businesses while returning capital to shareholders, and we believe we're on track to achieve that goal. Thank you. And I'll turn it back to Reed."

I think, a while ago, you guys had laid out a plan for EBITDA growth there but the currencies have moved against you. Help us think about the opportunity there, particularly in light of some of the non-rupee denominated cost you have on the sports side. And a similar question, maybe, Chase, on FOX network, it sounds like you're planning to sort of double down, I don't know if that's the right phrase, but invest more in content entertainment and push the programming. Can you give us some color on sort of how big you want to go and what we should be thinking about in terms of programming cost growth at FOX over the next couple of years?"

I think, the last time, when we talked about sort of the profit to the pathway for the Indian business, actually, since then, the currency has been reasonably stable over the last sort of 7 or I guess 9 months now. So I don't think that's had an additional impact going forward from what we saw then. But essentially, the STAR entertainment business, the local language business and the regional language business there is a very profitable business today, a very attractive business. And really, we're investing a lot of those profits to build the sports business alongside that, which we think really have a transformational effect on the business since the acquisition of the half interest of ESPN STAR Sports that we didn't own previously. And I think, what we're seeing now is really the peak year of investment. In fact, these coming quarters, with the Cricket World Cup and a series of events, really making that heavy investment right now. But we see that turning reasonably quickly, and we have pretty good certainty on what those rights costs look like for the STAR Sports business. We're launching 2 new sports channels, 2 HD channels, actually, just in the next month, to continue to grow the portfolio. And we think, over a 5-year basis, this business at STAR India is a very, very profitable business. We think it can get to north of -- I've said in the past, certainly north of $500 million of profit, and do it with some pace and some velocity. And I think, investing in programming and investing on screen for our customers is a theme that you'll see everywhere around the business. We really think that's the business that we're in and something that is super important for us and is going to deliver a lot of long-term growth domestically here as well as around the world."

And I think, our priority is really building hits, first and foremost. And I guess, that's why I made the comment. If we want to just improved profits, we'd squeeze programming and squeeze marketing and we don't think that's the right move. So I don't think it's, in many ways -- I think it is making sure we've got a bench of programming as we try and develop these hits. I think, this year, we felt we were a little thin in terms of having programming available. I think, we always know not every show is going to work and we got to make sure we have appropriate flexibility to build. But I think, what we're really talking about is stabilizing the Broadcast business and providing a platform to grow. But I think that real growth comes in the next couple of years, not the next 12 months. So I think the next year will be a period of more stabilizing that business and putting it on a path to growth. But I think I'm talking more priorities. And I think, to the degree, it's spending in reality, some of our more expensive programming, something like Glee, is ending its run. So obviously, there are some costs that will go away, will not recur, as we invest in new shows. But I think, if you say what's the investment, it's probably having a bit more flexibility and a bit more the bench of programming to launch next year to enable us to have a few more shots at creating the hits that are the foundation for future. Obviously, Empire and Gotham give us some exciting building blocks to grow off of, but it's not a significant increase in cost. Again, I'm probably speaking more to what we think is the priority for the coming year."

In terms of developing them, I'm not going to comment on any one particular offer. And we don't -- certainly, we don't have announcements today. We are working on a lot of things. I think, we'll announce something when essentially we're ready to do it. I expect this to be an area where we are busy and do move forward, but we're not going to rush that, sort of make press releases. I think, what's most important, and I'm not sure I've seen it today, is there are offers that sort of resonate with the consumer. I mean, I think, a lot of what's been out there so far seems to be, whether it's driven by transactions or deals or something or other considerations, I think we want to see, can we bring things that are additive to our business. And I think, at the start, we have to make sure what we do in this space, as we do in other places, is additive to our business, but brings new opportunities and interesting experiences to consumers. And whether that's through a richer experience, a better interface, more choice. Again, I think, what we offer consumers today in many ways is a pretty attractive proposition. But clearly, there's segments we're not reaching in the right way and there are opportunities for us to expand and grow that pie. And we are going to be active there. But we're going to be thoughtful about it as well and make sure it's done in a way that is additive to our business as a whole as we go forward. And on TCFTV, I think, it's an important part, one of the core strategic reasons for putting it together is increasingly -- I think, it's -- we're not alone in this. A lot of the upside of what a network represents in terms of launching programming is realized on the products, on the content side of it. So the real win-win for us is to launch content that we own. It doesn't mean we're not going to have third-party content on our network, we will, because, realistically, we want to have the best content possible, and it doesn't mean we're not going to sell content to third-party networks, we will do that as well. But clearly, the sweet spot is using our network to be able to create assets that we own. And I think, by putting them together under one roof, we think, we certainly create -- it makes those opportunities more available to us and certainly, I think, streamline that decision-making, make the ability to identify needs and ensure we're doing everything possible to maximize the opportunities to launch a hit show is done by having the studio and the network work together. But it is one of the core benefits that we look to in putting the studio and the network under Gary and Dana's leadership."

I mean, in all -- and that's -- obviously, it certainly applies to some of the newer initiatives like FS1 or sports internationally, but I cited, I think, upfront, talked about FOX News, which I think just gets stronger and we are once again resetting that business. FOX business, I think, we're just really moving to now to really full competitive distribution. So when I look at our portfolio of channels, both the established ones and the newer ones, I think, there's lot of growth in international marketplace. Clearly, as you look at it around the world, has got -- is certainly somewhere -- midstream, in terms of reaching any -- reaching its full potential, varies by region, but there's an enormous amount of growth. We talked before about India, where that is in terms of what we think that business can be as we move through this decade. Ultimately, I really mean what I said when I talked about the digital platforms and us taking advantage of those, both directly and through outher parties. I think, for those who have -- we really believe must-have content is going to be a sweet spot in the digital world. People -- it's the content people are going to want to watch, we refer to the RSNs. The reality ends up being sports come at a cost but they're also the product that's most in demand. And I think, hit product is going to grow exponentially in value and importance. And I think, those that have the heavy breadth that hit unique content will be ideally positioned to take advantage of all these platforms and create new offers and new propositions for consumers and opportunities to engage more directly with consumers in terms of developing those offers, monetizing the viewership, developing databases and the like. So I think, in many ways, I think, it will -- a lot of it is short-term pressure because the pressure short-term will not -- will take time -- it will take time to build the vehicles that replace the short-term pressures. But as we go forward, I think, it's an area of tremendous growth for us. I mean, I think, those with -- and again, get unique content brands at scale, have -- really in the sweet spot to take advantage of these things. So I think, our core businesses have a lot of growth left here and overseas in their traditional models, not that some of those -- the models aren't maturing, but our business is clearly, when we look at what we're doing with FOX News, look at where we are with retransmission rates and the potential there, we think the value of our content holds up. Yes, you'll still -- certainly, as we said, I think that the cable bundle really is pretty much in line with our expectations. I've said before, probably spring. But I think, it's got real legs to it and still is going to be a cornerstone for a long time. But as we go forward, these digital platforms really open up a whole new dimension in growth on top of the opportunities we have within the traditional model."

It's a -- we've completed a number of transactions over the last number of years from the acquisition of the Asianet business and local regional languages in India, which really gave us a new dimension to that business through the acquisition of our partner stakes in ESPN, STAR Sports and Fox Pan-American Sports and so on. And I think, we'll continue to look at acquisitions where we can simplify our business, where we can really add a dimension and really add velocity and pace to the business. But we're not looking to fill a whole bunch of gaps, if you will. I think, we have a good position internationally.

I think, FX has held up really well, and I think, actually, if programming continues to, if anything, distinguish itself from, certainly, its basic cable competitors more and more. And I look at some of the shows they got coming this year, I think, they're great. So I think, we feel very good, and I think we feel great about it. I mean, I feel more than pretty good. I mean, I think, we knew there was going to be some pressures. And competitively, I think, it's very strong and weren't dealing with the same pressures on ratings that the broader industry is and, I think, competitively, they're doing well."

We're very excited about it. And really, for us, it's about investing in the capability around ad innovation that we can service in the company, as it does service multiple clients in the industry. But also, it's we really think we can hopefully accelerate the rollout of new technology and some new ad products that we think are really at the forefront of thinking around how you monetize digital viewership, how you monetize time-ship to viewership. And as we cease the streaming share of time-ship to viewing continue to grow, vis-à-vis DVRs, really, you have to remember that we're really just in the very, very foothills of monetizing that viewership and that viewership is very, very large. It's a material percentage above what our live plus 3 or live plus 7 viewing is. So it's really about monetizing the streaming environment and being able to accelerate with new ad products for other clients, other broadcasters as well as for ourselves, but there'll be more on that going forward. Fundamentally, it's about the acquisition capability within the networks group and we think it -- we really think it can move the dial over time."

Looking at the solidness of your subscriber revenue streams that showed itself in the first half, when you look at the back half of the year given the reduction in full year guidance, can you just give us a sense, you talked about the currency, but what type of domestic ad market are you looking at for broadcast networks, stations and cable? Could you just give us some color on just -- it sounds like those numbers obviously have been down pretty substantially, at least for the broadcast stations and networks, but just some sense of order of magnitude? And will cable also feel that effect versus the strength you had this quarter? And then, just kind of a big picture question for, I don't know, for all of you. When you look at the rationale for the Time Warner acquisition attempt over the summer, it seemed to us that a direct to consumer business, with all of the content the combined companies would have had versus selling your content to Netflix, was a huge potential benefit. As you look at kind of what's going on in advertising and you look at the kind of the strength that Netflix keeps growing, does it make it that much important to kind of revisit that transaction, work out some form of relationship with Time Warner, just because both of you could, both in this ad market, and the change in consumer, you both could use each other more than ever before?"

I mean, just comment on the ad markets, I guess, because you cited that. What I'd say, sort of the ad markets, is we look at that them today. Nationally, I guess, they're okay, probably not where we might have hoped. I think we came into this quarter hoping they'll be up probably a bit more of renewed budgets and the like, probably this quarter feels a little -- probably like the fourth quarter -- like the December quarter. Maybe some rays of light to give you a little hope the national market to be a little better. But I guess I'd say it's not as robust as we would've hoped in terms of a rebound, but it's okay. Upfront pricing is still a premium to the scat. The scatter pricing is a premium to the upfront pricing. So it's okay. I would say the local markets are probably softer than the national markets. I think, the local markets, from a market perspective as we look at what our expectations are for this year, I think the local markets took up. The market factors had a bigger hit. I guess, as you look at sort of what -- to provide a little more visibility to sort of the adjusted guidance, I mean, really, there's sort of probably 3 buckets in aggregate that sort of changes from when we last looked at it and it's currency, it's the Broadcast business and the content piece John touched on and they're probably all about equal. I mean, it's sort of -- probably the better part of -- and I'll use round numbers, about probably $100 million in each. So I think we talked about the currency being $100 million, I think broadcast. Again, the content which is a combination of Shine being clearly a significant event and then to a lesser extent, the Christmas releases that didn't pan out. In the broadcast piece, it's sort of -- it's -- probably our biggest rating we already took. In the first quarter, we knew our ratings were short. And to a large degree, our content upside offset the rating's shortfalls. Probably ratings are a little bit worse, but -- than our expectations in the quarter. But that sort of $100 million is probably a bit of ratings. Sports, as John touched on, was a little soft. I mean, our 2 big conference championship games were blowouts, the next -- our 2 biggest regular season games, I mean, John gave you the average. Clearly, all did not pan out. The NFL was a touch behind in our big 4 o'clock games in the last quarter. So that was -- the $100 million is up a little bit. And clearly, the station market, we were expecting sort of, and I think we talked about it going into the year, a low single. We weren't expecting much, but we were sort of expecting a low single-digit 1% to 2% market growth and probably it looks like now a low to mid decline -- no, low mid decline percentage. We do $1 billion in 6 months in that business, so if you got a 5% swing, it's $50 million. So if you had to broadcast pieces up and say it's $50 million in stations and $20 million to $25 million in the sports, the biggest piece being college -- the college games. And another piece on the ratings on top of what really was largely we anticipated in the September quarter, those sort of give you the pieces and the offset we've had in content went the other way, with Shine being pulled out and a couple of Christmas pictures not being what we thought they'd be."

And the issues we're facing today, we feel very excited by it. I do mean to look -- I think we have a breadth of content that enables us to navigate this space. You talked about Netflix. I think, from the get-go, our approach to the SVOD space, Netflix in particular, specifically the SVOD space in general, has been to be disciplined about it, to make sure we participate in that business, adhering to sort of rules that first and foremost defend the value, enable us to continue to grow our core businesses, which is the networks, and make sure we're enlarging our overall pie and not cannibalizing our core businesses in an adverse way to the extent of short-term dollars. So we have been disciplined in terms of which we do it. In reality, our recent SVOD deals have been actually with Amazon and Hulu Plus. So I think that's a positive that you've got a more competitive marketplace than you've had there. But we will and will continue to ensure that we're not going to take actions that would prioritize short-term profits from a sale at the expense of the health of our long-term businesses. And I think, we've been true to that to date in these things and we will continue to ensure that we grow our overall business, and that's certainly the -- a rule we'll -- a principle we'll stay true to as we develop the opportunities in the digital platforms. We think there are real opportunities to develop ways to offer our products in new and exciting ways and we have to figure out what are the right models for those, we're doing a lot of work on that. We're obviously engaging with some third-parties. We did announce we concluded a deal with Sony. We're talking to others. But in all these cases, we're going to ensure we do things that enables us to grow our overall business, not cannibalize it. And we think we have the franchises and the content that puts us in a leadership position to be must-have content with essentially not  everybody made, somebody can create a package that doesn't have our content in, but I think our content at its core is content that really is central to the video business. And we are confident in our ability to navigate that and to ensure an exciting future for us."

The right question is what are you making? How do you make it great? How do you stand out? And can you be a place that can attract the great show runners, the great writers, the great talent to come and do incredible work? And I think, we're very, very confident that, creatively, the teams across 21st Century Fox companies can continue to execute. They've been executing very well. But it's not really a question of a volume game, it's a question of how do you make stuff that's genuinely distinctive in that environment where you have so much consumer choice. And I think, the thing that exacerbates the competitive kind of dynamic around it is that with the availability of streaming platforms and the availability of vast libraries of scripted programming, you're really competing with not just what's on in the same hour but you're competing with everything that's come before. And that's something that is a great creative challenge but one that we feel is our core business to try to rise to and to try to get great people to do that."

Look, we have -- we are certainly changing how we're approaching the ad market. I mean, as I touched on, we have restructured our entire ad sales organization. And in many ways, the primary reason for doing that was to position us to deal with the world going forward. I mean, there were some costs that came out but the objective, that's the secondary consideration that those were just efficiency moves. Our objective in reorganizing and restructuring the ad sales organization was to position us to deal with the world we expect to be competing in, which, again, has this -- has viewership moving to other places and advertisers, not surprisingly, wanting a lot of the attributes of efficiency and effectiveness that come with additional platforms. We have to make sure we're positioned to take advantage of that. So I think, that's the priority. I'm not sure if in terms of we'll be doing it starting today, not even the upfront, so the upfront is part of that process. But certainly, the way we're approaching the entire ad market is in a state of transition. I will say, in the digital, a lot of money -- clearly, there's a lot of desire there. I think, 1 of the things we hope to do and I think our content, because it's so important it can help is still unclear to what degree our advertisers are getting value out of the digital marketplace. In many ways, that may be what is R&D spending which probably has a logic to it. But I think, it's unclear, in many places, are they getting value for that spending? Or are they chasing sort of goals in terms of attributes without knowing whether they're getting the value for it? So I think, I hope we can add a dimension that sort of enables them to ensure by having content that really is big as a sweet spot, that we're able to really deliver on the value that gets associated with those digital platforms."

91031,281624853,755047,"Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2015",2015-02-04,"Earnings Calls","TFCF Corporation","Executives","All right. Thanks, Reed. As you will have seen in today's earnings release, we reported another good quarter of financial results led by double-digit revenue and EBITDA growth at our Cable Networks. Note that due to the sale in November of our DBS busines",1518,"All right. Thanks, Reed. As you will have seen in today's earnings release, we reported another good quarter of financial results led by double-digit revenue and EBITDA growth at our Cable Networks. Note that due to the sale in November of our DBS businesses to Sky, our reported financial results include the consolidation of these businesses this year for our partial quarter of ownership as compared to a full quarter consolidation a year ago. So to provide a more meaningful comparative analysis, we're providing total company adjusted revenue and adjusted EBITDA that excludes the DBS businesses in all periods. Most of the comments that follow will be on this adjusted basis, and their press release provides the reconciliations between the reported results on this adjusted basis.
So second quarter adjusted total company revenues were $7.4 billion, up 10% compared to the second quarter a year ago, reflecting double digit increases in our Cable Network and Film segments. 
Adjusted total segment EBITDA for the second quarter was $1.7 billion, up 12% over the $1.51 billion from a year ago. This increase reflects strong results of the Cable Network segment, improvements led by costs at the Television segment and similar film contributions to a year ago. Note that unfavorable foreign currency movements reduced our overall total EBITDA growth rate in the quarter by 6 percentage points.
From a bottom line perspective, we reported income from continuing operations attributable to stockholders of $6.2 billion as compared to the $982 million we reported in the second quarter a year ago. This year's results include $5 billion of gains reported in Other net, which was principally from the company's sale of the DBS businesses to Sky. Also included in this year's equity earnings of affiliate results is net after-tax income of approximately $100 million related to Sky's gains on the sales of certain of its investments, partially offset by their purchase price amortization and expenses related to their acquisition of Sky Italia and Sky Deutschland.
Excluding net income effect of these net equity gains and last year's gain from participating in Sky's share repurchase program as well as the amounts reflected in Other net, second quarter adjusted earnings per share was $0.53 this year versus $0.33 in the prior year. This quarter's adjusted earnings per share includes the recognition of various tax benefits of approximately $250 million or $0.12 per share. For the remainder of the fiscal year, we expect our tax rate to approximate 31%. Also note that the net income and EPS contributions of the DBS segment in each year were not significant.
Now let me provide some additional context at the performance -- on the performance of a few of our businesses, and let's start with the Cable Network segment, where overall total segment revenues increased 14% from last year, highlighted by a 16% increase in affiliate revenues and 8% advertising revenue growth.
With respect to affiliate revenues, domestic affiliate fees increased 19%, primarily from higher average rates led by the RSNs, FX and FOX News, as well as increases from the conversion of our new channels, FS1 and FXX. The inclusion of the YES Network this year also contributed to our growth, and excluding the contribution from YES, we had a low double digit domestic affiliate fee increase. Our reported international affiliate fees were up 7%, reflecting strong underlying local currency growth of about 20%.
The second quarter Cable segment advertising revenue growth of 8% reflects domestic advertising increases of 11%, led by the FX Networks, FS1 and FXX. Reported international advertising grew 5%, but we had 10% growth on a local currency basis driven by strong year-over-year increases at STAR.
Total cable segment EBITDA in the second quarter of $1.16 billion was up 12% over the prior year, reflecting the strong revenue growth, which was partially offset by a planned 16% increase in expenses, primarily related to higher sports rights and entertainment programming costs. The negative impact from the strengthening U.S. dollar impacted the segment growth rate by 6%.
EBITDA at our domestic channels increased 13% from higher contributions at our established networks as well as the impact of consolidating the YES Network this year.
EBITDA at Fox Sports 1 was below last year, reflecting the planned increased programming costs associated with the inaugural broadcast of the Major League Baseball playoffs.
Reported international channel EBITDA contributions increased 8% as strong double digit local currency growth at both FIC and the STAR entertainment channels was partially offset by the continued investment we're making in STAR Sports and the negative impact from foreign exchange rates.
At our Television segment, second quarter EBITDA was $290 million, an increase of $72 million as compared to the prior-year result. This higher contribution is primarily due to lower programming costs reflecting the absence of X Factor this year, the movement of Glee into the March quarter and the shift of the baseball League Championship Series to Fox Sports 1. Total segment revenues were consistent with the year ago quarter as strong retransmission consent revenue growth was offset by a 3% decline in advertising revenues. This ad revenue decline is primarily due to lower general entertainment ratings at the broadcast network and stations, offset in part by higher local political ad revenues related to the midterm elections.
Turning to our Film segment. We reported second quarter EBITDA of $336 million, a similar result to that of a year ago, as higher film studio contributions were offset by fewer television series deliveries. Total segment revenues in the quarter increased $276 million or 11%, driven by several successful theatrical releases, including Gone Girl and The Maze Runner. The majority of these higher theatrical revenues were offset by increased releasing cost for both these films as well as Exodus and Night at the Museum 3.
Now before I turn to guidance, let me make a couple of capital-related comments. We ended the quarter with $10.1 billion in cash and $19.1 billion in gross debt, and the cash position reflects the net proceeds from the sale of Sky Italia and Sky Deutschland during the quarter.
With regard to the stock buyback, we repurchased approximately $2.9 billion of FOXA shares from July 1 through today, and we're on plan to complete the $6 billion buyback within the 12-month timeframe we previously announced.
And today, the company increased its dividend and declared a semiannual dividend of $0.15 per share. This translates to a $0.30 dividend on an annual basis, a 20% increase over the previous dividend payout.
Now let me address our guidance update for fiscal 2015. As a reminder, for guidance purposes, we are excluding the DBS businesses for the entirety of all periods, resulting in a base EBITDA for fiscal 2014 of $6.29 billion.
On last quarter's earnings call, we mentioned that we had seen some puts and takes as against our original expectations for fiscal 2015, with the negative variances at that time primarily relating to the strengthening dollar and underperformance at the broadcast network as against our original expectations. Since that update, these trends have continued and at levels above what we expected.
Over the last 3 months, the U.S. dollar has appreciated significantly, further reducing the translated U.S. dollar earnings from our international businesses, most notably from the FOX International Channels. Assuming exchange rates stay where they are today, the strengthened dollar has now further reduced our fiscal 2015 EBITDA expectations by an additional $100 million plus, resulting in a total full year effect across the company of around $250 million versus last year.
At our Television Broadcast business, the network and the stations, we now know that market and rating challenges were more significant than we expected. 
On the entertainment side, Empire and American Idol are doing well competitively, but our ratings overall have underperformed and our expectation that the national and local ad markets would gain momentum going into calendar 2015 has not occurred. 
On the sports side, our biggest college football games in the quarter were all lopsided wins, with an average score of 52 to 10, thereby impacting the viewership.
At our Film segment, we continue to anticipate that the full year contributions will exceed our original expectations, but now by a lesser amount than we thought 3 months ago, primarily reflecting lower-than-anticipated box office results from our holiday releases, as well as closing on the transfer of our Shine business to the Endemol joint venture earlier than we expected. This will result in the elimination of Shine's EBITDA contributions for the rest of the year as it moves through our Equity Affiliate line.
Despite our change in expectations around currencies, broadcast TV and our Film segment, our domestic cable network businesses continue to perform right in line with our expectations.
So considering these factors and based on all of the assumptions inherent in our current projections, we now expect that our total segment EBITDA percentage growth rate for fiscal 2015 will be toward the lower end of the mid-single-digit range, above the $6.29 billion total segment EBITDA base level for fiscal 2014.
With that, let me turn it over to Chase."

There isn't a lot to add to what John said about the currency issues. We are practical, we are addressing hedging strategies to help manage the risk, but hedging will only mitigate further fluctuations, not the currency impact to date.
On the broadcast side, network and stations, the issue is primarily entertainment rating shortfalls at our network, exacerbated by adverse industry trends and linear network ratings in the Television advertising markets, which, combined, leave our expected ad revenues well short of plan.
Looking forward to 2016, we expect these same themes to continue. The majority of our businesses are strong and on track, however, currency moves this year will adversely impact 2016 profits by about $200 million, which is on top of the approximately $250 million hit to expected 2016 profits from currency shifts last year, a total hit of about $450 million to our original 2016 projection in August 2013.
We also expect the next 12 months to be a period of investment in new programming at our broadcast network. In addition, we anticipate the industry trends impacting advertising will be slightly larger than previously expected, as both advertising and viewership continues to migrate to digital platforms.
Our original target for 2016 profits was $9 billion, which, adjusted for the deconsolidation of the Skys and Shine, would be about $8 billion. Clearly, our Broadcast business is not where we expected it to be at this time, and external market forces like currency have been more unfavorable than expected. While we still expect solid double-digit growth overall next year due to the strength of most of our businesses, the challenges in currency and broadcasting now lead us to an expected 2016 profit in the mid-$7 billion range.
We're obviously disappointed to fall short of our targets for this year and next. We take these targets seriously. However, our overall goal is not to hit a short-term profit target but to build shareholder value, which will be determined by the overall momentum and competitive strengths of our businesses and how well they're positioned to grow and succeed in light of broader economic technological and global trends. If our goal was to hit a short-term profit target, we'd pursue efforts like cutting marketing and programming cost at the expense of future profits. We'll not do that because we believe shareholder value is built through long-term growth.
In terms of that overall goal, we could not be more excited about the future. First, as noted earlier, most of our businesses and key initiatives are on target and competitively as strong as ever. Affiliate revenues and retransmission fees, which are the foundation for future growth, are on or ahead of our plans. Among key initiatives, we begun to once again reset the FOX News rate to reflect its importance in the market with new agreements now in place, with 4 MVPDs that represent over 1/4 of the market, and Fox Sports 1 now has affiliation agreements in place with all major MVPDs that reflect the new FS1 rate.
Our domestic and international cable channels grew to represent about 70% of our profit, are on track on a local currency basis, as with the new channel initiatives launched in the last few years. 
Our new sports and entertainment channels continue to build in their leadership position with truly unique and focused brands around the world. For example, FX has really left competing basic cable networks behind with programming that makes it appear to premium networks, while FXX is at an exciting new dimension to that group as the fastest-growing network in cable.
Our Film and Television businesses have great momentum and continue to distinguish themselves as industry leaders. Our Film business finished calendar 2014 with record-breaking worldwide box office. We've locked up key sports content around the world through the rest of this decade to assure us access to this critical content and provide cost stability.
Even in the earlier noted areas where we faced challenges, we're excited about the future. At our Broadcast business, our issues have been ones of execution, not structure. The foundation is in place with retransmission revenues ahead of plan with significant room to grow and our major sports rights are in place under long-term contracts.
Our challenge has been the networks' entertainment programming. After a few tough years, we believe we've turned the corner with a new network management team who inherited our current broadcast issues that has brought fresh momentum and energy to the business. It's always a tough business to predict, but we are excited about new hits like Empire and Gotham, as well as the dynamic slate of new event programming. Our competitors have already shown what a difference a couple of hits can make.
It will take us time to get the Broadcast business to where it should be in terms of profitability. The next year plus will be a period of investment, with the priority focused on building hit shows, not maximizing profits. The profits will follow. We still believe our Broadcast business has a strategic and financial future that is as promising as ever. The time when the value of hit programming continues to grow exponentially, our broadcast network plays a unique role in launching defining events like Empire.
Turning to the broader industry issues. The digital transition continues to be a glass half full story for us. The movement of advertising dollars and shift to our consumer viewing is clearly going to continue. I think it is fair to say that this trend recently has been a bit faster than many expected. These issues will put short-term pressure on our business but represent longer-term exciting growth opportunities as we're able to deliver more efficient and effective capabilities to advertisers, better monetize viewership on digital platforms and create new offers consumers -- for consumers on these platforms. Our content and brands are the ones consumers and advertisers want to access to first and foremost, and we're committed to building the capabilities to meet that demand.
Recent initiatives like the restructuring of our ad sales organization and the acquisition of trueX are focused on that goal.
In closing, let me touch on return of capital on our balance sheet. We're well-aware that the recent completion of the Sky transaction once again has our balance sheet at an overly liquid position. We will complete our $6 billion buyback as planned, although that will still leave us with excess liquidity. Between now and fiscal year end, our board will continue to consider next steps. Our priorities for capital remain the same: Invest in our core businesses to grow long-term value; opportunistic flexibility; and return of capital to shareholders. We continue to pursue our goal of achieving an efficient balance sheet, but we'll do so in a deliberate manner. Quite simply, our goal continues to be building shareholder value by growing our businesses while returning capital to shareholders, and we believe we're on track to achieve that goal. Thank you. And I'll turn it back to Reed."

Help us think about the opportunity there, particularly in light of some of the non-rupee denominated cost you have on the sports side. And a similar question, maybe, Chase, on FOX network, it sounds like you're planning to sort of double down, I don't know if that's the right phrase, but invest more in content [ph] entertainment and push the programming. Can you give us some color on sort of how big you want to go and what we should be thinking about in terms of programming cost growth at FOX over the next couple of years?"

I think, the last time, when we talked about sort of the profit or the pathway for the Indian business, actually, since then, the currency has been reasonably stable over the last sort of 7 or I guess 9 months now. So I don't think that's had an additional impact going forward from what we saw then. But essentially, the STAR entertainment business, the local language business and the regional language business there is a very profitable business today, a very attractive business. And really, we're reinvesting a lot of those profits to build the sports business alongside that, which we think can really have a transformational effect on the business since the acquisition of the half interest of ESPN STAR Sports that we didn't own previously. And I think, what we're seeing now is really the peak year of investment. In fact, these coming quarters, with the Cricket World Cup and a series of events, really making that a heavy investment right now. But we see that turning reasonably quickly, and we have pretty good certainty on what those rights costs look like for the STAR Sports business. We're launching 2 new sports channels, 2 HD channels, actually, just in the next month, to continue to grow the portfolio. And we think, over a 5-year basis, this business at STAR in India is a very, very profitable business. We think it can get to north of -- I've said in the past, certainly north of $500 million in profit, and do it with some pace and some velocity. And I think, investing in programming and investing on screen for our customers is a theme that you'll see everywhere around the business. We really think that's the business that we're in and something that is super important for us and is going to deliver a lot of long-term growth domestically here as well as around the world."

And I think, our priority is really building hits, first and foremost. And I guess, that's why I made the comment. If we want to just improve profits, we'd squeeze programming and squeeze marketing and we don't think that's the right move. So I don't think it's, in many ways -- I think it is making sure we've got a bench of programming as we try and develop these hits. I think, this year, we felt we were a little thin in terms of having programming available. I think, we always know not every show is going to work and we got to make sure we have appropriate flexibility to build. But I think, what we're really talking about is stabilizing the Broadcast business and providing a platform to grow. But I think that real growth comes in the next couple of years, not the next 12 months. So I think the next year will be a period more of stabilizing that business and putting it on a path to growth. But I think I'm talking more priorities. And I think, to the degree, it's spending in reality, some of our more expensive programming, something like Glee, is ending its run. So obviously, there are some costs that will go away, will not recur, as we invest in new shows. But I think, if you say what's the investment, it's probably having a bit more flexibility and a bit more the bench of programming to launch next year to enable us to have a few more shots at creating the hits that are the foundation for the future. Obviously, Empire and Gotham give us some exciting building blocks to grow off of, but it's not a significant increase in cost. Again, I'm probably speaking more to what we think is the priority for the coming year."

Look, I think, these digital platforms are obviously a very important part of our future. We're spending a lot of time sort of trying to engage with third-parties, doing our own analysis on what makes sense for us. In terms of developing them, I'm not going to comment on any one particular offer. And we don't -- certainly, we don't have announcements today. We are working on a lot of things. I think we'll announce something when essentially we're ready to do it. I expect this to be an area where we are busy and do move forward, but we're not going to rush that, sort of to make press releases. I think, what's most important, and I'm not sure I've seen it to date, is there are offers that sort of resonate with the consumer. I mean, I think, a lot of what's been out there so far seems to be, whether it's driven by transactions or deals or something or other considerations, I think we want to see, can we bring things that are additive to our business. And I think, at the start, we have to make sure what we do in this space, as we do in other places, is additive to our business, but brings new opportunities and interesting experiences to consumers. And whether that's through a richer experience, a better interface, more choice. Again, I think, what we offer consumers today in many ways is a pretty attractive proposition. But clearly, there's segments we're not reaching in the right way and there are opportunities for us to expand and grow that pie. And we are going to be active there. But we're going to be thoughtful about it as well and make sure it's done in a way that is additive to our business as a whole as we go forward. And on TCFTV, I think, it's an important part, one of the core strategic reasons for putting it together is increasingly -- I think, it's -- we're not alone in this. A lot of the upside of what a network represents in terms of launching programming is realized on the products, on the content side of it. So the real win-win for us is to launch content that we own. It doesn't mean we're not going to have third-party content on our network, we will, because, realistically, we want to have the best content possible, and it doesn't mean we're not going to sell content to third-party networks, we will do that as well. But clearly, the sweet spot is using our network to be able to create assets that we own. And I think, by putting them together under one roof, we think, we certainly create -- it makes those opportunities more available to us and certainly, I think, streamline that decision-making, make the ability to identify needs and ensure we're doing everything possible to maximize the opportunities to launch a hit show is done by having the studio and the network work together. But it is one of the core benefits that we look to in putting the studio and the network under Gary and Dana's leadership."

I mean, in all -- and that's -- obviously, it certainly applies to some of the newer initiatives like FS1 or sports internationally, but I cited, I think, upfront, talked about FOX News, which I think just gets stronger and we are once again resetting that business. FOX business, I think, we're just really moving to now to really full competitive distribution. So when I look at our portfolio of channels, both the established ones and the newer ones, I think, there's lot of growth in international marketplace. Clearly, as you look at it around the world, has got -- is certainly somewhere -- midstream, in terms of reaching any -- reaching its full potential, varies by region, but there's an enormous amount of growth. We talked before about India, where that is in terms of what we think that business can be as we move through this decade. Ultimately, I really mean what I said when I talked about the digital platforms and us taking advantage of those, both directly and through other parties. I think, for those who have -- we really believe must-have content is going to be a sweet spot in a digital world. People -- it's the content people are going to want to watch, we refer to the RSNs. The reality ends up being sports come at a cost but they're also the product that's most in demand. And I think, hit product is just going to grow exponentially in value and importance. And I think, those that have the heavy breadth of hit unique content will be ideally positioned to take advantage of all these platforms and create new offers and new propositions for consumers and opportunities to engage more directly with consumers in terms of developing those offers, monetizing the viewership, developing databases and the like. So I think, in many ways, I think, it will -- it'll obviously put short-term pressure because the pressure short-term will not -- it will take time to build the vehicles that replace the short-term pressures. But as we go forward, I think, it's an area of tremendous growth for us. I mean, I think, those who have -- and again, get unique content brands at scale, have -- are really in the sweet spot to take advantage of these things. So I think, our core businesses have a lot of growth left here and overseas in their traditional models, not that some of those -- the models aren't maturing, but our business is clearly, when we look at what we're doing with FOX News, look at where we are with retransmission rates and the potential there, we think the value of our content holds up. Yes, you'll still -- certainly, as we said, I think that the cable bundle really is pretty much in line with our expectations. I've said before, probably spring. But I think, it's got real legs to it and still is going to be a cornerstone for a long time. But as we go forward, these digital platforms really open up a whole new dimension in growth on top of the opportunities we have within the traditional model."

I think, it's fair to say that we're pretty happy with the mix that we have around the place. It's a -- we've completed a number of transactions over the last number of years from the acquisition of the Asianet business and local regional languages in India, which really gave us a new dimension to that business through the acquisition of our partner stakes in ESPN, STAR Sports and Fox Pan-American Sports and so on. And I think, we'll continue to look at acquisitions where we can simplify our business, where we can really add a dimension and really add velocity and pace to the business. But we're not looking to fill a whole bunch of gaps, if you will. I think, we have a good position internationally. And to Chase's point before about long-term growth, I think it really is one of the drivers of our long-term growth when we look at our emerging markets position, particularly in India, in parts of Asia, in other parts of Asia. And in Latin America, we feel very, very strong about the position. That's not to say that we rule things out. We'll look opportunistically at a variety of things, as you would expect.

But also, it's something that we really think we can hopefully accelerate the rollout of new technology and some new ad products that we think are really at the forefront of thinking around how you monetize digital viewership, how you monetize time-ship to viewership. And as we seize the streaming share of time-ship to viewing continue to grow, vis-à-vis DVRs, really, you have to remember that we're really just in the very, very foothills of monetizing that viewership and that viewership is very, very large. It's a material percentage above what our live plus 3 or live plus 7 viewing is. So it's really about monetizing the streaming environments and being able to accelerate with new ad products for other clients, other broadcasters as well as for ourselves, but there'll be more on that going forward.

But clearly, you've got to be cognizant of what's going on in countries. And certainly, the currency issues we've had in a place like Argentina are a reflection of sort of broader economic issues. So I think, we'd always take broader economic issues, long-term broader economic issues into account in terms of evaluating where we were going to invest. Again, though I think, most of our investments, don't want to repeat it, would be in the form of building businesses, not making large international acquisitions."

Looking at the solidness of your subscriber revenue streams that showed itself in the first half, when you look at the back half of the year given the reduction in full year guidance, can you just give us a sense, you talked about the currency, but what type of domestic ad market are you looking at for broadcast networks, stations and cable? Could you just give us some color on just -- it sounds like those numbers obviously have to be down pretty substantially, at least for the broadcast stations and networks, but just some sense of order of magnitude? And will cable also feel that effect versus the strength you had this quarter? And then, just kind of a big picture question for, I don't know, for all of you. When you looked at the rationale for the Time Warner acquisition attempt over the summer, it seemed to us that a direct to consumer business, with all of the content the combined companies would have had versus selling your content to Netflix, was a huge potential benefit. As you look at kind of what's going on in advertising and you look at the kind of the strength that Netflix keeps growing, does it make it that much important to kind of revisit that transaction, work out some form of relationship with Time Warner, just because both of you could, both in this ad market, and the change in consumer, you both could use each other more than ever before?"

I mean, maybe just comment on the ad markets, I guess, because you cited that. What I'd say, sort of the ad markets, is we look at them today. Nationally, I guess, I'd say they're okay, probably not where we might have hoped. I think we came into this quarter hoping they'll be up probably a bit more of renewed budgets and the like, probably the quarter feels a little -- probably like the fourth quarter -- like the December quarter. Maybe some rays of light to give you a little hope the national market to be a little better. But I guess I'd say it's not as robust as we would've hoped in terms of a rebound, but it's okay. Upfront pricing is still a premium to the scat. The scatter pricing is a premium to the upfront pricing. So it's okay. I would say the local markets are probably softer than the national markets. I think the local markets, from a market perspective as we look at what our expectations are for this year, I think the local markets took up. The market factors had a bigger hit. I guess, as you look at sort of what -- to provide a little more visibility to sort of the adjusted guidance, I mean, really, there's sort of probably 3 buckets in aggregate that sort of changes from when we last looked at it and it's currency, it's the Broadcast business and the content piece John touched on and they're probably all about equal. I mean, it's sort of -- probably the better part of -- and I'll use round numbers, about probably $100 million in each. So I think we talked about the currency being $100 million, I think the broadcast. Again, the content which is a combination of Shine being clearly a significant event and then to a lesser extent, the Christmas releases that didn't pan out. In the broadcast piece, it's sort of -- it's -- probably our biggest rating hit we already took. In the first quarter, we knew our ratings were short. And to a large degree, our content upside offset the rating's shortfalls. Probably ratings are a little bit worse, but -- than our expectations in the quarter. But that sort of $100 million is probably a bit of ratings. Sports, as John touched on, was a little soft. I mean, our 2 big conference championship games were blowouts, the next -- our 2 biggest regular season games, I mean, John gave you the average. Clearly, all did not pan out. The NFL was a touch behind in our big 4:00 games in the last quarter. So that was up -- the $100 million is up a little bit. And clearly, the station market, we were expecting sort of, and I think we talked about it going into the year, a low single. We weren't expecting much, but we were sort of expecting a low single-digit 1% to 2% market growth and probably it looks like now a low to mid decline -- no, low mid decline percentage. We do $1 billion in 6 months in that business, so if you got a 5% swing, it's $50 million. So if you had to broadcast pieces up and say it's $50 million in stations and $20 million to $25 million in the sports, the biggest piece being college -- the college games. And another piece on the ratings on top of what really was largely we anticipated in the September quarter, those sort of give you the pieces and the offset we'd had in content went the other way, with Shine being pulled out and a couple of Christmas pictures not being what we thought they'd be."

And the issues we're facing today, we feel very excited by it. I do mean to look -- I think we have a breadth of content that enables us to navigate this space. You talked about Netflix. I think, from the get-go, our approach to the SVOD space, Netflix in particular, specifically the SVOD space in general, has been to be disciplined about it, to make sure we participate in that business, adhering to sort of rules that first and foremost defend the value, enable us to continue to grow our core businesses, which is the networks, and make sure we're enlarging our overall pie and not cannibalizing our core businesses in an adverse way to the extent of short-term dollars. So we have been disciplined in the terms of which we do it. In reality, our recent SVOD deals have been actually with Amazon and Hulu Plus. So we think that's a positive that you've got a more competitive marketplace than you've had there. But we will and will continue to ensure that we're not going to take actions that would prioritize short-term profits from a sale at the expense of the health of our long-term businesses. And I think, we've been true to that to date in these things and we will continue to ensure that we grow our overall business, and that's certainly the -- a rule we'll -- a principle we'll stay true to as we develop the opportunities in the digital platforms. We think there are real opportunities to develop ways to offer our products in new and exciting ways and we have to figure out what are the right models for those, we're doing a lot of work on that. We're obviously engaging with some third-parties. We did announce we concluded a deal with Sony. We're talking to others. But in all these cases, we're going to ensure we do things that enable us to grow our overall business, not cannibalize it. And we think we have the franchises and the content that puts us in a leadership position to be must-have content with essentially not  everybody made, somebody can create a package that doesn't have our content in, but I think our content at its core is content that really is central to the video business. And we are confident in our ability to navigate that and to ensure an exciting future for us."

I mean, I think, it's less driven by the SVOD services, and really just driven by cable network programmers getting into dramatic series production by and large, and increasing volumes, and the numbers are still going up. But I think, it's really important to remember that one hour of scripted television is very, very different from another hour of scripted television. So the total volume isn't really the question. The right question is what are you making? How do you make it great? How do you stand out? And can you be a place that can attract the great show runners, the great writers, the great talent to come and do incredible work? And I think, we're very, very confident that, creatively, the teams across 21st Century Fox companies can continue to execute. They've been executing very well. But it's not really a question of a volume game, it's a question of how do you make stuff that's genuinely distinctive in that environment where you have so much consumer choice. And I think, the thing that exacerbates the competitive kind of dynamic around it is that with the availability of streaming platforms and the availability of vast libraries of scripted programming, you're really competing with not just what's on in the same hour but you're competing with everything that's come before. And that's something that is a great creative challenge but one that we feel is our core business to try to rise to and to try to get great people to do that."

Look, we have -- we are certainly changing how we're approaching the ad market. I mean, as I touched on, we have restructured our entire ad sales organization. And in many ways, the primary reason for doing that was to position us to deal with the world going forward. I mean, there were some costs that came out but the objective, that's the secondary consideration that those were just efficiency moves. Our objective in reorganizing and restructuring the ad sales organization was to position us to deal with the world we expect to be competing in, which, again, has this -- has viewership moving to other places and advertisers, not surprisingly, wanting a lot of the attributes of efficiency and effectiveness that come with additional platforms. We have to make sure we're positioned to take advantage of that. So I think, that's the priority. I'm not sure if in terms of we'll be doing it starting today, not even the upfront, so the upfront is part of that process. But certainly, the way we're approaching the entire ad market is in a state of transition. I will say, in the digital, a lot of money -- clearly, there's a lot of desire there. I think, 1 of the things we hope to do and I think our content, because it's so important it can help is still unclear to what degree our advertisers are getting value out of the digital marketplace. In many ways, they may be what is R&D spending which probably has a logic to it. But I think, it's unclear, in many places, are they getting value for that spending? Or are they chasing sort of goals in terms of attributes without knowing whether they're getting the value for it? So I think, I hope we can add a dimension that sort of enables them to ensure by having content that really we think is a sweet spot, that we're able to really deliver on the value that gets associated with those digital platforms."

Before we get into the specific earnings commentary, just a reminder that because of the sale of our DBS businesses to Sky this past November, our reported financial results for the third quarter this year do not include the consolidation of these DBS businesses as compared to a full quarter consolidation a year ago. So similar to last quarter, to provide a more meaningful comparative analysis, we are providing total company adjusted revenue and adjusted EBITDA, which excludes the DBS businesses in all periods.
Now turning to the quarter results. Third quarter total company revenues were $6.8 billion, up $84 million compared to the year ago adjusted result, reflecting double-digit increases at our Cable Networks segment and mid-single-digit increases at Film. This growth was mostly offset by lower Television segment revenues where the prior-year results included approximately $350 million in revenues from the broadcast of the Super Bowl.
Total segment EBITDA for the third quarter was $1.68 billion, a 3% reduction versus the adjusted EBITDA from a year ago of $1.73 billion. This year's result reflects continued strong underlying Cable Network segment contributions and higher Film segment contributions. These increases were more than offset by reduced Television segment results, reflecting last year's Super Bowl broadcast as well as this year's impact of the investments in our new sports channels in India. Additionally, this quarter reflected the most unfavorable year-on-year comparisons so far of foreign exchange rates. And as a result, our overall total EBITDA growth rate was reduced by approximately 7 percentage points in the quarter.
From a bottom-line perspective, on a GAAP basis, we reported income from continuing operations attributable to stockholders of $990 million as compared to the $1.07 billion we reported a year ago. Equity earnings were $160 million higher than a year ago, primarily reflecting this year's inclusion of our share of Sky's gain on the sale of Sky bet. Excluding the net income effects of Other net, as well as certain adjustments to equity earnings, including eliminating the gain on the Sky bet sale and eliminating last year's gain from participating in Sky share repurchase program, third quarter adjusted earnings per share were $0.42 this year versus $0.47 in the prior year.
Now let me provide some comments on the performance at our businesses. Let's start with the Cable Networks, where our total segment revenues increased 14% from last year, highlighted by a 15% increase in affiliate revenues and 9% advertising revenue growth.
With respect to affiliate revenues, domestic affiliate fees increased 20%, primarily from higher average rates led by the RSNs, FX and FOX News, as well as increases from the conversion of our new channels, FS1 and FXX. The inclusion of the YES Network for the full quarter this year also contributed to our growth. Excluding the contribution from YES, we had a mid-teens domestic affiliate fee increase.
Our reported international affiliate fees were up 2%, reflecting an underlying mid-teens local currency growth rate, which was mostly offset by unfavorable foreign exchange movements, particularly in Latin America and in Europe.
The 9% total cable ad revenue growth from the quarter was led by our international channels, where reported international advertising grew 24%, reflecting 29% growth on a local currency basis. This growth was primarily driven by increases at STAR from this year's broadcast of the ICC World Cup.
The third quarter domestic advertising revenues were at similar levels to a year ago, with increases of the sports networks, FOX News and FXX, essentially being offset by lower ad revenues at FX and in National Geographic Channel due to lower ratings.
Total Cable segment EBITDA in the third quarter of $1.23 billion was up 5% over the prior year, reflecting the solid revenue growth, which was partially offset by a planned 19% increase in expenses, primarily related to higher sports rights and entertainment programming costs. Around 60% of the increase in expenses came from STAR Sports, most notably, the cost of the Cricket World Cup rights. The negative comparative effect from the strengthening U.S. dollar impacted the segment growth rate by around 5%. EBITDA at our domestic cable channels increased 21% from higher contributions at FOX News and from our sports channels, including the impact of consolidating the YES Network for the full quarter. This EBITDA growth was partially offset by lower contributions from the FX Networks due to increased programming costs.
At the international channels, despite local currency growth at FIC, our reported international channel EBITDA contributions declined 60%, driven by both the sizable planned Cricket investment we made at STAR Sports as well as the overall negative impact from foreign exchange rates, especially from Latin America.
At our Television segment, third quarter EBITDA was $141 million, roughly half the contribution generated in the third quarter a year ago. This decline principally reflects the absence of the revenue and earnings from the Super Bowl broadcast in the prior year, as well as higher entertainment programming costs this year from a higher volume of original series, including Glee and Empire. Excluding last year's Super Bowl, segment revenues were consistent with the year-ago quarter as strong retransmission consent revenue growth was offset by a 7% decline in ad revenues due to lower general entertainment ratings at the Broadcast network.
Turning to our Film segment. We reported third quarter EBITDA of $382 million, an 8% increase over year ago results as higher film studio contributions more than offset lower Television production results and the unfavorable impacts of foreign currency. Total segment revenues in the quarter increased $110 million or 5%, driven by several successful theatrical releases, including Kings Men and Taken 3, as well as home entertainment revenues from Rio 2 and The Fault in Our Stars.
The reduced contributions from Television production are largely due to lower SVOD revenues this year reflecting last year's multiseries sale to Amazon, which included 24 and The Americans.
Now before I turn to guidance, let me make a couple of capital-related comments. We ended the quarter with $9.3 billion in cash and $19.1 billion in gross debt. These balances reflect strong cash generation from operating activities in the quarter alone of approximately $1.8 billion and share repurchases in the quarter of $2.1 billion.
Subsequent to the quarter, we've continued to actively repurchase shares. From July 1 through today, we've repurchased approximately $5.25 billion of FOXA shares and we have approximately $1.25 billion remaining on our current authorization. So we're on plan to complete the $6 billion buyback within the 12-month timeframe that we previously announced.
Now let me address our guidance update for fiscal 2015. And as a reminder, for guidance purposes, we are excluding the DBS businesses for the entirety of all periods, resulting in a base EBITDA for fiscal 2014 of $6.29 billion.
On our last quarters earnings call, we indicated that the strengthening dollar would have an adverse impact on our EBITDA growth for the year based on exchange rates at that time. Since that call, the dollar, on average, has continued to strengthen although in recent days, it's begun to weaken against certain currencies. So this volatility makes it difficult to forecast with precision the impact on our results, but we estimate that foreign exchange rates could have up to an incremental 1 percentage point negative impact on our growth rate. Absent this potential impact, we are maintaining our guidance for our total segment EBITDA percentage growth rate for fiscal 2015 to be at the lower end of the mid-single-digit range above the $6.29 billion total segment EBITDA base level for fiscal 2014.
With that, let me turn it over to Chase."

Our results continue to be driven by competitive strength at our Cable Networks, strong affiliate fee growth and leadership in our content businesses, while we face headwinds due to both foreign currency and the turnaround efforts at our Broadcast business. Our third quarter results were further impacted by the absence of the Super Bowl this year and significant investments at STAR Sports in India, particularly the Cricket World Cup.
We will address our guidance for the next fiscal year on our year end call in August. Therefore, I want to use the next few minutes address some specific issues.
As I noted a minute ago, we continue to have strong underlying growth at our cable channels driven by higher affiliate fees. We also continue to close agreements that meet or exceed our expectations for new and existing agreements. At the same time, there's increasing noise in the market about new over-the-top offers, skinny bundles and other new options for consumers to access content. It is important to provide a bit of insight when considering these issues.
First, we believe the current pay-TV ecosystem is strong and the consumers continue to value choice and breadth and content. While we're seeing a small decline in pay-TV subs, we believe the vast majority of customers will continue to want a bundle of channels that is priced appropriately as opposed to a limited number of premium priced channels.
Second, our existing carriage agreements are carefully constructed, not only provide us with a fair value for our content, but also specify the terms in which our channels are packaged and distributed. Many agreements provide limited flexibility for customer retention or experimentation with alternative packages. Any plans to distribute our package or channels in other ways would require a significantly different pricing structure. Even with this, we do expect there'd be more choices for consumers. This means more competition for our content. It also provides us opportunities to expand our business by providing consumers a better experience and connecting with customers we may not reach today. Not everyone will benefit from these changes. We continue to believe that content will be the ultimate beneficiary of the growth of digital platforms and, that within the content world, those with must-have brands and content at scale will be the true winners. As both existing MVPDs and new entrants try to construct new consumer offers, those with broad hit content and unique brands will be best positioned to come out on top. We believe we are uniquely positioned to be such a winner.
In the U.S. and, increasingly, internationally, we built our business around 5 key brands: Fox Sports, FOX News, FX, National Geographic and FOX, each of which is a market leader with unique strengths. At FOX sports, we've locked up key local national and international rights well into the next decade. Our Regional Sports Networks add a critical dimension to our sports business that truly distinguishes us. The sheer popularity of the RSNs have made that business a pillar of strength second to none for us. We've used our scale, experience and broad affiliate agreements to enable us to continue to grow these businesses.
FOX News and FX have also established themselves as true industry leaders. FOX News is as dominant as ever, leading CNN, MSNBC and HLN combined in primetime viewers. At the FX Network, the quality, breadth and distinctiveness in the programming really make it a premium channel residing in the basic cable space. Additionally, our FXX channel has essentially doubled its viewership from a year ago. National Geographic is one of the most recognized brands in the world. While the channel is still a work in progress, we believe we haven't come close to tapping its true potential.
The FOX Network is clearly on a turnaround in the entertainment side. Nonetheless, it continues to be a driving force with enormous upside. The sports side of the network has been further strengthened this year by adding the FIFA World Cup and U.S. Open Golf to our portfolio of NFL, MLB and NASCAR events. 
On the entertainment side, this season's Gotham and, more recently, Empire, give us momentum as we head into next week's upfront and Dana Walden and Gary Newman are given the business a fresh energy and excitement. We are not the first broadcast network to fight through a turnaround, and we're confident we are on our way.
The breadth and strength of our brands and content are also going to be critical as we navigate the changes to the advertising side of our business. Our product has never seen such demand. However, we don't yet have the ability to effectively monetize the growing viewership. We also need to realize the consumers in the digital world are not going to be captivate viewers that will sit through 16 minutes of ads an hour. Advertising will have to be more effective and engaging to justify a premium. We'll need to work more closely with advertisers to connect with consumers in ways they value and enjoy. 
Both the recent reorganization of our channels ad sales group and our true x acquisition are steps in this direction.
There'll be short-term challenges such as those we're experiencing today in the advertising side of our business which can create pressure as we work to develop new business models. However, for those that navigate this transition successfully, the media industry that emerges on the other side will be one with enormous growth potential and an incredibly exciting future. One of the keys to success will be the ability to be disciplined in the face of industry noise and to be willing to invest and build on positions of strength even in the face of uncertain times. This is a time to prioritize long-term gains over short-term pain. We need to resist the temptation to react the short-term disruptions that we can air long-term future. In many ways, it's a time to double down. We will also continue to invest aggressively in original content. Many have asked if the current level of original content adoption is sustainable. The obvious answer is that it is if we create the best content. We contend the winners in the content will be those with the management and infrastructure to maximize the value of that content. Our proven track record, management bench strength, deep roster of talent relationships, unique library and worldwide set of leading industry network industry-leading networks will enable us to monetize content second to none.
We also need to control a much wider set of rights to the content we distribute. Today's slicing and dicing rights are over. In order to create the best consumer experience and maximize the value of our content and networks, we need to have the flexibility to come to the broader set of rights. The best path to controlling own destinies is to create our own product. We will clearly continue to work with third parties, but the sweet spot is undoubtedly where we own and distribute our own content. Our leadership position in content gives us a big advantage in achieving that goal. In closing, we believe we are incredibly well-positioned and are confident that today's challenges represent real opportunities for the future. Thank you."

You could say the upfront we're about to go into while important is probably a bit of antiquated practice given where the world is heading. Advertisers want more flexibility. I think for us, I think it's increasingly important, that's why we restructured our group that we really work with advertisers to figure out how we create unique opportunities with unique messages that resonate. I think there's a degree more energy in it. But again, I think everybody's still trying to navigate this new space. There's no question everybody wants the attributes that are associated with the digital world. I think in some ways the promises ahead of the reality. And I think some of that reality has got to get fleshed out and people have to understand. We have to do a better job of prioritizing, monetizing that viewership. I mean, we've taken steps.

I think all those things will be a bigger factor than they've been in the past, but it's going to take time. Again, you're sort of in a lot of ways we haven't developed a lot of the capabilities, not just measurement but technology and other things to measuring effectiveness, capabilities, deliver on the promise of it. We're better than we were, but it's still really early days. So I think all those things would be a part of it. Certainly, all the trends, you're talking currency, we need to clearly C3 we said before, the answer in C7  in the answer they're all directionally the answer of starting to measure the viewership outside the linear network. We've got a long, long way to go to really monetize every viewership in every shape and form we can to work clearly with the reorganization to work with advertisers, to find ways. I think certainly, we will be much more looking across. I mean the purpose of putting our ad sales together was to sell across our platforms. So and in many ways, we're going to create unique relationships with advertisers. What we want to do is use you did make franchise we have across the breadth of them. That's how we create something that really takes advantage of our unique content and brands is to give an advertiser an ability to access customers across all our franchises and to develop then unique messages that resonate. Again, I think it's increasingly important we find ways to make advertising not an encumbrance to consumers but value-added part of the experience. That's part of what through to us it's an ability to make the advertising experience one that is more valued. And part of the value is making more relevant. But all those things have to be part of directionally where we're going. We're not going to get there in the next 2 months, but certainly we expect to make steps and in all honesty, we've made steps to date, but we have a long, long way to go."

We're just beginning our budget reviews now, I mean actually the first budget meeting is later this week, so we haven't even had the first one. And as you get close to do it, we got to get a handle on there will be things that affect the budgets, such as the ongoing strength of the dollar, we'll have visibility to that; updated views on the ad markets post the upfront specifics and our content release schedule; level of investments in content; all those things will come through. So I think we've historically, which is why we give the guidance sort of at year-end that we've gone through to get a handle on it and I think that's probably where we're going to stick with it. Scatter market, I mean the pricing's actually been pretty good. I mean I think probably the volume probably is not quite as strong as pricing. But pricing actually in the scatter market pretty good. I think in terms of currency, I'm not going to predict C3 versus C7. I think probably the second part of your question, it's probably more relevant, I mean it matters, but at the end of the day, I think neither one is the answer and there probably will be some dynamics of pricing factored what you put into it. What we need to do is make it a priority to monetize viewership, all the viewership that's occurring, which is why we neither needed C3 nor C7 is the answer. To some degree, the product has to have really almost sold in a different way, it has to be sold in a premium basis, I mean not just queuing up with what we're selling linearly. We need to worlds going to have, it's going to have different ad loads and going to have different advertising messages with different capabilities that hopefully should be much more attractive. And in some degree we have to move to figure out how we get paid for the premium value of the advertising that can exist in the marketplace going forward. And so things like C3 and C7 to me are small steps but they're not the answer. They're not irrelevant, so we do want to capture more of that viewership in the manner we can through at least reflecting the expanding viewership in all these digital platforms. But that's not the end goal. The end again goal is to figure out how do we get fairly compensated for the product that really is a product that everybody wants. At the end of the day, product that consumers and advertisers all want to deal with is our product. We need the ability we need to be able to build the capability to monetize the popularity of that viewership. And again, C7 is not an answer, it's a small step in the right direction. But just a small step."

I mean, I guess probably the investing comment that is going and it's not solely speaking to this, probably is a comment first and foremost about the FOX Network. I mean clearly the FOX Network, I mean you could we report segment, so it's not a secret. The FOX Network is not where we think it should be and where we plan for it to be. We think we've got some nice momentum with Empire and Gotham and a couple of things coming. We like the sports franchises we've added. We still look at FOX Network as a business that should be the shining light that it's at the top of the pyramid that drives our business forward. Clearly, it's not performed at such. It's taken its ratings declines in the last few years or not that we planned on. We're excited about new management team. We made the changes to drive that business and I think it's so I think certainly it's that in the case in point probably is the most is probably the clearest case in point is, I think thing, we think that's a great business. And we think we need to continue to have the backbone to invest to drive that business to what it can be as opposed to saying how do we sort of hit a profit target in the next year for the FOX Network as opposed to investing to enable it to get to the right place 3 years from now. So I think it's probably talking more about that type of investment. I think I guess the only other comment I'd make is, in general, you go back the Analyst Day, the world is fluid. I mean I think you've got to be opportunistic and you got to make judgments as you get to various places in time as what's the right decision, what's the competitive marketplace, what are the other industry dynamics that have occurred and how do you manage your business to build long-term value from what you know today. And certainly, today, and I'm not facts, it's not making any judgments about margins or anything else as opposed to, today, clearly, there have been -- I think there have been changes in the marketplace. Certainly, the impacts on ratings across Cable Networks have probably been larger than one would've expected a year ago, including me. I wouldn't have -- I think some of those shifts have been larger than would have anticipated, we saw the trends coming. And I think as the world evolves, you've got to adjust to it. And I think a lot of our businesses, things like investing in sports and FS1 is pretty much right on plan. The produce programming is still a work in progress and we are bringing in new executive, we announced in to be the point person for that. We knew creating programming takes time, some of its works, some of it hasn't. And we actually feel great about where it is and we're pretty much where we expect it to be. So I think in general, I think their business is clearly aren't where we expect it to be, the broadcast network. Obviously, the international channels have taken the competitively closer where we are, the financials aren't where we expect it to be because of the currency. But more broadly, I think we are continuing to adhere to things we talked about and -- but we're always I think we said it at the Analyst Day, I think you always want I think it's important that you continue to aggressively compete in the world as you know more as the world evolves. I think in terms of over-the-top, I think over-the-top is a very important part of our future. Now that being said, as I said in the prepared comments, we still think most consumers are going to want to bundle a programming. I don't think they want to buy à la carte, they want to buy a bundle of programming. We think there'd be more people, more players offering bundles of programming. I think those bundles have to be ones that are concocted with the consumer in mind, not something that is artificially concocted by the content owner and a distributor that doesn't really make sense, the alignment of what that content is doesn't make sense to a consumer. So you have to figure out. You're going if these over-the-top players are going to be what are they bringing in many ways certainly bringing a better consumer experience. I think in some ways, the Netflix and Hulus are sort of cases in point of a better value of a better consumer experience. I mean, and I think go in the flip side and say the struggle TV Everywhere have been an example of the challenge you have when you don't create the right consumer experience. So I think there can be over-the-top players that bring a new consumer experience that again, at its core, is still offering a bundle of programming and not exactly what's out there it's that if you want to make sure you must have valid that has to be in that bundle if you're creating a bundle that really resonates with that consumer and we do still think consumers want proactive choice that we've got the content that will be a central part in any of those over-the-top bundles but I think bringing obviously the competition is good but bringing a better, bringing better experiences to the marketplace. If people can develop better user interfaces, that's a positive. And I mean I always front DIRECTV when I was there, one of the reasons DIRECTV I think competed successfully against the cable industry was it was better experience. I think the easy-to-use and simplicity are probably some of the most underappreciated assets in the business. Actually we're excited about it. We've got probably amongst any of our peers have more firsthand experience in dealing directly with businesses internationally, that deal directly with consumers that create consumer interfaces and manage relationships with consumers so we think over-the-top for us specifically is an interesting opportunity. We think working with third parties to create more competition and new experiences is an important opportunity. We also think there are customers that again I think the predominant majority will want a bundle. I think there are consumers that probably are interested in alternatives, everybody talkies about the millennials. And I think the ability to create packages or offers that they speak to that generation is also an interesting opportunity. Obviously there are consumers we don't reach today and we want to be and additive way, I think it's important everything we do is adding to the pie, not cannibalizing the pie, create offers that speak to customers that want something different, we think that will be a relatively small minority but it's important for us to do and we look forward to developing all of that."

And FOX has a lot I think of relatively kind of average price must-have programming, not outside the mean, the broadcast network ONOs, news, general entertainment, even national sports. But we don't really know where the RSNs fit in and we don't have a lot of data to base them on, I guess outside of sling and Sony, if you can talk about that.

But I don't actually look at it, I think the RSNs represents great must-have content. And I think that it is as important as any content that exists in a local market for a large segment of consumers. Obviously, any piece of content is relevant to everybody but is content second to none. It is, and I think in some ways, I guess we judge its importance when we -- as we engage with our distributors in the marketplace. And it has continued to be a critical part of our business. It continues a critical pillar of driving our business forward. Obviously, some others have stumbled in it. I think we've proven a capability, sort of the L.A. and Houston points to we've proven a capability that we know how to manage, we know how to manage, I think our scale helps this and most of our agreements in place are long-term. I think over 80% of our agreements are into the 20s. And we know how to continue to renew them in terms that work I think we've renewed about 20% of our team deals in the last couple of years. So it's a business that and again we bring a lot of strength that would enable us to make these instances work and that others on a lot of bases obviously our established relationships with MVPDs are all part of that. So in many ways, I just look at it is some way we'd look at the other channels, the other channels we have and being one if not the most important drivers in the business.

It's really beat in part and parcel of how we approach the marketplace both in the United States and in other markets as we've invested in sports around the place. And to Chase's point, the result of the RSNs and the results in our sports businesses around the world are validating that more as opposed to less."

And it's done well. And even though the investment in cricket for example has been very heavy, the results have been tremendous and we've seen record viewership. We saw an incredible from an audience perspective some really incredible results and that's particularly in India of over 600 million viewers for the World Cup. And also that's a real platform to build new sports off of as well. So in the last year, investment not just in Cricket but in the body, in domestic professional football, soccer in India and the investment in sports across Asia and Latin America has been very, very effective both with our affiliates but also at advertisers and most importantly, for customers."

Before we get into the specific earnings commentary, just a reminder that because of the sale of our DBS businesses to Sky this past November, our reported financial results for the third quarter this year do not include the consolidation of",1267,"Thanks, Reed. Before we get into the specific earnings commentary, just a reminder that because of the sale of our DBS businesses to Sky this past November, our reported financial results for the third quarter this year do not include the consolidation of these DBS businesses as compared to a full quarter consolidation a year ago. So similar to last quarter, to provide a more meaningful comparative analysis, we are providing total company adjusted revenue and adjusted EBITDA, which excludes the DBS businesses in all periods.
Now turning to the quarter results. Third quarter total company revenues were $6.8 billion, up $84 million compared to the year-ago adjusted result, reflecting double-digit increases at our Cable Networks segment and mid-single-digit increases at Film. This growth was mostly offset by lower Television segment revenues, where the prior-year results included approximately $350 million in revenues from the broadcast of the Super Bowl.
Total segment EBITDA for the third quarter was $1.68 billion, a 3% reduction versus the adjusted EBITDA from a year ago of $1.73 billion. This year's result reflects continued strong underlying Cable Network segment contributions and higher Film segment contributions. These increases were more than offset by reduced Television segment results, reflecting last year's Super Bowl broadcast as well as this year's impact of the investments in our new sports channels in India. Additionally, this quarter reflected the most unfavorable year-on-year comparisons so far of foreign exchange rates, and as a result, our overall total EBITDA growth rate was reduced by approximately 7 percentage points in the quarter.
From a bottom-line perspective, on a GAAP basis, we reported income from continuing operations attributable to stockholders of $990 million as compared to the $1.07 billion we reported a year ago. Equity earnings were $160 million higher than a year ago, primarily reflecting this year's inclusion of our share of Sky's gain on the sale of Sky Bet. Excluding the net income effects of Other, net as well as certain adjustments to equity earnings, including eliminating the gain on the Sky Bet sale and eliminating last year's gain from participating in Sky share repurchase program, third quarter adjusted earnings per share were $0.42 this year versus $0.47 in the prior year.
Now let me provide some comments on the performance at our businesses. Let's start with the Cable Networks, where our total segment revenues increased 14% from last year, highlighted by a 15% increase in affiliate revenues and 9% advertising revenue growth.
With respect to affiliate revenues, domestic affiliate fees increased 20%, primarily from higher average rates led by the RSNs, FX and FOX News as well as increases from the conversion of our new channels, FS1 and FXX. The inclusion of the YES Network for the full quarter this year also contributed to our growth. Excluding the contribution from YES, we had a mid-teens domestic affiliate fee increase.
Our reported international affiliate fees were up 2%, reflecting an underlying mid-teens local currency growth rate, which was mostly offset by unfavorable foreign exchange movements, particularly in Latin America and in Europe.
The 9% total cable ad revenue growth from the quarter was led by our international channels, where reported international advertising grew 24%, reflecting 29% growth on a local currency basis. This growth was primarily driven by increases at STAR from this year's broadcast of the ICC World Cup.
The third quarter domestic advertising revenues were at similar levels to a year ago, with increases of the sports networks, FOX News and FXX, essentially being offset by lower ad revenues at FX and the National Geographic Channel due to lower ratings.
Total Cable segment EBITDA in the third quarter of $1.23 billion was up 5% over the prior year, reflecting the solid revenue growth, which was partially offset by a planned 19% increase in expenses, primarily related to higher sports rights and entertainment programming costs. Around 60% of the increase in expenses came from STAR Sports, most notably, the cost of the Cricket World Cup rights. The negative comparative effect from the strengthening U.S. dollar impacted the segment growth rate by around 5%. EBITDA at our domestic cable channels increased 21% from higher contributions at FOX News and from our sports channels, including the impact of consolidating the YES Network for the full quarter. This EBITDA growth was partially offset by lower contributions from the FX Networks due to increased programming costs.
At the international channels, despite local currency growth at FIC, our reported international channel EBITDA contributions declined 60%, driven by both the sizable planned cricket investment we made at STAR Sports as well as the overall negative impact from foreign exchange rates, especially from Latin America.
At our Television segment, third quarter EBITDA was $141 million, roughly half the contribution generated in the third quarter a year ago. This decline principally reflects the absence of the revenue and earnings from the Super Bowl broadcast in the prior year as well as higher entertainment programming costs this year from a higher volume of original series, including Glee and Empire. Excluding last year's Super Bowl, segment revenues were consistent with the year-ago quarter, as strong retransmission consent revenue growth was offset by a 7% decline in ad revenues due to lower general entertainment ratings at the broadcast network.
Turning to our Film segment. We reported third quarter EBITDA of $382 million, an 8% increase over year-ago results as higher film studio contributions more than offset lower Television production results and the unfavorable impacts of foreign currency. Total segment revenues in the quarter increased $110 million or 5%, driven by several successful theatrical releases, including King's Men and Taken 3 as well as home entertainment revenues from Rio 2 and The Fault in Our Stars.
The reduced contributions from Television production are largely due to lower SVOD revenues this year reflecting last year's multi-series sale to Amazon, which included 24 and The Americans.
Now before I turn to guidance, let me make a couple of capital-related comments. We ended the quarter with $9.3 billion in cash and $19.1 billion in gross debt. These balances reflect strong cash generation from operating activities in the quarter alone of approximately $1.8 billion and share repurchases in the quarter of $2.1 billion.
Subsequent to the quarter, we've continued to actively repurchase shares. From July 1 through today, we've repurchased approximately $5.25 billion of FOXA shares and we have approximately $1.25 billion remaining on our current authorization. So we're on plan to complete the $6 billion buyback within the 12-month timeframe that we previously announced.
Now let me address our guidance update for fiscal 2015. And as a reminder, for guidance purposes, we are excluding the DBS businesses for the entirety of all periods, resulting in a base EBITDA for fiscal 2014 of $6.29 billion.
On our last quarters earnings call, we indicated that the strengthening dollar would have an adverse impact on our EBITDA growth for the year based on exchange rates at that time. Since that call, the dollar, on average, has continued to strengthen, although in recent days, it's begun to weaken against certain currencies. So this volatility makes it difficult to forecast with precision the impact on our results, but we estimate that foreign exchange rates could have up to an incremental 1 percentage point negative impact on our growth rate. Absent this potential impact, we are maintaining our guidance for our total segment EBITDA percentage growth rate for fiscal 2015 to be at the lower end of the mid-single-digit range above the $6.29 billion total segment EBITDA base level for fiscal 2014.
With that, let me turn it over to Chase."

Our results continue to be driven by competitive strength at our Cable Networks, strong affiliate fee growth and leadership in our content businesses, while we face headwinds due to both foreign currency and the turnaround efforts at our Broadcast business. Our third quarter results were further impacted by the absence of the Super Bowl this year and significant investments at STAR Sports in India, particularly the Cricket World Cup.
We will address our guidance for the next fiscal year on our year-end call in August. Therefore, I want to use the next few minutes address some specific issues.
As I noted a minute ago, we continue to have strong underlying growth at our cable channels driven by higher affiliate fees. We also continue to close agreements that meet or exceed our expectations for new and existing agreements. At the same time, there's increasing noise in the market about new over-the-top offers, skinny bundles and other new options for consumers to access content. It is important to provide a bit of insight when considering these issues.
First, we believe the current pay TV ecosystem is strong and the consumers continue to value choice and breadth in content. While we're seeing a small decline in pay TV subs, we believe the vast majority of customers will continue to want a bundle of channels that is priced appropriately as opposed to a limited number of premium-priced channels.
Second, our existing carriage agreements are carefully constructed, not only provide us with a fair value for our content, but also specify the terms in which our channels are packaged and distributed. Many agreements provide limited flexibility for customer retention or experimentation with alternative packages. Any plans to distribute our package or channels in other ways would require a significantly different pricing structure. Even with this, we do expect there'd be more choices for consumers. This means more competition for our content. It also provides us opportunities to expand our business by providing consumers a better experience and connecting with customers we may not reach today. Not everyone will benefit from these changes. We continue to believe that content will be the ultimate beneficiary of the growth of digital platforms and, that within the content world, those with must-have brands and content at scale will be the true winners. As both existing MVPDs and new entrants try to construct new consumer offers, those with broad-hit content and unique brands will be best positioned to come out on top. We believe we're uniquely positioned to be such a winner.
In the U.S. and, increasingly, internationally, we built our business around 5 key brands: Fox Sports, FOX News, FX, National Geographic and FOX, each of which is a market leader with unique strengths. At FOX Sports, we've locked up key local national and international rights well into the next decade. Our regional sports networks add a critical dimension to our sports business that truly distinguishes us. The sheer popularity of the RSNs have made that business a pillar of strength second to none for us. We've used our scale, experience and broad affiliate agreements to enable us to continue to grow these businesses.
FOX News and FX have also established themselves as true industry leaders. FOX News is as dominant as ever, beating CNN, MSNBC and HLN combined in prime-time viewers. At the FX Network, the quality, breadth and distinctiveness in the programming really make it a premium channel residing in the basic cable space. Additionally, our FXX channel has essentially doubled its viewership from a year ago. National Geographic is one of the most recognized brands in the world. And while the channel is still a work in progress, we believe we haven't come close to tapping its true potential.
The FOX Network is clearly on a turnaround in the entertainment side. Nonetheless, it continues to be a driving force with enormous upside. The sports side of the network has been further strengthened this year by adding the FIFA World Cup and U.S. Open Golf to our portfolio of NFL, MLB and NASCAR events.
On the entertainment side, this season's Gotham and, more recently, Empire, give us momentum as we head into next week's upfront and Dana Walden and Gary Newman have given the business a fresh energy and excitement. We are not the first broadcast network to fight through a turnaround and we're confident we are on our way.
The breadth and strength of our brands and content are also going to be critical as we navigate the changes to the advertising side of our business. Our product has never seen such demand. However, we don't yet have the ability to effectively monetize the growing viewership. We also need to realize the consumers in the digital world are not going to be captivate viewers that will sit through 16 minutes of ads an hour. Advertising will have to be more effective and engaging to justify a premium. We'll need to work more closely with advertisers to connect with consumers in ways they value and enjoy. 
Both the recent reorganization of our channels' ad sales group and our trueX acquisition are steps in this direction.
There will be short-term challenges such as those we're experiencing today in the advertising side of our business, which can create pressure as we work to develop new business models. However, for those that navigate this transition successfully, the media industry that emerges on the other side will be one with enormous growth potential and an incredibly exciting future. One of the keys to success will be the ability to be disciplined in the face of industry noise and to be willing to invest and build on positions of strength even in the face of uncertain times. This is a time to prioritize long-term gains over short-term pain. We need to resist the temptation to react the short-term disruptions that we can air long-term future. In many ways, it's a time to double down. 
We must also continue to invest aggressively in original content. Many have asked if the current level of original content adoption is sustainable. The obvious answer is that it is if we create the best content. We contend the winners in the content will be those with the management and infrastructure to maximize the value of that content. Our proven track record, management-bench strength, deep roster of talent relationships, unique library and worldwide set of leading industry network -- industry-leading networks will enable us to monetize content second to none.
We also need to control a much wider set of rights to the content we distribute. The days of slicing-and-dicing rights are over. In order to create the best consumer experience and maximize the value of our content and networks, we need to have the flexibility to come to the broadest set of rights. The best path to controlling own destiny is to create our own product. We will clearly continue to work with third parties, but the sweet spot is undoubtedly where we own and distribute our own content. Our leadership position in content gives us a big advantage in achieving that goal. 
In closing, we believe we are incredibly well-positioned and are confident that today's challenges represent real opportunities for the future. Thank you."

I mean, clearly, we're going to a transition here. I mean, advertisers, without doubt, have more choices. They want more flexibility in some ways. You could say the upfront we're about to go into, while important, is probably a bit of an antiquated practice given where the world's heading. I think advertisers want more flexibility. I think, for us, I think it's increasingly important. That's why we restructured our group, that we really work with advertisers to figure out how do we create unique opportunities with unique messages that resonate. I think there's a degree more energy in it. But again, I think everybody's still trying to navigate this new space. There's no question everybody wants the attributes that are associated with the digital world. I think in some ways the promise is ahead of the reality. And I think some of that reality's got to get fleshed out and people have to understand. We have to do a better job of prioritizing, monetizing that viewership. I mean, we've taken steps. Certainly, it's become a not immaterial part of our business, but it's got to get -- we're in the middle of the first inning of what we need to do in terms of monetizing that ad inventory. We need to develop the capabilities to do it.

I think all those things will be a bigger factor than they've been in the past, but it's going to take time. Again, you're sort of, in a lot of ways, we haven't developed a lot of the capabilities, not just measurement, but technology and other things to measure effectiveness, capabilities, delivered on the promise of it. We're better than we were, but it's still really early days. So I think all those things will be a part of it. Certainly, all the trends, you're talking currency, we need to clearly -- C3, we said before, isn't the answer and C7 isn't the answer. They're all directionally the answer of starting to measure the viewership outside the linear network. We've got a long, long way to go to really monetize every viewership in every shape and form we can to work clearly with the reorganization, to work with advertisers. And then to find ways, I think certainly, we will be much more looking across. I mean, the purpose of putting our ad sales together was to sell across our platforms. So -- and in many ways, if we're going to create unique relationships with advertisers, what we want to do is use the unique franchises we have across the breadth of them. That's how we create something that really takes advantage of our unique content and brands is to give an advertiser an ability to access customers across all our franchises and to develop then unique messages that resonate. Again, I think it's increasingly important we find ways to make advertising not an encumbrance to consumers, but sort of a value-added part of the experience. That's part of what trueX rings to us, is an ability to make the advertising experience one that is more valued. And part of the value just comes from making it more relevant. But all those are -- all those things have to be part of directionally where we're going. We're not going to get there in the next 2 months, but certainly, we expect to make steps. And in all honesty, we've made steps to date, but we have a long, long way to go."

And as you get close to do it, we got to get a handle on -- there will be things that affect the budgets, such as the ongoing strength of the dollar, we'll have visibility to that; updated views on the ad markets, post the upfront specifics and our content release schedule; level of investments in content; all those things will come through. So I think we've historically -- which is why we give the guidance sort of at year end after we've gone through a budget process to get a handle on it. And I think that's probably where we're going to stick with it. Scatter market, I mean, the pricing's actually been pretty good. I mean, I think probably the volume probably is not quite as strong as the pricing. But pricing's actually -- in the scatter market's been pretty good. I think in terms of currency, I'm not going to predict C3 versus C7. I think probably -- the second part of your question, it's probably more relevant. I mean it matters, but at the end of the day, I think neither one's the answer. And there'd probably be some dynamics of pricing factored into what you put into it. What we need to do is make it a priority to monetize viewership, all the viewership that's occurring, which is why neither needed C3 nor C7 is the answer. To some degree, the product has to have -- really almost to be sold in a different way. It has to be sold in a premium basis. I mean, not just queuing up with what we're selling linearly. We need to -- [indiscernible] different world's going to have. It's going to have different ad loads and going to have different advertising ad [indiscernible] -- advertising messages with different capabilities that hopefully should be much more attractive. And in some degree, we have to move to figure out how do we get paid for the premium value of the advertising that can exist in the marketplace going forward. And a -- so things like C3 and C7 to me are small steps, but they're not the answer. I mean, yes, they're not irrelevant. So we do want to capture more of that viewership in the manner we can through at least reflecting the expanding viewership in all these digital platforms. But that's not the end goal. The end goal is to figure how do we get fairly compensated for the product that really is a product that everybody wants. I mean, at the end of the day, the product that consumers and advertisers all want to deal with is our product. We need the ability to -- we need to figure out a -- we need to build the capability to monetize the popularity of that viewership. And again, C7 is not an answer. It's a small step in the right direction. But just a small step."

I mean, clearly, the FOX Network -- I mean you could -- we report the broadcast segment, so it's not a secret. The FOX Network is not where we think it should be and not where we planned for it to be. We think we've got some nice momentum with Empire and Gotham and a couple of things coming. We like the sports franchises we've added. We still look at FOX Network as a business that should be the shining light, that it's the top of the pyramid that drives our business forward. Clearly, it's not performed at such. It's taken -- its ratings declines in the last few years were not -- not that we planned on. We're excited about new management team. We made the changes to drive that business, and I think it's -- so I think certainly using that as the case in point probably is the most -- is probably the clearest case in point is, I think -- we think that's a great business. And we think we need to continue to have the backbone to invest to drive that business to what it can be as opposed to saying, how do we sort of hit a profit target in the next year for the FOX Network as opposed to investing to enable it to get to the right place 3 years from now. So I think it's probably talking more about that type of an investment. I think I guess, the only other comment I'd make is, in general -- and you go back to the Analyst Day, let's -- the world is fluid. I mean, I think you've -- you always got to be opportunistic. And you got to make judgments as you get to various places in time as what's the right decision, what's the competitive marketplace, what are the other industry dynamics that have occurred and how do you manage your business to build long-term value from what you know today. And certainly, today -- and I'm not -- we're just stating the facts, not -- it's not making any judgments about margins or anything else as opposed to -- today, clearly, there have been -- I think, there have been changes in the marketplace. Certainly, the impacts on ratings across Cable Networks have probably been larger than one would've expected a year ago, including me. I wouldn't have -- I think some of those shifts have been larger than would have anticipated. We saw the trends coming. And I think as the world evolves, you've got to adjust to it. And I think a lot of our businesses -- I mean, if you added things like investing in sports, and FS1's pretty much right on plan. The produced programming's still a work in progress. And we are bringing in new executive, we announced, in to be the point person for that. We knew creating programming takes time. Some of it's -- some of it's worked. Some of it hasn't. And we actually feel great about where it is and we're pretty much where we expect it to be. So I think in general, I think their business is clearly aren't where we expect it to be, the broadcast network. Obviously, the international channels have taken -- competitively are closer to where we are. They don't -- their financials aren't where we expected it to be because of the currency. But more broadly, I think we are continuing to adhere to things we talked about and -- but we're always going to -- I think we said it in the Analyst Day. I think you always want -- I think it's important that you continue to aggressively compete in the world, as you know more as the world evolves. I think in terms of over-the-top, I think that over-the-top is a very important part of our future. Now that being said, as I said in the prepared comments, we still think most consumers are going to want to bundle a programming. I don't think they want to buy à la carte. They want to buy a bundle of programming. We think there'd be more people, more players offering bundles of programming. I think those bundles have to be ones that are concocted with the consumer in mind, not something that is artificially concocted by the content owner and a distributor that doesn't really make sense. The alignment of what that content is doesn't make sense to a consumer. So you have to figure out -- you're going to -- if these over-the-top players are going to be -- what are they bringing, in many ways -- certainly, bringing a better consumer experience. I think, in some ways, the Netflix and Hulus are sort of cases in point of a better -- the value of a better consumer experience. I mean -- and I think if you can go in the flip side and say the struggle with TV Everywhere have been an example of the challenge you have when you don't create the right consumer experience. So I think there can be over-the-top players that bring a new consumer experience that again, at its core, is still offering a bundle of programming, may not be exactly what's out there it's why -- and if you want to make sure you must-have content that has to be in that bundle if you're creating a bundle that really resonates with that consumer. And we do still think consumers want proactive choice, that we've got the content that will be a central part of any of those over-the-top bundles. But I think bringing -- obviously, the competition's good, but bringing a better -- bringing better experiences to the marketplace. If people can develop better user interfaces, that's a positive. And I mean, I always lauded DIRECTV when I was there. I mean, what -- one of the reasons DIRECTV I think competed successfully against the cable industry was it was better experience. And I think sort of easy-to-use and simplicity are probably some of the most underappreciated assets in the -- virtues in the business. Actually, we're excited about it. Look, we've got -- we, probably amongst may of our peers, have more firsthand experience in dealing directly -- we have businesses internationally that deal directly with consumers that create consumer interfaces and manage relationships with consumers. So we think over-the-top, for us specifically, is an interesting opportunity. We think working with third parties to create more competition and new experiences is an important opportunity. We also think there are customers that -- again, I think the predominant majority will want a bundle. I think there are consumers that probably are interested in alternatives. Everybody talks about the millennials. And I think the ability to create packages or offers that they speak to that generation is also an interesting opportunity. Obviously, we've -- they're consumers we don't reach today, and we want to be able to -- in an additive way, I think it's important -- everything we do is adding to the pie, not cannibalizing the pie, create offers that speak to customers that want something different. We think that'll be a relatively small minority, but it's important for us to do. And we look forward to developing all of that."

Sony PlayStation Vue is out there. There's a lot of speculation around what might be on Apple. And FOX has a lot I think, of relatively kind of average-priced must-have programming, not outside the mean: the broadcast network O&Os, news, general entertainment, even national sports. But we don't really know where the RSNs fit in, and we don't have a lot of data to base them on, I guess outside of Sling and Sony; if you could talk about that. But how do you see the distribution landscape shaping up for the RSNs an OTT MVPD world? What's your confidence that the distribution model sustains itself?"

So they're different in that. Although, for us, I think our RSNs in aggregate cover 70% of the country. So in some ways, you could say the RSNs for us are a national business. I mean -- and I do think that strength in RSNs is a distinguishing feature for us against a lot of the other people. But I don't actually look at it [indiscernible] -- look, I think the RSNs represent great, must-have content. And I think that it is as important as any content that exists in a local market for a large segment of consumers. Obviously, any piece of content is relevant to everybody, but it is content second to none. It is -- and I think in some ways, I guess, we judge its importance when we -- as we engage with our distributors in the marketplace. And it has continued to be a critical part of our business. It continues a critical pillar of driving our business forward. Obviously, some others have stumbled in it. I think we've proven a capability, sort of the L.A. and Houston [indiscernible] points to, we've proven a capability that we know how to manage, we know how to navigate. I think our scale helps in this, and most of our agreements in place are long-term. I think over 80% of our agreements are into the 20s. I think we've -- and we know how to continue to renew them in terms that work. I think we've renewed about 20% of our team deals in the last couple of years. So it's a business that -- and again, we bring a lot of strength that would enable us to make these instances work, and that others, on a one-off basis obviously aren't -- our established relationships with MVPDs are all a part of that. So in many ways, I just -- I look at -- it is -- same way we'd look at the other channels, the other channels we have and being one of, if not, the most important drivers in the business. And we do just think again, that those array of channels are going to be our must-have content for consumers out there."

And I think we see the RSNs as sort of a separate category from that. It's really been in part and parcel of how we approach the marketplace, both in the United States and in other markets, as we've invested in sports around the place. And to Chase's point, the results of the RSNs and the results in our sports businesses around the world are validating that more as opposed to less."

Before we get into the specific earnings commentary, just a reminder that because of the sale of our DBS businesses to Sky this past November, our reported financial results for the third quarter this year do not include the consolidation of",1268,"Thanks, Reed. Before we get into the specific earnings commentary, just a reminder that because of the sale of our DBS businesses to Sky this past November, our reported financial results for the third quarter this year do not include the consolidation of these DBS businesses as compared to a full quarter consolidation a year ago. So similar to last quarter, to provide a more meaningful comparative analysis, we are providing total company adjusted revenue and adjusted EBITDA, which excludes the DBS businesses in all periods.
Now turning to the quarter results. Third quarter total company revenues were $6.8 billion, up $84 million compared to the year-ago adjusted result, reflecting double-digit increases at our Cable Networks segment and mid-single-digit increases at Film. This growth was mostly offset by lower Television segment revenues, where the prior-year results included approximately $350 million in revenues from the broadcast of the Super Bowl.
Total segment EBITDA for the third quarter was $1.68 billion, a 3% reduction versus the adjusted EBITDA from a year ago of $1.73 billion. This year's result reflects continued strong underlying Cable Network segment contributions and higher Film segment contributions. These increases were more than offset by reduced Television segment results, reflecting last year's Super Bowl broadcast as well as this year's impact of the investments in our new sports channels in India. Additionally, this quarter reflected the most unfavorable year-on-year comparisons so far of foreign exchange rates, and as a result, our overall total EBITDA growth rate was reduced by approximately 7 percentage points in the quarter.
From a bottom-line perspective, on a GAAP basis, we reported income from continuing operations attributable to stockholders of $990 million as compared to the $1.07 billion we reported a year ago. Equity earnings were $160 million higher than a year ago, primarily reflecting this year's inclusion of our share of Sky's gain on the sale of Sky Bet. Excluding the net income effects of Other net, as well as certain adjustments to equity earnings, including eliminating the gain on the Sky Bet sale and eliminating last year's gain from participating in Sky share repurchase program, third quarter adjusted earnings per share were $0.42 this year versus $0.47 in the prior year.
Now let me provide some comments on the performance at our businesses. Let's start with the Cable Networks, where our total segment revenues increased 14% from last year, highlighted by a 15% increase in affiliate revenues and 9% advertising revenue growth.
With respect to affiliate revenues, domestic affiliate fees increased 20%, primarily from higher average rates led by the RSNs, FX and FOX News as well as increases from the conversion of our new channels, FS1 and FXX. The inclusion of the YES Network for the full quarter this year also contributed to our growth. Excluding the contribution from YES, we had a mid-teens domestic affiliate fee increase.
Our reported international affiliate fees were up 2%, reflecting an underlying mid-teens local currency growth rate, which was mostly offset by unfavorable foreign exchange movements, particularly in Latin America and in Europe.
The 9% total cable ad revenue growth from the quarter was led by our international channels, where reported international advertising grew 24%, reflecting a 29% growth on a local currency basis. This growth was primarily driven by increases at STAR from this year's broadcast of the ICC World Cup.
The third quarter domestic advertising revenues were at similar levels to a year ago, with increases of the sports networks, FOX News and FXX, essentially being offset by lower ad revenues at FX and the National Geographic Channel due to lower ratings.
Total Cable segment EBITDA in the third quarter of $1.23 billion was up 5% over the prior year, reflecting the solid revenue growth, which was partially offset by a planned 19% increase in expenses, primarily related to higher sports rights and entertainment programming costs. Around 60% of the increase in expenses came from STAR Sports, most notably, the cost of the Cricket World Cup rights. The negative comparative effect from the strengthening U.S. dollar impacted the segment growth rate by around 5%. EBITDA at our domestic cable channels increased 21% from higher contributions at FOX News and from our sports channels, including the impact of consolidating the YES Network for the full quarter. This EBITDA growth was partially offset by lower contributions from the FX Networks due to increased programming costs.
At the international channels, despite local currency growth at FIC, our reported international channel EBITDA contributions declined 60%, driven by both the sizable planned cricket investment we made at STAR Sports as well as the overall negative impact from foreign exchange rates, especially from Latin America.
At our Television segment, third quarter EBITDA was $141 million, roughly half the contribution generated in the third quarter a year ago. This decline principally reflects the absence of the revenue and earnings from the Super Bowl broadcast in the prior year as well as higher entertainment programming costs this year from a higher volume of original series, including Glee and Empire. Excluding last year's Super Bowl, segment revenues were consistent with the year-ago quarter, as strong retransmission consent revenue growth was offset by a 7% decline in ad revenues due to lower general entertainment ratings at the broadcast network.
Turning to our Film segment. We reported third quarter EBITDA of $382 million, an 8% increase over year-ago results as higher film studio contributions more than offset lower Television production results and the unfavorable impacts of foreign currency. Total segment revenues in the quarter increased $110 million or 5%, driven by several successful theatrical releases, including King's Men and Taken 3 as well as home entertainment revenues from Rio 2 and The Fault in Our Stars.
The reduced contributions from Television production are largely due to lower SVOD revenues this year reflecting last year's multi-series sale to Amazon, which included 24 and The Americans.
Now before I turn to guidance, let me make a couple of capital-related comments. We ended the quarter with $9.3 billion in cash and $19.1 billion in gross debt. These balances reflect strong cash generation from operating activities in the quarter alone of approximately $1.8 billion and share repurchases in the quarter of $2.1 billion.
Subsequent to the quarter, we've continued to actively repurchase shares. From July 1 through today, we've repurchased approximately $5.25 billion of FOXA shares and we have approximately $1.25 billion remaining on our current authorization. So we're on plan to complete the $6 billion buyback within the 12-month timeframe that we previously announced.
Now let me address our guidance update for fiscal 2015. And as a reminder, for guidance purposes, we are excluding the DBS businesses for the entirety of all periods, resulting in a base EBITDA for fiscal 2014 of $6.29 billion.
On our last quarter's earnings call, we indicated that the strengthening dollar would have an adverse impact on our EBITDA growth for the year based on exchange rates at that time. Since that call, the dollar, on average, has continued to strengthen, although in recent days, it's begun to weaken against certain currencies. So this volatility makes it difficult to forecast with precision the impact on our results, but we estimate that foreign exchange rates could have up to an incremental 1 percentage point negative impact on our growth rate. Absent this potential impact, we are maintaining our guidance for our total segment EBITDA percentage growth rate for fiscal 2015 to be at the lower end of the mid-single-digit range above the $6.29 billion total segment EBITDA base level for fiscal 2014.
With that, let me turn it over to Chase."

Our results continue to be driven by competitive strength at our Cable Networks, strong affiliate fee growth and leadership in our content businesses, while we face headwinds due to both foreign currency and the turnaround efforts at our Broadcast business. Our third quarter results were further impacted by the absence of the Super Bowl this year and significant investments at STAR Sports in India, particularly the Cricket World Cup.
We will address our guidance for the next fiscal year on our year-end call in August. Therefore, I want to use the next few minutes to address some specific issues.
As I noted a minute ago, we continue to have strong underlying growth at our cable channels driven by higher affiliate fees. We also continue to close agreements that meet or exceed our expectations for new and existing agreements. At the same time, there's increasing noise in the market about new over-the-top offers, skinny bundles and other new options for consumers to access content. It is important to provide a bit of insight when considering these issues.
First, we believe the current pay TV ecosystem is strong and that consumers continue to value choice and breadth in content. While we're seeing a small decline in pay TV subs, we believe the vast majority of customers will continue to want a bundle of channels that is priced appropriately as opposed to a limited number of premium-priced channels.
Second, our existing carriage agreements are carefully constructed, to not only provide us with a fair value for our content, but also specify the terms in which our channels are packaged and distributed. Many agreements provide limited flexibility for customer retention or experimentation with alternative packages. Any plans to distribute or package our channels in other ways would require a significantly different pricing structure. Even with this, we do expect there'd be more choices for consumers. This means more competition for our content. It also provides us opportunities to expand our business by providing consumers a better experience and connecting with customers we may not reach today. Not everyone will benefit from these changes. We continue to believe that content will be the ultimate beneficiary of the growth of digital platforms and, that within the content world, those with must-have brands and content at scale will be the true winners. As both existing MVPDs and new entrants try to construct new consumer offers, those with broad-hit content and unique brands will be best positioned to come out on top. We believe we're uniquely positioned to be such a winner.
In the U.S. and, increasingly, internationally, we built our business around 5 key brands: Fox Sports, FOX News, FX, National Geographic and FOX, each of which is a market leader with unique strengths. At FOX Sports, we've locked up key local national and international rights well into the next decade. Our regional sports networks add a critical dimension to our sports business that truly distinguishes us. The sheer popularity of the RSNs have made that business a pillar of strength second to none for us. We've used our scale, experience and broad affiliate agreements to enable us to continue to grow these businesses.
FOX News and FX have also established themselves as true industry leaders. FOX News is as dominant as ever, beating CNN, MSNBC and HLN combined in prime-time viewers. At the FX Network, the quality, breadth and distinctiveness in the programming really make it a premium channel residing in the basic cable space. Additionally, our FXX channel has essentially doubled its viewership from a year ago. National Geographic is one of the most recognized brands in the world. And while the channel is still a work in progress, we believe we haven't come close to tapping its true potential.
The FOX Network is clearly in a turnaround in the entertainment side. Nonetheless, it continues to be a driving force with enormous upside. The sports side of the network has been further strengthened this year by adding the FIFA World Cup and U.S. Open Golf to our portfolio of NFL, MLB and NASCAR events.
On the entertainment side, this season's Gotham and, more recently, Empire, give us momentum as we head into next week's upfront and Dana Walden and Gary Newman have given the business a fresh energy and excitement. We are not the first broadcast network to fight through a turnaround and we're confident we are on our way.
The breadth and strength of our brands and content are also going to be critical as we navigate the changes to the advertising side of our business. Our product has never seen such demand. However, we don't yet have the ability to effectively monetize the growing viewership. We also need to realize the consumers in the digital world are not going to be captive viewers that will sit through 16 minutes of ads an hour. Advertising will have to be more effective and engaging to justify a premium. We'll need to work more closely with advertisers to connect with consumers in ways they value and enjoy. 
Both the recent reorganization of our channels' ad sales group and our trueX acquisition are steps in this direction.
There will be short-term challenges such as those we're experiencing today on the advertising side of our business, which can create pressure as we work to develop new business models. However, for those that navigate this transition successfully, the media industry that emerges on the other side will be one with enormous growth potential and an incredibly exciting future. One of the keys to success will be the ability to be disciplined in the face of industry noise and to be willing to invest and build on positions of strength even in the face of uncertain times. This is a time to prioritize long-term gains over short-term pain. We need to resist the temptation to react to short-term disruptions by weakening our long-term future. In many ways, it's a time to double down. 
We must also continue to invest aggressively in original content. Many have asked if the current level of original content production is sustainable. The obvious answer is that it is if we create the best content. We contend the winners in the content world will be those with the management and infrastructure to maximize the value of that content. Our proven track record, management-bench strength, deep roster of talent relationships, unique library and worldwide set of leading industry network -- industry-leading networks will enable us to monetize content second to none.
We also need to control a much wider set of rights to the content we distribute. The days of slicing-and-dicing rights are over. In order to create the best consumer experience and maximize the value of our content and networks, we need to have the flexibility to come to the broadest set of rights. The best path to controlling own destiny is to create our own product. We will clearly continue to work with third parties, but the sweet spot is undoubtedly where we own and distribute our own content. Our leadership position in content gives us a big advantage in achieving that goal. 
In closing, we believe we are incredibly well-positioned and are confident that today's challenges represent real opportunities for the future. Thank you."

I mean, right now, you have the quiet that always exists, sort of before the upfront. So it's sort of heading into the upfront. It's tough to judge right now. But I think they are okay. I mean, clearly, we're going to a transition here. I mean, advertisers, without doubt, have more choices. They want more flexibility in some ways. You could say the upfront we're about to go into, while important, is probably a bit of an antiquated practice given where the world's heading. I think advertisers want more flexibility. I think, for us, I think it's increasingly important. That's why we restructured our group, that we really work with advertisers to figure out how do we create unique opportunities with unique messages that resonate. I think there's a degree more energy in it. But again, I think everybody's still trying to navigate this new space. There's no question everybody wants the attributes that are associated with the digital world. I think in some ways the promise is ahead of the reality. And I think some of that reality's got to get fleshed out and people have to understand. We have to do a better job of prioritizing, monetizing that viewership. I mean, we've taken steps. Certainly, it's become a not immaterial part of our business, but it's got to get -- we're in the middle of the first inning of what we need to do in terms of monetizing that ad inventory. We need to develop the capabilities to do it. But a lot of it's sort of prioritizing, focus and working with these advertisers to develop the right messages and the right communications for those advertisers."

We're better than we were, but it's still really early days. So I think all those things will be a part of it. Certainly, all the trends, you're talking currency, we need to clearly -- C3, we said before, isn't the answer and C7 isn't the answer. They're all directionally the answer of starting to measure the viewership outside the linear network. We've got a long, long way to go to really monetize every viewership in every shape and form we can to work clearly with the reorganization, to work with advertisers. And then to find ways, I think certainly, we will be much more working across. I mean, the purpose of putting our ad sales together was to sell across our platforms. So -- and in many ways, if we're going to create unique relationships with advertisers, what we want to do is use the unique franchises we have across the breadth of them. That's how we create something that really takes advantage of our unique content and brands is to give an advertiser an ability to access customers across all our franchises and to develop then unique messages that resonate. Again, I think it's increasingly important we find ways to make advertising not an encumbrance to consumers, but sort of a value-added part of the experience. That's part of what trueX brings to us, is an ability to make the advertising experience one that is more valued. And part of the value just comes from making it more relevant. But all those are -- all those things have to be part of directionally where we're going. We're obviously not going to get there in the next 2 months, but certainly, we expect to make steps. And in all honesty, we've made steps to date, but we have a long, long way to go."

I mean, actually, the first budget meeting is later this week, so we haven't even had the first one. And as you get closer to do it, we got to get a handle on -- there will be things that affect the budgets, such as the ongoing strength of the dollar, we'll have better visibility to that; updated views on the ad markets, post the upfront specifics and our content release schedule; level of investments in content; all those things will come through. So I think we've historically -- which is why we give the guidance sort of at year end after we've gone through a budget process to get a handle on it. And I think that's probably where we're going to stick with it. Scatter market, I mean, I think the pricing's actually been pretty good. I mean, I think probably the volume probably is not quite as strong as the pricing. But pricing's actually -- in the scatter market's been pretty good. I think in terms of currency, I'm not going to predict C3 versus C7. I think probably -- the second part of your question, it's probably more relevant. I mean it matters, but at the end of the day, I think neither one's the answer. And there will probably be some dynamics of pricing factored into what you put into it. What we need to do is make it a priority to monetize viewership, all the viewership that's occurring, which is why neither C3 nor C7 is the answer. To some degree, this product has to have -- really almost has to be sold in a different way. It has to be sold in a premium basis. I mean, not just cume-ing up with what we're selling linearly. We need to -- partially because the digital world's going to have -- it's going to have different ad loads and going to have different ad -- advertising messages with different capabilities that hopefully should be much more attractive. And in some degree, we have to move to figure out how do we get paid for the premium value of the advertising that can exist in the marketplace going forward. And a -- so things like C3 and C7 to me are small steps, but they're not the answer. I mean, yes, they're not irrelevant. So we do want to capture more of that viewership in the manner we can through at least reflecting the expanding viewership in all these digital platforms. But that's not the end goal. The end goal is to figure how do we get fairly compensated for the product that really is a product that everybody wants. I mean, at the end of the day, the product that consumers and advertisers all want to deal with is our product. We need the ability to -- we need to figure out a -- we need to build the capability to monetize the popularity of that viewership. And again, C7 is not an answer. It's a small step in the right direction. But just a small step."

I mean, I guess probably the investing comment is going -- and it's not solely speaking to this, probably is a comment, first and foremost, about the FOX Network. I mean, clearly, the FOX Network -- I mean you could -- we report the broadcast [ph] segment, so it's not a secret. The FOX Network is not where we think it should be and not where we planned for it to be. We think we've got some nice momentum with Empire and Gotham and a couple of things coming. We like the sports franchises we've added. We still look at FOX Network as a business that should be the shining light, that it's the top of the pyramid that drives our business forward. Clearly, it's not performed at such. It's taken -- its ratings declines in the last 3 years are not -- not what we planned on. We're excited about new management team. We made the changes to drive that business, and I think it's -- so I think certainly using that as the case in point, it probably is the most -- is probably the clearest case in point is, I think -- we think that's a great business. And we think we need to continue to have the backbone to invest to drive that business to what it can be as opposed to saying, how do we sort of hit a profit target in the next year for the FOX Network as opposed to investing to enable it to get to the right place 3 years from now. So I think it's probably talking more about that type of an investment. I think I guess, the only other comment I'd make is, in general -- and you go back to the Analyst Day, let's -- the world is fluid. I mean, I think you've -- you always got to be opportunistic. And you got to make judgments as you get to various places in time as what's the right decision, what's the competitive marketplace, what are the other industry dynamics that have occurred and how do you manage your business to build long-term value from what you know today. And certainly, today -- and I'm not -- we're just stating the facts, not -- it's not making any judgments about margins or anything else as opposed to -- today, clearly, there have been -- I think, there have been changes in the marketplace. Certainly, the impacts on ratings across Cable Networks have probably been larger than one would've expected a year ago, including me. I wouldn't have -- I think some of those shifts have been larger than would have anticipated where you saw the trends coming. And I think as the world evolves, you've got to adjust to it. And I think a lot of our businesses -- I mean, if you added things like investing in sports, and FS1's pretty much right on plan. The produced programming's still a work in progress. And we are bringing in new executive, we announced, in to be the point person for that. We knew creating programming takes time. Some of it's -- some of it's worked. Some of it hasn't. And we actually feel great about where it is and we're pretty much where we expect it to be. So I think in general, I think their business is clearly aren't where we expected it to be, the broadcast network. Obviously, the international channels have taken -- competitively are closer to where we are. They don't -- their financials aren't where we expected it to be because of the currency. But more broadly, I think we are continuing to adhere to things we talked about and -- but we're always going to -- look, I think we said it in the Analyst Day. I think you always want -- I think it's important that you continue to aggressively compete in the world, as you know more as the world evolves. I think in terms of over-the-top, I think that over-the-top is a very important part of our future. Now that being said, as I said in the prepared comments, we still think most consumers are going to want to bundle a programming. I don't think they want to buy à la carte. They want to buy a bundle of programming. We think there'll be more people, more players offering bundles of programming. I think those bundles have to be ones that are concocted with the consumer in mind, not something that is artificially concocted by the content owner and a distributor that doesn't really make sense. The alignment of what that content is doesn't make sense to a consumer. So you have to figure out -- you're going to -- if these over-the-top players are going to be -- what are they bringing, in many ways -- certainly, bringing a better consumer experience. I think, in some ways, the Netflix and Hulus are sort of cases in point of a better -- the value of a better consumer experience. I mean -- and I think if you can go in the flip side and say the struggle of the TV Everywhere -- have been an example of the challenge that you have when you don't create the right consumer experience. So I think there can be over-the-top players that bring a new consumer experience that again, at its core, is still offering a bundle of programming, may not be exactly what's out there it's why I think you want to make sure you must-have content that has to be in that bundle if you're creating a bundle that really resonates with that consumer. And we do still think consumers want breadth and choice, that we've got the content that will be a central part of any of those over-the-top bundles. But I think bringing -- obviously, the competition's good, but bringing a better -- bringing the better experiences to the marketplace. If people can develop better user interfaces, that's a positive. And I mean, I always thought of DIRECTV when I was there. I mean, what -- one of the reasons DIRECTV I think competed successfully against the cable industry was it was a better experience. And I think sort of easy-to-use and simplicity are probably some of the most underappreciated assets in the -- virtues in the business. Actually, we're excited about it. Look, we've got -- we, probably amongst many of our peers, have more firsthand experience in dealing directly -- we have, as I said, businesses internationally that deal directly with consumers that create consumer interfaces and manage relationships with consumers. So we think over-the-top, for us specifically, it's an interesting opportunity. We think working with third parties to create more competition and new experiences is an important opportunity. We also think there are customers that -- again, I think the predominant majority will want a bundle. I think there are consumers that probably are interested in alternatives. Everybody talks about the millennials. And I think the ability to create packages or offers that they speak to that generation is also an interesting opportunity. Obviously, we've -- they're consumers we don't reach today, and we want to be able to -- in an additive way, I think it's important -- everything we do is adding to the pie, not cannibalizing the pie, create offers that speak to customers that want something different. We think that'll be a relatively small minority, but it's important for us to do. And we look forward to developing all of that."

And FOX has a lot I think, of relatively kind of average-priced must-have programming, not outside the mean: the broadcast network O&Os, news, general entertainment, even national sports. But we don't really know where the RSNs fit in, and we don't have a lot of data to base them on, I guess outside of Sling and Sony; if you could talk about that.

I mean -- and I do think that strength in RSNs is a distinguishing feature for us against a lot of the other people. But I don't actually look at it that different -- look, I think the RSNs represent great, must-have content. And I think that it is as important as any content that exists in a local market for a large segment of consumers. Obviously, any piece of content is relevant to everybody, but it is content second to none. It is -- and I think in some ways, I guess, we judge its importance when we -- as we engage with our distributors in the marketplace. And it has continued to be a critical part of our business. It continues a critical pillar of driving our business forward. Obviously, some others have stumbled in it. I think we've proven a capability, sort of the L.A. and Houston situation points to, we've proven a capability that we know how to manage, we know how to navigate. I think our scale helps in this, and most of our agreements in place are long-term. I think over 80% of our agreements are into the 20s. I think we've -- and we know how to continue to renew them in terms that work. I think we've renewed about 20% of our team deals in the last couple of years.

It's really been in part and parcel of how we approach the marketplace, both in the United States and in other markets, as we've invested in sports around the place.

I'm wondering now -- you're almost done with that investment cycle -- what's the right way to think about cost growth domestically at cable going forward? Because in the past before the cycle started, you guys were mid- to high single digit expense growers. So that's I think one of the questions people want to get is, what's normalized spending, post the investment cycle?"

So they've done it great. We couldn't be -- realistically couldn't feel more excited about it."

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on what we shaped to be a very busy day for all of you.It's my first time back on our earnings call for a number of years, and I must say it's a privilege to be back at the company",1200,"Thank you, Reed. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on what we shaped to be a very busy day for all of you.
It's my first time back on our earnings call for a number of years, and I must say it's a privilege to be back at the company in an executive capacity, and on this call with you, and with Reed with John and with James.
As you know, on July 1, we firmly completed a leadership transition that we have been working towards for some time. James and I both appreciate the boards confidence in us, and we are acutely aware of the responsibilities that come with it.
We are extraordinarily energized to be leading the company at a time when there are so many opportunities ahead. But of course, the company finds itself in this position, thanks in very large part to Chase. We must thanks him for his many years of exceptional leadership. And while Chase will no longer be joining these calls, he continues to be highly involved in many aspects of the company.
His ongoing counsel is a valued asset to us.
James I have been immersed in Twenty-First Century Fox on all its end of the broader industry generally, for at least, the past 25 years. This background and context will serve as well, as we partner to lead Twenty-First Century Fox to a time of accelerated industry change. I can assure you that we, the board and the senior management team, are intensely focused on the array of opportunities that are emerging for Twenty-First Century Fox and for our shareholders.
Now while there has been a particular emphasis on it recently, the reality is that our industry has always been evolving and innovating. The imperative is how we respond to it. Every aspect of our business is being affected by increasingly rapid change, from how we develop content to delivery to consumer engagement and of course, to how we monetize it all.  The scale and speed of this change will, to some, be overwhelming. 
But a key underlying trend is important to recognize here. More people are now watching more quality storytelling than ever. They're just consuming it differently, given the growing array of options available to them. This is a key and positive trend.
Empowered by new technologies, our customers are demanding distinct and better ways to consumer content, personalized to them in a variety of new nonlinear environments. These new viewing experiences bring with them, both new challenges, which we do not underestimate but also, significant opportunities for viewers, advertisers and distributors that simply have not been possible in the linear world. These challenges and opportunities are forefront in our mind as we develop and execute over-the-top distribution and advertising strategies.
One thing is very clear to us: In this environment, it is not enough to simply adapt to change. To succeed in this environment, we must lead change, and that is what all of us in the senior team are committed to do.  But we also understand that linear viewing remains a key driver of our channels business, which in turn, is a direct result of our continuing commitment to finding and investing in the best content and content creators around the world. This commitment will not diminish under the new management structure, and if anything, will increase.
Sport and news are also more important than ever in the linear world, Fox Sports, specifically, Fox Sports 1, is showing strong viewing momentum, as Fox News also continues to deliver dominant ratings. Our goal has been and remains to simplify our business and focus on the content, the brand and the markets and that are most valuable to our customers and to our shareholders.
We separated Twenty-First Century Fox News Corp. to drive value and focused. We merged these guys into 1 entity, and we consolidated strategic minority investments, including the YES Network, ESPN Star Sports, Fox Pan American Sports, Asianet and TV. We refocused our channels in the key global brands of scale, FOX, Fox Sports, FX, Fox News, Nat Geo and STAR. And launched several new channels in support of this effort, including Fox Sports 1, FXX and STAR Sports.
Internationally, we concentrated on investments to develop further depth and leadership in India and Latin America, key emerging markets with a substantial growth opportunities. We've also saw to be optimistic and maximizing the value proposition of some of our businesses. For example, with the merger of Shine with Endemol, creating the Endemol Shine Group, the world's leading independent producer of content and IP.  As a result of this work, we feel for the Twenty-First Century Fox today, is well positioned to succeed in today's dynamic media market, as a global content creator and distributor. Despite the changes in our industry, you should not expect any seismic shift in our areas of focus or in the direction of travel of the company.
Operationally, we have consistently over delivered on our affiliate revenue plan, met our expectations on content monetization, but have fallen short in advertising revenue growth while also absorbing significant foreign exchange headwinds. James will comment further on our intense focus around creative excellence and storytelling, that consumer experience on our operating strength in execution. But on the point of financial strength, I did want to underscore our ongoing commitment to having Twenty-First Century Fox and a strong financial position to pursue opportunities while providing appropriate levels of shareholder returns.
As we look to deploy our capital for growth, we continue to have a strong bias towards building, not buying. We spent the last several years simplifying our portfolio and increasing the focus on what will drive incremental value. As we look at our portfolio businesses today, we don't see material gaping holes. But that's not to suggest that we won't pursue compelling opportunities. There may be opportunities to strengthen existing businesses with bolt-on acquisitions, such as our investment in TV India, or to acquire and develop new capabilities, particularly, in digital advertising and digital video generally, such as for example, our trueX acquisition.  These will require investments and ton of time, and we will be both opportunistic and disciplined as we evaluate the landscape, just as we have been in the past.
Our record on delivering capital return to shareholders is solid. In fact, by the end of fiscal 2016, we will have returned an excess of $24 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends over a 5-year period. This represents nearly 200% of free cash flow over that same period. This includes The $5 billion share repurchase authorization we announced today, which we intend to complete within the next 12 months. 
Our commitment to deliver value to our shareholders is not just a statement. And my father, James and I, are not only the leaders of this company, we are also among its most committed, most long-term and largest shareholders. As such, our interest are directly aligned with our investors.  That is to focus on capturing the opportunities from the strength of our assets to further drive long-term stockholder value.
And with that, I'll hand it over to John and James."
91031,307085981,850409,"Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2015",2015-08-05,"Earnings Calls","TFCF Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Lachlan. It's John, and good afternoon. At the outset, I'll remind you that because of the sales this past November, of our DBS businesses to Sky, our reported financial results for the year and for the fourth quarter are not like-for-like.  So to",1712,"Thanks, Lachlan. It's John, and good afternoon. At the outset, I'll remind you that because of the sales this past November, of our DBS businesses to Sky, our reported financial results for the year and for the fourth quarter are not like-for-like.  So to continue to present a more meaningful comparison, we are providing and commenting on total company adjusted revenue and EBITDA, which excludes the DBS businesses in all periods.
So let me start with the full year results. For the full year, total company adjusted revenues were $27 billion, up 3% over last year, driven by double-digit revenue growth in the cable segment, partially offset by comparisons against the prior year, which included the Super Bowl revenues in the Television segment, and a full year of Shine in the Film segment.
Total segment full year adjusted EBITDA is $6.49 billion. 3% higher than the year-ago, reflecting higher contributions from our cable and film segments, partially offset by lower results of the Television segment. Overall, we had a 6% negative impact on our EBITDA growth rate from foreign currency effects.
Reported net income from continuing operations attributable to the shareholders this year was $8.4 billion or $3.93 per share on a reported basis. This includes $4.2 billion of income, reflected as Other net, which largely relates to the gain from the sale of the DBS businesses to Sky, and also includes approximately $800 million of charges recorded in the fourth quarter, of which approximately half, relates to programming inventory that will no longer be aired and contract termination costs for the canceled COT20 Indian cricket tournament.  The majority of the balance and represents a charges from the disposition of certain pension liabilities.
Additionally, this year's equity earnings of affiliates results include income of approximately $600 million, primarily related to Sky's games on their sales of certain investments, partially offset by their amortization and other expenses related to the acquisition of that SKY Italia and Sky ID.
Excluding the net income effects and both years, of amounts reported in Other, net as well as the equity earnings adjustments, adjusted earnings per share were $1.72 compared to the adjusted year-ago result of $1.55. 
And now, let me cover the fourth quarter results. Fourth quarter adjusted revenues decreased by $635 million to $6.2 billion, as continued growth at the cable networks was more than offset by lower revenue at the film and Television segments. Total segment adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $1.54 billion, a 5% decline from a year ago, which reflects lower contributions of the film and Television segments, and a negative versus percentage point impact from foreign exchange.  From a bottom line perspective, making similar adjustments as in the annual results, fourth quarter adjusted EPS was up $0.39 this year, down $0.03 from the comparable $0.42 last year. 
Now touching on the main segments. We'll start with the cable networks, where revenues in the fourth quarter increased to 7% from last year, highlighted by an overall 8% increase in affiliate revenues and 4% advertising growth.  Domestic affiliate revenues increased 12%, primarily from higher average rates. Our reported international affiliate revenues were down 2%, but we had local currency growth of approximately 9%. 
The fourth quarter cable segment advertising revenue growth was led by international advertising increases of 14%, driven by STAR. The negative impact from foreign exchange was essentially offset by the first-time inclusion of the Fox Turkey in our FIC results. 
Domestic advertising was 2% lower than the prior year, as increases at Fox Sports 1 were offset by declines at FX, which had fewer original programming hours versus the prior year.
Total cable segment EBITDA in the fourth quarter of $1.22 billion was up 1% over the prior year. Increases at our international channels were mostly offset by an expected decline at our domestic channels from higher sports costs, as a result of new events, including the NASCAR Sprint Cup races, the U.S. Open Golf Tournament and the Women's World Cup.  Overall, expenses of the cable segment increased by 10% in the quarter, largely due to these new events at Fox Sports 1. 
The negative comparative effect from foreign exchange impacted the segment EBITDA growth rate by approximately 4%.
At our Television segment, fourth quarter EBITDA was $113 [ph] million, as compared to $145 million in the prior year. This largely reflects 14% lower advertising revenues from lower entertainment ratings, as well as higher sports programming costs due to the network broadcast of the U.S. Open and Women's World Cup, and this was all partially offset by continued retransmission consent revenue growth.
Turning to our Film segment. We reported fourth quarter EBITDA of $269 million, a 21% decline from last year. Revenues in the quarter decreased 32% due to the absence of Shine and difficult revenue comparisons to the prior year, which included the blockbuster releases of X-Men: Days of Future Past and Rio 2.
The EBITDA decline primarily reflects the absence of Shine's results, slightly lower TV production contributions and unfavorable impacts from foreign exchange.
So that closes up the comments on fiscal 2015. Let me comment on our outlook for fiscal 2016. Total segment EBITDA growth and consistent with our previous guidance practice, we're starting with the fiscal 2015 base year EBITDA of the $6.49 billion we just reported, which excludes the DBS segment contributions.
Now from a summary level, fiscal 2016 is projected to be a year of continued strong growth at our cable segment, challenging comparisons of our Film segment, due to the timing of the major releases and a continuation of the programming and marketing initiatives in support of ratings recovery at the Television segment. 
Now let me provide additional segment details. Our cable segment will lead the fiscal 2016 growth, driven by low double-digit affiliate fee increases led by the U.S. As we've commented on previously, our rate of expense growth will moderate in fiscal '16 to about half the high teens rate experienced in the previous 2 fiscal years, and this growth will be generally led by contractual stepups in sports rights and entertainment and digital investments at STAR.
So considering these factors, coupled with the impact of foreign exchange rates, we expect the cable segment fiscal 2016 EBITDA growth rate to be in the mid-teens range, with underlying double-digit EBITDA growth rate, and both the domestic and international channel portfolios.  Foreign exchange is expected to have an approximate 2% negative impact within this growth rate.
Turning to the Television segment. We're expecting a double-digit increase in retransmission consent revenues, while at revenues are expected to be in line with fiscal 2015. Expenses are anticipated to increase in the mid-single-digit range led by planned increases in our national sports contracts and by slightly higher marketing investments at the Fox Network to support new series.  And as a result, we expect overall Television EBITDA to be essentially flat with fiscal 2015.
At the Filmed Entertainment segment, while we're very excited about the upcoming release late, the timing impact of 3 tent-pole releases will impact EBITDA comparisons versus fiscal 2015. Specifically, at the end of the fiscal year, we will re-lease the sequels to X-Men and Independence Day, and in early July, Ice Age 5. This schedule will result in the recognition of significant releasing and pre-releasing costs in fiscal 2016, while the bulk of the EBITDA benefit from these films falls in fiscal 2017. Primarily, as a result of this comparative release schedule headwind and factoring in the impact of foreign exchange, we expect the Filmed Entertainment segment EBITDA to be around $200 million below the fiscal '15 result we just reported. 
So as we roll it all up and based on all of the assumptions inherent in our projections, we're anticipating total company segment EBITDA percentage growth rate for fiscal 2016 to be in the mid-single-digit range, above the $6.49 billion base level for fiscal 2015. This range anticipates a negative 3% impact from foreign currency headwinds using current rates. 
Now 6 months ago, we indicated that we expected our fiscal 2016 results to be in the mid-$7 billion range, and our outlook today is below that level. The primary factors causing this change have been noted publicly, including headwinds from corner foreign exchange and for releasing timing, for the sports and digital investments in India to support long-term growth and an updated view of the ad markets.
Regarding the remainder of the income statement, there are 2 items I'd call out to you for fiscal 2016. First, our equity earnings of affiliates will be impacted as compared to fiscal 2015 due to the costs from Hulu strategic growth initiative to ramp up their programming investment. Second, our tax rate is expected to increase to a more normalized rate in the low 30% range.
And finally, turning to cash flow and capital allocation. We ended the fiscal year with $8.4 billion in cash and approximately $19 billion in debt. We expect around the same level of working capital requirements in fiscal 2016 as we just had in fiscal '15. In fiscal '16, a contributor to this will be the temporary buildup of receivables from billings associated with those summer releases I just mentioned, and they will be collected in the early weeks of fiscal 2017. 
Additionally, we'll fund several investments in fiscal 2016, including the purchase of TV in India, Hulu on drafting spending, and payments to terminate the CLT20 contract in India, which we assumed in the ESS acquisition.
With regard to the buyback program. That we announced a year ago, we've now fully executed that program, and bought back $6 billion of Fox A shares during the last year. And as Lachlan mentioned, today, we announced the new $5 billion share buyback authorization, which we intend to complete within the next 12 months.
As we look to the efficiency of our balance sheet, our cash and leverage targets have not changed. We continue to target maintaining a $2 billion to $3 billion cash balance, and a gross leverage ratio of 2.5x to 3x. Given the level of shareholder returns and our investment capital, by the end of fiscal 2016, we expect to be much closer to both of those targets. And now let me turn it over to James."

And thanks, everyone, for being on the call. As we begin a new fiscal year, we're really pleased with where the business is. But of course, there's a lot of work to be done. Moving forward, our overall priori",1753,"Thanks very much, John, and thanks, Lachlan. And thanks, everyone, for being on the call. 
As we begin a new fiscal year, we're really pleased with where the business is. But of course, there's a lot of work to be done. Moving forward, our overall priorities are to build upon the goals we've set as the senior leadership team when we formed 21CF 2 years ago. 
First and foremost, as a creative company, we're focused on great storytelling across the business. Our continued creative execution, from our partnerships to the writers and producers across the spectrum, at TCFTV and FXT, to our sports investments and operations at STAR Sports in India, to the diverse and multifaceted slate that we continue to develop at Fox Filmed Entertainment, is the necessary ingredient to any continued and future success.
Secondly, and the crux of the changes in our industry, we have to make sure those stories get to our customers in the most effective and compelling way possible. And that's all about ensuring a great consumer experience, both in partnership with MVPDs and over-the-top via established platforms, such as Hulu or Netflix or Sky Go, or by creating totally new experiences to which customers can discover and consume content and engage with advertising.
Primarily, this digital video approach is about ensuring a high-quality On Demand and live experience, and a seamless multi-platform access approach that responds to customers' needs and meets and exceeds their expectations. These capabilities and enhancing the material in 21CF are a large focus for the team.
Thirdly, we recognize and we relish our position as a global company, with diverse and deep assets across the globe. We'll continue to focus on selective deep growth in markets that really matter. For example, India and Latin America, comprise more than 2/3 of our international advertising revenue, and we have a significant opportunity to continue to grow as a leader in these markets. Maintaining and enhancing our leadership positions over the next years will be a dramatic contributor to our overall growth of the company.
Our ability to execute on these strategic priorities will be critical to consistently delivering top line revenue and earnings growth, and creating long-term value for our shareholders and our plan achievs that. While we have not in the absolute visibility into the success of our shows and films, nor the precise data of advertising and foreign exchange markets, our fiscal 2016 plan is based on very realistic assumptions within the various markets in which we're active. 
As John outlined, next year's financial growth is entirely driven by our cable network's business, led by strong revenue increases, coupled with moderating cost growth. Approximately, 2/3 of this segment is expected 2016 revenues are generated by affiliate fees, with more than 80% of those revenues already locked in from existing affiliate agreements.
We also have very good visibility on the anticipated reduction of year-over-year cost growth, which is a direct result of our moving past the peak investment phase at our developing cable channels. Now there's been much attention paid and rightly so to the overall trends in the paid subscriber universe. Our operational focus on our channel distribution is balanced between our traditional markets and the emerging over-the-top services, as they're introduced in the market. We've been very successful so far, generating industry-leading affiliate fee growth for years. And with the realignment and strengthening of our key cable network brands, we expect this to continue. 
Specifically, even in the context of an expected 1% annual industry decline in the number of base domestic subscribers, we fully expect our total paid subscribers in the U.S. market and globally, to grow. While our most distributed networks, FX and Fox News, will likely see reductions in billable subscribers in line with the trends of the U.S. cable and satellite universe, the balance of our networks, including Fox Sports 1 and 2, FXX, National Geographic and National Geographic Wild, will experience good growth in domestic distribution.
It's also important to focus on the opportunity with existing and emerging over-the-top platforms. And given the strength of our channels and programming, we expect to be meaningfully participating in these platforms, creating new customer headroom and enhancing competition and innovation downstream.
Moving to our Television segment. The network continues to be an area of intense focus. But returning series such as Empire, Gotham and the Last Man On Earth, provide momentum that will build upon in the upcoming season. We're very focused on fortifying the Fox brand through adventurous, distinctive programming, and we're very excited to have 10 new series scheduled to Premiere next season.
Our creative efforts will be supported by retransmission consent group, and we're forward to progress in monetizing nonlinear impressions, as the linear non-live business will continue to face ratings pressure as consumers continue to customize their viewing habits.
At our Film segment, while we expect to drop in year-over-year profits due to timing of our releases as John has outlined, we have high expectations for what is set up to be a very strong Slate, with more releases in this past year, supported by significant the franchise films, including Fantastic 4, The Maze Runner, Alvin and the Chipmunks, X-Men and Independence Day. And new franchises led by the Peanuts Movie, Deadpool and Ms. Perrigrin's Home for Peculiars.
And in our Television production business, a very excited about opportunities to build on our returning shows, as well as ramping up the creative focus to develop new hits.
So overall, barring unforeseen events outside of our control, we have a degree of confidence in achieving our earnings guidance for fiscal 2016. Looking forward over those next 12 months, our main focus will be on execution, particularly in the areas of creative excellence, digital video and advertising capabilities and channel distribution.
Looking further out, while it goes without saying that we're not going to provide specific guidance for 2017 and beyond, I would like to say that we feel very good about the trajectory of our business over the next few years. Our cable networks are expected to maintain the momentum we are forecasting for fiscal 2016. Our Television segment is stabilizing, with new management of the network, and some key building blocks that will enable it to reap the benefits of ongoing strongly transmission increases and materially enhanced advertising capabilities, to turn this segment into a source of growth after number of disappointing years. We'll reap the benefits of the investments at STAR, as India becomes a real growth engine for our company in 2017 and beyond. 
We'll also benefit in 2017 in the Film segment, as the timing issues of 2016 reverse, and a slate of exciting films come to market over the next 2 years to drive significant profit growth in the Film segment from the lows of 2016. 
Our 2017 results will be further strengthened by the broadcast of Super Bowl 51, and the impact of the next presidential election. We recognize there will be challenges to navigate the shift in digital landscape. However, we believe the unique strength and scale of these franchises make the next few years a period of great opportunity.
Now as I mentioned earlier, we're a creative business at heart. And that's what we put on the screen for customers that drives the whole business. Many of you have heard me with the expression of investing upstream, and that's exactly our focus. In the film business, we'll be releasing 23 features over the next year, and our Television production business, we plan on producing a total of approximately 40 series across domestic broadcast and cable networks. 
By owning the vast majority of content that we program in our ours, we are able to better monetize our IP across multiple revenue streams. But it's not just quantity, of course. We need to produce hits. And as a result, we need to continually ensure that we have the right environment and culture that attracts great creators for our company. We're very proud of our creative partnerships, with some of the greatest writers, directors and producers in the world, including James Cameron, Ridley Scott, Brian Singer, Ryan Murphy, Seth MacFarlane, Howard Gordon, Brian Grazer, Lee Daniels and any strong, Cris Carter, Steve Levenson and so many more.
The talents across our entertainment news and sports operations is the cornerstone of our business. And it enables us to continue to take creative risks and seek new opportunities in formats in which to deliver our stories.
Secondly, we're focused on enhancing our capabilities to capitalize on new opportunities to more directly reach and serve our customers, and provide solutions for the advertisers. On the advertising side, these capabilities are centered on obtaining better measurement of nonlinear impressions, improving the monetization of both linear and nonlinear impressions, enabling programmatic sales, and better leveraging trueX throughout our portfolio.
We're encouraged by the early progress we are seeing, and in fact, we expect and plan to be able to offset the decline we are seeing in domestic network entertainment advertising by better monetization of our digital and nonlinear audience over the next 12 months. 
On the consumer side, we're thinking a lot about our presence in the direct-to-consumer digital video space. Throughout our global portfolio, particularly, at Sky and in India Tata Sky and with Hotstar, we had a great experience in direct-to-consumer businesses. Customer focus and product-focused. Sky today operates the biggest streaming business in Europe, Hulu operates the second largest trading platform in the U.S. and one of the largest digital long-form and supported platforms in the world. And we're also operating the largest over-the-top platform in India. 
We've announced recently that Brian Sullivan and many of you know, from his recent time within the growth of Sky Deutschland, he will previously had announced as customer group, is now heading up our direct-to-consumer product efforts here.
We're very focused on applying all of our enterprise to creating with our partners, a great experience, where our programming is available, discoverable and accessible in the way that today's and tomorrow's customer expects and deserves.
So as you can see, there's much happening and much to do. Before but it's a Q&A, I just like to underscore Lachlan's earlier comment regarding our alignment with shareholders interest. Because as we focus on growth, opportunities and long-term value creation, we view this direct alignment to be there positive feature of the company for all the shareholders of Twenty-First Century Fox. 
Now I'd like to turn back over to Reed."

The -- look, I think -- look, first of all, domestic affiliate growth has been pretty strong, and as I said in my comments, I think we will continue a lot of that momentum. We've got really good visibility on the portfolio, and as I said, about 80% of next year's numbers. And as -- from time to time, you get the opportunities to reset that. We think there's still gains to be made, both in volume, with respect to distributing -- getting twofold distribution a number of our networks, as well as in price, as we continue to invest on screen and really concentrate around these core brands that we've talked about. So we're pretty optimistic about it, actually, from our portfolio's perspective, which has some unique kind of elements to it. So we feel good about that. It's also really exciting time in terms of these affiliate relationships because fundamentally, with the vast majority of customers consuming multi-channel television through what other traditional MVPDs, we know there's a huge amount of opportunities to innovate on those platforms. And both in th standpoint of ad innovation, from the standpoint of new pricing models, et cetera, we think that actually, it's a pretty exciting environment to actually be operating in. In addition to that, we've seen new entrants. And I think the opportunities for growth, with new over-the-top kind of -- full or medium service MVPDs emerging, we think it's a real positive, as you see downstream competition increasing that drives a lot of innovation, it drives innovation across the whole kind of subscriber universe, and creates new headroom for growth into -- what we previously called the kind of broad only households, which really become part of the pay TV universe through these services, which we think is a positive. With respect to our flexibility to produce -- to go direct-to-consumer and things like that, without getting to specifics of individual deals, we do -- we have quite a lot of flexibility in terms of how we license the programming, how we license our channels, and how we price them both on a wholesale and retail basis. But we haven't made any big decisions on that point at this point. And there are no current plans from an independently priced direct-to-consumer offering right now."

Look, Hulu is going really well right now. We're very encouraged by it. We're soon -- the company is soon to surpass 10 million paid customers with Hulu plus, and really has the velocity that it hasn't had for years, so we're very excited about that. I think growth is coming from a variety of places. I don't think it's sort of a zero-sum game between Netflix or an Amazon Prime and Hulu. It seems like most customers and many, many customers will have both. And many customers are MVPD customers as well. So it's a comes from a variety of places, to the very attractive price points. And I think importantly, with a really distinctive offering. So when you look at the offering of currents, when you look at some of the new output agreements that are coming through, Hulu and the breadth of programming there that the team puts together, and the partners contribute, it's a very much unique offering. So people want it in addition to other things, and that's driving really good growth right now. I think the standpoint of -- the plans for Hulu, right now, Disney and us, who are partners in Hulu -- obviously, Comcast is a partner but it's operating under the consent decree for a while -- we are very committed to growing this business. We think it's a very exciting business. We think we can grow it substantially more than it has -- than it has gotten to today. And it can be a very, very valuable asset for us. I would say, when you talk about getting credit for the value, it's a little frustrating. We do think it's a great asset inside our portfolio, but similar to many of the nonconsolidated assets in our portfolio from -- there are stake in Endemol Shine to the big one at Sky. It is a little frustrating, and we don't believe we get the value for those assets. Stake and -- our value in the Sky business this year has gone from $9 billion to well over $12 billion in a space of 12 months, not including the substantial and very tax-efficient distribution of capital in the transaction that we executed to merge with 3 [ph] Skies that Lachlan mentioned in his remarks.

We think advertising technology is an important part of that. The trueX acquisition was an important acquisition for us because we really embedded it into the operations of the business, and that's leading to new opportunities. I think from a standpoint of analytics, that we've been doing already and really gearing up outside of that, it fits in very well, from the standpoint of looking at new things that we can do in terms of product innovation, from engagement units to time to shift to the advertising and other things, with think that, that's pretty exciting. And in the streaming environment, something that you can do on a much more targeted and addressable basis, so you can be more efficient  with lighter loads and create a better customer experience in the On Demand marketplace, as well as the linear marketplace as well. So those are the sorts of things that we're focused and looking at, as well as really, just really getting -- putting more weight into the digital sales effort itself, working with the clients and agencies, around creating the currencies that really -- can generate demand. On the international markets, our x U.S. markets, already -- to give you an example, the Hotstar platform in India, which is -- with a very, very rapidly -- is a rapidly growing mobile Internet platform around all of our programming that we create, known India, which is Lot. We are working very closely between the STAR teams and the Fox Networks, in particular, the trueX team, to build the ad platform underneath that. We've sort of taken a view that we really want to build audience first, and then the ad platform is being kind of done in parallel. But this capability directly applies, and is being applied to creating some of those new opportunities. And I think the other piece here on Latin America and India, and particularly, India -- don't forget how stronger than the average as a market is. When you have a real position of ratings leadership that we have and that we can sustain that, we're able to really grow our linear advertising very, very attractively. And still, the majority of that marketplace for a while yet, is that way, and there's a huge amount of growth to come. I mean, you don't see it really in the numbers consolidated because of the sports investment we've been making, but the Entertainment business, alone in India in fiscal '15, is over a $300 million EBITDA business. And that's something that is growing at a very rapid pace. So it's a real -- there's a real advertising marketplace there that is growing organically, and we're able to grow our share as we go forward."

But our real focus is on launching the show, giving it the appropriate marketing support, and getting out there properly. The nonlinear monetization on that is in addition, is a new feature here. And what we seeing going forward is the ability to monetize much more spread out viewing. We've talked a lot as an industry, around 3 days versus 7 days, I think we're probably more focused on 30 days and 6 months. We're still seeing customers come to the pilot episode of Empire on some platforms. And in the coming years, being able to monetize that audience, which is a quality, live, engaged audience, is going to be just as important as audiences in other windows.

It's -- listen, we are -- we're big believers in the concert business, we are big believers in IP. And we think scale is important. But I think our focus, as we've been saying for a while, our focus is very much in execution. We really like the product mix that we have and the asset mix that we have. And we are able to dial up that scale, as you've seen, both in terms of investing and markets, where we have really a deep presence like in -- parts of Latin America or India. And in the U.S., where we're increasing the volume of our production pretty dramatically. And we feel like we have the capability to do that without commenting on any hypothetical future activity. We like the asset mix. We think we're in a good position. And I think to your point about this sort of changing landscape, as I mentioned earlier in my remarks, and I think we sort of fell a unique set of assets here, where -- even though we can talk about the whole MVPD universe, and as you mentioned, the kind of total, the total subscriber trends there, but our channels and brands still have headroom for growth, many of them, most of them, actually, because they're at different late stage, if you will. And also, we're really going in and challenging in markets where we're bringing new competition, in the national sports network market, in the business news market, in places like that, that have dominant players. And we're really come from a different base really coming from a different base, where they're going and taking share. In June, we outrated ESPN on Fox Sports 1, for the first time, kind of a milestone. And we're very excited about the opportunities for those things to grow. But that doesn't mean that we're complacent. The fundamental point that I think we're trying to make here is that we are more proactive than never, and we'll be, with our partners in the MVPD universe and over-the-top, players coming in to really make sure that from a customer experience point of view, the OnDemand kind of universe for them and the product offering of our set of our set of content, is something that is really special and works for them and meets and exceeds their expectations. And that's something that I think, from the standpoint of -- I think the last 20 years, maybe, in the cable industry, are the channels businesses, et cetera, haven't really -- as an industry in the U.S. have been focused on, as a large part of our business is direct-to-consumer around the world, we're really applying a lot of that, and thinking about how we partner with all of these players, as well as increase the capability ourselves to go out and do a better job there and grow the business."

I gave it to Lachlan, so it's okay. It's a -- listen, I think it's a good question. I think what we have to think about it -- what we do and as a team here, this is something that occupies a huge amount of our time, is thinking about how do we -- as the platform choices the customers are making, really, obviously you've seen a lot more competition downstream in terms of the retailing of video programming, either on ad supported or not ad supported, Internet networks like Netflix versus kind of smaller bundles, like Hulu Plus, there's -- we need to get a better understanding. And we've developed this now, about where our best business is, and then what we need to do within those business to do -- to make it better. So for example, when we talk about our digital nonlinear Advertising business starting to really get a little bit of traction in thinking about offsetting some of the linear declines, a lot of that comes both from our own sort of either authenticated apps and online distribution of our products. But really, a lot of it comes from Hulu inventory that we're able to monetize better and better as we go along. So it's really about working in this developing system to be able to create new opportunities, to do better than we're doing in the linear kind of scheduled multi-channel environment. And I think it's really important to note that even though -- we might be going to 10 million Hulu customers, and there's 10 [ph] growing to 10x million broadband-only households, so to speak, really this 85 million, 90 million MBPD household marketplace, all-digital, with new services being rolled out through that, that universe, is a huge opportunity in terms of ad innovation, in terms of bundling and pricing, in terms of OnDemand capability. And we're very committed to making that the best experience we can in partnership with some of our biggest wholesale customers, via DIRECTV or Comcast or whomever. So I think our goal here is to be a really flexible licensor to make our distributors successful but also, to make the economics of distribution of these platforms enhanced from earlier today. And that's really come from, as I said in my comments, discoverability of our content, accessibility across multiple platforms and multiplier devices, and ad innovation that is candidly, less interruptive, more targeted, lower load and higher-priced."

And I think that's been the story for the better part of 20 years. So just think, James, as you look out over the next few years, is -- essentially, the build-out of the platform in India done, and margin starts to grow along with revenue, or is there potentially more to invest in India that we should make sure we think about our models? And I'll just ask a second one for John. I know -- I hate to rehash Ben's question, but a math challenge. So my take -- cable networks at mid-teens and minus $200 million on film, and flat on TV, Other up a little bit, I get 7% growth, $6.95 billion.

I think I would say, it's probably been, I don't know if it's in 20 years or it's in 15 years ago, we started broadcasting in Hindi, and created Star Plus, and that really, just put us in the pathway to turning around STAR TV overall, and particularly, creating something in India that can be profitable, and would lift our Asian business. Remember, before that, it was a big -- it was a heavy loss maker. So I think over the last 15 years, we were able to kind of organically invest in programming, organically invest in some new channels in certain areas. And that's a pretty good place. Certainly, over the last 6 or 7 years, we've really dialed it up in terms of how we invest there and what we want to do. And you're right. Listen -- I mean, the regional language business is something we felt was important for us. We do that in a combination of acquisitions with Asianet and more recently, TV but also, organically, creating STAR Prava, STAR and so forth, some organic offshoots in regional languages. I think at this point, we're really seeing the scale of the sports investment, which is really, a bigger organic investment than anything we've done there in the past peak. And we have good visibility around the revenue growth around the business and the amelioration of the rate of growth in the sports investment going forward. So I do think that when we look out in '17, '18 and beyond, you can see real operating leverage in terms of profits in the India business come through. Now that said, we are -- we're big believers in the marketplace. And if we saw opportunities there that can materially enhance the value of the business, we would have to be very thoughtful about them. But I think, from an organic investment point of view, outside of the digital investment in Hotstar and really growing that, you're seeing a peak in the Television business given the scale of the sports investment we've made. And we don't see any new major sports rights in the very near-term horizon that would materially change that. We've successfully exited the CLT20 competition this year, and launched the second season of Cabadi [ph] actually, at a very cost-effective rate, which is year-on-year 45% in its early matches, so we think that's pretty good. So I think we're still very much on track to see $0.5 billion or so of EBITDA in India within the next sort of 3 years or so -- and a real velocity towards $1 billion of EBITDA, shortly thereafter, around the end of the decade, at the beginning of the next month."

The portfolio is really coming through now, and we're starting to see the impact of the investments in deals that we've made over the last 18 months to 2 years, as those things kind of rolled through in Fox Sports 1. With respect to Thursday Night Football, first of all, without getting into idle speculation, I would imagine that a lot of that would end up being in broadcast, and not on Fox Sports 1, so it's a slightly different question. But it's very -- we've been a partner of the NFL for many, many years. We love the NFL products. We think our customers love football. We know they do. And it remains and continues to be, a really unique offering for customers. And we're always interested in finding ways that make sense to enhance what we can do and to try to do more with really unique events, like the NFL.

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on what has shaped up to be a very busy day for all of you.
It's my first time back on our earnings call for a number of years, and I must say it's a privilege to be back at the company in an executive capacity and on this call with you, and with Reed, with John and with James.
As you know, on July 1, we formally completed a leadership transition that we have been working towards for some time. James and I both appreciate the board's confidence in us, and we are keenly aware of the responsibilities that come with it. We are extraordinarily energized to be leading the company at a time when there are so many opportunities ahead. But of course, the company finds itself in this position, thanks in very large part to Chase, who we must thank for his many years of exceptional leadership. And while Chase will no longer be joining these calls, he continues to be highly involved in many aspects of the company.
His ongoing counsel is a valued asset to us.
James and I have been immersed in Twenty-First Century Fox and all its iterations and in the broader industry generally for at least the past 25 years. This background and context will serve us well as we partner to lead Twenty-First Century Fox through a time of accelerated industry change. I can assure you that we, the board and the senior management team are intensely focused on the array of opportunities that are emerging for Twenty-First Century Fox and for our shareholders.
Now while there has been a particular emphasis on it recently, the reality is that our industry has always been evolving and innovating. The imperative is how we respond to it. Every aspect of our business is being affected by increasingly rapid change, from how we develop content, to delivery, to consumer engagement and, of course, to how we monetize it all. The scale and speed of this change will, to some, be overwhelming. 
But a key underlying trend is important to recognize here. More people are now watching more quality storytelling than ever. They're just consuming it differently given the growing array of options available to them. This is a key and positive trend.
Empowered by new technologies, our customers are demanding distinct and better ways to consumer content, personalized to them in a variety of new nonlinear environments. These new viewing experiences bring with them both new challenges, which we do not underestimate, but also significant opportunities for viewers, advertisers and distributors that simply have not been possible in the linear world. These challenges and opportunities are forefront in our mind as we develop and execute over-the-top distribution and advertising strategies.
One thing is very clear to us. In this environment, it is not enough to simply adapt to change. To succeed in this environment, we must lead change, and that is what all of us in the senior team are committed to do. 
But we also understand that linear viewing remains a key driver of our channels business, which, in turn, is a direct result of our continuing commitment to finding and investing in the best content and content creators around the world. This commitment will not diminish under the new management structure and, if anything, will increase.
Sport and news are also more important than ever in the linear world. Fox Sports, specifically Fox Sports 1, is showing strong viewing momentum as FOX News also continues to deliver dominant ratings. Our goal has been and remains to simplify our business and focus on the content, the brand and the markets that are most valuable to our customers and to our shareholders.
We separated Twenty-First Century Fox News Corp. to drive value and focus. We merged these guys into one entity, and we consolidated strategic minority investments, including the YES Network, ESPN STAR Sports, Fox Pan American Sports, Asianet and MATV. We refocused our channels in the key global brands of scale: FOX, Fox Sports, FX, FOX News, Nat Geo and STAR; and launched several new channels in support of this effort, including Fox Sports 1, FXX and STAR Sports.
Internationally, we concentrated our investments to develop further depth and leadership in India and Latin America, key emerging markets with substantial growth opportunities. We've also sought to be optimistic in maximizing the value and position of some of our businesses. For example, with the merger of Shine with Endemol, creating the Endemol Shine Group, the world's leading independent producer of content and IP. 
As a result of this work, we feel Twenty-First Century Fox today is well positioned to succeed in today's dynamic media market as a global content creator and distributor. Despite the changes in our industry, you should not expect any seismic shift in our areas of focus or in the direction of travel of the company.
Operationally, we have consistently over delivered on our affiliate revenue plan, met our expectations on content monetization, but have fallen short in advertising revenue growth while also absorbing significant foreign exchange headwinds. James will comment further on our intense focus around creative excellence and storytelling, that consumer experience and on our operating strength and execution. But on the point of financial strength, I did want to underscore our ongoing commitment to having Twenty-First Century Fox in a strong financial position to pursue opportunities while providing appropriate levels of shareholder returns.
As we look to deploy our capital for growth, we continue to have a strong bias towards building, not buying. We spent the last several years simplifying our portfolio and increasing the focus on what will drive incremental value. As we look at our portfolio of businesses today, we don't see material gaping holes. But that's not to suggest that we won't pursue compelling opportunities. There may be opportunities to strengthen existing businesses with bolt-on acquisitions, such as our investment in MATV in India; or to acquire and develop new capabilities, particularly in digital advertising and digital video generally, such as, for example, our trueX acquisition. These will require investments from time to time, and we will be both opportunistic and disciplined as we evaluate the landscape, just as we have been in the past.
Our record on delivering capital return to shareholders is solid. In fact, by the end of fiscal 2016, we will have returned in excess of $24 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends over a 5-year period. This represents nearly 200% of free cash flow over that same period. This includes the $5 billion share repurchase authorization we announced today, which we intend to complete within the next 12 months. 
Our commitment to deliver value to our shareholders is not just a statement. And my father, James and I are not only the leaders of this company, we are also among its most committed, most long-term and largest shareholders. As such, our interests are directly aligned with our investors, that is to focus on capturing the opportunities from the strength of our assets to further drive long-term stockholder value.
And with that, I'll hand it over to John and James."
91031,307085981,850505,"Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2015",2015-08-05,"Earnings Calls","TFCF Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Lachlan. It's John, and good afternoon. At the outset, I'll remind you that because of the sale this past November of our DBS businesses to Sky, our reported financial results for the year and for the fourth quarter are not like-for-like. So to co",1700,"Thanks, Lachlan. It's John, and good afternoon. At the outset, I'll remind you that because of the sale this past November of our DBS businesses to Sky, our reported financial results for the year and for the fourth quarter are not like-for-like. So to continue to present a more meaningful comparison, we're providing and commenting on total company adjusted revenue and EBITDA, which excludes the DBS businesses in all periods.
So let me start with the full year results. For the full year, total company adjusted revenues were $27 billion, up 3% over last year, driven by double-digit revenue growth in the Cable segment, partially offset by comparisons against the prior year, which included the Super Bowl revenues in the Television segment and a full year of Shine in the Film segment.
Total segment full year adjusted EBITDA is $6.49 billion, 3% higher than a year ago, reflecting higher contributions from our Cable and Film segments, partially offset by lower results at the Television segment. Overall, we had a 6% negative impact on our EBITDA growth rate from foreign currency effects.
Reported net income from continuing operations attributable to shareholders this year was $8.4 billion or $3.93 per share on a reported basis. This includes $4.2 billion of income, reflected as Other, net, which largely relates to the gain from the sale of the DBS businesses to Sky; and also includes approximately $800 million of charges recorded in the fourth quarter, of which approximately half relates to programming inventory that will no longer be aired and contract termination costs for the canceled CLT20 Indian cricket tournament. The majority of the balance represents charges from the disposition of certain pension liabilities.
Additionally, this year's equity earnings of affiliate results include income of approximately $600 million, primarily related to Sky's gains on their sales of certain investments, partially offset by their amortization and other expenses related to the acquisition of Sky Italia and Sky D.
Excluding the net income effects in both years, of amounts reported in Other, net as well as the equity earnings adjustments, adjusted earnings per share were $1.72 compared to the adjusted year-ago result of $1.55. 
And now let me cover the fourth quarter results. Fourth quarter adjusted revenues decreased by $635 million to $6.2 billion as continued growth at the cable networks was more than offset by lower revenue at the Film and Television segments. Total segment adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $1.54 billion, a 5% decline from a year ago, which reflects lower contributions of the Film and Television segments and a negative 6 percentage point impact from foreign exchange. From a bottom line perspective, making similar adjustments as in the annual results, fourth quarter adjusted EPS was $0.39 this year, down $0.03 from the comparable $0.42 last year. 
Now touching on the main segments. We'll start with the Cable Networks, where revenues in the fourth quarter increased 7% from last year, highlighted by an overall 8% increase in affiliate revenues and 4% advertising growth. Domestic affiliate revenues increased 12%, primarily from higher average rates. Our reported international affiliate revenues were down 2%, but we had local currency growth of approximately 9%. 
The fourth quarter Cable segment advertising revenue growth was led by international advertising increases of 14%, driven by STAR. The negative impact from foreign exchange was essentially offset by the first-time inclusion of Fox Turkey in our FIC results. Domestic advertising was 2% lower than the prior year as increases at Fox Sports 1 were offset by declines at FX, which had fewer original programming hours versus the prior year.
Total Cable segment EBITDA in the fourth quarter of $1.22 billion was up 1% over the prior year. Increases at our international channels were mostly offset by an expected decline at our domestic channels from higher sports costs as a result of new events, including the NASCAR Sprint Cup races, the U.S. Open Golf tournament and the Women's World Cup.  Overall, expenses at the Cable segment increased by 10% in the quarter, largely due to these new events at Fox Sports 1. The negative comparative effect from foreign exchange impacted the segment EBITDA growth rate by approximately 4%.
At our Television segment, fourth quarter EBITDA was $113 million as compared to $145 million in the prior year. This largely reflects 14% lower advertising revenues from lower entertainment ratings as well as higher sports programming costs due to the network broadcast of the U.S. Open and Women's World Cup. And this was all partially offset by continued retransmission consent revenue growth.
Turning to our Film segment. We reported fourth quarter EBITDA of $269 million, a 21% decline from last year. Revenues in the quarter decreased 32% due to the absence of Shine and difficult revenue comparisons to the prior year, which included the blockbuster releases of X-Men: Days of Future Past and Rio 2. The EBITDA decline primarily reflects the absence of Shine's results, slightly lower TV production contributions and unfavorable impacts from foreign exchange.
So that closes out the comments on fiscal 2015. Let me comment on our outlook for fiscal 2016. Total segment EBITDA growth and consistent with our previous guidance practice, we're starting with the fiscal 2015 base year EBITDA of the $6.49 billion we just reported, which excludes the DBS segment contributions.
Now from a summary level, fiscal 2016 is projected to be a year of continued strong growth at our Cable segment, challenging comparisons at our Film segment due to the timing of major releases and a continuation of the programming and marketing initiatives in support of ratings recovery at the Television segment. Now let me provide additional segment details. 
Our Cable segment will lead the fiscal 2016 growth, driven by low double-digit affiliate fee increases led by the U.S. As we've commented on previously, our rate of expense growth will moderate in fiscal '16 to about half the high-teens rate experienced in the previous 2 fiscal years, and this growth will be generally led by contractual step-ups in sports rights and entertainment and digital investments at STAR. So considering these factors, coupled with the impact of foreign exchange rates, we expect the Cable segment fiscal 2016 EBITDA growth rate to be in the mid-teens range, with underlying double-digit EBITDA growth rate in both the domestic and international channel portfolios. Foreign exchange is expected to have an approximate 2% negative impact within this growth rate.
Turning to the Television segment. We're expecting a double-digit increase in retransmission consent revenues, while ad revenues are expected to be in line with fiscal 2015. Expenses are anticipated to increase in the mid-single-digit range led by planned increases in our national sports contracts and by slightly higher marketing investments at the Fox Network to support new series. As a result, we expect overall Television EBITDA to be essentially flat with fiscal 2015.
At the Filmed Entertainment segment, while we're very excited about the upcoming release slate, the timing impact of 3 tent-pole releases will impact EBITDA comparisons versus fiscal 2015. Specifically, at the end of the fiscal year, we will release the sequels to X-Men and Independence Day; and in early July, Ice Age 5. The schedule will result in the recognition of significant releasing and pre-releasing costs in fiscal 2016, while the bulk of the EBITDA benefit from these films falls in fiscal 2017. Primarily, as a result of this comparative release schedule headwind and factoring in the impact of foreign exchange, we expect the Filmed Entertainment segment EBITDA to be around $200 million below the fiscal '15 result we just reported. 
So as we roll it all up and based on all of the assumptions inherent in our projections, we're anticipating total company segment EBITDA percentage growth rate for fiscal 2016 to be in the mid-single-digit range above the $6.49 billion base level for fiscal 2015. This range anticipates a negative 3% impact from foreign currency headwinds using current rates. 
Now 6 months ago, we indicated that we expected our fiscal 2016 results to be in the mid-$7 billion range, and our outlook today is below that level. The primary factors causing this change have been noted publicly, including headwinds from foreign exchange and film releasing timing, for the sports and digital investments in India to support long-term growth and an updated view of the ad markets.
Regarding the remainder of the income statement, there are 2 items I'd call out to you for fiscal 2016: first, our equity earnings of affiliates will be impacted as compared to fiscal 2015 due to the costs from Hulu's strategic growth initiative to ramp up their programming investment; second, our tax rate is expected to increase to a more normalized rate in the low 30% range.
And finally, turning to cash flow and capital allocation. We ended the fiscal year with $8.4 billion in cash and approximately $19 billion in debt. We expect around the same level of working capital requirements in fiscal 2016 as we just had in fiscal '15. In fiscal '16, a contributor to this will be the temporary buildup of receivables from billings associated with those summer releases I just mentioned, and they will be collected in the early weeks of fiscal 2017. Additionally, we'll fund several investments in fiscal 2016, including the purchase of MATV in India, Hulu and DraftKings funding and payments to terminate the CLT20 contract in India, which we assumed in the ESS acquisition.
With regard to the buyback program that we announced a year ago, we've now fully executed that program and bought back $6 billion of Fox A shares during the last year. And as Lachlan mentioned, today, we announced the new $5 billion share buyback authorization, which we intend to complete within the next 12 months.
As we look to the efficiency of our balance sheet, our cash and leverage targets have not changed. We continue to target maintaining a $2 billion to $3 billion cash balance and a gross leverage ratio of 2.5x to 3x. Given the level of shareholder returns and our investment capital, by the end of fiscal 2016, we expect to be much closer to both of those targets. 
And now let me turn it over to James."
91031,307085981,850505,"Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2015",2015-08-05,"Earnings Calls","TFCF Corporation","Executives","Thanks very much, John, and thanks, Lachlan. And thanks, everyone, for being on the call. As we begin a new fiscal year, we're really pleased with where the business is, but of course, there's a lot of work to be done. Moving forward, our overall priori",1755,"Thanks very much, John, and thanks, Lachlan. And thanks, everyone, for being on the call. 
As we begin a new fiscal year, we're really pleased with where the business is, but of course, there's a lot of work to be done. Moving forward, our overall priorities are to build upon the goals we've set as the senior leadership team when we formed 21CF 2 years ago. 
First and foremost, as a creative company, we're focused on great storytelling across the business. Our continued creative execution, from our partnerships to the writers and producers across the spectrum, at TCFTV and FXP, to our sports investments and operations at STAR Sports in India, to the diverse and multifaceted slate that we continue to develop at Fox Filmed Entertainment, is the necessary ingredient to any continued and future success.
Secondly, and at the crux of the changes in our industry, we have to make sure those stories get to our customers in the most effective and compelling way possible. And that's all about ensuring a great consumer experience, both in partnership with MVPDs and over-the-top via established platforms, such as Hulu or Netflix or Sky Go; or by creating totally new experiences to which customers can discover and consume content and engage with advertising. Primarily, this digital video approach is about ensuring a high-quality on-demand and live experience and a seamless multi-platform access approach that responds to customers' needs and meets and exceeds their expectations. These capabilities and enhancing the material in 21CF are a large focus for the team.
Thirdly, we recognize and we relish our position as a global company, with diverse and deep assets across the globe. We'll continue to focus on selective deep growth in markets that really matter. For example, India and Latin America comprise more than 2/3 of our international advertising revenue, and we have a significant opportunity to continue to grow as a leader in these markets. Maintaining and enhancing our leadership positions over the next years will be a dramatic contributor to our overall growth of the company.
Our ability to execute on these strategic priorities will be critical to consistently delivering top line revenue and earnings growth and creating long-term value for our shareholders, and our plan achieves that. While we have neither the absolute visibility into the success of our shows and films, nor the precise state of the advertising and foreign exchange markets, our fiscal 2016 plan is based on very realistic assumptions within the various markets in which we're active. 
As John outlined, next year's financial growth is entirely driven by our Cable Networks business, led by strong revenue increases coupled with moderating cost growth. Approximately 2/3 of this segment's expected 2016 revenues are generated by affiliate fees, with more than 80% of those revenues already locked in from existing affiliate agreements. We also have very good visibility on the anticipated reduction of year-over-year cost growth, which is a direct result of our moving past the peak investment phase at our developing cable channels. 
Now there's been much attention paid and rightly so to the overall trends in the paid subscriber universe. Our operational focus on our channel distribution is balanced between our traditional markets and the emerging over-the-top services as they are introduced in the market. We've been very successful so far at generating industry-leading affiliate fee growth for years. And with the realignment and strengthening of our key Cable Network brands, we expect this to continue. 
Specifically, even in the context of an expected 1% annual industry decline in the number of base domestic subscribers, we fully expect our total paid subscribers in the U.S. market and globally to grow. While our most distributed networks, FX and FOX News, will likely see reductions in billable subscribers in line with the trends of the U.S. cable and satellite universe; the balance of our networks, including Fox Sports 1 and 2, FXX, National Geographic and National Geographic Wild, will experience good growth in domestic distribution. It's also important to focus on the opportunity with existing and emerging over-the-top platforms. And given the strength of our channels and programming, we expect to be meaningfully participating in these platforms, creating new customer headroom and enhancing competition and innovation downstream.
Moving to our Television segment. The network continues to be an area of intense focus. But returning series, such as Empire, Gotham and Last Man On Earth, provide momentum that we'll build upon in the upcoming season. We're very focused on fortifying the Fox brand through adventurous, distinctive programming, and we're very excited to have 10 new series scheduled to premiere next season. Our creative efforts will be supported by retransmission consent fee growth. And we're looking forward to progress in monetizing nonlinear impressions as the linear non-live business will continue to face ratings pressure as consumers continue to customize their viewing habits.
At our Film segment, while we expect to drop in year-over-year profits due to timing of our releases, as John has outlined, we have high expectations for what is set up to be a very strong slate, with more releases in this past year supported by significant franchise films, including Fantastic Four, The Maze Runner, Alvin and the Chipmunks, X-Men and Independence Day; and new franchises, led by The Peanuts Movie, Deadpool and Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiars. And at our Television production business, we're very excited about opportunities to build on our returning shows as well as ramping up the creative focus to develop new hits.
So overall, barring unforeseen events outside of our control, we have a high degree of confidence in achieving our earnings guidance for fiscal 2016. Looking forward over those next 12 months, our main focus will be on execution, particularly in the areas of creative excellence, digital video and advertising capabilities and channel distribution.
Looking further out, while it goes without saying that we're not going to provide specific guidance for 2017 and beyond, I would like to say that we feel very good about the trajectory of our business over the next few years. Our Cable Networks are expected to maintain the momentum we're forecasting for fiscal 2016. Our Television segment is stabilizing, with new management at the network and some key building blocks that will enable it to reap the benefits of ongoing strong retransmission increases and materially enhanced advertising capabilities to turn this segment into a source of growth after a number of disappointing years. We'll reap the benefits of the investments at STAR as India becomes a real growth engine for our company in 2017 and beyond. We'll also benefit in 2017 in the Film segment as the timing issues of 2016 reverse and a slate of exciting films come to market over the next 2 years to drive significant profit growth in this -- in the Film segment from the lows of 2016. 
Our 2017 results will be further strengthened by the broadcast of Super Bowl 51 and the impact of the next presidential election. We recognize there'll be challenges to navigate the shift in digital landscape. However, we believe the unique strength and scale of these franchises make the next 2 years a period of great opportunity.
Now as I mentioned earlier, we're a creative business at heart. And that's what we've put on the screen for customers that drives the whole business. Many of you have heard me use the expression investing upstream, and that's exactly our focus. In the Film business, we'll be releasing 23 features over the next year. In our Television production business, we plan on producing a total of approximately 40 series across domestic broadcast and cable networks. By owning the vast majority of content that we program on our networks, we're able to better monetize our IP across multiple revenue streams. 
But it's not just quantity, of course. We need to produce hits. And as a result, we need to continually ensure that we have the right environment and culture that attracts great creators to our company. We're very proud of our creative partnerships with some of the greatest writers, directors and producers in the world, including James Cameron, Ridley Scott, Bryan Singer, Ryan Murphy, Seth MacFarlane, Howard Gordon, Brian Grazer, Lee Daniels and Danny Strong, Chris Carter, Steven Levitan and so many more. The talents across our entertainment, news and sports operations is the cornerstone of our business, and it enables us to continue to take creative risks and seek new opportunities and formats in which to deliver our stories.
Secondly, we're focused on enhancing our capabilities to capitalize on new opportunities to more directly reach and serve our customers and provide solutions for the advertisers. On the advertising side, these capabilities are centered on obtaining better measurement of nonlinear impressions, improving the monetization of both linear and nonlinear impressions, enabling programmatic sales and better leveraging trueX throughout our portfolio. We're encouraged by the early progress we're seeing. And in fact, we expect and plan to be able to offset the decline we are seeing in domestic network entertainment advertising by better monetization of our digital and nonlinear audience over the next 12 months. 
On a consumer side, we're thinking a lot about our presence in the direct-to-consumer digital video space. Throughout our global portfolio, particularly at Sky and in India Tata Sky and with hotstar, we've had a great experience in direct-to-consumer businesses. Customer focused and product focused, Sky today operates the biggest streaming business in Europe, Hulu operates the second largest streaming platform in the U.S. and one of the largest digital long-form, ad-supported platforms in the world, and we're also operating the largest over-the-top platform in India. We've announced recently that Brian Sullivan, and many of you know from his recent time within the growth of Sky Deutschland or previously heading up Sky's customer group, is now heading up our direct-to-consumer product efforts here. We're very focused on applying all of our enterprise to creating with our partners a great experience, where our programming is available, discoverable and accessible in the way that today's and tomorrow's customer expects and deserves.
So as you can see, there's much happening and much to do. Before we go to Q&A, I'd just like to underscore Lachlan's earlier comment regarding our alignment with shareholders' interests. Because as we focus on growth, opportunities and long-term value creation, we view this direct alignment to be a very positive feature of the company for all the shareholders of Twenty-First Century Fox. 
Now I'd like to turn it back over to Reed."

And as -- from time to time, you get the opportunity to reset that. We think there's still gains to be made both in volume, with respect to distributing -- getting twofold distribution, a number of our networks, as well as in price as we continue to invest on screen and really concentrate around these core brands that we've talked about. So we're pretty optimistic about it, actually, from our portfolio's perspective, which has some unique kind of elements to it. So we feel good about that. It's also really exciting time in terms of these affiliate relationships because, fundamentally, with the vast majority of customers consuming multi-channel television through what are the traditional MVPDs, we know there's huge amount of opportunities to innovate on those platforms. And both in the standpoint of ad innovation, from the standpoint of new pricing models, et cetera, we think that, actually, it's a pretty exciting environment to actually be -- to be operating in. In addition to that, we've seen new entrants. And I think the opportunities for growth, with new over-the-top kind of full or medium service MVPDs emerging, we think it's a real positive. As you see downstream competition increasing, that drives a lot of innovation, it drives innovation across the whole kind of subscriber universe and creates new headroom for growth into what we previously called the kind of broadband-only households, which really become part of the pay-TV universe through these services, which we think is a positive.

Look, Hulu is going really well right now. We're very encouraged by it. We're soon to -- the company is soon to surpass 10 million paid customers of Hulu Plus and really has the velocity that it hasn't had for years, so we're very excited about that. I think growth is coming from a variety of places. I don't think it's sort of a zero-sum game between Netflix or an Amazon Prime and Hulu. It seems like most customers -- or many, many customers will have both. And many customers are MVPD customers as well. So it's -- it comes from a variety of places that have very attractive price point and I think, importantly, with a really distinctive offering. So when you look at the offering, the currents, when you look at some of the new output agreements that are coming through Hulu and the breadth of programming there that the team puts together and the partners contribute, it's very much a unique offering. So it -- people want it in addition to other things, and that's driving really, really good growth right now. I think the standpoint of the plans for Hulu, right now, Disney and us, who are partners in Hulu -- obviously, Comcast is a partner, but it's operating under the consent decree for a while -- we are very committed to growing this business. We think it's a very exciting business. We think we can grow it substantially more than it has -- than it's gotten to today. And it can be a very, very valuable asset for us. I would say, when you talk about getting credit for the value, it's a little frustrating. We do think it's a great asset inside our portfolio. But similar to many of the nonconsolidated assets in our portfolio from -- there are stake in Endemol Shine to the big one at Sky, it is a little frustrating, and we don't believe we get the value for those assets. Stake and our value in the Sky business this year has gone from $9 billion to well over $12 billion in a space of 12 months, not including the substantial and very tax-efficient distribution of capital in the transaction that we executed to merge the 3 Skys that Lachlan mentioned in his remarks. So I guess I would -- I'm not going to start asking you the questions, but I think it's probably duty [ph] on the call, why that -- why we might not get that credit.

And as we approach these agreements with distributors and with our partners, either over-the-top or otherwise, it's really a complete offering. And I think you have to remember that in the markets where these RSNs are, they are often the most popular channel in the marketplace. We are very, very pleased to just renew, for example, the St. Louis Cardinals for 15 years. And St. Louis and baseball season, our RSN there is often the #1 TV channel in the market. So on a market-by-market basis, these channels are hugely compelling. The content is genuinely differentiated and has a passionate following. And I think it's a real benefit to all of our -- to our partners and distributors to carry these things, and we continue to seek to distribute them. I think the question around small bundles and as things emerge, I think we are seeing -- and I've spoken about this in the past, sort of a -- there is a bit of a rebundling going on. And I think we're well positioned in that marketplace because of the work that we've done to really invest on screen around these big brands and to invest in the content that really matters for our customers.

So while we do have linear declines we are projecting internally, and hopefully, we'll do far better than this, declines on the linear side, our sports ratings and revenue coming from sports should cover that.

The trueX acquisition was an important acquisition for us because we've really embedded it into the operations of the business, and that's leading to new opportunities; I think from a standpoint of analytics, that we've been doing already and really gearing up outside of that, it fits in very well; from the standpoint of looking at new things that we can do in terms of product innovation, from engagement units to time shift with advertising and other things, we think that that's pretty exciting; and in a streaming environment, something that you can do on a much more targeted and addressable basis, so you can be more efficient  with lighter loads and create a better customer experience in the on-demand marketplace as well as the linear marketplace as well. So those are the sorts of things that we're very focused and looking at as well as really just getting -- putting more weight into the digital sales effort itself, working with the clients and agencies around creating the currencies that, really, can generate demand. On the international markets, or our x U.S. markets, already, to give you an example, the hotstar platform in India, which is -- with a very, very rapidly -- is a rapidly growing mobile Internet platform around all of our programming that we create, known in India, which is a lot, we are working very closely between the STAR teams and Fox Networks, in particular, the trueX team, to build the ad platform underneath that. We've sort of taken a view there that we really want to build the audience first, and the ad platform is being kind of done in parallel. But this capability directly applies and is being applied to creating some of those new opportunities. And I think the other piece here on Latin America and India, particularly India, don't forget how strong the linear advertising market is. When you have a real position of ratings leadership that we have, and we can sustain that, we're able to really grow our linear advertising very, very attractively. And still, the majority of that marketplace, for a while yet, is that way, and there's a huge amount of growth to come. I mean, you don't see it really in the numbers consolidated because of the sports investment we've been making, but the entertainment business alone in India in fiscal '15 is over a $300 million EBITDA business. And that's something that is growing at a very rapid pace. So it's a real -- there's a real advertising marketplace there that is growing organically, and we're able to grow our share as we go forward."

But our real focus is on launching the show, giving it the appropriate marketing support and getting out there properly. The nonlinear monetization on that, as an addition, is a new feature here. And what we're seeing, going forward, is the ability to monetize much more spread out viewing, and we've talked a lot as an industry, around 3 days versus 7 days. I think we're probably more focused on 30 days and 6 months. We're still seeing customers come to the pilot episode of Empire on some platforms. And in the coming years, being able to monetize that audience, which is a quality, live, engaged audience, is going to be just as important as audiences in other windows.

Without commenting on any hypothetical future activity, we like the asset mix. We think we're in a good position. And I think to your point about this sort of changing landscape, as I mentioned earlier in my remarks, and I think we have sort of a unique set of assets here, where even though -- we can talk about the whole MVPD universe and, as you mentioned, the kind of total -- the total subscriber trends there, but our channels and brands still have headroom for growth, many of them -- most of them, actually, because they're at a different life stage, if you will. And also, we're really going in and challenging in markets where we're bringing new competition in the national sports network market, in the business news market, in places like that, that had dominant players. And we're really coming from a different base, where they go and taking share. In June, we outrated ESPN on Fox Sports 1 for the first time, kind of a milestone. And we're very excited about the opportunities for those things to grow. But that doesn't mean that we're complacent. The fundamental point that I think we're trying to make here is that we are more proactive than ever, and we'll be with our partners in the MVPD universe and new over-the-top players coming in to really make sure that, from a customer experience point of view, the on-demand kind of universe for them and the product offering of our set of content is something that is really special and works for them and meets and exceeds their expectations. And that's something that I think, from the standpoint of, I think, the last 20 years maybe in the cable industry or the channels business, et cetera, we haven't really, as an industry in the U.S., been that focused on. As a large part of our business is direct-to-consumer around the world, we're really applying a lot of that and thinking about how we partner with all of these players as well as increase the capability ourselves to go out and do a better job there and grow the business."

It's a -- listen, I think it's a good question, and I think we have to think about it. What we do as a team here, we -- this is something that occupies a huge amount of our time, is thinking about how do we -- as the platform choices the customers are making really evolve, and you see a lot more competition downstream in terms of the retailing of video programming, either on ad supported or not ad supported; Internet networks like Netflix versus kind of smaller bundles like Hulu Plus, there's -- we need to get a better understanding. And we've developed this now about where our best business is and then what we need to do in -- within those businesses to do -- to make it better. So for example, when we talk about our digital nonlinear advertising business starting to really get a little bit of traction and thinking about offsetting some of the linear declines, a lot of that comes both from our own sort of either authenticated apps and online distribution of our products. But really, a lot of it comes from Hulu inventory that we're able to monetize better and better as we go along. So it's really about working in this developing system to be able to create new opportunities to do better than we're doing in the linear kind of scheduled multi-channel environment. And I think it's really important to note that even though we might be going to 10 million Hulu customers, and they're 10 million growing to 10-plus-x million broadband-only households, so to speak, really, this 85 million, 90 million MVPD household marketplace, all digital, with new services being rolled out through that universe is a huge opportunity in terms of ad innovation, in terms of bundling and pricing, in terms of on-demand capability. And we're very committed to making that the best experience we can in partnership with some of our biggest wholesale customers via DIRECTV or Comcast or whomever. So I think our goal here is to be a really flexible licensor to make our distributors successful but also to make the economics of distribution on these platforms enhanced from where they are today. And that's really come from, as I said in my comments, discoverability of our content, accessibility across multiple platforms and multiple devices and ad innovation that is, candidly, less interruptive, more targeted, lower load and higher priced."

And I think that's been the story of the better part of 20 years. So just I think, James, as you look out over the next few years, is, essentially, the build-out of the platform in India done, and margin starts to grow along with revenue? Or is there potentially more to invest in India that we should make sure we think about our models? And I'll just ask a second one for John. I know -- I hate to rehash Ben's question, but I'm math challenged. So my take, Cable Networks at mid-teens, and minus $200 million on Film, and flat on TV, Other up a little bit, I get 7% growth, $6.95 billion.

I think I would say it's probably been -- I don't know if it's in 20 years or it's 15 years ago, we started broadcasting in Hindi and created STAR Plus. And that really just put us on the pathway to turning around STAR TV overall and particularly creating something in India that can be profitable, and they lift our Asian business. Remember, before that, it was a big -- a heavy loss maker. So I think over the last 15 years, we were able to kind of organically invest in programming, organically invest in some new channels in certain areas and got to a pretty good place. Certainly, over the last 6 or 7 years, we've really dialed it up in terms of how we invest there and what we want to do. And you're right, listen, I mean, the regional language business is something that we thought was important for us. We did that in a combination of acquisitions with Asianet and, more recently, MATV; but also, organically, creating STAR Pravah, STAR Jalsha and so forth, some organic offshoots in regional languages. I think at this point, we're really seeing the scale of the sports investment, which is really a bigger organic investment than anything we've done there in the past peak. And we have good visibility around the revenue growth around the business and the amelioration of the rate of growth in the sports investment going forward. So I do think that when we look out in '17, '18 and beyond, you can see real operating leverage in terms of profits in the India business come through. Now that said, we are -- we're big believers in the marketplace. And if we saw opportunities there that can materially enhance the value of the business, we would have to be very thoughtful about them. But I think, from an organic investment point of view, outside of the digital investment in hotstar and really growing that, you're seeing a peak in the Television business given the scale of the sports investment we've made. And we don't see any new major sports rights in the very near-term horizon that would materially change that. We've successfully exited the CLT20 competition this year and launched the second season of Kabaddi, actually, at a very cost-effective rate, which is year-on-year up 45% in its early matches, so we think that's pretty good. So I think we're still very much on track to see $0.5 billion or so of EBITDA in India within the next sort of 3 years or so and a real velocity towards $1 billion of EBITDA shortly thereafter, around the end of the decade, at the beginning of the next one."

With respect to Thursday Night Football, first of all, without getting into idle speculation, but I would imagine that a lot of that would've -- would end up being in broadcast and not on Fox Sports 1, so it's a slightly different question. But it's very -- we've been a partner of the NFL for many, many years. We love the NFL products. We think our customers love football. We know they do. And it remains and continues to be a really unique offering for customers. And we're always interested in finding ways that make sense to enhance what we can do and to try to do more with really unique events, like the NFL.

Thanks very much, Bryan. It's James. On Sky, look, I think we've been pretty clear about this in the past, and I think I'll be consistent today. Obviously, we do get a little frustrated that the credit and the value doesn't necessarily flow through. But at the same time, we believe the business is a dynamic and growing business and an exciting one. We've been very focused on completing the transaction at last year, taking our consolidated assets at Sky Deutschland and Sky Italia and combining those with what was BSkyB, that is now Sky plc, and we think that's been very, very attractive for Sky and Sky shareholders and very, very attractive for us and our shareholders. And we're very focused on supporting the company in terms of completing that integration and really dialing up the velocity at which that business can operate and perform. And I think you saw their results last week, and that is all going reasonably well. So we like the business. We think it's a very strong business and one that has a huge amount of headroom for growth. That said, these unconsolidated assets are something that, a number of years ago, we set it out to simplify. And we've done that in a variety of places around the world, with a number of assets that we've either divested of or acquired the balance of. But today, we have no immediate plans around that, and we're focused very much on supporting Sky in its growth. And we think that's creating a lot of value over the long term for us although, to your point, not necessarily realized in our stock price today."

James and I have been immersed in Twenty-First Century Fox and all its iterations and in the broader industry generally for at least the past 25 years. This background and context will serve us well as we partner to lead Twenty-First Century Fox through a time of accelerated industry change. I can assure you that we, the board and the senior management team are intensely focused on the array of opportunities that are emerging for Twenty-First Century Fox and for our shareholders.
Now while there has been a particular emphasis on it recently, the reality is that our industry has always been evolving and innovating. The imperative is how we respond to it. Every aspect of our business is being affected by increasingly rapid change, from how we develop content, to delivery, to consumer engagement and, of course, to how we monetize it all. The scale and speed of this change will, to some, be overwhelming. 
But a key underlying trend is important to recognize here. More people are now watching more quality storytelling than ever. They're just consuming it differently given the growing array of options available to them. This is a key and positive trend.
Empowered by new technologies, our customers are demanding distinct and better ways to consume our content, personalized to them in a variety of new nonlinear environments. These new viewing experiences bring with them both new challenges, which we do not underestimate, but also significant opportunities for viewers, advertisers and distributors that simply have not been possible in the linear world. These challenges and opportunities are forefront in our mind as we develop and execute over-the-top distribution and advertising strategies.
One thing is very clear to us. In this environment, it is not enough to simply adapt to change. To succeed in this environment, we must lead change, and that is what all of us in the senior team are committed to do. 
But we also understand that linear viewing remains a key driver of our channels business, which, in turn, is a direct result of our continuing commitment to finding and investing in the best content and content creators around the world. This commitment will not diminish under the new management structure and, if anything, will increase.
Sport and news are also more important than ever in the linear world. Fox Sports, specifically Fox Sports 1, is showing strong viewing momentum as Fox News also continues to deliver dominant ratings. Our goal has been and remains to simplify our business and focus on the content, the brand and the markets that are most valuable to our customers and to our shareholders.
We separated Twenty-First Century Fox News Corp. to drive value and focus. We merged the Skys into one entity, and we consolidated strategic minority investments, including the YES Network, ESPN STAR Sports, Fox Pan American Sports, Asianet and MATV. We refocused our channels in the key global brands of scale: FOX, Fox Sports, FX, Fox News, Nat Geo and STAR; and launched several new channels in support of this effort, including Fox Sports 1, FXX and STAR Sports.
Internationally, we concentrated our investments to develop further depth and leadership in India and Latin America, key emerging markets with substantial growth opportunities. We've also sought to be opportunistic in maximizing the value and position of some of our businesses. For example, with the merger of Shine with Endemol, creating the Endemol Shine Group, the world's leading independent producer of content and IP. 
As a result of this work, we feel Twenty-First Century Fox today is well positioned to succeed in today's dynamic media market as a global content creator and distributor. Despite the changes in our industry, you should not expect any seismic shift in our areas of focus or in the direction of travel of the company.
Operationally, we have consistently over delivered on our affiliate revenue plan, met our expectations on content monetization, but have fallen short in advertising revenue growth while also absorbing significant foreign exchange headwinds. James will comment further on our intense focus around creative excellence and storytelling, the consumer experience and on our operating strength and execution. But on the point of financial strength, I did want to underscore our ongoing commitment to having Twenty-First Century Fox in a strong financial position to pursue opportunities while providing appropriate levels of shareholder returns.
As we look to deploy our capital for growth, we continue to have a strong bias towards building, not buying. We spent the last several years simplifying our portfolio and increasing the focus on what will drive incremental value. As we look at our portfolio of businesses today, we don't see material gaping holes. But that's not to suggest that we won't pursue compelling opportunities. There may be opportunities to strengthen existing businesses with bolt-on acquisitions, such as our investment in MATV in India; or to acquire and develop new capabilities, particularly in digital advertising and digital video generally, such as, for example, our trueX acquisition. These will require investments from time to time, and we will be both opportunistic and disciplined as we evaluate the landscape, just as we have been in the past.
Our record on delivering capital return to shareholders is solid. In fact, by the end of fiscal 2016, we will have returned in excess of $24 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends over a 5-year period. This represents nearly 200% of free cash flow over that same period. This includes the $5 billion share repurchase authorization we announced today, which we intend to complete within the next 12 months. 
Our commitment to deliver value to our shareholders is not just a statement. And my father, James and I are not only the leaders of this company, we are also among its most committed, most long-term and largest shareholders. As such, our interests are directly aligned with our investors, that is to focus on capturing the opportunities from the strength of our assets to further drive long-term stockholder value.
And with that, I'll hand it over to John and James."
91031,307085981,850761,"Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2015",2015-08-05,"Earnings Calls","TFCF Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Lachlan.

So to co",1699,"Thanks, Lachlan. It's John, and good afternoon. At the outset, I'll remind you that because of the sale this past November of our DBS businesses to Sky, our reported financial results for the year and for the fourth quarter are not like-for-like. So to continue to present a more meaningful comparison, we're providing and commenting on total company adjusted revenue and EBITDA, which excludes the DBS businesses in all periods.
So let me start with the full year results. For the full year, total company adjusted revenues were $27 billion, up 3% over last year, driven by double-digit revenue growth in the Cable segment, partially offset by comparisons against the prior year, which included the Super Bowl revenues in the Television segment and a full year of Shine in the Film segment.
Total segment full year adjusted EBITDA is $6.49 billion, 3% higher than a year ago, reflecting higher contributions from our Cable and Film segments, partially offset by lower results at the Television segment. Overall, we had a 6% negative impact on our EBITDA growth rate from foreign currency effects.
Reported net income from continuing operations attributable to shareholders this year was $8.4 billion or $3.93 per share on a reported basis. This includes $4.2 billion of income, reflected as Other, net, which largely relates to the gain from the sale of the DBS businesses to Sky; and also includes approximately $800 million of charges recorded in the fourth quarter, of which approximately half relates to programming inventory that will no longer be aired and contract termination costs for the canceled CLT20 Indian cricket tournament. The majority of the balance represents charges from the disposition of certain pension liabilities.
Additionally, this year's equity earnings of affiliate results include income of approximately $600 million, primarily related to Sky's gains on their sales of certain investments, partially offset by their amortization and other expenses related to the acquisition of Sky Italia and Sky D.
Excluding the net income effects in both years, of amounts reported in Other, net as well as the equity earnings adjustments, adjusted earnings per share were $1.72 compared to the adjusted year-ago result of $1.55. 
And now let me cover the fourth quarter results. Fourth quarter adjusted revenues decreased by $635 million to $6.2 billion as continued growth at the cable networks was more than offset by lower revenue at the Film and Television segments. Total segment adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $1.54 billion, a 5% decline from a year ago, which reflects lower contributions of the Film and Television segments and a negative 6 percentage point impact from foreign exchange. From a bottom line perspective, making similar adjustments as in the annual results, fourth quarter adjusted EPS was $0.39 this year, down $0.03 from the comparable $0.42 last year. 
Now touching on the main segments. We'll start with the Cable Networks, where revenues in the fourth quarter increased 7% from last year, highlighted by an overall 8% increase in affiliate revenues and 4% advertising growth. Domestic affiliate revenues increased 12%, primarily from higher average rates. Our reported international affiliate revenues were down 2%, but we had local currency growth of approximately 9%. 
The fourth quarter Cable segment advertising revenue growth was led by international advertising increases of 14%, driven by STAR. The negative impact from foreign exchange was essentially offset by the first-time inclusion of Fox Turkey in our FIC results. Domestic advertising was 2% lower than the prior year as increases at Fox Sports 1 were offset by declines at FX, which had fewer original programming hours versus the prior year.
Total Cable segment EBITDA in the fourth quarter of $1.22 billion was up 1% over the prior year. Increases at our international channels were mostly offset by an expected decline at our domestic channels from higher sports costs as a result of new events, including the NASCAR Sprint Cup races, the U.S. Open Golf tournament and the Women's World Cup.  Overall, expenses at the Cable segment increased by 10% in the quarter, largely due to these new events at Fox Sports 1. The negative comparative effect from foreign exchange impacted the segment EBITDA growth rate by approximately 4%.
At our Television segment, fourth quarter EBITDA was $113 million as compared to $145 million in the prior year. This largely reflects 14% lower advertising revenues from lower entertainment ratings as well as higher sports programming costs due to the network broadcast of the U.S. Open and Women's World Cup. And this was all partially offset by continued retransmission consent revenue growth.
Turning to our Film segment. We reported fourth quarter EBITDA of $269 million, a 21% decline from last year. Revenues in the quarter decreased 32% due to the absence of Shine and difficult revenue comparisons to the prior year, which included the blockbuster releases of X-Men: Days of Future Past and Rio 2. The EBITDA decline primarily reflects the absence of Shine's results, slightly lower TV production contributions and unfavorable impacts from foreign exchange.
So that closes out the comments on fiscal 2015. Let me comment on our outlook for fiscal 2016. Total segment EBITDA growth and consistent with our previous guidance practice, we're starting with the fiscal 2015 base year EBITDA of the $6.49 billion we just reported, which excludes the DBS segment contributions.
Now from a summary level, fiscal 2016 is projected to be a year of continued strong growth at our Cable segment, challenging comparisons at our Film segment due to the timing of major releases and a continuation of the programming and marketing initiatives in support of ratings recovery at the Television segment. Now let me provide additional segment details. 
Our Cable segment will lead the fiscal 2016 growth, driven by low double-digit affiliate fee increases led by the U.S. As we've commented on previously, our rate of expense growth will moderate in fiscal '16 to about half the high-teens rate experienced in the previous 2 fiscal years, and this growth will be generally led by contractual step-ups in sports rights and entertainment and digital investments at STAR. So considering these factors, coupled with the impact of foreign exchange rates, we expect the Cable segment fiscal 2016 EBITDA growth rate to be in the mid-teens range, with underlying double-digit EBITDA growth rate in both the domestic and international channel portfolios. Foreign exchange is expected to have an approximate 2% negative impact within this growth rate.
Turning to the Television segment. We're expecting a double-digit increase in retransmission consent revenues, while ad revenues are expected to be in line with fiscal 2015. Expenses are anticipated to increase in the mid-single-digit range led by planned increases in our national sports contracts and by slightly higher marketing investments at the Fox Network to support new series. As a result, we expect overall Television EBITDA to be essentially flat with fiscal 2015.
At the Filmed Entertainment segment, while we're very excited about the upcoming release slate, the timing impact of 3 tentpole releases will impact EBITDA comparisons versus fiscal 2015. Specifically, at the end of the fiscal year, we will release the sequels to X-Men and Independence Day; and in early July, Ice Age 5. This schedule will result in the recognition of significant releasing and pre-releasing costs in fiscal 2016, while the bulk of the EBITDA benefit from these films falls in fiscal 2017. Primarily, as a result of this comparative release schedule headwind and factoring in the impact of foreign exchange, we expect the Filmed Entertainment segment EBITDA to be around $200 million below the fiscal '15 result we just reported. 
So as we roll it all up and based on all of the assumptions inherent in our projections, we're anticipating total company segment EBITDA percentage growth rate for fiscal 2016 to be in the mid-single-digit range above the $6.49 billion base level for fiscal 2015. This range anticipates a negative 3% impact from foreign currency headwinds using current rates. 
Now 6 months ago, we indicated that we expected our fiscal 2016 results to be in the mid-$7 billion range, and our outlook today is below that level. The primary factors causing this change have been noted publicly, including headwinds from foreign exchange and film releasing timing, further sports and digital investments in India to support long-term growth and an updated view of the ad markets.
Regarding the remainder of the income statement, there are 2 items I'd call out to you for fiscal 2016: first, our equity earnings of affiliates will be impacted as compared to fiscal 2015 due to the costs from Hulu's strategic growth initiative to ramp up their programming investment; second, our tax rate is expected to increase to a more normalized rate in the low 30% range.
And finally, turning to cash flow and capital allocation. We ended the fiscal year with $8.4 billion in cash and approximately $19 billion in debt. We expect around the same level of working capital requirements in fiscal 2016 as we just had in fiscal '15. In fiscal '16, a contributor to this will be the temporary buildup of receivables from billings associated with those summer releases I just mentioned, and they will be collected in the early weeks of fiscal 2017. Additionally, we'll fund several investments in fiscal 2016, including the purchase of MATV in India, Hulu and DraftKings funding and payments to terminate the CLT20 contract in India, which we assumed in the ESS acquisition.
With regard to the buyback program that we announced a year ago, we've now fully executed that program and bought back $6 billion of Fox A shares during the last year. And as Lachlan mentioned, today, we announced the new $5 billion share buyback authorization, which we intend to complete within the next 12 months.
As we look to the efficiency of our balance sheet, our cash and leverage targets have not changed. We continue to target maintaining a $2 billion to $3 billion cash balance and a gross leverage ratio of 2.5x to 3x. Given the level of shareholder returns and our investment capital, by the end of fiscal 2016, we expect to be much closer to both of those targets. 
And now let me turn it over to James."
91031,307085981,850761,"Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2015",2015-08-05,"Earnings Calls","TFCF Corporation","Executives","Thanks very much, John, and thanks, Lachlan. And thanks, everyone, for being on the call. As we begin a new fiscal year, we're very pleased with where the business is, but of course, there's a lot of work to be done. Moving forward, our overall prioriti",1754,"Thanks very much, John, and thanks, Lachlan. And thanks, everyone, for being on the call. 
As we begin a new fiscal year, we're very pleased with where the business is, but of course, there's a lot of work to be done. Moving forward, our overall priorities are to build upon the goals we've set as the senior leadership team when we formed 21CF 2 years ago. 
First and foremost, as a creative company, we're focused on great storytelling across the business. Our continued creative execution, from our partnerships to the writers and producers across the spectrum, at TCFTV and FXP, to our sports investments and operations at STAR Sports in India, to the diverse and multifaceted slate that we continue to develop at Fox Filmed Entertainment, is the necessary ingredient to any continued and future success.
Secondly, and at the crux of the changes in our industry, we have to make sure those stories get to our customers in the most effective and compelling way possible. And that's all about ensuring a great consumer experience, both in partnership with MVPDs and over-the-top via established platforms, such as Hulu or Netflix or Sky Go; or by creating totally new experiences to which customers can discover and consume content and engage with advertising. Primarily, this digital video approach is about ensuring a high-quality on-demand and live experience and a seamless multi-platform access approach that responds to customers' needs and meets and exceeds their expectations. These capabilities and enhancing the material in 21CF are a large focus for the team.
Thirdly, we recognize and we relish our position as a global company, with diverse and deep assets across the globe. We'll continue to focus on selective deep growth in markets that really matter. For example, India and Latin America comprise more than 2/3 of our international advertising revenue, and we have a significant opportunity to continue to grow as a leader in these markets. Maintaining and enhancing our leadership positions over the next years will be a dramatic contributor to our overall growth of the company.
Our ability to execute on these strategic priorities will be critical to consistently delivering top line revenue and earnings growth and creating long-term value for our shareholders, and our plan achieves that. While we have neither the absolute visibility into the success of our shows and films, nor the precise state of the advertising and foreign exchange markets, our fiscal 2016 plan is based on very realistic assumptions within the various markets in which we're active. 
As John outlined, next year's financial growth is entirely driven by our Cable Networks business, led by strong revenue increases coupled with moderating cost growth. Approximately 2/3 of this segment's expected 2016 revenues are generated by affiliate fees, with more than 80% of those revenues already locked in from existing affiliate agreements. We also have very good visibility on the anticipated reduction of year-over-year cost growth, which is a direct result of our moving past the peak investment phase at our developing cable channels. 
Now there's been much attention paid and rightly so to the overall trends in the paid subscriber universe. Our operational focus on our channel distribution is balanced between our traditional markets and the emerging over-the-top services as they are introduced in the market. We've been very successful so far at generating industry-leading affiliate fee growth for years. And with the realignment and strengthening of our key Cable Network brands, we expect this to continue. 
Specifically, even in the context of an expected 1% annual industry decline in the number of base domestic subscribers, we fully expect our total paid subscribers in the U.S. market and globally to grow. While our most distributed networks, FX and Fox News, will likely see reductions in billable subscribers in line with the trends of the U.S. cable and satellite universe; the balance of our networks, including Fox Sports 1 and 2, FXX, National Geographic and National Geographic Wild, will experience good growth in domestic distribution. It's also important to focus on the opportunity with existing and emerging over-the-top platforms. And given the strength of our channels and programming, we expect to be meaningfully participating in these platforms, creating new customer headroom and enhancing competition and innovation downstream.
Moving to our Television segment. The network continues to be an area of intense focus. But returning series, such as Empire, Gotham and Last Man On Earth, provide momentum that we'll build upon in the upcoming season. We're very focused on fortifying the Fox brand through adventurous, distinctive programming, and we're very excited to have 10 new series scheduled to premiere next season. Our creative efforts will be supported by retransmission consent fee growth. And we're looking forward to progress in monetizing nonlinear impressions as the linear non-live business will continue to face ratings pressure as consumers continue to customize their viewing habits.
At our Film segment, while we expect a drop in year-over-year profits due to timing of our releases, as John has outlined, we have high expectations for what is set up to be a very strong slate, with more releases in this past year supported by significant franchise films, including Fantastic Four, The Maze Runner, Alvin and the Chipmunks, X-Men and Independence Day; and new franchises, led by The Peanuts Movie, Deadpool and Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiars. And at our Television production business, we're very excited about opportunities to build on our returning shows as well as ramping up the creative focus to develop new hits.
So overall, barring unforeseen events outside of our control, we have a high degree of confidence in achieving our earnings guidance for fiscal 2016. Looking forward over those next 12 months, our main focus will be on execution, particularly in the areas of creative excellence, digital video and advertising capabilities and channel distribution.
Looking further out, while it goes without saying that we're not going to provide specific guidance for 2017 and beyond, I would like to say that we feel very good about the trajectory of our business over the next few years. Our Cable Networks are expected to maintain the momentum we're forecasting for fiscal 2016. Our Television segment is stabilizing, with new management at the network and some key building blocks that will enable it to reap the benefits of ongoing strong retransmission increases and materially enhanced advertising capabilities to turn this segment into a source of growth after a number of disappointing years. We'll reap the benefits of the investments at STAR as India becomes a real growth engine for our company in 2017 and beyond. We'll also benefit in 2017 in the Film segment as the timing issues of 2016 reverse and a slate of exciting films come to market over the next few years to drive significant profit growth in this -- in the Film segment from the lows of 2016. 
Our 2017 results will be further strengthened by the broadcast of Super Bowl LI and the impact of the next presidential election. We recognize there'll be challenges to navigate the shifting digital landscape. However, we believe the unique strength and scale of these franchises make the next few years a period of great opportunity.
Now as I mentioned earlier, we're a creative business at heart. And it's what we put on the screen for customers that drives the whole business. Many of you have heard me use the expression investing upstream, and that's exactly our focus. In the Film business, we'll be releasing 23 features over the next year. In our Television production business, we plan on producing a total of approximately 40 series across domestic broadcast and cable networks. By owning the vast majority of content that we program on our networks, we're able to better monetize our IP across multiple revenue streams. 
But it's not just quantity, of course. We need to produce hits. And as a result, we need to continually ensure that we have the right environment and culture that attracts great creators to our company. We're very proud of our creative partnerships with some of the greatest writers, directors and producers in the world, including James Cameron, Ridley Scott, Bryan Singer, Ryan Murphy, Seth MacFarlane, Howard Gordon, Brian Grazer, Lee Daniels and Danny Strong, Chris Carter, Steven Levitan and so many more. The talents across our entertainment, news and sports operations is the cornerstone of our business, and it enables us to continue to take creative risks and seek new opportunities and formats in which to deliver our stories.
Secondly, we're focused on enhancing our capabilities to capitalize on new opportunities to more directly reach and serve our customers and provide solutions for the advertisers. On the advertising side, these capabilities are centered on obtaining better measurement of nonlinear impressions, improving the monetization of both linear and nonlinear impressions, enabling programmatic sales and better leveraging trueX throughout our portfolio. We're encouraged by the early progress we're seeing. And in fact, we expect and plan to be able to offset the decline we are seeing in domestic network entertainment advertising by better monetization of our digital and nonlinear audience over the next 12 months. 
On a consumer side, we're thinking a lot about our presence in the direct-to-consumer digital video space. Throughout our global portfolio, particularly at Sky and in India Tata Sky and with hotstar, we've had a great experience in direct-to-consumer businesses. Customer focused and product focused, Sky today operates the biggest streaming business in Europe, Hulu operates the second largest streaming platform in the U.S. and one of the largest digital long-form, ad-supported platforms in the world, and we're also operating the largest over-the-top platform in India. We've announced recently that Brian Sullivan, who many of you know from his recent time within the growth of Sky Deutschland or previously heading up Sky's customer group, is now heading up our direct-to-consumer product efforts here. We're very focused on applying all of our enterprise to creating with our partners a great experience, where our programming is available, discoverable and accessible in the way that today's and tomorrow's customer expects and deserves.
So as you can see, there's much happening and much to do. Before we go to Q&A, I'd just like to underscore Lachlan's earlier comment regarding our alignment with shareholders' interests. Because as we focus on growth, opportunities and long-term value creation, we view this direct alignment to be a very positive feature of the company for all the shareholders of Twenty-First Century Fox. 
Now I'd like to turn it back over to Reed."

And as -- from time to time, you get the opportunity to reset that. We think there's still gains to be made both in volume, with respect to distributing -- getting twofold distribution, a number of our networks, as well as in price as we continue to invest on screen and really concentrate around these core brands that we've talked about. So we're pretty optimistic about it, actually, from our portfolio's perspective, which has some unique kind of elements to it. So we feel good about that. It's also really exciting time in terms of these affiliate relationships because, fundamentally, with the vast majority of customers consuming multi-channel television through what are the traditional MVPDs, we know there's a huge amount of opportunities to innovate on those platforms. And both from the standpoint of ad innovation, from the standpoint of new pricing models, et cetera, we think that, actually, it's a pretty exciting environment to actually be -- to be operating in. In addition to that, we seen new entrants. And I think the opportunities for growth, with new over-the-top kind of full or medium service MVPDs emerging, we think it's a real positive. As you see downstream competition increasing, that drives a lot of innovation, it drives innovation across the whole kind of subscriber universe and creates new headroom for growth into what we previously called the kind of broadband-only households, which really become part of the pay-TV universe through these services, which we think is a positive. With respect to our flexibility to produce -- to go direct-to-consumer and things like that, without getting into specifics of individual deals, we do -- we have quite a lot of flexibility in terms of how we license the programming, how we license our channels and how we price them both on a wholesale and retail basis. But we haven't made any big decisions on that point at this point. And there are no current plans from an -- for an independently priced direct-to-consumer offering right now."

Look, Hulu is going really well right now. We're very encouraged by it. We're soon to -- the company is soon to surpass 10 million paid customers of Hulu Plus and really has the velocity that it hasn't had for years, so we're very excited about that. I think growth is coming from a variety of places. I don't think it's sort of a zero-sum game between Netflix or an Amazon Prime and Hulu. It seems like most customers -- or many, many customers will have both. And many customers are MVPD customers as well. So it's -- it comes from a variety of places, it's at a very attractive price point and I think, importantly, with a really distinctive offering. So when you look at the offering, the currents, when you look at some of the new output agreements that are coming through Hulu and the breadth of programming there that the team puts together and the partners contribute, it's very much a unique offering. So it -- people want it in addition to other things, and that's driving really, really good growth right now. I think the standpoint of the plans for Hulu, right now, Disney and us, who are partners in Hulu -- obviously, Comcast is a partner, but it's operating under the consent decree for a while -- we are very committed to growing this business. We think it's a very exciting business. We think we can grow it substantially more than it has -- than it's gotten to to date. And it can be a very, very valuable asset for us. I would say, when you talk about getting credit for the value, it's a little frustrating. We do think it's a great asset inside our portfolio. But similar to many of the nonconsolidated assets in our portfolio from --  our stake in Endemol Shine to the big one at Sky, it is a little frustrating, and we don't believe we get the value for those assets. Stake and our value in the Sky business this year has gone from $9 billion to well over $12 billion in a space of 12 months, not including the substantial and very tax-efficient distribution of capital in the transaction that we executed to merge the 3 Skys that Lachlan mentioned in his remarks. So I guess I would -- I'm not going to start asking you the questions, but I think it's probably the duty [ph] on the call, why that -- why we might not get that credit.

The -- look, I think we take the view that we sort of operate in the domestic marketplace, and we have 5 core brands that Lachlan outlined. Sports is a broad brand that includes our RSNs. And as we approach these agreements with distributors and with our partners, either over-the-top or otherwise, it's really a complete offering. And I think you have to remember that in the markets where these RSNs are, they are often the most popular channel in the marketplace. We are very, very pleased to just renew, for example, the St. Louis Cardinals for 15 years. And in St. Louis in baseball season, our RSN there is often the #1 TV channel in the market. So on a market-by-market basis, these channels are hugely compelling. The content is genuinely differentiated and has a passionate following. And I think it's a real benefit to all of our -- to our partners and distributors to carry these things, and we continue to seek to distribute them. I think the question around small bundles and as things emerge, I think we are seeing -- and I've spoken about this in the past, sort of a -- there is a bit of a rebundling going on. And I think we're well positioned in that marketplace because of the work that we've done to really invest on screen around these big brands and to invest in the content that really matters for our customers.

The vibrancy and deepness of the sports marketplace continues. So while we do have linear declines we are projecting internally, and hopefully, we'll do far better than this, declines on the linear side, our sports ratings and revenue coming from sports should cover that. In addition, I would say we are also anticipating that declines in the linear side on entertainment will be captured, really, for the first time, by increases in nonlinear advertising. So it's that degree of confidence and that plan we have that leads us to flat on advertising overall."

So we see that as a very positive factor and one that is really, I think, in success will be -- create a totally new dynamic in this business, where we think about investing on-screen, creating multi-platform access and the streaming environment, in particular, being potentially a more attractive advertising environment than the linear environment.

The trueX acquisition was an important acquisition for us because we've really embedded it into the operations of the business, and that's leading to new opportunities; I think from a standpoint of analytics, that we've been doing already and really gearing up outside of that, it fits in very well; from the standpoint of looking at new things that we can do in terms of product innovation, from engagement units to time shifted advertising and other things, we think that that's pretty exciting; and in a streaming environment, something that you can do on a much more targeted and addressable basis, so you can be more efficient  with lighter loads and create a better customer experience in the on-demand marketplace as well as the linear marketplace as well. So those are the sorts of things that we're very focused and looking at as well as really just getting -- putting more weight into the digital sales effort itself, working with the clients and agencies around creating the currencies that, really, can generate demand. On the international markets, or our ex U.S. markets, already, to give you an example, the hotstar platform in India, which is -- with a very, very rapidly -- is a rapidly growing mobile Internet platform around all of our programming that we create and own in India, which is a lot, we are working very closely between the STAR teams and Fox Networks, in particular, the trueX team, to build the ad platform underneath that. We've sort of taken a view there that we really want to build the audience first, and the ad platform is being kind of done in parallel. But this capability directly applies and is being applied to creating some of those new opportunities. And I think the other piece here on Latin America and India, particularly India, don't forget how strong the linear advertising market is. When you have a real position of ratings leadership that we have, and we can sustain that, we're able to really grow our linear advertising very, very attractively. And still, the majority of that marketplace, for a while yet, is that way, and there's a huge amount of growth to come. I mean, you don't see it really in the numbers consolidated because of the sports investment we've been making, but the entertainment business alone in India in fiscal '15 is over a $300 million EBITDA business. And that's something that is growing at a very rapid pace. So it's a real -- there's a real advertising marketplace there that is growing organically, and we're able to grow our share as we go forward."

And we're very confident in our partners and the writers and producers and the cast there, who are -- who have really proven themselves to be just tremendous. But our real focus is on launching the show, giving it the appropriate marketing support and getting out there properly. The nonlinear monetization on that, as an addition, is a new feature here. And what we're seeing, going forward, is the ability to monetize much more spread out viewing, and we've talked a lot as an industry, around 3 days versus 7 days. I think we're probably more focused on 30 days and 6 months. We're still seeing customers come to the pilot episode of Empire on some platforms. And in the coming years, being able to monetize that audience, which is a quality, live, engaged audience, is going to be just as important as audiences in other windows. So it's more about the total breadth of audience across programming that's made over a longer period of time that you can do well with, not to mention other windows: SVOD, box sets, series stacking and things like that."

Without commenting on any hypothetical future activity, we like the asset mix. We think we're in a good position.

And also, we're really going in and challenging in markets where we're bringing new competition in the national sports network market, in the business news market, in places like that, that had dominant players. And we're really coming from a different base, really going and taking share. In June, we outrated ESPN on Fox Sports 1 for the first time, kind of a milestone. And we're very excited about the opportunities for those things to grow. But that doesn't mean that we're complacent. The fundamental point that I think we're trying to make here is that we are more proactive than ever, and we'll be with our partners in the MVPD universe and new over-the-top players coming in to really make sure that, from a customer experience point of view, the on-demand kind of universe for them and the product offering of our set of content is something that is really special and works for them and meets and exceeds their expectations. And that's something that I think, from the standpoint of, I think, the last 20 years maybe in the cable industry or the channels business, et cetera, we haven't really, as an industry in the U.S., been that focused on. As a large part of our business is direct-to-consumer around the world, we're really applying a lot of that and thinking about how we partner with all of these players as well as increase the capability ourselves to go out and do a better job there and grow the business."

It's a -- listen, I think it's a good question, and I think we have to think about it. What we do as a team here, we -- this is something that occupies a huge amount of our time, is thinking about how do we -- as the platform choices the customers are making really evolve, and you see a lot more competition downstream in terms of the retailing of video programming, either on ad supported or not ad supported; Internet networks like Netflix versus kind of smaller bundles like Hulu Plus, there's -- we need to get a better understanding. And we've developed this now about where our best business is and then what we need to do in -- within those businesses to do -- to make it better. So for example, when we talk about our digital nonlinear advertising business starting to really get a little bit of traction and thinking about offsetting some of the linear declines, a lot of that comes both from our own sort of either authenticated apps and online distribution of our products. But really, a lot of it comes from Hulu inventory that we're able to monetize better and better as we go along. So it's really about working in this developing system to be able to create new opportunities to do better than we're doing in the linear kind of scheduled multi-channel environment. And I think it's really important to note that even though we might be going to 10 million Hulu customers, and they're 10 million growing to 10-plus-x million broadband-only households, so to speak, really, this 85 million, 90 million MVPD household marketplace, all digital, with new services being rolled out through that universe is a huge opportunity in terms of ad innovation, in terms of bundling and pricing, in terms of on-demand capability. And we're very committed to making that the best experience we can in partnership with some of our biggest wholesale customers via DIRECTV or Comcast or whomever. So I think our goal here is to be a really flexible licensor to make our distributors successful but also to make the economics of distribution on these platforms enhanced from where they are today. And that's really come from, as I said in my comments, discoverability of our content, accessibility across multiple platforms and multiple devices and ad innovation that is, candidly, less interruptive, more targeted, lower load and higher priced."

And I think that's been the story of the better part of 20 years. So just I think, James, as you look out over the next few years, is, essentially, the build-out of the platform in India done, and margin starts to grow along with revenue? Or is there potentially more to invest in India that we should make sure we think about our models? And I'll just ask a second one for John. I know -- I hate to rehash Ben's question, but I'm math challenged. So my take, Cable Networks at mid-teens, and minus $200 million on Film, and flat on TV, Other up a little bit, I get 7% growth, $6.95 billion.

I think I would say it's probably been -- I don't know if it's in 20 years or it's 15 years ago, we started broadcasting in Hindi and created STAR Plus. And that really just put us on the pathway to turning around STAR TV overall and particularly creating something in India that can be profitable, and really lift our Asian business. Remember, before that, it was a big -- a heavy loss maker. So I think over the last 15 years, we were able to kind of organically invest in programming, organically invest in some new channels in certain areas and got to a pretty good place. Certainly, over the last 6 or 7 years, we've really dialed it up in terms of how we invest there and what we want to do. And you're right, listen, I mean, the regional language business is something that we thought was important for us. We did that in a combination of acquisitions with Asianet and, more recently, MATV; but also, organically, creating STAR Pravah, STAR Jalsha and so forth, some organic offshoots in regional languages. I think at this point, we're really seeing the scale of the sports investment, which is really a bigger organic investment than anything we've done there in the past peak. And we have good visibility around the revenue growth around the business and the amelioration of the rate of growth in the sports investment going forward. So I do think that when we look out in '17, '18 and beyond, you can see real operating leverage in terms of profits in the India business come through. Now that said, we are -- we're big believers in the marketplace. And if we saw opportunities there that can materially enhance the value of the business, we would have to be very thoughtful about them. But I think, from an organic investment point of view, outside of the digital investment in hotstar and really growing that, you're seeing a peak in the Television business given the scale of the sports investment we've made. And we don't see any new major sports rights in the very near-term horizon that would materially change that. We've successfully exited the CLT20 competition this year and launched the second season of Kabaddi, actually, at a very cost-effective rate, which is year-on-year up 45% in its early matches, so we think that's pretty good. So I think we're still very much on track to see $0.5 billion or so of EBITDA in India within the next sort of 3 years or so and a real velocity towards $1 billion of EBITDA shortly thereafter, around the end of the decade, at the beginning of the next one."

Thanks very much, Bryan. It's James. On Sky, look, I think we've been pretty clear about this in the past, and I think I'll be consistent today. Obviously, we do get a little frustrated that the credit and the value doesn't necessarily flow through. But at the same time, we believe the business is a dynamic and growing business and an exciting one. We've been very focused on completing the transaction at last year, taking our consolidated assets at Sky Deutschland and Sky Italia and combining those with what was BSkyB, that is now Sky plc, and we think that's been very, very attractive for Sky and Sky shareholders and very, very attractive for us and our shareholders. And we're very focused on supporting the company in terms of completing that integration and really dialing up the velocity at which that business can operate and perform. And I think you saw their results last week, and that is all going reasonably well. So we like the business. We think it's a very strong business and one that has a huge amount of headroom for growth. That said, these unconsolidated assets are something that, a number of years ago, we set about to simplify. And we've done that in a variety of places around the world, with a number of assets that we've either divested of or acquired the balance of. But today, we have no immediate plans around that, and we're focused very much on supporting Sky in its growth. And we think that's creating a lot of value over the long term for us although, to your point, not necessarily realized in our stock price today."

Please to join you today from Los Angeles to report our first fiscal quarter earnings.
I'm going to take a few -- make a few comments and turn the call over to John and James, who are both in London. We've made good progress this quarter. Our performance underscores the strength of our business and the durability of the growth strategies we have pursued over the last number of years and continued to do so.
But even with progress, we are all united in the view that this is a time of transformative change in our industry. It's the kind of change that demands equal measures that we are thinking and of calculated risk-taking. In this quarter, we've applied both to good effect.  And there are some essential points that must be considered. While demand for the type of high-quality storytelling, news and live sport that we produce continues to grow, our viewers are increasingly choosing when and how they experience our programming. Live viewing of television is contracting as a percentage of total viewing, especially in the younger demographics coveted by advertisers. The definition of ratings success has evolved from overnight ratings to 3-day and 7-day ratings to more accurately reflect how programming is being consumed and they will need to evolve further.
Take for example, the Season 2 Premiere of our breakout hit, Empire. It reached 12 million total viewers in Live Plus same day, a great number. But that figure more than doubled to 25 million when we look at 30-day multi platform viewing. We see similar lifts across our networks when we look at actual consumption across a spectrum of viewing when compared to the current Live Plus three-day industry-standard.  Using Nielson Online Live Plus 7-day ratings, the FOX Network is up a couple of percent year-over-year and excluding sports, we are up almost 10%, but tells also only half of the picture. 
Our FOX Networks average nonlinear audience has risen by about 1/3 year-over-year. It's a testament to the fact that premium broadcast content is in more demand than ever but also illustrates the need for the industry to move to modern ratings currency that reflects today's consumption of media in a way that is highly measurable and relevant to advertisers.
Driving part of this change is without a doubt, the emergence of over-the-top services, such as Hulu and Netflix. Another byproduct of these services is clearly the maturing of the traditional large cable bundle. But we see this trend as having less impact on FOX as a group, then perhaps, on others. That's because our key U.S. brands, FOX, Fox News, Fox Sports, National Geographic and the FX Suite, are in great demand, due in large part, to years of significant programming and marketing investment.  In fact, this quarter's results reflect increases in our aggregate number of U.S. domestic subscribers compared to a year ago of over 1%, with subscriber additions at our younger, less distributor channels more than offsetting the overall 1% to 2% declines impacting the overall industry.
And internationally, we also continue to see subscription growth, and are benefiting from demographic trends and pay Television gains in high-growth markets.
Overall, we feel exceptionally well-positioned with robust demand for our quality programming, leadership across entertainment, sports and news, and enhanced digital product focus and strong brands, and that we have made an focus of our investment. We look forward to continuing to make strides against our strategic plan to continue to return real value to our shareholders over the remainder of this fiscal period and beyond.
And with that, I'll now hand over to John and James in London for their comments and for questions."

Starting off, I'll remind you that because of the sale of our DBS businesses to Sky last November, our reported financial results for the first quarter are not like-for-like. So as we've done in the past, we're providing total company adjusted revenue and adjusted EBITDA, which excludes the DBS businesses in the prior year period.
Most of my comments that will follow will be on this adjusted basis.
So first quarter adjusted revenues decreased by $406 million to $6.1 billion as continued revenue growth in the Cable network segment, was more than offset by lower revenue in the Film segment. Note that the absence of Shine and overall adverse foreign currency movements, each negatively impacted quarterly revenues by approximately $200 million. Together, these approximate the total year-over-year quarterly revenue decline.
Total segment adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was $1.54 billion, a $37 million decrease from a year ago. This decline reflects double-digit growth at the Cable Networks and Television segments, which were more than offset by lower contributions at the Film segment. This year's results include slightly more than a $100 million negative impact from unfavorable foreign currency movements. Absent this impact, our overall growth rate would be 5%.
From a bottom line perspective, we reported income from continuing operations attributable to stockholders of $678 million or $0.34 per share. Excluding the net income effects in both years of Other net and of equity earnings adjustments, primarily related to Sky's acquisitions and dispositions, first quarter adjusted EPS was $0.38 this year, down $0.01 from the comparable $0.39 a year ago. And overall, with this first quarter now completed, we're holding to the financial guidance expectations we provided to you on our last call.
And now let me provide with some additional comments on the performance at our operating segments for the first quarter. And let's start with the Cable Networks, where total segment EBITDA of $1.31 billion was up 26% on segment revenue growth of 7%. Domestic revenues increased 10% in the aggregate, led by affiliate fee growth of 11% and advertising increases of 4%. EBITDA at our domestic channels increased 19% over the prior year, reflecting these higher revenues in conjunction with total cost increases of only 4%, led by lower costs at the FX Channel.
First quarter reported international affiliate fee and ad revenues were both essentially even with last year. However, excluding the effects of foreign exchange, local currency affiliate fees and advertising revenues were each up around 10%.
Reported international channel EBITDA contributions increased over 50%, even after reflecting an approximate $60 million negative impact from foreign exchange. This recorded growth was largely due to lower sports programming costs at STAR Sports from the absence of last year's India England cricket series. 
Elsewhere, double-digit local currency EBITDA growth at the STAR entertainment channels and at the Fox International Channels, were essentially offset by the negative impact from foreign currency, principally from Latin America and from the euro.
Turning to our Television segment. First quarter EBITDA was $196 million, 13% higher than prior year results. This improvement largely reflects continued strong retransmission consent revenue growth and lower programming expenses at the FOX broadcast network and stations, which were partially offset by a 5% decline in segment advertising revenues. This advertising decline reflects the expected impact of 1 last week of the NFL due to a later regular-season start, which we get back in the third quarter and lower political ad revenues at the stations due to the midterm elections in the prior year.
At the Film segment, we reported first quarter EBITDA of $149 million, $309 million below last year. This decline is primarily driven by challenging comparisons to the prior year, which included significant contributions from the theatrical release of Dawn of the Planet of the Apes and the Home Entertainment release of Rio 2, compared to reduced theatrical contributions this year that included the underperformance of Fantastic Four.  This quarter was also impacted by the inclusion of significant pre-releasing costs in advance of these successful October theatrical release of The Martian. 
Our TV production contributions were also lower in the quarter, primarily due to lower Cable syndication revenues owing to last year's sale of How I Met Your Mother.
Overall, revenues for the Film segment decreased by 28%, with close to half of this decline reflecting both the absence of revenues from Shine which we merged with Endemol last December, and foreign currency movements.
Shifting over to our buyback activities, and since July 1 through today, we've repurchased approximately $2.1 billion of FOXA shares and that we are on plan to complete the authorized a $5 billion buyback within the 12 months time frame that we've previously announced. 
Subsequent to quarter end, we issued $1 billion and long-term debt, and we repaid at $200 million of maturities, with approximately $500 million of further maturities over the next year.
With regards to the financial guidance, as I said earlier, with 1 quarter under our belt, we're holding to the expectations we gave you 3 months ago. Specifically, we continue to anticipate a total company segment EBITDA percentage growth rate for fiscal 2016 to be in the mid-single-digit range above the $6.49 billion we reported from fiscal 2015, and that number excludes the impact of the DBS segment contributions.
Now foreign currency certainly do we can since our August call, and this volatility continues to be a risk to keep an eye on as the year goes forward. Our underlying business operating trends have generally been progressing as expected in the aggregate.
As you know, when Twenty-First Century FOX was formed in 2013, we provided our 3-year goals and our guidance, and have updated you on those in each of the years on that cycle. As we look to the end of the 3-year period, upon the completion of this fiscal year, I'd like to touch on our approach to financial guidance going forward.
Looking back to 3 years had ups and downs, led by currency impacts, which absorbed hundreds of millions of growth dollars and had structural changes to our portfolio of businesses. But through that period, we have been and we'll continue to be transparent and direct about the trends we are seeing and impact on our outlook. We are very confident in our ability to execute against the opportunities we have ahead to sustain long-term growth, but we don't want to chase the short-term targets through changes in our operating plan, merely because our currency rate changes, of movie release, of ships are underperformed, so we modify our approach to SVOD Licensing. It's not good for our management team and it's not good for our shareholders.  So beginning with fiscal 2017, we will modify our approach to financial guidance to eliminate our emphasis on a specific dollar annual earnings target. Instead, we'll provide you with quantitative and qualitative information on those key areas where we have good visibility and on the trends and initiatives in our businesses. We'll also provide insight into where we'll be focusing our resources to maximize opportunity through both organic innovation and through investment.  And of course, we'll also continue to provide details around our annual Capital Allocation Plan and our targets.
And now let me turn it to James."

And good morning, everyone, and thank you all for joining us.
As you heard from Lachlan and John, the investments we've been making in our core brands, in all our key markets are progressing and producing returns, and we continue to push the pace of these initiatives as we see meaningful opportunity ahead of us.
On the short-term front, as you heard from John's review, we continue to make progress against the fiscal 2016 financial objectives. We expect strong growth in our core cable franchises, promising forward movement in our TV broadcast segment, offset by some currency headwinds and short-term performance in the film business, which as you know, we measure over a longer period, as results can be lumpy due to the timings and individual pictures' performance.
We also continue to execute on our key strategic priorities. Specifically, to create compelling and unique storytelling, to enhance the customer experience of our digital video brands, and to leverage our leadership position in developing markets where we see the greatest opportunities, particularly India and Latin America.  So we've seen good momentum in our domestic Cable portfolio, where our overall EBITDA growth is up 19% versus a year ago. This growth led by revenue gains, is a clear result of the investments we've made and the work the team has done and continue to do, to bolster the customer offerings of our core brands. It also reflects increases in our aggregate number of domestic subscribers compared to a year ago of over 1%.
Looking forward, as Lachlan noted, we anticipate that some of the conversations we're having with new streaming distribution services not yet to market will result in revenue that will augment the existing viewing alternatives. Now I'd like to update you on the progress we're making at a few of our key brands.
Our domestic Sports Business continued to deliver, and has increasingly become a critical component for distributors. In aggregate, our brands currently provide more than 25% of all sports viewing in the U.S., national and local combined. I noticed there have been some recent attention of the potential disruption from the digital the submission of sports. 
Last week, Yahoo! and the NFL announced that they had 33.6 million streams or 15.2 million unique views on their NFL web stream game. So in digital numbers are comparable basis for TV ratings, Yahoo! average 1.6 million U.S. viewers per minute, but at the same day, on average, 18 million viewers per minute were watching the NFL on FOX.
As FS1 is making real headway as well, and is on or above plan by pretty much all metrics. Over the past quarter, we strengthened our audience engagement, extending last spring' ssuccesses from the broadcast of the Women's World Cup and U.S. Gulf -- U.S. Open Golf with strong MLB regular and postseason events. Nationally, regular season baseball viewership on FBC and FS1 increased 16% and 22%, respectively, over last year's level. As a New Yorker and as broadcaster, I'm disappointed, of course, with the world series, finishing 5 games. But unfortunately, there's no changing that now. But even with pure games, this year's World Series averaged close to 15 million viewers, more than last year's full seven-game performance, and ranked as the best five-game average since 2009 -- on the Yankees, beat the Phillies in 6 games. 
Locally, our regional sports networks our commanding presence, as demonstrated by our regular season baseball telecast on VRSN, with 13 out of our 15 teams ranking at or near the top of local content ratings.  And this year's World Series champion, the Kansas City Royals, carried on FOX Sports Midwest, scored the highest regular-season local TV ratings of any RSN in 13 years. We look forward to welcoming them in all our RSN MLB teams back for spring training. What's clear from this, is that our sports brands are a fundamental differentiator for 21 CF, and they'll continue to deliver returns for years to come.
At the FX suite of channels, will continue to deliver exciting new originals to audiences everywhere. And in particular, the American Horror story franchise continues to be a ratings and critical phenomenon. They won 5 Emmy awards in September and more recently, its fifth installment, debuted as the second most-watched telecast in FX Networks' history in the key 18 to 49 demo. And the Premiere has reached more than 15 million total viewers to date across all platforms. 
The reception at Fargo is getting some form routing, is also very encouraging. And I encourage all of you to watch the show. It's really one of the best and most exciting pieces of storytelling on air anywhere.
We look forward to calendar 2016 as well, with some truly great new and returning shows, including Ryan Murphy's American Crime Story, The People Versus O.J. Simpson, and the Americans on FX and It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia on FXX. 
Fox News continues to go from strength to strength. The August GOP debate delivered a record of 24 million total viewers, making it the #1 highest-rated non-sports cable telecast of all time. This summer, Fox News was the number 1 on Channel across our basic cable for 5 consecutive weeks ago The Kelly File and Hannity, both reached ratings high this past quarter since debuting in their current time spots.
And the new FOX Business schedule is gaining momentum, and the channel is hosting another Republican debate on November 10. And we think it's really a great opportunity to showcase and differentiate FOX Business in terms of depth and quality and production.
Outside of the U.S., our channels have continued their growth trajectory. At STAR, the entertainment channels generated double-digit revenue and profit increases on the strength of original programming. STAR Sports Poker Buddy Season 2 continue the successful on strong ratings growth. And we expect the business to take like meaningful profit progress this year, in line with the goals we've discussed with you in the past.
The Fox International Channels, even with some regional economic headwinds, grew its unique paying subscribers by 13% over a year ago level, now approaching 300 million, while also delivering double-digit local currency revenue and profit growth.
More broadly, we're working hard to build on the strength of our brand portfolio. A few months ago, we announced the agreement to expand our successful joint venture with the National Geographic Society. Our plan is to form National Geographic partners, which combines the National Geographic Society's branded media asset, including one of the most recognized magazines in the road any substantial digital footprints with the National Geographic Channels, among the most widely distributed Television services globally, is an enormous opportunity for the company.
The new limited Run Series breakthrough, which brings to life scientific and technological discovery through some of the biggest names in film, including Ron Howard, Brian Grazer and Brett Ratner -- exemplifies the kind of storytelling that is unique to National Geographic. Combining all of these consumer-facing assets into one entity, would drive greater opportunities to leverage one of the world's most recognized and treasured brands, especially in a nonlinear world.  The integration planning and implementation is moving along, and we're on track to close the transaction in the next few weeks.
Turning to our U.S. Broadcast business. Trends this fall season are encouraging. While still early, we're seeing positive results driven by new programming and our investment in our returning shows. We're happy with the performance of Empire at second outing, the show really is a phenomenon. And it's 1 borne out of our bizarre to support storytellers and our appetite for taking creative risks. 
Beyond Empire, FOX has a number of new series that have provided significant gains year-over-year for us. Rosewood, Scream Queens, Grandfathered and The Grinder, have driven percentage increases anywhere from 21% to 78% compared to the same time slot last year.
It's fair to say that Minority Report has been a disappointment, and we've shortened the series order, and expect to have new reprogramming in the second half. While last year is not the benchmark we would aspire to measure against, nonetheless, total viewership growth, live, multi-platform and time-shifted to date, is up 10% year-on-year. 
As with every fall  broadcast season, a lot of attention has paid to the overnight ratings reports that measure the linear viewership of the new series Premieres. And we're focusing on saying, as Lachlan said, more in total viewership and driving overall consumption on multi-platform multi-day basis. 
The FOX Network is unique and that it attracts the youngest audience of any major broadcast network, perhaps, more than any other network, we're seeing significant audience growth from multi-platform viewing and from extended C3 and C7. For example, in addition to the Empire 30-day numbers as Lachlan talked about, Scream Queens more than doubled its live audience, over 130%, when including viewership across all platforms.  We're seeing similar numbers for other shows. And in fact, more than 50% of our ad inventory is now sold in the C7 window. It's true that much of this viewership is monetized today at a lower level than what we would like. And as I've said before, the important thing is to grow the audience, and our capabilities with respect to selling that audience are improving.
We're on track to grow our nonlinear ad revenue by around 40% this fiscal, this includes inventory across Hulu, VOD, FX Now, FOX NOW, Fox Sports To Go and Fox Sports Digital. We think it's important to create and distribute together, and I'm pleased that approximately 70% of our new prime time shows are from our own studio, 20th Century Fox Television, up from about 50% last year.  The full-time value -- the full lifetime value of these assets is something we're very focused on.
TCFTV and its subsidiaries continue to benefit from the overall strong demand prescriptive programming producing 36 series for 12 networks this season. While a little more than half of these series -- 64%, are supporting FOX channels, we continue to be a major provider of shows to others, with hip series such as Homeland, Modern Family and Fresh Off The Boat. Quality storytelling has never been more in demand.
Moving to the film studio. The first quarter film earnings were well below a year ago, reflecting release timing in the lack of a major success full release. However, the recent success of The Martian, and a very solid slate of upcoming features, gives us comfort here. Looking ahead, we're bringing Charlie Brown to the big screen this weekend with The Peanuts Movie, and with that, have the next installment of the very successful Alvin and the Chipmunks franchise in December, and the holiday release of Joy, which reunites Jennifer Lawrence with David O Russell once again.
Also in December, The Revenant with Leonardo DiCaprio in a wonderful film by Alejandro Ngiri-2 [ph], the very promising Deadpool this February, and we then wrap up the fiscal year with 2 big global franchises with X-Men: Apocalypse and the long-awaited sequel Independence Day Resurgence.
And looking a little further ahead, we'll also be releasing franchise extensions for Ice Age in the summer of 2016, the Planet of the Apes, Aliens, Maze Runner, King's Men and of course, Avatar, over the next few years. 
It's worth noting that the film industry is gaining strength, and the calendar year-to-date consumer spending on digital home entertainment up mid-teens for the industry, and a bit higher for us. We're making progress as well and our nonconsolidated businesses. The combination of the 3 Sky businesses is producing strong results, and together, these businesses are thriving, added around 1 million paid-for subscription products this quarter, and achieving the best overall U.K. sub-growth we've seen in 4 years, in addition to strong customer growth in Germany and steady performance in Italy.  Sky is truly setting the pace in digital Television across Europe.
And Hulu continues to grow, both subscribers and engagement aggressively. Year-to-date until September, total viewing at Hulu is up 85% [ph] versus prior year, and the subscriber additions are up more than 60%. And the Endemol Shine Group, our joint venture with Apollo, continues to deliver high-quality programming globally with non-scripted content such as Hunted, being picked up by CBS in the U.S. and new scripted programming, such as the Frankenstein Chronicles, preselling extremely well. Established titles, such as Big Brother, are traveling further than ever before, but the pilot series due to air in China for the first time this fall.
So while there's still much to do, we feel good about progress in the company overall, and about where we're headed. So with that, we'll hand it over to all of you for any questions you might have. Reed?"

But I think when we look at the present state of the business, with respect to the growth that we're seeing in really, IP Stream video consumption, these are something that we're very excited about. And we have been pretty aggressive about trying to create growth there, investing in our capability with respect to monetizing that viewership, and doing it in a better way, developing new products for customers, as well as with partners, for example, at our Hulu partnership -- growing that business very aggressively and seeing very good result at this point. So I think when we think about investing in these areas, so you already -- you've already seen a lot of that in these sort of numbers and within our kind of inorganic internal investments as we think about how we make programming, what rights we seek to control, and then how we want to sell those things. With respect to specific decisions around windowing, SVOD partners, how we're exporting programming across the full lifetime of the programming, those are things that continually evolve. And I think it's really important for us to be able to be disruptive in those areas. I think it's important for us but to cling to business rules that inevitably change and have been changing over the last number of decades. in the business and an industry that's been characterized more than anything else, by really, wave after wave, of technological change that fundamentally, creates better products for customers, creates more competition downstream. And we think in that environment, we've always been best served to be able to innovate and disrupt ourselves. So I think with respect to how we think about investment -- and I don't want to get into -- I don't want to get into a backdoor way into '17 guidance. But I would say that we look at -- the sorts of things we've been doing around growing our capability, as well as licensing to new entrants in the marketplace on the right business terms and also, increasing the business that we do with many of our existing partners who distribute our content. These are the sorts of things we're focused on, and I think you'll see the more activity with respect to that, as those agreements are concluded and adjusted and as we signed new ways to distribute the products going forward over the next year."

And I think that's a real -- for; any business, that's trying to move fast and trying to growth. That's a real danger that one has to be very alive to. And we have to be willing to take some risks but also, to be innovative and to be disruptive. And I think as leaders of the business, and I think I speak for all of the leaders within the business, which is although the way through the business, because everybody has a responsibility to lead -- we have to be disruptors if we're going to grow. So when we look at growing the IP Streaming -- sort of our growing kind of business in IP streaming in the future, we're pretty excited about the innovation that we can bring to that marketplace. And we're working hard across the board, both internally, when we think about developing our authenticated apps, potentially, the direct-to-consumer offerings. Some of our competitors have been out there with those -- we haven't done that yet here. But for example, in India with hotstar, we've been very aggressive in building out a mobile video platform that we control and that we reach the customers with directly. And we're working hard within Hulu as well to both grow the business absolutely, but also to grow the offerings of the business. And we're really excited about our progress there. With respect to your question about ads, we're also really pleased with the progress we're making with respect to sort of ad innovation, to vote with premium ad-free services which Hulu announced and launched, but also with expanding the opt-in engagement advertising that we've talked about in the past to the Hulu platform which we just announced yesterday. And that's in addition to our own authenticated apps services. So fundamentally, in advertising, that these innovations are about empowering the audience to decide the value of their attention, and that makes sense to them. And it also makes a lot of sense to us. And we think pricing models around retention are going to be developing, and we want to be at the forefront of developing those, of an understanding how those work, and how we can create the best return.

I think I'll leave it to them and obviously, in the spring, with the upfront, is just going to be a lot of attention to that. But the growth is good, and we're -- I think, I would say we're at this point, pretty comfortable with the mix of growth, in terms of ad-free versus ad supported. And look, I think our commitment to Hulu is self-evident. We've invested a lot of it. We continue to license to it, where it makes the most sense, for our creative partners and us to do so. But also, we want to grow our app distribution as well. And I think we're seeking the license rights to distributors of all kinds, if it's on the right terms. And I think the other thing that's changing, and maybe this is to the heart of your question is, that the SVOD Licensing business itself is changing pretty quickly. And it's also the surprising new approaches and new ways, I think that we can provide a great service to customers that you'll see over the next little while. So in that environment, of all of that going on, I think our opportunities do lie in kind of leaning in and being disruptive ourselves, and not being afraid of that. And look, I think it's consistent with the way we've managed -- the way the business has grown over many, many years, from disrupting the U.S. Broadcast business with Fox Broadcasting so many years ago, to disrupting the European Television business with the 3 different Skys, and disrupting advertising and the Broadcast business today, with Hulu and other things over the current period in the next few years -- I think is a real opportunity to create enormous value. So look, I think that's one of the most important sort of cultural traits in our business, and it's one that we're going to continue to encourage and nurture, so I think it has to exist everywhere in this company."

Look, just to clarify Hulu, I think one of the things that's important to note is that the current -- the way the business looks today with all of the different services in Subscription Video On Demand, as well as the MBpd marketplace, all of these services are going to change. And I think you've seen competitors take the pricing, you've seen new tiers and new products emerge. And I think it's important to note that it's not necessarily steady-state, in fact, it's one of pretty rapid evolution and innovation. So I think with respect to the ad free pricing at Hulu and the delta between the ad supported and the ad free, as you imagine, that was a source of robust debate. But at the end of the day, the business just had to move forward and try. And we're learning a lot from that. And I think pricing may change but also, as I mentioned before, we're very focused on thinking about how can these services also expand their offerings and create new price points with new contents or other things in them? So I think that's going to evolve and I wouldn't necessarily say it's a steady-state today. With respect to cannibalization, cannibalism -- I'll refrain from commenting on -- I think it's inevitable that new services and new competition both grow the overall market but also impact customers to other services. And we're very focused on how do we think about monetization in that environment, and how do we make sure that overall -- I mean, look at the whole business, our approach to growing the streaming business very aggressively, is one that's going to be more attractive for us? And personally, I think overtime, it's not necessarily a straight line, I think over time from the streaming entertainment business and streaming television businesses is much more attractive with opportunities for innovation, in terms of ad vote, ad pricing, subscription pricing, premium ad free models, as well as the discoverability of our programming across -- for customers. It's just a very attractive -- it's a very attractive set of attributes for customers, and I think, for our business as well. And -- but it's pretty early days in terms of finding all of the different ways that we can move it forward and we can innovate there. And your second question..."

You guys have always been ahead of the curve on giving us some really useful color around viewership, around nontraditional platforms -- you did more so today. I'm trying to figure out how we can use them to model the business? So if I go back to something, I think you guys said total viewership on FOX broadcasting network was up like 10%. Can you remind us how much of that was sort of -- was in the traditional C3, C7 window, whatever the Nielsen kind of -- the Nielsen window you sold it in? And then can you give us what the viewership was outside that window and remind us of what the monetization of that viewership is, or at least, give us a sense of what the potential upside of the monetization is, given that you know what the audience is, and you must have a sense of where you can monetize it over time? And lastly, Lachlan talked about the growth in nonlinear viewership. What are you doing with the data? You must be coming up with some pretty interesting data from the growth in this nonlinear viewership, that I would imagine, is extremely valuable in both monetization and devising a strategy for building your business going forward. How do you think about the data?"

So when you said ""Can we help you with your modeling, how will that work?"" I'm speaking to myself. Yes, maybe you could help us modeling. It's -- what's complicated about it is -- and I really -- I think it illustrates the point around measurement systems evolving that Lachlan made earlier, which is -- what we're really focused on is what was our total audience last night and the day before and last week? And that was made up of customers and viewers watching live things, things a day old, things 4 days old, things 30 days old, and in some cases, things many months old. And what you want to review is get a picture of that overall viewership. And it's not easy to come by, and it lags because the measurement systems and all of those things don't always think -- when we don't get those numbers in the most timely way that we would like. So the total picture of the audience is more complex. That said -- just to break it down a little bit for you -- in the season to date, the live viewing, as I've mentioned before, was just under half, right? So 50% was more than that. And so it's about -- I think live viewing was about 40 -- high-40s percentage there. And then Hulu made up, sort of in the teens, and the balance was VOD -- a very small amount broad authenticated apps, which we're working on authentication pathways and stuff to improve there, and some time shifting on DVR. So the balance is definitely moving towards, obviously, time-shifted and on-demand. And from a sales point of view, about half of our inventory was sold on a C7 basis in the period. So that's sort of where that breaks down, but it's something that's really evolving. And I think when we think about how we instrument the business going forward and how we measure the business, and then deal with advertisers and all of our clients -- customers on that, those are things that are going to continue to evolve. But we're very focused on the total audience in a given time period, and then we build that up. So when we said to you that total audience was up 10% in the season today, but the same original programming, that really was the accumulated viewership, literally, on a per minute basis, relative to the previous year. And a lot of that was driven by the growth in seven-day and 30-day viewership there. And look, we think that it's really, really encouraging that the audience is moving towards these On Demand platform and in particular, where they're moving towards Hulu, where we can really innovate and monetize that audience. And with respect to your second question just on data, you're right, it is -- it  is very interesting. And when we're -- and it's -- it's interesting. It's very, very early days because the consumption curve is pretty dramatic. And that's something that we are -- we're really using today to understand both how we use our air better in terms of promo inventory, sales inventory, et cetera, how we're going to say our customers move between different shows and different platforms. But there are also gaps in that data -- obviously, working with third-party partners, but that is a big focus for us. And we think it's one of the -- the data opportunity is one of the great characteristics of an IT streaming TV business in the future, is the ability to have that data -- the ability to use that to improve your products and services and monetize the viewership and the audience in the right way. With respect to pricing, the attention of the audience, correct me, item for demo for advertisers."

So with respect to FS1, Fox Sports 1, is fully -- is fully in profit for the full year this year, and we think that's great achievement. We've invested a lot in programming, a lot of -- putting a great product on screen for people. And I think the launch and the first, in the first 2 years of this project, as I said my comments earlier, has really gone to plan or ahead of plan pretty much across the board, both in terms of audience as well as the P&L. So that's sort of where that is, and we see really good growth there going forward. Now obviously, one of the key things that drives that is affiliate fee increases -- we have a lot of visibility on a lot of that. But there -- as the -- as new affiliate agreements come go forward, both in terms of distribution and price, we see an opportunity to grow there, but those will come in steps. FX, we think is really -- the FX Suite more broadly, is really, one of the core creative franchises in the business today, and we think it's very, very promising. We see good growth there, but obviously, the investments in originals has been very high, and that's something that has had impacted the profit, other than that, it would be. And at STAR, where we really took 100% of the profit in the entertainment business, and invested it in building a Sports Business there after the acquisition of ESPN Star Sports. We're seeing very, very good progress there. Last year -- the 2 years just gone was really the peak year of investments in that. So as we see continued growth in the entertainment business there and the growth rate of costs in the -- or rather, the costs spike in the sports business ameliorate pretty dramatically with that -- you've kind of got kind of a double whammy there, and the growth of the STAR business in terms of EBITDA will be substantial this year and for the next few years as that sports investment kind of backs out. So I think, I would say we feel really good about all of those things. And most importantly, I think as we look at these numbers years ago and said, listen, we're going to invest in these core brands, we're going to invest in getting -- we're going to invest actually in getting out of a lot of smaller brands, little things that weren't really moving the dial for customers, we can ask them really successful. And when I look at our discussions with our wholesale distributors, when I look at the way we're licensing, when I look at the volume and quality of the product that we have at our hands, in our hands now, it's really -- it's paying dividends in the marketplace, as we negotiate new distribution contracts, as we license things in a new way, and as we grow the audience overall, as I said earlier."

We're really happy to be able to get engagement units launched on Hulu, or a -- in answer to yesterday, we have Mondelez -- a number of Mondelez brands, really as the sort of launch partner to do that. And there's a good volume of inventory there. So actually, I think this is picking up pretty quickly. And it's a combination, not just of the Nielsen -- it's a combination of the Nielsen ratings changes and getting a currency there that's established, but also a lot of other viewership data coming from a variety of platforms. And we worked with all of those who worked with the third-party services, from Rentrak, et cetera, but also, our own internal data in terms of what we're streaming and how we're doing it, and those numbers there.

Todd, let me deal with the STAR answer first. Look, I think the inflection point was really this year, when we hit the sort of peak sports investment because of the business generally, on an underlying basis, the entertainment business is already well on its way, and it's substantially -- I think we've disclosed this, over $300 million this year, so I think in EBITDA. So it's really the eating -- the taking that investment -- taking all that profit and reinvesting that, it's just creating this new kind of -- this new business in sports, which we think is really adds a totally new dimension and a real sense of scale -- a real scale to do business there. The infection point is when that peaks. And that peaked this year, so we see -- yes, this last year that just ended. So when we look at the future of that business, what I'm going to say, it's a straight line -- there's always some ups and downs here and there. But the profit growth will start to be significant for this year and will continue towards that $1 billion target at the present conditions -- if you kind of -- being consistent towards the end of this decade or thereabouts, at the turn of the decade. So I think that feels reasonably good. It's totally dependent on continued creative excellence across that business, so there is a lot of execution risk on all of these businesses. But we've got -- we feel very, very good about the products we have, about the brands, about the company there. And when we want to aim high with it. And we think it can really change our lives."

First, at the network, earlier in the quarter, we had lower costing programming, repeats versus some of the original programmer we had the year ago same quarter. We've got lower programming at the station group, given that some programming is just rolling off there. And of course, given the revenue impact, we have lower costs for the NFL week, moving from this quarter to the following -- to the third quarter. Offsetting that, we did have higher marketing costs at the network, given that we launched clearly, a schedule that was a morning series than we had in several years. So that balanced the bit of the cost reduction from the year earlier."

Pleased to join you today from Los Angeles to report our first fiscal quarter earnings.
I'm going to take a few -- make a few comments, then turn the call over to John and James, who are both in London. We've made good progress this quarter. Our performance underscores the strength of our business and the durability of the growth strategies we have pursued over the last number of years and continued to do so.
But even with progress, we are all united in the view that this is a time of transformative change in our industry. It's the kind of change that demands equal measures of clear thinking and of calculated risk-taking. In this quarter, we've applied both to good effect. There are some essential points that must be considered. While demand for the type of high-quality storytelling, news and live sport that we produce continues to grow, our viewers are increasingly choosing when and how they experience our programming. Live viewing of television is contracting as a percentage of total viewing, especially in the younger demographics coveted by advertisers. The definition of ratings success has evolved from overnight ratings to 3-day and 7-day ratings to more accurately reflect how programming is being consumed and they will need to evolve further.
Take for example, the season 2 premiere of our breakout hit, Empire. It reached nearly 12 million total viewers in Live+Same Day, a great number. But that figure more than doubles to 25 million when we look at 30-day multi-platform viewing. We see similar lifts across our networks when we look at actual consumption across a spectrum of viewing when compared to the current Live+3 Day industry standard. Using Nielsen Live + 7 Day ratings, the FOX Network is up a couple of percent year-over-year. And excluding sports, we are up almost 10%, but that tells also only half of the picture. 
Our FOX Network's average nonlinear audience has risen by about 1/3 year-over-year. It's a testament to the fact that premium broadcast content is in more demand than ever, but also illustrates the need for the industry to move to modern ratings currency that reflects today's consumption of media in a way that is highly measurable and relevant to advertisers.
Driving part of this change is, without doubt, the emergence of over-the-top services such as Hulu and Netflix. Another byproduct of these services is clearly the maturing of the traditional large cable bundle. But we see this trend as having less impact on FOX as a group than perhaps on others. That's because our key U.S. brands, FOX, Fox News, Fox Sports, National Geographic and the FX Suite, are in great demand due in large part to years of significant programming and marketing investment. In fact, this quarter's results reflect increases in our aggregate number of U.S. domestic subscribers compared to a year ago of over 1%, with subscriber additions at our younger, less distributed channels more than offsetting the overall 1% to 2% declines impacting the overall industry.
And internationally, we also continue to see subscription growth and are benefiting from demographic trends and pay television gains in high-growth markets.
Overall, we feel exceptionally well positioned with robust demand for our quality programming, leadership across entertainment, sports and news and enhanced digital product focus and strong brands that we have made a focus of our investment. We look forward to continuing to make strides against our strategic plan to continue to return real value to our shareholders over the remainder of this fiscal period and beyond.
And with that, I'll now hand over to John and James in London for their comments and for questions."

It's John, and good morning, everyone. Starting off, I'll remind you that because of the sale of our DBS businesses to Sky last November, our reported financial results for the first quarter are not like-to-like. So as we've done in the p",1209,"Thanks, Lachlan. It's John, and good morning, everyone. Starting off, I'll remind you that because of the sale of our DBS businesses to Sky last November, our reported financial results for the first quarter are not like-to-like. So as we've done in the past, we're providing total company adjusted revenue and adjusted EBITDA, which excludes the DBS businesses in the prior year period. Most of my comments that will follow will be on this adjusted basis.
So first quarter adjusted revenues decreased by $406 million to $6.1 billion as continued revenue growth in the Cable Network segment was more than offset by lower revenue at the Film segment. Note that the absence of Shine and overall adverse foreign currency movements each negatively impacted quarterly revenues by approximately $200 million. Together, these approximate the total year-over-year quarterly revenue decline.
Total segment adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was $1.54 billion, a $37 million decrease from a year ago. This decline reflects double-digit growth at the Cable Networks and Television segments, which were more than offset by lower contributions at the Film segment. This year's results include slightly more than a $100 million negative impact from unfavorable foreign currency movements. Absent this impact, our overall growth rate would be 5%.
From a bottom line perspective, we reported income from continuing operations attributable to stockholders of $678 million or $0.34 per share. Excluding the net income effects in both years of Other net and of equity earnings adjustments, primarily related to Sky's acquisitions and dispositions, first quarter adjusted EPS was $0.38 this year, down $0.01 from the comparable $0.39 a year ago. And overall, with this first quarter now completed, we're holding to the financial guidance expectations we provided to you on our last call.
And now let me provide some additional comments on the performance at our operating segments for the first quarter. And let's start with the Cable Networks, where total segment EBITDA of $1.31 billion was up 26% on segment revenue growth of 7%. Domestic revenues increased 10% in the aggregate, led by affiliate fee growth of 11% and advertising increases of 4%. EBITDA at our domestic channels increased 19% over the prior year, reflecting these higher revenues in conjunction with total cost increases of only 4%, led by lower costs at the FX Channel.
First quarter reported international affiliate fee and ad revenues were both essentially even with last year. However, excluding the effects of foreign exchange, local currency affiliate fees and advertising revenues were each up around 10%.
Reported international channel EBITDA contributions increased over 50%, even after reflecting an approximate $60 million negative impact from foreign exchange. This reported growth was largely due to lower sports programming costs at STAR Sports from the absence of last year's India-England cricket series. 
Elsewhere, double-digit local currency EBITDA growth at the STAR entertainment channels and at the Fox International Channels were essentially offset by the negative impact from foreign currency, principally from Latin America and from the euro.
Turning to our Television segment. First quarter EBITDA was $196 million, 13% higher than prior year results. This improvement largely reflects continued strong retransmission consent revenue growth and lower programming expenses at the FOX broadcast network and stations, which were partially offset by a 5% decline in segment advertising revenues. This advertising decline reflects the expected impact of 1 last week of the NFL due to a later regular-season start, which we get back in the third quarter, and lower political ad revenues at the stations due to the midterm elections in the prior year.
At the Film segment, we reported first quarter EBITDA of $149 million, $309 million below last year. This decline is primarily driven by challenging comparisons to the prior year, which included significant contributions from the theatrical release of Dawn of the Planet of the Apes and the home entertainment release of Rio 2, compared to reduced theatrical contributions this year that included the underperformance of Fantastic Four. This quarter was also impacted by the inclusion of significant pre-releasing costs in advance of these successful October theatrical release of The Martian. 
Our TV production contributions were also lower in the quarter, primarily due to lower cable syndication revenues owing to last year's sale of How I Met Your Mother.
Overall, revenues of the Film segment decreased by 28%, with close to half of this decline reflecting both the absence of revenues from Shine, which we merged with Endemol last December, and foreign currency movement.
Shifting over to our buyback activities. Since July 1 through today, we repurchased approximately $2.1 billion of FOXA shares and we're on plan to complete the authorized $5 billion buyback within the 12-month time frame that we've previously announced. 
Subsequent to quarter end, we issued $1 billion on long-term debt, and we repaid $200 million of maturities, with approximately $500 million in further maturities over the next year.
With regards to the financial guidance, as I said earlier, with 1 quarter under our belt, we're holding to the expectations we gave you 3 months ago. Specifically, we continue to anticipate a total company segment EBITDA percentage growth rate for fiscal 2016 to be in the mid-single-digit range above the $6.49 billion we reported for fiscal 2015, and that number excludes the impact of the DBS segment contributions.
Now foreign currencies are clearly weakened since our August call, and this volatility continues to be a risk to keep an eye on as the year goes forward. But our underlying business operating trends have generally been progressing as expected in the aggregate.
As you know, when Twenty-First Century Fox was formed in 2013, we provided our 3-year goals and our guidance and have updated you on those in each of the years in that cycle. As we look to the end of that 3-year period, upon the completion of this fiscal year, I'd like to touch on our approach to financial guidance going forward.
Looking back, the 3 years had ups and downs, led by currency impacts, which absorbed hundreds of millions of growth dollars and had structural changes to our portfolio of businesses. But through that period, we have been and will continue to be transparent and direct about the trends we are seeing and their impact on our outlook. We are very confident in our ability to execute against the opportunities we have ahead to sustain long-term growth, but we don't want to chase the short-term target through changes in our operating plan, merely because currency rate changes, movie release, ships are underperformed or we modify our approach to SVOD licensing. It's not good for our management team and it's not good for our shareholders. So beginning with fiscal 2017, we will modify our approach to financial guidance to eliminate our emphasis on a specific dollar annual earnings target. Instead, we'll provide you with quantitative and qualitative information on those key areas where we have good visibility and on the trends and initiatives in our businesses. We'll also provide insight into where we'll be focusing our resources to maximize opportunity through both organic innovation and through investment.  And of course, we'll also continue to provide details around our annual capital allocation plan and our targets.
And now let me turn it to James."

And good morning, everyone, and thank you all for joining us.
As you've heard from Lachlan and John, the investments we've been making in our core brands in all our key markets are progressing and producing returns, and we continue to push the pace of these initiatives as we see meaningful opportunity ahead of us.
On the short-term front, as you heard from John's review, we continue to make progress against the fiscal 2016 financial objectives. We expect strong growth in our core cable franchises, promising forward movement in our TV broadcast segment, offset by some currency headwinds and short-term performance in the Film business, which, as you know, we measure over a longer period as results can be lumpy due to timings and individual pictures' performance.
We also continue to execute on our key strategic priorities. Specifically, to create compelling and unique storytelling, to enhance the customer experience of our digital video brands and to leverage our leadership position in developing markets where we see the greatest opportunities, particularly India and Latin America. So we've seen good momentum in our domestic Cable portfolio, where our overall EBITDA growth is up 19% versus a year ago. This growth, led by revenue gains, is a clear result of the investments we've made and the work the team has done and continue to do to bolster the customer offerings of our core brands. It also reflects increases in our aggregate number of domestic subscribers compared to a year ago of over 1%.
Looking forward, as Lachlan noted, we anticipate that some of the conversations we're having with new streaming distribution services not yet to market will result in new revenue that will augment the existing viewing alternatives. Now I'd like to update you on the progress we're making at a few of our key brands.
Our domestic sports business continued to deliver and has increasingly become a critical component for distributors. In aggregate, our brands currently provide more than 25% of all sports viewing in the U.S., national and local combined. I noticed there's some recent attention on the potential disruption from the digital distribution of sports. 
Last week, Yahoo! and the NFL announced that they had 33.6 million streams or 15.2 million unique views on their NFL web stream game. Though the digital numbers are put in a comparable basis for TV ratings, Yahoo! delivered an average 1.6 million U.S. viewers per minute. That same day, on average, 18 million viewers per minute were watching the NFL on FOX.
FS1 is making real headway as well and is on or above plan by pretty much all metrics. Over the past quarter, we strengthened our audience engagement, extending last spring's successes from the broadcast of the Women's World Cup and U.S. Golf -- U.S. Open Golf with strong MLB regular and postseason events. Nationally, regular season baseball viewership on FBC and FS1 increased 16% and 22%, respectively, over last year's level. As a New Yorker and as a broadcaster, I'm disappointed, of course, with the World Series finishing in 5 games. But unfortunately, there's no changing that now. But even with fewer games, this year's World Series averaged close to 15 million viewers, more than last year's full 7-game performance, and ranked as the best 5-game average since 2009 when the Yankees beat the Phillies in 6 games. 
Locally, our regional sports networks are commanding presence, as demonstrated by our regular season baseball telecast on the RSNs, with 13 out of our 15 teams ranking at or near the top of local prime time ratings. And this year's World Series champion, the Kansas City Royals, carried on FOX Sports Midwest, scored the highest regular-season local TV ratings of any RSN in 13 years. We look forward to welcoming them in all our RSN MLB teams back for spring training. What's clear from this is that our sports brands are a fundamental differentiator for 21CF, and they'll continue to deliver returns for years to come.
At the FX suite of channels, we continue to deliver exciting new originals to audiences everywhere. In particular, the American Horror Story franchise continues to be a ratings and critical phenomenon. It won 5 Emmy Awards in September, and more recently, its fifth installment debuted the second most-watched telecast in FX Networks' history in the key 18 to 49 demo. And the premiere has reached more than 15 million total viewers to date across all platforms. 
The reception that Fargo is getting in its sophomore outing is also very encouraging, and I encourage all of you to watch the show. It's really one of the best and most exciting pieces of storytelling on air anywhere.
We look forward to calendar 2016 as well with some truly great new and returning shows including Ryan Murphy's American Crime Story: The People v. O.J. Simpson and the Americans on FX and It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia on FXX. 
Fox News continues to go from strength to strength. The August GOP debate delivered a record of 24 million total viewers, making it the #1 highest-rated non-sports cable telecast of all time. This summer, Fox News was the #1 channel across all of basic cable for 5 consecutive weeks. The Kelly File and Hannity, both reached ratings high this past quarter since debuting in their current time slots.
And the new FOX Business schedule is gaining momentum, and the channel is hosting another Republican debate on November 10. And we think it's really a great opportunity to showcase and differentiate FOX Business in terms of depth and quality and production.
Outside of the U.S., our channels have continued their growth trajectory. At STAR, the entertainment channels generated double-digit revenue and profit increases on the strength of original programming. STAR Sports' Pro Kabaddi season 2 continued its successful run with strong ratings growth. And we expect the business to take -- make meaningful profit progress this year, in line with the goals we've discussed with you in the past.
The Fox International Channels, even with some regional economic headwinds, grew its unique paying subscribers by 13% over year-ago levels, now approaching 300 million, while also delivering double-digit local currency revenue and profit growth.
More broadly, we're working hard to build on the strength of our brand portfolio. A few months ago, we announced the agreement to expand our successful joint venture with the National Geographic Society. Our plan is to form National Geographic Partners, which combines the National Geographic Society's branded media assets, including one of the most recognized and respected magazines in the world and a substantial digital footprint with the National Geographic Channels, among the most widely distributed television services globally, is an enormous opportunity for the company.
The new limited-run series breakthrough, which brings to life scientific and technological discovery through some of the biggest names in film, including Ron Howard, Brian Grazer and Brett Ratner, exemplifies the kind of storytelling that is unique to National Geographic. Combining all of these consumer-facing assets into one entity would drive greater opportunities to leverage one of the world's most recognized and treasured brands, especially in a nonlinear world. The integration planning and implementation is moving along, and we're on track to close the transaction in the next few weeks.
Turning to our U.S. Broadcast business. Trends this fall season are encouraging. While still early, we're seeing positive results driven by new programming and our investment in our returning shows. We're happy with the performance of Empire at second outing, the show really is a phenomenon. And it's one borne out of our desire to support storytellers and our appetite for taking creative risks. 
Beyond Empire, FOX has a number of new series that have provided significant gains year-over-year for us. Rosewood, Scream Queens, Grandfathered and The Grinder, have driven percentage increases anywhere from 21% to 78% compared to the same time slot last year.
It's fair to say that Minority Report has been a disappointment, and we've shortened the series order and expect to have new programming in the second half. While last year is not the benchmark we would aspire to measure against, nonetheless, total viewership growth, live, multi-platform and time-shifted to date, is up 10% year-on-year. 
As with every fall broadcast season, a lot of attention is paid to the overnight ratings reports that measure the linear viewership of the new series premieres. And we're focusing, as Lachlan said, more on total viewership and driving overall consumption on multi-platform, multi-day basis. 
The FOX Network is unique in that it attracts the youngest audience of any major broadcast network, perhaps more than any other network we're seeing significant audience growth from multi-platform viewing and from extended C3 and C7 viewing. For example, in addition to the Empire 30-day numbers, as Lachlan talked about, Scream Queens more than doubled its live audience, over 130%, when including viewership across all platforms. We're seeing similar numbers for other shows. And in fact, more than 50% of our ad inventory is now sold in the C7 window. It's true that much of this viewership is monetized today at a lower level than what we would like. And as I've said before, the important thing is to grow the audience, and our capabilities with respect to selling that audience are improving.
We're on track to grow our nonlinear ad revenue by around 40% this fiscal. This includes inventory across Hulu, VOD, FXNOW, FOX NOW, FOX Sports GO and Fox Sports Digital. We think it's important to create and distribute together, and I'm pleased that approximately 70% of our new prime time shows are from our own studio, 20th Century Fox Television, up from about 50% last year. The full-time value -- the full lifetime value of these assets is something we're very focused on.
TCFTV and its subsidiaries continue to benefit from the overall strong demand prescriptive programming, producing 36 series for 12 networks this season. While a little more than half of these series -- 64%, are supporting FOX channels, we continue to be a major provider of shows to others, with hip series such as Homeland, Modern Family and Fresh Off The Boat. Quality storytelling has never been more in demand.
Moving to the film studio. The first quarter film earnings were well below a year ago, reflecting release timing and the lack of a major successful release. However, the recent success of The Martian and a very solid slate of upcoming pictures gives us comfort here. Looking ahead, we're bringing Charlie Brown to the big screen this weekend with The Peanuts Movie, and with that, we have the next installment of the very successful Alvin and the Chipmunks franchise in December and the holiday release of Joy, which reunites Jennifer Lawrence with David O. Russell once again.
Also in December, The Revenant with Leonardo DiCaprio in a wonderful film by Alejandro Iñárritu, the very promising Deadpool this February, and we then wrap up the fiscal year with 2 big global franchises with X-Men: Apocalypse and the long-awaited sequel Independence Day Resurgence.
And looking a little further ahead, we'll also be releasing franchise extensions for Ice Age in the summer of 2016, Planet of the Apes, Aliens, Maze Runner, King's Men and of course, Avatar, over the next few years. 
It's worth noting that the film industry is gaining strength and calendar year-to-date consumer spending on digital home entertainment, up mid-teens for the industry and a bit higher for us.
We're making progress as well in our nonconsolidated businesses. The combination of the 3 Sky businesses is producing strong results, and together, these businesses are thriving, adding around 1 million paid-for subscription products this quarter and achieving the best overall U.K. sub-growth we've seen in 4 years, in addition to strong customer growth in Germany and steady performance in Italy. Sky is truly setting the pace in digital television across Europe.
Hulu continues to grow, both subscribers and engagement, aggressively. Year-to-date until September, total viewing at Hulu is up 85% versus prior year, and net subscriber additions are up more than 60%. And the Endemol Shine Group, our joint venture with Apollo, continues to deliver high-quality programming globally with non-scripted content such as Hunted being picked up by CBS in the U.S. and new scripted programming such as the Frankenstein Chronicles, preselling extremely well. Established titles such as Big Brother are traveling further than ever before with a pilot series due to air in China for the first time this fall.
So while there is still much to do, we feel good about the progress in the company overall and about where we're headed. So with that, we'll hand it over to all of you for any questions you might have. Reed?"

Look, I think as Lachlan mentioned, it is a time of change as we've all -- as we all know in the business. But I think when we look at the present state of the business, with respect to the growth that we're seeing in really IP streaming video consumption, this is something that we're very excited about. And we have been pretty aggressive about trying to create growth there, investing in our capability with respect to monetizing that viewership and doing it in a better way, developing new products for customers, as well as with partners, for example, at our Hulu partnership, growing that business very aggressively and seeing very good results at this point. So I think when we think about investing in these areas that you already -- you've already seen a lot of that in the sort of numbers and within our kind of -- within our organic internal investments as we think about how we make programming, what rights we seek to control and then how we want to sell those things. With respect to specific decisions around windowing, SVOD partners, how we're exploiting programming across the full lifetime of the programming, those are things that continually evolve. And I think it's really important for us to be able to be disruptive in those areas. I think it's important for us not to cling to business rules that inevitably change and have been changing over the last number of decades, living in a business and an industry that's been characterized, more than anything else, by really wave after wave of technological change that fundamentally creates better products for customers, creates more competition downstream. And we think in that environment, we've always been best served to be able to innovate and disrupt ourselves. So I think with respect to how we think about investment, I don't want to get into -- I don't want to get into sort of a backdoor way into '17 guidance. But I would say that we look at the sorts of things we've been doing around growing our capability as well as licensing to new entrants in the marketplace on the right business terms and also increasing the business that we do with many of our existing partners who distribute our content. These are the sorts of things we're focused on, and I think you'll see more activity with respect to that as those agreements are concluded and adjusted and as we find new ways to distribute the product going forward over the next year."

I mean, first of all, I think, as I said earlier, we believe very strongly in Hulu and in Hulu's prospects. And as I said just a second ago, in response to Doug's question, it's really crucial that we don't become overly beholden to our own incumbency. And I think that's a real -- for any business that's trying to move fast and trying to grow, that's a real danger that one has to be very alive to. And we have to be willing to take some risks but also to be innovative and to be disruptive. And I think as leaders of the business, and I think I speak for all of the leaders within the business, which is all the way through the business because everybody has a responsibility to lead, we have to be disruptors if we're going to grow. So when we look at growing the IP streaming -- sort of our growing kind of business in IP streaming in the future, we're pretty excited about the innovation that we can bring to that marketplace. And we're working hard across the board, both internally when we think about developing our authenticated apps, potentially the direct-to-consumer offerings, some of our competitors have been out there with those, we haven't done that yet here. But for example, in India with hotstar, we've been very aggressive in building out a mobile video platform that we control and that we reach the customers with directly. And we're working hard within Hulu as well to both grow the business absolutely, but also to grow the offerings of the business. And we're really excited about our progress there. With respect to your question about ads, we're also really pleased with the progress we're making with respect to sort of ad innovation, to vote with premium ad-free services, which Hulu announced and launched, but also with expanding the opt-in engagement advertising that we've talked about in the past to the Hulu platform, which we just announced yesterday. And that's in addition to our own authenticated apps services. So fundamentally, in advertising, these innovations are about empowering the audience to decide the value of their attention, and that makes sense to them. And it also makes a lot of sense to us. And we think pricing models around retention are going to be developing, and we want to be at the forefront of developing those and understanding how those work and how we can create the best return. And the scale of the Hulu inventory there and the scale of the Hulu audience is a great place to be innovating in that regard, and they've been really embracing that."

And look, I think our commitment to Hulu is self-evident. We've invested a lot in it. We continue to license to it, where it makes the most sense for our creative partners and us to do so. But also, we want to grow our app distribution as well. And I think we're seeking to license rights to distributors of all kinds, if it's on the right terms. And I think the other thing that's changing, and maybe this is to the heart of your question, is that the SVOD licensing business itself is changing pretty quickly. And there's also the surprising new approaches and new ways I think that we can provide a great service to customers that you'll see over the next little while. So I would say in that environment, of all of that going on, I think our opportunities do lie in kind of leaning in and being disruptive ourselves and not being afraid of that. And look, I think it's consistent with the way we've managed -- the way the business has grown over many, many years, from disrupting the U.S. Broadcast business with Fox Broadcasting so many years ago, to disrupting the European Television business with the 3 different Skys and disrupting advertising and the Broadcast business today with Hulu and other things over the current period in the next few years, I think, is a real opportunity to create enormous value. So look, I think that's one of the most important sort of cultural traits in our business, and it's one that we're going to continue to encourage and nurture. So I think it has to exist everywhere in this company."

Look, just to clarify, I think one of the things that's important to note is that the current -- the way the business looks today with all of the different services in subscription video on demand as well as the MBPD marketplace, all of these services are going to change. And I think you've seen competitors take the pricing. You've seen new tiers and new products emerge. And I think it's important to note that it's not necessarily a steady state. In fact, it's one of pretty rapid evolution and innovation. So I think with respect to the ad-free pricing at Hulu and the delta between ad supported and the ad-free, as you would imagine, that was a source of robust debate. But at the end of the day, the business just had to move forward and try. And we're learning a lot from that. And I think pricing may change but also, as I mentioned before, we're very focused on thinking about how can these services also expand their offerings and create new price points with new contents or other things in them? So I think that's going to evolve and I wouldn't necessarily say it's a steady-state today. With respect to cannibalization, cannibalism -- I'll refrain from commenting on -- I think it's inevitable that new services and new competition both grow the overall market but also impact customers to other services. And we're very focused on how do we think about monetization in that environment and how do we make sure that overall -- I mean, look at the whole business, our approach to growing the streaming business very aggressively is one that's going to be more attractive for us? And personally, I think over time it's not necessarily a straight line. I think over time the streaming entertainment business and streaming television business is much more attractive with opportunities for innovation in terms of ad loads, ad pricing, subscription pricing, premium ad-free models as well as the discoverability of our programming across -- for customers. It's just a very attractive -- it's had a very attractive set of attributes for customers and, I think, for our business as well. And -- but it's pretty early days in terms of finding all of the different ways that we can move it forward and we can innovate there. And your second question..."

You guys have always been ahead of the curve on giving us some really useful color around viewership, around nontraditional platforms. You did more so today. I'm trying to figure out how we can use them to model the business. So if I go back to something, I think you guys said total viewership on FOX Broadcasting Network was up like 10%. Can you remind us how much of that was sort of -- was in the traditional C3, C7 window, whatever the Nielsen kind of -- the Nielsen window you sold it in? And then can you give us what the viewership was outside that window and remind us of what the monetization of that viewership is, or at least, give us a sense of what the potential upside of the monetization is, given that you know what the audience is and you must have a sense of where you can monetize it over time? And lastly, Lachlan talked about the growth in nonlinear viewership. What are you doing with the data? You must be coming up with some pretty interesting data from the growth in this nonlinear viewership that I would imagine is extremely valuable in both monetization and devising a strategy for building your business going forward.

Yes, maybe you could help us with modeling.",654,"Thanks very much, David. So with respect to the breakdown, so for the first of all, it is more complicated, right? So when you said ""Can we help you with modeling? How will that work?"" So I'm speaking to myself. Yes, maybe you could help us with modeling. It's -- what's complicated about it is we're -- and I really -- I think it illustrates the point around measurement systems evolving that Lachlan made earlier, which is that what we're really focused on is what was our total audience last night and the day before and last week? And that was made up of customers and viewers watching live things. Things a day old, things 4 days old, things 30 days old, and in some cases, things many months old. And what you want to really do is get a picture of that overall viewership. And it's not easy to come by, and it lags because the measurement systems and all of those things don't always sync up and when we don't get those numbers in the most timely way that we would like. So the total picture of the audience is more complex. That said, just to break it down a little bit for you, in the season to date, the live viewing, as I've mentioned before, was just under half, right? So 50% was more than that. And so it's about -- I think live viewing was about 40 -- high-40s percentage there. And then Hulu made up sort of in the teens, and the balance was VOD, a very small amount for our authenticated apps, which we're working on authentication pathways and stuff to improve there, and sometimes shifting on DVR. So the balance is definitely moving towards, obviously, time-shifted and on-demand. And from a sales point of view, about half of our inventory was sold on a C7 basis in the period. So that's sort of where that breaks down, but it is something that's really evolving. And I think when we think about how we instrument the business going forward and how we measure the business and then deal with advertisers and all of our clients and customers on that, those are things that are going to continue to evolve. But we're very focused on the total audience in a given time period and then we build that up. So when we said to you that total audience was up 10% in the season to date for entertainment programming, that really was the accumulated viewership literally on a per minute basis relative to the previous year. And a lot of that was driven by the growth in 7-day and 30-day viewership there. And look, we think that it's really, really encouraging that the audience is moving toward these on-demand platforms, and in particular, where they're moving towards Hulu, where we can really innovate and monetize that audience. And with respect to your second question, just on data, you're right, it is -- it's very interesting. And when we're -- and it's -- but it's interesting. It's very, very early days because the consumption curve is pretty dramatic. And that's something that we're really using today to understand both how we use our air better in terms of promo inventory, sales inventory, et cetera, how we're going to understand how customers move between different shows and different platforms. But there are also gaps in that data, obviously, working with third-party partners, but that is a big focus for us. And we think it's one of the -- data opportunity is one of the great characteristics of an IT streaming TV business in the future, is the ability to have that data, the ability to use that to improve your products and services and monetize the viewership and the audience in the right way with respect to pricing, the attention of the audience, correct me, either for them or for advertisers."

So with respect to FS1, Fox Sports 1, fully -- is fully in profit for the full year this year, and we think that's great achievement. We've invested a lot in programming, a lot in putting a great product on screen for people. And I think the launch and the first -- in the first 2 years of this project, as I said my comments earlier, has really gone to plan or ahead of plan pretty much across the board, both in terms of audience as well as the P&L. So that's sort of where that is, and we see really good growth there going forward. Now obviously, one of the key things that drives that is affiliate fee increases. We have a lot of visibility on a lot of that. But there -- as the -- as new affiliate agreements come go forward, both in terms of distribution and price, we see an opportunity to grow there. But those will come in steps. FX, we think, is really, the FX suite more broadly, is really one of the kind of core creative franchises in the business today, and we think it's very, very promising. We see good growth there. But obviously, the investments in originals has been very high and that's something that has impacted profit other than that it would be. And at STAR, we really took 100% of the profit in the entertainment business and invested and then building a sports business there after the acquisition of ESPN Star Sports. We're seeing very, very good progress there. Last year or the year just gone was really the peak year of investments in that. So as we see continued growth in the entertainment business there and the growth rate of cost in the -- or rather, the costs spike in the sports business ameliorate pretty dramatically with that, you kind of get a double whammy there. And the growth of the STAR business in terms of EBITDA will be substantial this year and for the next few years as that sports investment kind of backs out. So I think I would say we feel really good about all of those things. And most importantly, I think as we looked at these a number of years ago and said, listen, we're going to invest in these core brands. We're going to invest in getting -- we're going to invest actually in getting out of a lot of smaller brands, little things that weren't really moving the dial for customers, we've been really successful. And when I look at our discussions with our wholesale distributors, when I look at the way we're licensing, when I look at the volume and quality of the product that we have at our hands -- in our hands now, it's really -- it's paying dividends in the marketplace as we negotiate new distribution contracts, as we license things in a new way and as we grow the audience overall, as I detailed earlier."

And I think it speaks to the increased scarcity of big live events, mass events that can deliver big audiences consistently. And at this point, I think it's early days in the season, obviously, in the NFL, but it feels reasonably good and strong going forward. As John mentioned before, we had 1 week less than the year before, but that reverses out or we get that week back later in the season. So I think it's -- I think it looks reasonably healthy. And the baseball ratings I mentioned earlier and revenue associated with that was pretty strong. So I'd feel -- I think we feel pretty good about it. And the big events on FS1 like the Women's World Cup, things like that, have been really tremendous. I mean, the other day, I think it was just last Sunday, we had a really tremendous day of sports on the network and on FS1. And all-in, it was a $100 million day.

And you'd generally tried to focus on audience growth and then create a center of gravity, create demand around that audience. And I think that's through the way we've approached it. So I feel actually pretty good in the progress there. And I would say that the Nielsen changes -- C7 changes, et cetera, are relevant. But just as relevant is our ability, moving to the question before, is our ability to gather up the data around viewing and, frankly, articulate that in a clear way to clients and advertisers and also give them the tools that are easy for them to start to innovate and experiment themselves. We're really happy to be able to get engagement units launched on Hulu or, I announced it yesterday, we have Mondelez as a -- a number of Mondelez brands really as the sort of launch partner to do that. And there's a good volume of inventory there. So actually, I think this is picking up pretty quickly. And it's a combination, not just of the Nielsen -- it's a combination of the Nielsen ratings changes and getting a currency there that's established, but also a lot of other viewership data coming from a variety of platforms. And we worked with all of those, worked with the third-party services, from Rentrak, et cetera, but also our own internal data in terms of what we're streaming and how we're doing it and those numbers there. So it's a blend of all of those things. And so far, we're seeing a reasonably good appetite for that, although it is -- it's obviously coming from a smaller base."

And what we tried to do is balance the portfolio so that we have strength in the right regions. We try to balance the long term of that business with respect to renewals, team agreements, et cetera, so that we can provide a lot of value for our team partners there and get the value in the marketplace for them. The majority of that business from a revenue perspective is affiliate revenues. So it's less driven by ratings.

And it's substantially, I think we've disclosed this, over $300 million this year, so I think in EBITDA. So it's really the eating -- the taking that investment and taking all that profit and reinvesting that into creating this new kind of -- this new business in sports, which we think is really adds a totally new dimension and a real sense of scale -- a real scale to do business there. The inflection point is when that peaks, and that peaked this year. So we see -- yes, this last year that just ended. So when we look at the future of that business, well, I'm not going to say it's a straight line. There's always some ups and downs here and there. But the profit growth will start to be significant this year and will continue towards that $1 billion target at the present conditions, if you kind of -- being consistent towards the end of this decade or thereabouts the turn of the decade. So I think that feels reasonably good. It's totally dependent on continued creative excellence across that business, so there is a lot of execution risk, as there is in all these businesses.

And of course, given the revenue impact, we have lower costs for the NFL week, moving from this quarter to the following -- to the third quarter. Offsetting that, we did have higher marketing costs at the network, given that we launched clearly a schedule that had more new series than we've had in several years.

Pleased to join you today from Los Angeles to report our first fiscal quarter earnings.
I'm going to take a few -- make a few comments, then turn the call over to John and James, who are both in London. We've made good progress this quarter. Our performance underscores the strength of our business and the durability of the growth strategies we have pursued over the last number of years and continue to do so.
But even with progress, we are all united in the view that this is a time of transformative change in our industry. It's the kind of change that demands equal measures of clear thinking and of calculated risk-taking. In this quarter, we've applied both to good effect. There are some essential points that must be considered. While demand for the type of high-quality storytelling, news and live sport that we produce continues to grow, our viewers are increasingly choosing when and how they experience our programming. Live viewing of television is contracting as a percentage of total viewing, especially in the younger demographics coveted by advertisers. The definition of ratings success has evolved from overnight ratings to 3-day and 7-day ratings to more accurately reflect how programming is being consumed and they will need to evolve further.
Take for example, the season 2 premiere of our breakout hit, Empire. It reached nearly 12 million total viewers in Live+Same Day, a great number. But that figure more than doubles to 25 million when we look at 30-day multi-platform viewing. We see similar lifts across our networks when we look at actual consumption across a spectrum of viewing when compared to the current Live+3 Day industry standard. Using Nielsen Live + 7 Day ratings, the FOX Network is up a couple of percent year-over-year. And excluding sports, we are up almost 10%, but that tells only half of the picture. 
Our FOX Network's average nonlinear audience has risen by about 1/3 year-over-year. It's a testament to the fact that premium broadcast content is in more demand than ever, but also illustrates the need for the industry to move to modern ratings currency that reflects today's consumption of media in a way that is highly measurable and relevant to advertisers.
Driving part of this change is, without doubt, the emergence of over-the-top services such as Hulu and Netflix. Another byproduct of these services is clearly the maturing of the traditional large cable bundle. But we see this trend as having less impact on FOX as a group than perhaps on others. That's because our key U.S. brands, FOX, Fox News, Fox Sports, National Geographic and the FX Suite, are in great demand due in large part to years of significant programming and marketing investment. In fact, this quarter's results reflect increases in our aggregate number of U.S. domestic subscribers compared to a year ago of over 1%, with subscriber additions at our younger, less distributed channels more than offsetting the overall 1% to 2% declines impacting the overall industry.
And internationally, we also continue to see subscription growth and are benefiting from demographic trends and pay television gains in high-growth markets.
Overall, we feel exceptionally well positioned with robust demand for our quality programming, leadership across entertainment, sports and news and enhanced digital product focus and strong brands that we have made a focus of our investment. We look forward to continuing to make strides against our strategic plan to continue to return real value to our shareholders over the remainder of this fiscal period and beyond.
And with that, I'll now hand over to John and James in London for their comments and for questions."

It's John, and good morning, everyone. Starting off, I'll remind you that because of the sale of our DBS businesses to Sky last November, our reported financial results for the first quarter are not like-to-like. So as we've done in the p",1209,"Thanks, Lachlan. It's John, and good morning, everyone. Starting off, I'll remind you that because of the sale of our DBS businesses to Sky last November, our reported financial results for the first quarter are not like-to-like. So as we've done in the past, we're providing total company adjusted revenue and adjusted EBITDA, which excludes the DBS businesses in the prior year period. Most of my comments that follow will be on this adjusted basis.
So first quarter adjusted revenues decreased by $406 million to $6.1 billion as continued revenue growth in the Cable Network segment was more than offset by lower revenue at the Film segment. Note that the absence of Shine and overall adverse foreign currency movements each negatively impacted quarterly revenues by approximately $200 million. Together, these approximate the total year-over-year quarterly revenue decline.
Total segment adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was $1.54 billion, a $37 million decrease from a year ago. This decline reflects double-digit growth at the Cable Networks and Television segments, which were more than offset by lower contributions at the Film segment. This year's results include slightly more than a $100 million negative impact from unfavorable foreign currency movements. Absent this impact, our overall growth rate would be 5%.
From a bottom line perspective, we reported income from continuing operations attributable to stockholders of $678 million or $0.34 per share. Excluding the net income effects in both years of Other net and of equity earnings adjustments, primarily related to Sky's acquisitions and dispositions, first quarter adjusted EPS was $0.38 this year, down $0.01 from the comparable $0.39 a year ago. And overall, with this first quarter now completed, we're holding to the financial guidance expectations we provided to you on our last call.
And now let me provide some additional comments on the performance at our operating segments for the first quarter. And let's start with the Cable Networks, where total segment EBITDA of $1.31 billion was up 26% on segment revenue growth of 7%. Domestic revenues increased 10% in the aggregate, led by affiliate fee growth of 11% and advertising increases of 4%. EBITDA at our domestic channels increased 19% over the prior year, reflecting these higher revenues in conjunction with total cost increases of only 4%, led by lower costs at the FX Channel.
First quarter reported international affiliate fee and ad revenues were both essentially even with last year. However, excluding the effects of foreign exchange, local currency affiliate fees and advertising revenues, were each up around 10%.
Reported international channel EBITDA contributions increased over 50%, even after reflecting an approximate $60 million negative impact from foreign exchange. This reported growth was largely due to lower sports programming costs at STAR Sports from the absence of last year's India-England cricket series. 
Elsewhere, double-digit local currency EBITDA growth at the STAR entertainment channels and at the Fox International Channels were essentially offset by the negative impact from foreign currency, principally from Latin America and from the euro.
Turning to our Television segment. First quarter EBITDA was $196 million, 13% higher than prior year results. This improvement largely reflects continued strong retransmission consent revenue growth and lower programming expenses at the FOX broadcast network and stations, which were partially offset by a 5% decline in segment advertising revenues. This advertising decline reflects the expected impact of 1 less week of the NFL due to a later regular-season start, which we get back in the third quarter, and lower political ad revenues at the stations due to the midterm elections in the prior year.
At the Film segment, we reported first quarter EBITDA of $149 million, $309 million below last year. This decline is primarily driven by challenging comparisons to the prior year, which included significant contributions from the theatrical release of Dawn of the Planet of the Apes and the home entertainment release of Rio 2, compared to reduced theatrical contributions this year that included the underperformance of Fantastic Four. This quarter was also impacted by the inclusion of significant pre-releasing costs in advance of these successful October theatrical release of The Martian. 
Our TV production contributions were also lower in the quarter, primarily due to lower cable syndication revenues owing to last year's sale of How I Met Your Mother.
Overall, revenues of the Film segment decreased by 28%, with close to half of this decline reflecting both the absence of revenues from Shine, which we merged with Endemol last December, and foreign currency movement.
Shifting over to our buyback activities. Since July 1 through today, we've repurchased approximately $2.1 billion of FOXA shares and we're on plan to complete the authorized $5 billion buyback within the 12-month time frame that we've previously announced. 
Subsequent to quarter end, we issued $1 billion on long-term debt, and we repaid $200 million of maturities, with approximately $500 million in further maturities over the next year.
With regards to the financial guidance, as I said earlier, with 1 quarter under our belt, we're holding to the expectations we gave you 3 months ago. Specifically, we continue to anticipate a total company segment EBITDA percentage growth rate for fiscal 2016 to be in the mid-single-digit range above the $6.49 billion we reported for fiscal 2015, and that number excludes the impact of the DBS segment contributions.
Now foreign currencies are clearly weakened since our August call, and this volatility continues to be a risk to keep an eye on as the year goes forward. But our underlying business operating trends have generally been progressing as expected in the aggregate.
As you know, when Twenty-First Century Fox was formed in 2013, we provided our 3-year goals and our guidance and have updated you on those in each of the years in that cycle. As we look to the end of that 3-year period, upon the completion of this fiscal year, I'd like to touch on our approach to financial guidance going forward.
Looking back, the 3 years had ups and downs, led by currency impacts, which absorbed hundreds of millions of growth dollars and had structural changes to our portfolio of businesses. But through that period, we have been and will continue to be transparent and direct about the trends we are seeing and their impact on our outlook. We are very confident in our ability to execute against the opportunities we have ahead to sustain long-term growth, but we don't want to chase the short-term target through changes in our operating plan, merely because currency rate changes, movie release, shifts are underperformed or we modify our approach to SVOD licensing. It's not good for our management team and it's not good for our shareholders. So beginning with fiscal 2017, we will modify our approach to financial guidance to eliminate our emphasis on a specific dollar annual earnings target. Instead, we'll provide you with quantitative and qualitative information on those key areas where we have good visibility and on the trends and initiatives in our businesses. We'll also provide insight into where we'll be focusing our resources to maximize opportunity through both organic innovation and through investment. And of course, we'll also continue to provide details around our annual capital allocation plan and our targets.
And now let me turn it over to James."

Specifically, to create compelling and unique storytelling, to enhance the customer experience of our digital video brands and to leverage our leadership positions in developing markets where we see the greatest opportunities, particularly India and Latin America. So we've seen good momentum in our domestic Cable portfolio, where our overall EBITDA growth is up 19% versus a year ago. This growth, led by revenue gains, is a clear result of the investments we've made and the work the team has done and continue to do to bolster the customer offerings of our core brands. It also reflects increases in our aggregate number of domestic subscribers compared to a year ago of over 1%.
Looking forward, as Lachlan noted, we anticipate that some of the conversations we're having with new streaming distribution services not yet to market, will result in new revenue that will augment the existing viewing alternatives. Now I'd like to update you on the progress we're making at a few of our key brands.
Our domestic sports business continued to deliver and has increasingly become a critical component for distributors. In aggregate, our brands currently provide more than 25% of all sports viewing in the U.S., national and local combined. I know there's been some recent attention on the potential disruption from the digital distribution of sports. 
Last week, Yahoo! and the NFL announced that they had 33.6 million streams or 15.2 million unique views on their NFL web stream game. Though when digital numbers are put in a comparable basis for TV ratings, Yahoo! delivered an average 1.6 million U.S. viewers per minute. That same day, on average, 18 million viewers per minute were watching the NFL on FOX.
FS1 is making real headway as well and is on or above plan by pretty much all metrics. Over the past quarter, we strengthened our audience engagement, extending last spring's successes from the broadcast of the Women's World Cup and U.S. Golf -- U.S. Open Golf with strong MLB regular and postseason events. Nationally, regular season baseball viewership on FBC and FS1 increased 16% and 22%, respectively, over last year's level. As a New Yorker and as a broadcaster, I'm disappointed, of course, with the World Series finishing in 5 games. But unfortunately, there's no changing that now. But even with fewer games, this year's World Series averaged close to 15 million viewers, more than last year's full 7-game performance, and ranked as the best 5-game average since 2009 when the Yankees beat the Phillies in 6 games. 
Locally, our regional sports networks are commanding presence, as demonstrated by our regular season baseball telecast on the RSNs, with 13 out of our 15 teams ranking at or near the top of local prime time ratings. And this year's World Series champion, the Kansas City Royals, carried on FOX Sports Midwest, scored the highest regular-season local TV ratings of any RSN in 13 years. We look forward to welcoming them in all our RSN MLB teams back for spring training. What's clear from this is that our sports brands are a fundamental differentiator for 21CF, and they'll continue to deliver returns for years to come.
At the FX suite of channels, we continue to deliver exciting new originals to audiences everywhere. In particular, the American Horror Story franchise continues to be a ratings and critical phenomenon. It won 5 Emmy Awards in September, and more recently, its fifth installment debuted as the second most-watched telecast in FX Networks' history in the key 18 to 49 demo. And the premiere has reached more than 15 million total viewers to date across all platforms. 
The reception that Fargo is getting in its sophomore outing is also very encouraging, and I encourage all of you to watch the show. It's really one of the best and most exciting pieces of storytelling on air anywhere.
We look forward to calendar 2016 as well with some truly great new and returning shows including Ryan Murphy's American Crime Story: The People v. O.J. Simpson and the Americans on FX and It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia on FXX. 
Fox News continues to go from strength to strength. The August GOP debate delivered a record 24 million total viewers, making it the #1 highest-rated non-sports cable telecast of all time. This summer, Fox News was the #1 channel across all of basic cable for 5 consecutive weeks. The Kelly File and Hannity, both reached ratings high this past quarter since debuting in their current time slots.
And the new FOX Business schedule is gaining momentum, and the channel is hosting another Republican debate on November 10. And we think it's really a great opportunity to showcase and differentiate FOX Business in terms of depth and quality and production.
Outside of the U.S., our channels have continued their growth trajectory. At STAR, the entertainment channels generated double-digit revenue and profit increases on the strength of original programming. STAR Sports' Pro Kabaddi season 2 continued its successful run with strong ratings growth. And we expect the business to take -- make meaningful profit progress this year, in line with the goals we've discussed with you in the past.
The Fox International Channels, even with some regional economic headwinds, grew its unique paying subscribers by 13% over year-ago levels, now approaching 300 million, while also delivering double-digit local currency revenue and profit growth.
More broadly, we're working hard to build on the strength of our brand portfolio. A few months ago, we announced the agreement to expand our successful joint venture with the National Geographic Society. Our plan is to form National Geographic Partners, which combines the National Geographic Society's branded media assets, including one of the most recognized and respected magazines in the world and a substantial digital footprint with the National Geographic Channels, among the most widely distributed television services globally, is an enormous opportunity for the company.
The new limited-run series breakthrough, which brings to life scientific and technological discovery through some of the biggest names in film, including Ron Howard, Brian Grazer and Brett Ratner, exemplifies the kind of storytelling that is unique to National Geographic. Combining all of these consumer-facing assets into one entity would drive greater opportunities to leverage one of the world's most recognized and treasured brands, especially in a nonlinear world. The integration planning and implementation is moving along, and we're on track to close the transaction in the next few weeks.
Turning to our U.S. Broadcast business. Trends this fall season are encouraging. While still early, we're seeing positive results driven by new programming and our investment in our returning shows. We're happy with the performance of Empire at second outing, the show really is a phenomenon. And it's one borne out of our desire to support storytellers and our appetite for taking creative risks. 
Beyond Empire, FOX has a number of new series that have provided significant gains year-over-year for us. Rosewood, Scream Queens, Grandfathered and The Grinder, have driven percentage increases anywhere from 21% to 78% compared to the same time slot last year.
It's fair to say that Minority Report has been a disappointment, and we've shortened the series order and expect to have new programming in the second half. While last year is not the benchmark we would aspire to measure against, nonetheless, total viewership growth, live, multi-platform and time-shifted to date, is up 10% year-on-year. 
As with every fall broadcast season, a lot of attention is paid to the overnight ratings reports that measure the linear viewership of the new series premieres. And we're focusing, as Lachlan said, more on total viewership and driving overall consumption on multi-platform, multi-day basis. 
The FOX Network is unique in that it attracts the youngest audience of any major broadcast network. Perhaps more than any other network, we're seeing significant audience growth from multi-platform viewing and from extended C3 and C7 viewing. For example, in addition to the Empire 30-day numbers, as Lachlan talked about, Scream Queens more than doubled its live audience, over 130%, when including viewership across all platforms. We're seeing similar numbers for other shows. And in fact, more than 50% of our ad inventory is now sold in the C7 window. It's true that much of this viewership is monetized today at a lower level than what we would like. And as I've said before, the important thing is to grow the audience, and our capabilities with respect to selling that audience are improving.
We're on track to grow our nonlinear ad revenue by around 40% this fiscal. This includes inventory across Hulu, VOD, FXNOW, FOX NOW, FOX Sports GO and Fox Sports Digital. We think it's important to create and distribute together, and I'm pleased that approximately 70% of our new prime time shows are from our own studio, 20th Century Fox Television, up from about 50% last year. The full-time value -- the full lifetime value of these assets is something we're very focused on.
TCFTV and its subsidiaries continue to benefit from the overall strong demand prescriptive programming, producing 36 series for 12 networks this season. While a little more than half of these series, 64%, are supporting FOX channels, we continue to be a major provider of shows to others, with hip series such as Homeland, Modern Family and Fresh Off The Boat. Quality storytelling has never been more in demand.
Moving to the film studio. The first quarter film earnings were well below a year ago, reflecting release timing and the lack of a major successful release. However, the recent success of The Martian and a very solid slate of upcoming pictures gives us some comfort here. Looking ahead, we're bringing Charlie Brown to the big screen this weekend with The Peanuts Movie, and we then have the next installment of the very successful Alvin and the Chipmunks franchise in December and the holiday release of Joy, which reunites Jennifer Lawrence with David O. Russell once again.
Also in December, The Revenant with Leonardo DiCaprio in a wonderful film by Alejandro Iñárritu, the very promising Deadpool this February, and we then wrap up the fiscal year with 2 big global franchises with X-Men: Apocalypse and the long-awaited sequel Independence Day Resurgence.
And looking a little further ahead, we'll also be releasing franchise extensions for Ice Age in the summer of 2016, Planet of the Apes, Aliens, Maze Runner, King's Men and of course, Avatar, over the next few years. 
It's worth noting that the film industry is gaining strength. The calendar year-to-date consumer spending on digital home entertainment, up mid-teens for the industry and a bit higher for us.
We're making progress as well in our nonconsolidated businesses. The combination of the 3 Sky businesses is producing strong results, and together, these businesses are thriving, adding around 1 million paid-for subscription products this quarter and achieving the best overall U.K. sub-growth we've seen in 4 years, in addition to strong customer growth in Germany and steady performance in Italy. Sky is truly setting the pace in digital television across Europe.
Hulu continues to grow, both subscribers and engagement, aggressively. Year-to-date through September, total viewing at Hulu is up 85% versus prior year, and net subscriber additions are up more than 60%. And the Endemol Shine Group, our joint venture with Apollo, continues to deliver high-quality programming globally with non-scripted content such as Hunted being picked up by CBS in the U.S. and new scripted programming such as the Frankenstein Chronicles, preselling extremely well. Established titles such as Big Brother are traveling further than ever before with a pilot series due to air in China for the first time this fall.
So while there is still much to do, we feel good about the progress in the company overall and about where we're headed. So with that, we'll hand it over to all of you for any questions you might have. Reed?"

Look, I think as Lachlan mentioned, it is a time of change as we've all -- as we all know in the business. But I think when we look at the present state of the business, with respect to the growth that we're seeing in really IP streaming video consumption, this is something that we're very excited about. And we have been pretty aggressive about trying to create growth there, investing in our capability with respect to monetizing that viewership and doing it in a better way, developing new products for customers, as well as with partners, for example, at our Hulu partnership, growing that business very aggressively and seeing very good results at this point. So I think when we think about investing in these areas, that you already -- you've already seen a lot of that in the sort of numbers and within our kind of -- within our organic internal investments as we think about how we make programming, what rights we seek to control and then how we want to sell those things. With respect to specific decisions around windowing, SVOD partners, how we're exploiting programming across the full lifetime of the programming, those are things that continually evolve. And I think it's really important for us to be able to be disruptive in those areas. I think it's important for us not to cling to business rules that inevitably change and have been changing over the last number of decades, being in a business and an industry that's been characterized, more than anything else, by really wave after wave of technological change that fundamentally creates better products for customers, creates more competition downstream. And we think in that environment, we've always been best served to be able to innovate and disrupt ourselves. So I think with respect to how we think about investment, I don't want to get into -- I don't want to get into sort of a backdoor way into '17 guidance. But I would say that we look at the sorts of things we've been doing around growing our capability as well as licensing to new entrants in the marketplace on the right business terms and also increasing the business that we do with many of our existing partners who distribute our content. These are the sorts of things we're focused on, and I think you'll see more activity with respect to that as those agreements are concluded and adjusted and as we find new ways to distribute the product going forward over the next year."

I mean, first of all, I think, as I said earlier, we believe very strongly in Hulu and in Hulu's prospects. And as I said just a second ago, in response to Doug's question, it's really crucial that we don't become overly beholden to our own incumbency. And I think that's a real -- for any business that's trying to move fast and trying to grow, that's a real danger that one has to be very alive to. And we have to be willing to take some risks but also to be innovative and to be disruptive. And I think as leaders of the business, and I think I speak for all of the leaders within the business, which is all the way through the business because everybody has a responsibility to lead, we have to be disruptors if we're going to grow. So when we look at growing the IP streaming -- sort of our growing kind of business in IP streaming in the future, we're pretty excited about the innovation that we can bring to that marketplace. And we're working hard across the board, both internally, when we think about developing our authenticated apps, potentially, the direct-to-consumer offerings. Some of our competitors have been out there with those, we haven't done that yet here. But for example, in India with hotstar, we've been very aggressive in building out a mobile video platform that we control and that we reach the customers with directly. And we're working hard within Hulu as well to both grow the business absolutely, but also to grow the offerings of the business. And we're really excited about our progress there. With respect to your question about ads, we're also really pleased with the progress we're making with respect to sort of ad innovation, to vote with premium ad-free services, which Hulu announced and launched, but also with expanding the opt-in engagement advertising that we've talked about in the past, to the Hulu platform, which we just announced yesterday. And that's in addition to our own authenticated apps services. So fundamentally, in advertising, these innovations are about empowering the audience to decide the value of their attention, and that makes sense to them. And it also makes a lot of sense to us. And we think pricing models around retention are going to be developing, and we want to be at the forefront of developing those and understanding how those work and how we can create the best return. And the scale of the Hulu inventory there and the scale of the Hulu audience is a great place to be innovating in that regard, and they've been really embracing that."

But also, we want to grow our app distribution as well. And I think we're seeking to license rights to distributors of all kinds, if it's on the right terms. And I think the other thing that's changing, and maybe this is to the heart of your question, is that the SVOD licensing business itself is changing pretty quickly. And there's also the surprising new approaches and new ways I think that we can provide a great service to customers that you'll see over the next little while. So I would say in that environment, of all of that going on, I think our opportunities do lie in kind of leaning in and being disruptive ourselves and not being afraid of that. And look, I think it's consistent with the way we've managed and the way the business has grown over many, many years, from disrupting the U.S. Broadcast business with Fox Broadcasting so many years ago, to disrupting the European Television business with the 3 different Skys and disrupting advertising and the Broadcast business today with Hulu and other things over the current period in the next few years, I think, is a real opportunity to create enormous value. So look, I think that's one of the most important sort of cultural traits in our business, and it's one that we're going to continue to encourage and nurture. So I think it has to exist everywhere in this company."

Look, just to clarify, I think one of the things that's important to note is that the current -- the way the business looks today with all of the different services in subscription video on demand as well as the MBPD marketplace, all of these services are going to change. And I think you've seen competitors take pricing. You've seen new tiers and new products emerge. And I think it's important to note that it's not necessarily a steady state. In fact, it's one of pretty rapid evolution and innovation. So I think with respect to the ad-free pricing at Hulu and the delta between ad supported and the ad-free, as you would imagine, that was a source of robust debate. But at the end of the day, the business just had to move forward and try. And we're learning a lot from that. And I think pricing may change but also, as I mentioned before, we're very focused on thinking about how can these services also expand their offerings and create new price points with new contents or other things in them? So I think that's going to evolve and I wouldn't necessarily say it's a steady-state today. With respect to cannibalization, cannibalism -- I'll refrain from commenting on -- I think it's inevitable that new services and new competition both grow the overall market but also impact customers to other services. And we're very focused on how do we think about monetization in that environment and how do we make sure that overall -- I mean, look at the whole business, our approach to growing the streaming business very aggressively is one that's going to be more attractive for us? And personally, I think over time, it's not necessarily a straight line. I think over time, the streaming entertainment business and streaming television business is much more attractive with opportunities for innovation in terms of ad loads, ad pricing, subscription pricing, premium ad-free models as well as the discoverability of our programming across -- for customers. It's just a very attractive -- it's had a very attractive set of attributes for customers and, I think, for our business as well. And -- but it's pretty early days in terms of finding all of the different ways that we can move it forward and we can innovate there. And your second question..."

You guys have always been ahead of the curve on giving us some really useful color around viewership, around nontraditional platforms. You did more so today. I'm trying to figure out how we can use them to model the business. So if I go back to something, I think you guys said total viewership on FOX Broadcasting Network was up like 10%. Can you remind us how much of that was sort of -- was in the traditional C3, C7 window, whatever the Nielsen kind of -- the Nielsen window you sold it in? And then can you give us what the viewership was outside that window and remind us of what the monetization of that viewership is, or at least, give us a sense of what the potential upside of the monetization is, given that you know what the audience is and you must have a sense of where you can monetize it over time? And lastly, Lachlan talked about the growth in nonlinear viewership. What are you doing with the data? You must be coming up with some pretty interesting data from the growth in this nonlinear viewership that I would imagine is extremely valuable in both monetization and devising a strategy for building your business going forward. How do you think about the data?"

So when you said ""Can we help you with modeling? How all that works."" So I was thinking to myself, yes, maybe you could help us modeling how it works. It's -- what's complicated about it is we're -- and I really -- I think it illustrates the point around measurement systems evolving, that Lachlan made earlier, which is that what we're really focused on is what was our total audience last night and the day before and last week? And that was made up of customers and viewers watching live things. Things a day old, things 4 days old, things 30 days old, and in some cases, things many months old. And what you want to really do is get a picture of that overall viewership. But it's not easy to come by, and it lags because the measurement systems and all of those things don't always sync up and we don't get those numbers in the most timely way that we would like. So the total picture of the audience is more complex. That said, just to break it down a little bit for you, in the season to date, the live viewing, as I've mentioned before, was just under half, right? So 50% was more than that. And so it's about -- I think live viewing was about 40 -- high-40s percentage there. And then Hulu made up sort of in the teens, and the balance was VOD, a very small amount for our authenticated apps, which we're working on authentication pathways and stuff to improve there, and sometimes shifting on DVR. So the balance is definitely moving towards, obviously, time-shifted and on-demand. And from a sales point of view, about half of our inventory was sold on a C7 basis in the period. So that's sort of where that breaks down, but it is something that's really evolving. And I think when we think about how we instrument the business going forward and how we measure the business and then deal with advertisers and all of our clients and customers on that, those are things that are going to continue to evolve. But we're very focused on the total audience in a given time period and then we build that up. So when we said to you that total audience was up 10% in the season to date for entertainment programming, that really was the accumulated viewership literally on a per minute basis relative to the previous year. And a lot of that was driven by the growth in 7-day and 30-day viewership there. And look, we think that it's really, really encouraging that the audience is moving toward these on-demand platforms, and in particular, where they're moving towards Hulu, where we can really innovate and monetize that audience. And with respect to your second question, just on data, you're right, it is -- it's very interesting. And when we're -- and it's -- but it's interesting. It's very, very early days because the consumption curve is pretty dramatic. And that's something that we're really using today to understand both how we use our air better in terms of promo inventory, sales inventory, et cetera, how we understand how customers move between different shows and different platforms. But there are also gaps in that data, obviously, working with third-party partners, but that is a big focus for us. And we think it's one of the -- data opportunity is one of the great characteristics of an IT streaming TV business in the future, is the ability to have that data, the ability to use that to improve your products and services and monetize the viewership and the audience in the right way with respect to pricing the attention of the audience correctly, either for them or for advertisers."

Thanks, Ben. I think the -- I'd add another sort of -- I'd add another stool for that -- leg to that stool, I guess, which is the investment that we've made in India in STAR, which is also one of the things that has been the investment we were making, but also, I think, when you look forward, generates a lot of growth. So with respect to FS1, Fox Sports 1, fully -- is fully in profit for the full year this year, and we think that's great achievement. We've invested a lot in programming, a lot in putting a great product on screen for people. And I think the launch and the first -- in the first 2 years of this project, as I said in my comments earlier, has really gone to plan or ahead of plan pretty much across the board, both in terms of audience as well as the P&L. So that's sort of where that is, and we see really good growth there going forward. Now obviously, one of the key things that drives that is affiliate fee increases. We have a lot of visibility on a lot of that. But there -- as the -- as new affiliate agreements come -- go forward, both in terms of distribution and price, we see an opportunity to grow there. But those will come in steps. FX, we think, is really the FX suite. More broadly, is really one of the kind of core creative franchises in the business today, and we think it's very, very promising. We see good growth there. But obviously, the investments in originals has been very high and that's something that has impacted profit other than that it would be. And at STAR, we really took 100% of the profit in the entertainment business and invested it in building a sports business there after the acquisition of ESPN Star Sports. We're seeing very, very good progress there. Last year or the year just gone was really the peak year of investments in that. So as we see continued growth in the entertainment business there and the growth rate of cost in the -- or rather, the cost spike in the sports business ameliorate pretty dramatically, with that, you kind of get a double whammy there. And the growth of the STAR business in terms of EBITDA will be substantial this year and for the next few years as that sports investment kind of backs out. So I think I would say we feel really good about all of those things. And most importantly, I think as we looked at these a number of years ago and said, listen, we're going to invest in these core brands. We're going to invest in getting -- we're going to invest actually in getting out of a lot of smaller brands, little things that weren't really moving the dial for customers, we think that's been really successful. And when I look at our discussions with our wholesale distributors, when I look at the way we're licensing, when I look at the volume and quality of the product that we have at our hands -- in our hands now, it's really -- it's paying dividends in the marketplace as we negotiate new distribution contracts, as we license things in a new way and as we grow the audience overall, as I detailed earlier."

We've seen -- I would say they're pretty much across the board in our sports portfolio. And I think it speaks to the increased scarcity of big live events, mass events that can deliver big audiences consistently. And at this point, I think it's early days in the season, obviously, in the NFL, but it feels reasonably good and strong going forward. As John mentioned before, we had 1 week less than the year before, but that reverses out or we get that week back later in the season. So I think it's -- I think it looks reasonably healthy. And the baseball ratings I mentioned earlier and revenue associated with that was pretty strong. So I'd feel -- I think we feel pretty good about it. And the big events on FS1 like the Women's World Cup, things like that, have been really tremendous. I mean, the other day, I think it was just last Sunday, we had a really tremendous day of sports on the network and on FS1. And all-in, it was a $100 million day.

And you'd generally try to focus on audience growth and then create a center of gravity, create demand around that audience. And I think that's through the way we've approached it. So I feel actually pretty good in the progress there. And I would say that the Nielsen changes -- C7 changes, et cetera, are relevant. But just as relevant is our ability, moving to the question before, is our ability to gather up the data around viewing and, frankly, articulate that in a clear way to clients and advertisers and also give them the tools that are easy for them to start to innovate and experiment themselves. We're really happy to be able to get engagement units launched on Hulu or, I announced it yesterday, and we have Mondelez as a -- a number of Mondelez brands really as the sort of launch partner to do that. And there's a good volume of inventory there. So actually, I think this is picking up pretty quickly. And it's a combination, not just of the Nielsen -- it's a combination of the Nielsen ratings changes and getting a currency there that's established, but also a lot of other viewership data coming from a variety of platforms. And we work with all of those, we work with the third-party services, from Rentrak, et cetera, but also our own internal data in terms of what we're streaming and how we're doing it and those numbers there. So it's a blend of all of those things. And so far, we're seeing a reasonably good appetite for that, although it is -- it's obviously coming from a smaller base."

And what we tried to do is balance the portfolio so that we have strength in the right regions. We try to balance the long term of that business with respect to renewals, team agreements, et cetera, so that we can provide a lot of value for our team partners there and get the value in the marketplace for them. The majority of that business from a revenue perspective is affiliate revenues. So it's less driven by ratings.

So it's really the eating -- the taking that investment and taking all that profit and reinvesting that into creating this new kind of -- this new business in sports, which we think really adds a totally new dimension and a real sense of scale -- a real scale to the business there. The inflection point is when that peaks, and that peaked this year. So we see -- yes, this last year that just ended. So when we look at the future of that business, while I'm not going to say it's a straight line. There's always some ups and downs here and there. But the profit growth will start to be significant this year and will continue towards that $1 billion target at the present conditions, if you kind of -- being consistent towards the end of this decade or thereabouts the turn of the decade. So I think that feels reasonably good. It's totally dependent on continued creative excellence across that business, so there is a lot of execution risk, as there is in all these businesses.

Offsetting that, we did have higher marketing costs at the network, given that we launched clearly a schedule that had more new series than we've had in several years.
