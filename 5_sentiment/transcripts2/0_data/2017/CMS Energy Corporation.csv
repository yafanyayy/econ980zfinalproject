Welcome to our 2016 year-end earnings call. We had another great year, and we look forward to sharing the highlights with you today.I'll review our 2016 results and 2017 focus and priorities, and Tom will cover",1412,"Thank you, Sri. Welcome, and good morning. Welcome to our 2016 year-end earnings call. We had another great year, and we look forward to sharing the highlights with you today.
I'll review our 2016 results and 2017 focus and priorities, and Tom will cover the financial results and outlook.
As you know, we released this morning that we again hit our top end of guidance at 7% year-over-year adjusted EPS growth at $2.02. That makes 14 years in a row of consistent performance at the top-end. Based on our 2016 actual performance, we're raising our 2017 full year guidance to the range of $2.14 to $2.18, or 6% to 8% adjusted EPS growth. As our earnings are growing among the best, we match that with equally strong dividend growth. Therefore, we once again increased our dividend 7% in line with our EPS growth.
As you've come to expect, our financial performance is not an accident. Our financial performance is supported by our operational strength. We are proud to share that we had our safest year on record, which is a 20% improvement over last year's previous best. We also had the best generation reliability on record. We delivered this performance while, at the same time, we retired 7 of our 12 coal field generation units. During operational success like this -- delivering operational success like this, while at the same time transitioning our fleet so significantly, requires a disciplined team focused on results. We once again delivered best-in-class cost reductions as well. In fact, O&M is down 6.5% year-over-year. This fuels our 10-year investment plan of $2.5 billion from our projection last year.
Lots of people ask so I'll definitely provide more details about how we continue to do this. We are well underway for another great year with emphasis on the new energy laws, our clean and lean capacity replacement strategy and the Consumers Energy way. 
Let's start by reviewing the energy law highlights. The Michigan legislature and governor in concert with the Michigan Agency for Energy and the MPSC have delivered solid policy for our state. At the highest level, this new law addresses the retail open access cross subsidy, enabling more competitive prices and eliminates the risk of energy shortfalls in Michigan. We're reminding everyone that Michigan is open for business. This new law creates a framework for our clean and lean generation strategy led by improved energy efficiency and demand response incentives, a 15% RPS standard and a very constructive net metering framework that removes the subsidy for the future producers of private [indiscernible].
Also, there's an integrated resource planning process that will allow for longer-term planning as well as upfront prudency review of our supply and demand strategy, which will result in a modern, reliable and affordable energy supply for Michigan.
Let me take a minute to share a bit more about what we mean when we refer to clean and lean. Our recent Palisades PPA termination application is a great example. We have long said that an inflexible, above-market PPA is not a cost-effective option for our customers and provides no long-term value for our investors. At the same time, we want to assure that we have sufficient resources to serve the load in Michigan. The traditional approach would be to replace the PPA with the megawatt for megawatt central station power plant. Instead, we believe we can use this change as an opportunity to build out a cleaner and leaner resource mix that assures reliability at the lowest cost possible that is a win for both customers and investors. By cleaner, we mean replacing Palisades with more energy efficiency, demand response, additional coal to gas switching and renewable energy as called for in our new law. By leaner, we mean when replacing Palisades, we can reduce demand on the peaks and fully utilize our existing gas assets. This saves our customers both energy and money. We're rightsizing our asset to match demand, thereby eliminating waste and still assuring reliability. We can de-risk our entire capital plan by freeing up dollars that would be traditionally kept in [ph] a big bag capital project. For many smaller options, that meet more of our customer's needs with less risk and less waste. And as we often remind you, we have plenty of that work that needs to be done. We are confident that we have a solid capacity replacement plan for Palisades that will ensure reliability and increasingly clean and affordable supply for the people of Michigan for years to come. I hope you're picking up on our continued theme of lean thinking. It's lean thinking that underpins not only our generation strategy but it is the heart of our CE way. Lean is not just low cost, it's about waste elimination that improves value for our customers at the lowest cost. Our business model is based on this lean way of thinking. We're deploying our CE way in all areas of our business. We are far from perfect and we can find areas for continuous improvement and waste elimination in every aspect of our work. We can then deploy the value created in waste elimination to drive sustainable growth.
By teaching our entire team to see and eliminate waste, we will provide a safe and reliable system for our customers at the lowest cost possible and grow our business. It may seem simple, but it's not easy. This lean way of thinking is how we will deliver world-class business results and why we can promise many years of further improvement.
The CE way really is a sustainable way of running our business where we don't make trade-off between key constituents, but rather we intend to focus on our triple bottom line: People, planet and profit, underpinned by our unwavering commitment to world-class performance. In fact, we are selected by Sustainalytics as the #1 utility in America for sustainable business practices in 2016.
Our simple but powerful business model is the manifestation of our commitment to people, planet and profit. Our system needs improvements and without the hard work that our team does to reduce absolute cost year over year over year, our investment requirements would be too expensive for our customers. We insist on both: serving our customers and doing it at the lowest cost possible.
We're not chasing profits or cost cuts at the expense of safety or reliability of our system. Rather we're delivering consistent profits and performance, because we are focused on the heart of our business, our customers.
Our 10-year capital investment plan reflects our lean thinking and our growth strategy. As a reminder, we announced in December that we've increased our 10-year capital plan to $18 billion. Our new law increased our renewable portfolio standard by 15% by 2021, and so we have added more renewable generation to our plan, in line with our clean and lean approach. We've also added an additional $500 million in our large gas system to continue to reduce costs and improve safety and deliverability over the next 10 years. The governor's infrastructure commission's report was published at the end of 2016, and he reinforced in a State of the State address that investment in infrastructure in Michigan is a top priority. The report found that our existing regulatory model works well to provide the funding and oversight needed for critical infrastructure investments in electricity and gas. Michigan's regulatory model, which was improved by the 2016 energy law is the ultimate public-private partnership in service of the people of Michigan.
This is not a blank check in our mind. We're always self-constrained by our customers' ability to pay, which is why our ongoing cost-reduction performance serves both investors and customers. As we reduce costs over time, we can grow our business, do more CapEx for areas like grid modernization, more gas infrastructure and PPA replacements in the future without unduly burdening our customers. High quality, safe and reliable service at the lowest cost possible. This is lean thinking.
One thing I have learned over the passing of time is that performance is power. When our performance is strong, when our processes are in control and our promises are kept, we can be flexible and adapt as the weather, the economy, policymakers and policies evolve. Our business model has and will continue to stand the test of time in a changing environment when it is backed by world-class performance delivered in a hometown way. That's the CE way."

As you can see here, adjusted 2016 earnings at $2.02 a share grew by $0.13 or 7%, no surprise. Our GAAP earnings at $1.98 a share were up $0.09 or 5%. This included the voluntary separation pro",1548,"Thanks, Patti, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. As you can see here, adjusted 2016 earnings at $2.02 a share grew by $0.13 or 7%, no surprise. Our GAAP earnings at $1.98 a share were up $0.09 or 5%. This included the voluntary separation program we announced last summer and tentative settlement of small gas reporting cases. All of our businesses improved year-to-year.
This is our standard look at our earnings per share outlook for 2016, throughout 2016. Early on, we offset abnormal storms and a warmer winter. Later we put to work upside from another strong year of cost performance and a warm summer. If we had not reinvested, our earnings per share could have been up 15%. Our reinvestment in O&M, however, was big. It included improvements and reliability in service. We also prefunded parent debt and made meaningful contributions to low income funds as well as our foundation. In total, our O&M cost was down 6.5% for 2016 compared with 2015 -- yup, 6.5% lower after all the ups and downs.
Our 2016 performance adds one more year on a long track record of adjusted earnings per share growth at 7%. And imagine, during the last 4 years, we reinvested $0.75 billion for our customers. Half of this was made possible by favorable weather, halved by cost reduction. Cost reduction is much better than planned. We achieved all of our financial targets for 2016. These included strong capital investment, healthy balance sheet ratios, competitive customer price improvements, robust operating cash flow growth, earnings per share growth at the top end of guidance and as announced last week, another 7% increase in our dividend. The increase keeps pace with our high-end EPS growth, which, of course, is at the high end of peers.
For 2017, we're pleased to have raised our guidance to reflect adjusted 6% to 8% growth on top of 2016 results. We're at -- which were at the top end of our guidance. So we continue to build success upon success in [indiscernible] year.
As shown here, our rate cases primarily reflect capital investment. They also permit us to flow through productivity improvements to our customers. We expect to reduce O&M costs another 2% this year and perhaps that's a little conservative based on -- after a top -- being at the top and for the decade and annual cost reductions of around 3%. This keeps our base rate increases at or below the level of inflation. On a real basis, this reduces the rate.
This level of cost reduction is not easy to do as Patti mentioned. New utilities can do it. This enables our rapidly growing customer investment. Looking ahead now, we should have an order on our electric rate case next month. We expect an ROE in the 10.1% to 10.3% range. This would mirror recent orders at DTE. We're in the middle of the process of our pending gas case. While the safe-implementation is lower-than-expected, we have no reservations about working with the commission to complete a satisfactory result.
Here is our cost-reduction track record. You know we're proud of it, but what's important is our commitment to continue for a long time. This comes from good business decisions that permit productivity gains as the workforce trends over, the shift from coal to gas generation, the introduction of smart meters and the elimination of waste. As we improve customer quality to better work processes, we'll see an overtime cost save as well as temporary workers saved by doing it right the first time. We already are seeing evidence of our Consumers Energy way process improvements. These drive up quality and they drive down cost. We work to improve customer service, and we eliminate waste.
Now for 2014, '15 and '16, we reduced our costs by more than 3% a year, and we plan conservatively to reduce cost a further 2% in each of the next 3 years. This helps fund that growing investment for customers.
For the last dozen years, our gross operating cash flow has been growing by more than $100 million a year. Since 2004, it's increased from $353 million to $2.1 billion last year. Over the next 5 years, it will grow about $800 million to $2.9 billion.
Our NOLs, bonus depreciation and AMT credits, help us provide and avoid the need for a block equity. If tax reform occurs, we expect that we'll still have a chance to use our NOLs, although at a lower rate. We also would expect to access our AMT credits early, but let's talk about that more in just a few minutes. So this is our sensitivity slide, and we give this to you each quarter to help you assess our prospect.
You can see that with reasonable planning assumptions and with robust risk mitigation, the probability of large variances from our plan are minimized. There are always ups and downs. Already this year, certain property taxes are expected to be lower, improving EPS by about $0.03. And energy efficiency incentives increased under the new energy law helping maybe by about $0.02. Now please keep in mind, if the electric rate case ROE comes in at 10.1% next month, that would hurt by about $0.03.
We may have an opportunity to invest even more with anticipated tax reform. We are all trying to shed useful light on this complicated subject. None of us really knows what tax reform will include or is it [ph] will occur. Here is one set of assumptions: corporate tax rates could drop to 15%. We could lose deductibility of interest expenses and state income taxes, and 100% asset expensing might occur.
Now we hope you'll find it helpful by seeing how this impacts each of our businesses, our utility enterprises and the parent. At the utility, we're fortunate to have substantial organic investment, not yet included in our plan, investment for gas infrastructure, PPA replacements and more renewables. Utilities in this situation will appreciate asset expensing to help fund new investment growth. At consumers, it would take only $100 million of new investment a year to backfill the 100% asset expensing. We've essentially already done that for raising our capital investment guidance from $17 billion to $18 billion last December. So happy phase for the utility.
Our nonutility business, Enterprises, will be impacted like normal nonutility. Tax reform would help, but for us, it's a small business. The profit improvement would be a little under $10 million a year. Here's the great news. Interest income may be used to offset interest expense. Our parent debt interest expense may be offset by our EnerBank interest income. And this assumes that none of the old debt is grandfathered. We still have to see how that turns out.
So again, as you can see on the right, with forecasted interest income at EnerBank at about $130 million, we can offset parent debt interest expense. Even if none of the legacy interest expense is [indiscernible] well, it's a happy phase for the parent, too. Again, none of us really know how the tax reform will end up. So on the left here, we have shown some alternatives to help you see different impacts. This shows the amount of CapEx backfill needed to offset a 100% asset expensing at various tax rates. At 15%, we'd add $100 million each year. That would rise to $300 million each year at 25%. Recall, we have investment opportunities of at least $3 billion. Our customers will enjoy rate reductions until we reach about a 25% tax rate. As we approach a 25% tax rate, with all the other assumptions being equal, we expect that our customers, investors would lose.
And, of course, minor changes in tax reform could make all of this very different. In each alternative, we still are able to use our NOLs, although remember, the benefit will be smaller. We also hope to accelerate use of our AMT credit to improve cash. We have not factored the use of the AMT credits in our planning yet, though there may be a little more upside there. Excluding tax reform -- here's our new report card for 2017 and beyond. We anticipate another great year this year. With no big bets and robust risk mitigation, our model serves us and -- [indiscernible] you and our customers well. Few companies are able to deliver top end earnings growth while improving value and service for customers year after year after year. We're pleased to have another outstanding consistent performance in 2016, and we expect to do the same in 2017.
With another consistent strong year ahead, 15 years in a row, we are able to continue to deliver robust adjusted earnings per share growth. With our capital investment already raised from $17 billion to $18 billion over the next 10 years, we expect to grow earnings 6% to 8% each year. Our approach to funding capital investment, both for customers and for investors, makes our earnings per share and cash flow growth sustainable for the decade ahead.

We still looking for the plan that's 1% next year and that's driven by industrial again. So as you look at 2017, when I say next year, this year, we expect the industrial side to be up about 5% and then we expect residential and commercial will be down and will be down around 1%, something like that. And that nets out all the energy efficiency. And so we've been having a great success from energy efficiencies. And don't forget, we're fortunate in our state to be able to earn incentives around that work and that's been about $17 million, $18 million a year, which is on top of our authorized ROE. The new law will permit us to almost double that when we get a full year effect. So we really happy with how that plays out. Now for this year, we ended up the year, the fourth quarter, with residential down a touch, commercial flat, and industrial up. And so industrial was up about 1.5%. And so we ended up the year about roughly 0.5% up.  We've seen a mixture of things going on out there this last quarter. And I will try to give you just a little bit of feel about it. In the industrial side on plastics, we saw good growth; fabricated steel, good growth, better than planned. On the auto side, the growth is continued, cautionary because we're seeing the actual sales flatten out a little bit for auto at probably record levels for many of them, but still in terms of growth, flattening out. We saw similar utilities that we serve doing really well. And then in food, that was mixed. So we saw some of our companies and customers doing really well and some backing off just a little bit. And then I chemicals, we saw things ease off. So we have quite a mix on the industrial side. Here's just what we're reading. We see apprehension, first excitement. And don't think the stock market, think about our customers and what the are growing in their businesses. We saw a lot of excitement and then the fourth quarter kind of eased off on some uncertainty. I think this first quarter is going to be an important one to watch, because we're going to see what confidence is out there on the consumer side and we are going to see what our businesses due. And I wouldn't be surprised if some of them hold back trying to get a better feel for tax reform, money they may bring in from overseas and they are going to do with their investment programs. But what I will tell you is when we go talk to our major customers face-to-face, even though there is a little trepidation, they are pretty upbeat. So I think we're in for a good year and a 1% growth is probably a very reasonable place to be."

At the end of last year, there is about $1 billion of NOLs and when you have a 35% tax yield like we do today, that's worth more than if we had, pick your number, 20% tax yield, right? So what we all have to do is take a noncash hit,whoever has NOLs and credits, right?  In year 1 of the tax reform, we would have to drive a noncash hit to reflect, whatever that is, the difference, right through the income statement. I assume everybody will adjust that out. But what's useful for us on the NOL is that we have a long enough life and we are positioned well enough and then we are not going to lose the use of them, but we still get them, but they are only worth $0.20 on the dollar instead of 35% on the dollar. And on the AMTs, presently, we plan to use those towards the end of our tax planning. But in the scenario, and again who knows what it will be, but I'm guessing in this scenario, we could lose access to those AMT credits and for us it's is roughly $300 million. Well, rather than do that, we will reconstrut how much we use of bonus depreciation this year and last year for tax reporting and we would work in the AMT credit, so we don't lose that $300 million. But we'll do it in the way so our customers and the utility are. We'll not ask them to take any penalty in that process. Now we feel pretty good about what we can do, but gosh, we got to figure out what really, really is first, before we can adjust our tax planning. So we've got 6 months, I think, of Washington, D.C. work before something settles out."

So at the you utility we are assuming backfill for whatever is opened up with the federal government. Now if we just think and the big picture as the free cash flow is we need to do it soon. We have to do it early on in the process. Now go over to a little businesslike enterprises, the non-utility business, we'll see the pickup in terms of benefit just like every non-utility, which is pretty normal, but since we already aren't in a position in paying taxes, then you are not going to see a tax cash flow change, if you're with me on that, right?  Because we're already in a position where we don't play -- pay taxes. And then on EnerBank, that will actually see a kickup, because now instead of losing the -- instead of paying taxes on a profit that we would make their inside of that business unit, we'll see that, that gets offset with the netting with parent interest. So they will get good news, but then when we consolidated up to the company, we already assume we're not paying any taxes. so I'm trying to tell you that there is not going to a much of a cash hurt or help. The big write-offs we do around the NOLs, that was asked about earlier in AMT credits, that's how that works the noncash thing, but will turn around on the AMT credits and we'll try to get advantage of those upfront and so everyone might conclude great, $300 million of better cash flow. Depends on what you compare to. This is just substituting for bonus depreciation, so these is really no change to cash flow. So not a lot of change early on is my answer and I made it complicated because it really is complicated and then you compare it to where you are today where you don't pay taxes, which  we love by the way.

Welcome to our 2016 year-end earnings call. We had another great year, and we look forward to sharing the highlights with you today.I'll review our 2016 results and 2017 focus and priorities, and Tom will cover",1411,"Thank you, Sri. Welcome, and good morning. Welcome to our 2016 year-end earnings call. We had another great year, and we look forward to sharing the highlights with you today.
I'll review our 2016 results and 2017 focus and priorities, and Tom will cover the financial results and outlook.
As you know, we released this morning that we again hit our top end of guidance at 7% year-over-year adjusted EPS growth at $2.02. That makes 14 years in a row of consistent performance at the top-end. Based on our 2016 actual performance, we're raising our 2017 full year guidance to the range of $2.14 to $2.18, or 6% to 8% adjusted EPS growth. As our earnings are growing among the best, we match that with equally strong dividend growth. Therefore, we once again increased our dividend 7% in line with our EPS growth.
As you've come to expect, our financial performance is not an accident. Our financial performance is supported by our operational strength. We are proud to share that we had our safest year on record, which is a 20% improvement over last year's previous best. We also had the best generation reliability on record. We delivered this performance while, at the same time, we retired 7 of our 12 coal field generation units. During operational success like this -- delivering operational success like this, while at the same time transitioning our fleet so significantly, requires a disciplined team focused on results. We once again delivered best-in-class cost reductions as well. In fact, O&M is down 6.5% year-over-year. This fuels our 10-year investment plan of $2.5 billion from our projection last year.
Lots of people ask so I'll definitely provide more details about how we continue to do this. We are well underway for another great year with emphasis on the new energy laws, our clean and lean capacity replacement strategy and the Consumers Energy way. 
Let's start by reviewing the energy law highlights. The Michigan legislature and governor in concert with the Michigan Agency for Energy and the MPSC have delivered solid policy for our state. At the highest level, this new law addresses the retail open access cross subsidy, enabling more competitive prices and eliminates the risk of energy shortfalls in Michigan. We're reminding everyone that Michigan is open for business. This new law creates a framework for our clean and lean generation strategy led by improved energy efficiency and demand response incentives, a 15% RPS standard and a very constructive net metering framework that removes the subsidy for the future producers of private solar.
Also, there's an integrated resource planning process that will allow for longer-term planning as well as upfront prudency review of our supply and demand strategy, which will result in a modern, reliable and affordable energy supply for Michigan.
Let me take a minute to share a bit more about what we mean when we refer to clean and lean. Our recent Palisades PPA termination application is a great example. We have long said that an inflexible, above-market PPA is not a cost-effective option for our customers and provides no long-term value for our investors. At the same time, we want to assure that we have sufficient resources to serve the load in Michigan. The traditional approach would be to replace the PPA with the megawatt for megawatt central station power plant. Instead, we believe we can use this change as an opportunity to build out a cleaner and leaner resource mix that assures reliability at the lowest cost possible that is a win for both customers and investors. By cleaner, we mean replacing Palisades with more energy efficiency, demand response, additional coal to gas switching and renewable energy as called for in our new law. By leaner, we mean when replacing Palisades, we can reduce demand on the peaks and fully utilize our existing gas assets. This saves our customers both energy and money. We're rightsizing our asset to match demand, thereby eliminating waste and still assuring reliability. We can de-risk our entire capital plan by freeing up dollars that would be traditionally captive in a big bet capital project. For many smaller options, that meet more of our customer's needs with less risk and less waste. And as we often remind you, we have plenty of that work that needs to be done. We are confident that we have a solid capacity replacement plan for Palisades that will ensure reliability and increasingly clean and affordable supply for the people of Michigan for years to come. I hope you're picking up on our continued theme of lean thinking. It's lean thinking that underpins not only our generation strategy but it is the heart of our CE way. Lean is not just low cost, it's about waste elimination that improves value for our customers at the lowest cost. Our business model is based on this lean way of thinking. We're deploying our CE way in all areas of our business. We are far from perfect and we can find areas for continuous improvement and waste elimination in every aspect of our work. We can then deploy the value created in waste elimination to drive sustainable growth.
By teaching our entire team to see and eliminate waste, we will provide a safe and reliable system for our customers at the lowest cost possible and grow our business. It may seem simple, but it's not easy. This lean way of thinking is how we will deliver world-class business results and why we can promise many years of further improvement.
The CE way really is a sustainable way of running our business where we don't make trade-off between key constituents, but rather we intend to focus on our triple bottom line: People, planet and profit, underpinned by our unwavering commitment to world-class performance. In fact, we are selected by Sustainalytics as the #1 utility in America for sustainable business practices in 2016.
Our simple but powerful business model is the manifestation of our commitment to people, planet and profit. Our system needs improvements and without the hard work that our team does to reduce absolute cost year over year over year, our investment requirements would be too expensive for our customers. We insist on both: serving our customers and doing it at the lowest cost possible.
We're not chasing profits or cost cuts at the expense of safety or reliability of our system. Rather we're delivering consistent profits and performance, because we are focused on the heart of our business, our customers.
Our 10-year capital investment plan reflects our lean thinking and our growth strategy. As a reminder, we announced in December that we've increased our 10-year capital plan to $18 billion. Our new law increased our renewable portfolio standard by 15% by 2021, and so we have added more renewable generation to our plan, in line with our clean and lean approach. We've also added an additional $500 million in our large gas system to continue to reduce costs and improve safety and deliverability over the next 10 years. The governor's infrastructure commission's report was published at the end of 2016, and he reinforced in a State of the State address that investment in infrastructure in Michigan is a top priority. The report found that our existing regulatory model works well to provide the funding and oversight needed for critical infrastructure investments in electricity and gas. Michigan's regulatory model, which was improved by the 2016 energy law is the ultimate public-private partnership in service of the people of Michigan.
This is not a blank check in our mind. We're always self-constrained by our customers' ability to pay, which is why our ongoing cost-reduction performance serves both investors and customers. As we reduce costs over time, we can grow our business, do more CapEx for areas like grid modernization, more gas infrastructure and PPA replacements in the future without unduly burdening our customers. High quality, safe and reliable service at the lowest cost possible. This is lean thinking.
One thing I have learned over the passing of time is that performance is power. When our performance is strong, when our processes are in control and our promises are kept, we can be flexible and adapt as the weather, the economy, policymakers and policies evolve. Our business model has and will continue to stand the test of time in a changing environment when it is backed by world-class performance delivered in a hometown way. That's the CE way."

As you can see here, adjusted 2016 earnings at $2.02 a share grew by $0.13 or 7%, no surprise. Our GAAP earnings at $1.98 a share were up $0.09 or 5%. This included the voluntary separation pro",1545,"Thanks, Patti, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. As you can see here, adjusted 2016 earnings at $2.02 a share grew by $0.13 or 7%, no surprise. Our GAAP earnings at $1.98 a share were up $0.09 or 5%. This included the voluntary separation program we announced last summer and tentative settlement of small gas reporting cases. All of our businesses improved year-to-year.
This is our standard look at our earnings per share outlook for 2016, throughout 2016. Early on, we offset abnormal storms and a warmer winter. Later we put to work upside from another strong year of cost performance and a warm summer. If we had not reinvested, our earnings per share could have been up 15%. Our reinvestment in O&M, however, was big. It included improvements and reliability in service. We also prefunded parent debt and made meaningful contributions to low income funds as well as our foundation. In total, our O&M cost was down 6.5% for 2016 compared with 2015 -- yup, 6.5% lower after all the ups and downs.
Our 2016 performance adds one more year on a long track record of adjusted earnings per share growth at 7%. And imagine, during the last 4 years, we reinvested $0.75 billion for our customers. Half of this was made possible by favorable weather, halved by cost reduction. Cost reduction is much better than planned. We achieved all of our financial targets for 2016. These included strong capital investment, healthy balance sheet ratios, competitive customer price improvements, robust operating cash flow growth, earnings per share growth at the top end of guidance and as announced last week, another 7% increase in our dividend. The increase keeps pace with our high-end EPS growth, which, of course, is at the high end of peers.
For 2017, we're pleased to have raised our guidance to reflect adjusted 6% to 8% growth on top of 2016 results. We're at -- which were at the top end of our guidance. So we continue to build success upon success in all recent year.
As shown here, our rate cases primarily reflect capital investment. They also permit us to flow through productivity improvements to our customers. We expect to reduce O&M costs another 2% this year and perhaps that's a little conservative based on -- after a top -- being at the top and for the decade and annual cost reductions of around 3%. This keeps our base rate increases at or below the level of inflation. On a real basis, this reduces the rate.
This level of cost reduction is not easy to do as Patti mentioned. New utilities can do it. This enables our rapidly growing customer investment. Looking ahead now, we should have an order on our electric rate case next month. We expect an ROE in the 10.1% to 10.3% range. This would mirror recent orders at DTE. We're in the middle of the process of our pending gas case. While the safe-implementation is lower-than-expected, we have no reservations about working with the commission to complete a satisfactory result.
Here is our cost-reduction track record. You know we're proud of it, but what's important is our commitment to continue for a long time. This comes from good business decisions that permit productivity gains as the workforce trends over, the shift from coal to gas generation, the introduction of smart meters and the elimination of waste. As we improve customer quality to better work processes, we'll see an overtime cost save as well as temporary workers saved by doing it right the first time. We already are seeing evidence of our Consumers Energy way process improvements. These drive up quality and they drive down cost. We work to improve customer service, and we eliminate waste.
Now for 2014, '15 and '16, we reduced our costs by more than 3% a year, and we plan conservatively to reduce cost a further 2% in each of the next 3 years. This helps fund that growing investment for customers.
For the last dozen years, our gross operating cash flow has been growing by more than $100 million a year. Since 2004, it's increased from $353 million to $2.1 billion last year. Over the next 5 years, it will grow about $800 million to $2.9 billion.
Our NOLs, bonus depreciation and AMT credits, help us provide and avoid the need for a block equity. If tax reform occurs, we expect that we'll still have a chance to use our NOLs, although at a lower rate. We also would expect to access our AMT credits early, but let's talk about that more in just a few minutes. So this is our sensitivity slide, and we give this to you each quarter to help you assess our prospect.
You can see that with reasonable planning assumptions and with robust risk mitigation, the probability of large variances from our plan are minimized. There are always ups and downs. Already this year, certain property taxes are expected to be lower, improving EPS by about $0.03. And energy efficiency incentives increased under the new energy law helping maybe by about $0.02. Now please keep in mind, if the electric rate case ROE comes in at 10.1% next month, that would hurt by about $0.03.
We may have an opportunity to invest even more with anticipated tax reform. We are all trying to shed useful light on this complicated subject. None of us really knows what tax reform will include or if it will occur. Here is one set of assumptions: corporate tax rates could drop to 15%. We could lose deductibility of interest expenses and state income taxes, and 100% asset expensing might occur.
Now we hope you'll find it helpful by seeing how this impacts each of our businesses, our utility enterprises and the parent. At the utility, we're fortunate to have substantial organic investment, not yet included in our plan, investment for gas infrastructure, PPA replacements and more renewables. Utilities in this situation will appreciate asset expensing to help fund new investment growth. At consumers, it would take only $100 million of new investment a year to backfill the 100% asset expensing. We've essentially already done that for raising our capital investment guidance from $17 billion to $18 billion last December. So happy phase for the utility.
Our nonutility business, Enterprises, will be impacted like normal nonutility. Tax reform would help, but for us, it's a small business. The profit improvement would be a little under $10 million a year. Here's the great news. Interest income may be used to offset interest expense. Our parent debt interest expense may be offset by our EnerBank interest income. And this assumes that none of the old debt is grandfathered. We still have to see how that turns out.
So again, as you can see on the right, with forecasted interest income at EnerBank at about $130 million, we can offset parent debt interest expense. Even if none of the legacy interest expenses [indiscernible] well, it's a happy phase for the parent, too. Again, none of us really know how the tax reform will end up. So on the left here, we have shown some alternatives to help you see different impacts. This shows the amount of CapEx backfill needed to offset a 100% asset expensing at various tax rates. At 15%, we'd add $100 million each year. That would rise to $300 million each year at 25%. Recall, we have investment opportunities of at least $3 billion. Our customers will enjoy rate reductions until we reach about a 25% tax rate. As we approach a 25% tax rate, with all the other assumptions being equal, we expect that our customers, investors would lose.
And, of course, minor changes in tax reform could make all of this very different. In each alternative, we still are able to use our NOLs, although remember, the benefit will be smaller. We also hope to accelerate use of our AMT credit to improve cash. We have not factored the use of the AMT credits in our planning yet, though there may be a little more upside there. Excluding tax reform -- here's our new report card for 2017 and beyond. We anticipate another great year this year. With no big bets and robust risk mitigation, our model serves us and -- serves you and our customers well. Few companies are able to deliver top end earnings growth while improving value and service for customers year after year after year. We're pleased to have another outstanding consistent performance in 2016, and we expect to do the same in 2017.
With another consistent strong year ahead, 15 years in a row, we are able to continue to deliver robust adjusted earnings per share growth. With our capital investment already raised from $17 billion to $18 billion over the next 10 years, we expect to grow earnings 6% to 8% each year. Our approach to funding capital investment, both for customers and for investors, makes our earnings per share and cash flow growth sustainable for the decade ahead. 
So thank you, again, for joining our call today. This is my 58th in a row, still humming along. Operator, we would be pleased if you open up to take questions. Thank you."

So as you look at 2017, when I say next year, this year, we expect the industrial side to be up about 5%, and then we expect that residential and commercial will be down and be down around 1%, something like that. And that nets out all the energy efficiency. So we've been having great success from energy efficiencies. And don't forget, we are fortunate in our state to be able to earn incentives around that work and that's been about $17 million, $18 million a year, which is on top of our authorized ROE. The new law will permit us to almost double that when we get a full year effect. So we're really happy with what -- how that plays out. Now for this year, we ended up the year, the fourth quarter, with residential down a touch, commercial flat and industrial up. And so industrial was up about 1.5%. And so we ended up the year about roughly 0.5% up. We've seen a mixture of things going on out there in this last quarter. And I'll try to give you just a little bit of a feel about it. In the industrial side, on plastics, we saw good growth; fabricated steel, good growth, better than planned. On the auto side, that growth has continued, cautionary tale, though, because we're seeing the actual sales flatten out a little bit for auto at probably record levels for many of them, but still, in terms of growth, flattening out. We saw similar utilities that we serve doing really well. And then in food, that was mixed. So we saw some of our companies and customers doing really well and some backing off just a little bit. And then on chemicals, we saw things ease off. So we have quite a mix on the industrial side. Here's what we are reading. We see apprehension, first excitement. If you -- don't think the stock market, think about our customers and what they're doing in their businesses. We saw a lot of excitement and then the fourth quarter kind of eased off on some uncertainty. I think this first quarter is going to be an important one to watch, because we're going to see what confidence is out there on the consumer side, and we're going to see what our businesses do. And I wouldn't be surprised if some of them hold back a little bit trying to get a better feel for tax reform, money they may bring in from overseas and what they're going to do with their investment programs. But what I will tell you when we go talk to our major customers face-to-face, even though there's a little trepidation, they're pretty upbeat. So I think we're in for a good year and a 1% growth is probably a very reasonable place to be."

And what's near and dear to us, as it is to our commission, is getting the capacity side right. So there is no mistake and then flowing through all these wonderful rate reductions. I mean, it's hard to get rate reductions at this magnitude. So we are just tickled about all of that. So when you look at DIG, we are still in the thinking stage. Is it better if we put DIG in the utility, both for accretion and for certainty on capacity? Or is it better that we keep it outside, providing that sort of emergency backup, if it was needed in a fashion as well as the business that we know? There is good interest. The upsides at DIG still look attractive. People are still interested in doing more capacity contracts with us, but we're not doing those right now because we're making sure that, that backup plan is available to us. Certainty of delivering power is critical to us and then right behind, that's the big customer savings that we get. So I'm giving you an awfully mushy answer. I normally don't do that, because we haven't made the decision. But I would tell you either inside of the utility or outside of the utility, there is some upside available from DIG."

And so we're going to be working together over the next several months to agree upon that backfill plan, and we'll be doing tests on a variety of options that we're recommending with more demand response, more energy efficiency, some -- potentially some additional coal to gas switching, but also then looking at DIG as a major part of our backfill plan for Palisades.

The one other thing that I wanted to ask, because you mentioned it and you're the only utility so for to mention it. It's another nuance of the tax question. Is the cash flow issue with the NOLs? So if your federal income tax collections go down at the utility level, that's obviously incredibly constructive for customers. It creates more than ample headroom for you to increase your capital expenditures to offset the impact of bonus depreciation should that also occur. But you rightly pointed out it would also reduce your parent cash flows, right? So you mentioned that you might be able to accelerate AMT credits to offset that. But if you can't offset it, doesn't that mean you have to go to the next highest sort of next lowest cost of capital option on the balance sheet, which would mean issuing more debt or some equity to fill the hole?"

So what we",308,"Well, then let's just elaborate so that we are all clear. At the end of last year, there is about $1 billion of NOLs. And when you have a 35% tax yield like we do today, that's worth more than if we had, pick your number, 20% tax yield, right? So what we all have to do is take noncash hit, whoever has NOLs and credits, right? In year 1 of the tax reform, we'll have to drive a noncash hit to reflect whatever that is, that difference, right through the income statement. I assume everybody will want to adjust that out. But what's useful for us on the NOLs is that we have a long enough life, and we're positioned well enough that we're not going to lose the use of them. So we'll still get them, but they're only worth $0.20 on the dollar instead of 35% on the dollar. And on the AMTs, presently, we plan to use those towards the end of our tax planning. But in this scenario -- and again, who knows what it'll be, but I'm guessing in this scenario, we could lose access to those AMT credits. And for us, there's roughly $300 million. Well, rather than do that, we'll reconstruct how much we use bonus depreciation this year and last year for tax reporting. And we'll work in the AMT credit so we don't lose that $300 million, but we'll do it in a way so our customers at the utility are [indiscernible]. We wouldn't ask them to take any penalty in this process. So we feel pretty good about what we can do, but gosh, we got to figure out what it really, really is first before we can adjust our tax planning. So we've got 6 months, I think, of Washington, D.C. work before something settles out."

So at the utility, we are assuming backfill for whatever is opened up with the federal government. So if you just think of that and a big picture as neutral free cash flow is we'll need to do it soon. We have to do it early on in the process. Now go over to a little businesslike enterprises, the nonutility business, we'll see the pickup in terms of benefit just like every nonutility, which would be pretty normal. But since we already aren't in a position on paying taxes, then you're not going to see a tax cash flow change, if you're with me on that, right? Because we're already in a position where we don't play -- pay taxes. And then on EnerBank, that will actually see a kickup, because now instead of losing the -- instead of paying taxes on the profit that we would make there inside of that business unit, we'll see that, that gets offset with the netting with parent interest. So they'll get good news. But then when we consolidate it up through the company, we already assume we're not paying any taxes. So I'm trying to tell you that there's not going to be much of a cash hurt or help. The big write-offs we do around the NOLs, that was asked about earlier in AMT credits, they mean that's how that works, the noncash thing, but will turn around on the AMT credits, and we will try to get advantage of those upfront. And so everyone might conclude, great, $300 million of better cash flow, depends on what you compare to. This is just substituting for bonus depreciation. So there's really no change to cash flow. So not a lot of change early on is my answer, and I made it complicated because it really is complicated and then you compare it to where you are today where you don't pay taxes, which we love, by the way. I think this is a great country. Any other questions?"

Welcome to our 2016 year-end earnings call. We had another great year, and we look forward to sharing the highlights with you today.I'll review our 2016 results and 2017 focus and priorities, and Tom will cover",1411,"Thank you, Sri. Welcome, and good morning. Welcome to our 2016 year-end earnings call. We had another great year, and we look forward to sharing the highlights with you today.
I'll review our 2016 results and 2017 focus and priorities, and Tom will cover the financial results and outlook.
As you know, we released this morning that we again hit our top end of guidance at 7% year-over-year adjusted EPS growth at $2.02. That makes 14 years in a row of consistent performance at the top-end. Based on our 2016 actual performance, we're raising our 2017 full year guidance to the range of $2.14 to $2.18, or 6% to 8% adjusted EPS growth. As our earnings are growing among the best, we match that with equally strong dividend growth. Therefore, we once again increased our dividend 7% in line with our EPS growth.
As you've come to expect, our financial performance is not an accident. Our financial performance is supported by our operational strength. We are proud to share that we had our safest year on record, which is a 20% improvement over last year's previous best. We also had the best generation reliability on record. We delivered this performance while, at the same time, we retired 7 of our 12 coal field generation units. During operational success like this -- delivering operational success like this, while at the same time transitioning our fleet so significantly, requires a disciplined team focused on results. We once again delivered best-in-class cost reductions as well. In fact, O&M is down 6.5% year-over-year. This fuels our 10-year investment plan of $2.5 billion from our projection last year.
Lots of people ask so I'll definitely provide more details about how we continue to do this. We are well underway for another great year with emphasis on the new energy laws, our clean and lean capacity replacement strategy and the Consumers Energy way. 
Let's start by reviewing the energy law highlights. The Michigan legislature and governor in concert with the Michigan Agency for Energy and the MPSC have delivered solid policy for our state. At the highest level, this new law addresses the retail open access cross subsidy, enabling more competitive prices and eliminates the risk of energy shortfalls in Michigan. We're reminding everyone that Michigan is open for business. This new law creates a framework for our clean and lean generation strategy led by improved energy efficiency and demand response incentives, a 15% RPS standard and a very constructive net metering framework that removes the subsidy for the future producers of private solar.
Also, there's an integrated resource planning process that will allow for longer-term planning as well as upfront prudency review of our supply and demand strategy, which will result in a modern, reliable and affordable energy supply for Michigan.
Let me take a minute to share a bit more about what we mean when we refer to clean and lean. Our recent Palisades PPA termination application is a great example. We have long said that an inflexible, above-market PPA is not a cost-effective option for our customers and provides no long-term value for our investors. At the same time, we want to assure that we have sufficient resources to serve the load in Michigan. The traditional approach would be to replace the PPA with the megawatt for megawatt central station power plant. Instead, we believe we can use this change as an opportunity to build out a cleaner and leaner resource mix that assures reliability at the lowest cost possible that is a win for both customers and investors. By cleaner, we mean replacing Palisades with more energy efficiency, demand response, additional coal to gas switching and renewable energy as called for in our new law. By leaner, we mean when replacing Palisades, we can reduce demand on the peaks and fully utilize our existing gas assets. This saves our customers both energy and money. We're rightsizing our asset to match demand, thereby eliminating waste and still assuring reliability. We can de-risk our entire capital plan by freeing up dollars that would be traditionally captive in a big bet capital project for many smaller options, that meet more of our customer's needs with less risk and less waste. And as we often remind you, we have plenty of that work that needs to be done. We are confident that we have a solid capacity replacement plan for Palisades that will ensure reliability and increasingly clean and affordable supply for the people of Michigan for years to come. I hope you're picking up on our continued theme of lean thinking. It's lean thinking that underpins not only our generation strategy but it is the heart of our CE way. Lean is not just low cost, it's about waste elimination that improves value for our customers at the lowest cost. Our business model is based on this lean way of thinking. We're deploying our CE way in all areas of our business. We are far from perfect and we can find areas for continuous improvement and waste elimination in every aspect of our work. We can then deploy the value created in waste elimination to drive sustainable growth.
By teaching our entire team to see and eliminate waste, we will provide a safe and reliable system for our customers at the lowest cost possible and grow our business. It may seem simple, but it's not easy. This lean way of thinking is how we will deliver world-class business results and why we can promise many years of further improvement.
The CE way really is a sustainable way of running our business where we don't make trade-offs between key constituents, but rather we intend to focus on our triple bottom line: People, planet and profit, underpinned by our unwavering commitment to world-class performance. In fact, we were selected by Sustainalytics as the #1 utility in America for sustainable business practices in 2016.
Our simple but powerful business model is the manifestation of our commitment to people, planet and profit. Our system needs improvements and without the hard work that our team does to reduce absolute cost year over year over year, our investment requirements would be too expensive for our customers. We insist on both: serving our customers and doing it at the lowest cost possible.
We're not chasing profits or cost cuts at the expense of safety or reliability of our system. Rather we're delivering consistent profits and performance, because we are focused on the heart of our business, our customers.
Our 10-year capital investment plan reflects our lean thinking and our growth strategy. As a reminder, we announced in December that we've increased our 10-year capital plan to $18 billion. Our new law increased our renewable portfolio standard by 15% by 2021, and so we have added more renewable generation to our plan, in line with our clean and lean approach. We've also added an additional $500 million in our large gas system to continue to reduce costs and improve safety and deliverability over the next 10 years. The governor's infrastructure commission's report was published at the end of 2016, and he reinforced in a State of the State address that investment in infrastructure in Michigan is a top priority. The report found that our existing regulatory model works well to provide the funding and oversight needed for critical infrastructure investments in electricity and gas. Michigan's regulatory model, which was improved by the 2016 energy law is the ultimate public-private partnership in service of the people of Michigan.
This is not a blank check in our mind. We're always self-constrained by our customers' ability to pay, which is why our ongoing cost-reduction performance serves both investors and customers. As we reduce costs over time, we can grow our business, do more CapEx for areas like grid modernization, more gas infrastructure and PPA replacements in the future without unduly burdening our customers. High quality, safe and reliable service at the lowest cost possible. This is lean thinking.
One thing I have learned over the passing of time is that performance is power. When our performance is strong, when our processes are in control and our promises are kept, we can be flexible and adapt as the weather, the economy, policymakers and policies evolve. Our business model has and will continue to stand the test of time in a changing environment when it is backed by world-class performance delivered in a hometown way. That's the CE way."

As you can see here, adjusted 2016 earnings at $2.02 a share grew by $0.13 or 7%, no surprise. Our GAAP earnings at $1.98 a share were up $0.09 or 5%.

As you can see here, adjusted 2016 earnings at $2.02 a share grew by $0.13 or 7%, no surprise. Our GAAP earnings at $1.98 a share were up $0.09 or 5%. This included the voluntary separation program we announced last summer and tentative settlement of small gas reporting cases. All of our businesses improved year-to-year.
This is our standard look at our earnings per share outlook for 2016, throughout 2016. Early on, we offset abnormal storms and a warmer winter. Later we put to work upside from another strong year of cost performance and a warm summer. If we had not reinvested, our earnings per share could have been up 15%. Our reinvestment in O&M, however, was big. It included improvements in reliability in service. We also prefunded parent debt and made meaningful contributions to low income funds as well as our foundation. In total, our O&M cost was down 6.5% for 2016 compared with 2015 -- yup, 6.5% lower after all the ups and downs.
Our 2016 performance adds one more year on a long track record of adjusted earnings per share growth at 7%. And imagine, during the last 4 years, we reinvested $.333 billion for our customers. Half of this was made possible by favorable weather, half by cost reduction. Cost reduction is much better than planned. We achieved all of our financial targets for 2016. These included strong capital investment, healthy balance sheet ratios, competitive customer price improvements, robust operating cash flow growth, earnings per share growth at the top end of guidance and as announced last week, another 7% increase in our dividend. The increase keeps pace with our high-end EPS growth, which, of course, is at the high end of peers.
For 2017, we're pleased to have raised our guidance to reflect adjusted 6% to 8% growth on top of 2016 results. We're at -- which were at the top end of our guidance. So we continue to build success upon success, no recess year.
As shown here, our rate cases primarily reflect capital investment. They also permit us to flow through productivity improvements to our customers. We expect to reduce O&M costs another 2% this year and perhaps that's a little conservative based on -- after a top -- being at the top end for the decade in annual cost reductions of around 3%. This keeps our base rate increases at or below the level of inflation. On a real basis, this reduces the rate.
This level of cost reduction is not easy to do as Patti mentioned. New utilities can do it. This enables our rapidly growing customer investment. Looking ahead now, we should have an order on our electric rate case next month. We expect an ROE in the 10.1% to 10.3% range. This would mirror recent orders at DTE. We're in the middle of the process of our pending gas case. While the safe-implementation is lower-than-expected, we have no reservations about working with the commission to complete a satisfactory result.
Here is our cost-reduction track record. You know we're proud of it, but what's important is our commitment to continue for a long time. This comes from good business decisions that permit productivity gains as the workforce turns over, the shift from coal to gas generation, the introduction of smart meters and the elimination of waste. As we improve customer quality through better work processes, we'll see an overtime cost save as well as temporary workers save by doing it right the first time. We already are seeing evidence of our Consumers Energy way process improvements. These drive up quality and they drive down cost. We work to improve customer service, and we eliminate waste.
Now for 2014, '15 and '16, we reduced our costs by more than 3% a year, and we plan conservatively to reduce cost a further 2% in each of the next 3 years. This helps fund that growing investment for customers.
For the last dozen years, our gross operating cash flow has been growing by more than $100 million a year. Since 2004, it's increased from $353 million to $2.1 billion last year. Over the next 5 years, it will grow about $800 million to $2.9 billion.
Our NOLs, bonus depreciation and AMT credits, help us provide and avoid the need for a block equity. If tax reform occurs, we expect that we'll still have a chance to use our NOLs, although at a lower rate. We also would expect to access our AMT credits early, but let's talk about that more in just a few minutes. So this is our sensitivity slide, and we give this to you each quarter to help you assess our prospect.
You can see that with reasonable planning assumptions and with robust risk mitigation, the probability of large variances from our plan are minimized. There are always ups and downs. Already this year, certain property taxes are expected to be lower, improving EPS by about $0.03. And energy efficiency incentives increased under the new energy law helping maybe by about $0.02. Now please keep in mind, if the electric rate case ROE comes in at 10.1% next month, that would hurt by about $0.03.
We may have an opportunity to invest even more with anticipated tax reform. We are all trying to shed useful light on this complicated subject. None of us really knows what tax reform will include or if it will occur. Here is one set of assumptions: corporate tax rates could drop to 15%. We could lose deductibility of interest expenses and state income taxes, and 100% asset expensing might occur.
Now we hope you'll find it helpful by seeing how this impacts each of our businesses, our utility enterprises and the parent. At the utility, we're fortunate to have substantial organic investment, not yet included in our plan, investment for gas infrastructure, PPA replacements and more renewables. Utilities in this situation will appreciate asset expensing to help fund new investment growth. At consumers, it would take only $100 million of new investment a year to backfill the 100% asset expensing. We've essentially already done that by raising our capital investment guidance from $17 billion to $18 billion last December. So happy face for the utility.
Our nonutility business, Enterprises, will be impacted like normal nonutility. Tax reform would help, but for us, it's a small business. The profit improvement would be a little under $10 million a year. Here's the great news. Interest income may be used to offset interest expense. Our parent debt interest expense may be offset by our EnerBank interest income. And this assumes that none of the old debt is grandfathered. We still have to see how that turns out.
So again, as you can see on the right, with forecasted interest income at EnerBank at about $130 million, we can offset parent debt interest expense. Even if none of the legacy interest expenses went well, it's a happy face for the parent, too. Again, none of us really know how the tax reform will end up. So on the left here, we have shown some alternatives to help you see different impacts. This shows the amount of CapEx backfill needed to offset a 100% asset expensing at various tax rates. At 15%, we'd add $100 million each year. That would rise to $300 million each year at 25%. Recall, we have investment opportunities of at least $3 billion. Our customers will enjoy rate reductions until we reach about a 25% tax rate. As we approach a 25% tax rate, with all the other assumptions being equal, we expect that our customers' investors would lose.
And, of course, minor changes in tax reform could make all of this very different. In each alternative, we still are able to use our NOLs, although remember, the benefit will be smaller. We also hope to accelerate use of our AMT credit to improve cash. We have not factored the use of the AMT credits in our planning yet, though there may be a little more upside there. Excluding tax reform -- here's our new report card for 2017 and beyond. We anticipate another great year this year. With no big bets and robust risk mitigation, our model serves us and -- serves you and our customers well. Few companies are able to deliver top end earnings growth while improving value and service for customers year after year after year. We're pleased to have another outstanding consistent performance in 2016, and we expect to do the same in 2017.
With another consistent strong year ahead, 15 years in a row, we are able to continue to deliver robust adjusted earnings per share growth. With our capital investment already raised from $17 billion to $18 billion over the next 10 years, we expect to grow earnings 6% to 8% each year. Our approach to funding capital investment, both for customers and for investors, makes our earnings per share and cash flow growth sustainable for the decade ahead.

So improving the quality of our work and at the same time reducing the cost of overtime, reducing the cost of repeat visits on homes that we couldn't get in, improving our route optimization. So we deploy these lean process improvements, root cause analysis, visual management and optimization exercises to fundamentally reduce the cost to deliver a higher value outcome for customers. And so that sort of work, we are just getting started across all of our operations and implementing those kinds of skills in our leadership team as well as our frontline employees. As I travel to stay and work with our crews and see the work that we're doing around all for customers, it's just incredible to me the potential that exists in getting our work done right the first time and doing it at the lowest cost possible. Lots of O&M wrapped up in that. So you can figure that to be -- that's what we'll deliver, are consistent 2% to 3% operating expense reductions.

We're still looking at a plan that's about 1% next year, and that's driven by industrial, again. So as you look at 2017, when I say next year, this year, we expect the industrial side to be up about 5%, and then we expect our residential and commercial will be down and be down around 1%, something like that. And that nets out all the energy efficiency. So we've been having great success from energy efficiencies. And don't forget, we are fortunate in our state to be able to earn incentives around that work and that's been about $17 million, $18 million a year, which is on top of our authorized ROE. The new law will permit us to almost double that when we get a full year effect. So we're really happy with what -- how that plays out. Now for this year, we ended up the year, the fourth quarter, with residential down a touch, commercial flat and industrial up. And so industrial was up about 1.5%. And so we ended up the year about roughly 0.5% up. We've seen a mixture of things going on out there in this last quarter. And I'll try to give you just a little bit of a feel about it. In the industrial side, on plastics, we saw good growth; fabricated steel, good growth, better than planned. On the auto side, that growth has continued, cautionary tale, though, because we're seeing the actual sales flatten out a little bit for auto at probably record levels for many of them, but still, in terms of growth, flattening out. We saw similar utilities that we serve doing really well. And then in food, that was mixed. So we saw some of our companies and customers doing really well and some backing off just a little bit. And then on chemicals, we saw things ease off. So we have quite a mix on the industrial side. Here's what we are reading. We see apprehension, first excitement. If you -- don't think the stock market, think about our customers and what they're doing in their businesses. We saw a lot of excitement and then the fourth quarter kind of eased off on some uncertainty. I think this first quarter is going to be an important one to watch, because we're going to see what confidence is out there on the consumer side, and we're going to see what our businesses do. And I wouldn't be surprised if some of them hold back a little bit trying to get a better feel for tax reform, money they may bring in from overseas and what they're going to do with their investment programs. But what I will tell you when we go talk to our major customers face-to-face, even though there's a little trepidation, they're pretty upbeat. So I think we're in for a good year and a 1% growth is probably a very reasonable place to be."

Or is it better that we keep it outside, providing that sort of emergency backup as it was needed in a fashion as well as the business that we know? There is good interest. The upsides at DIG still look attractive. People are still interested in doing more capacity contracts with us, but we're not doing those right now because we're making sure that, that backup plan is available to us.

And I already realize I probably might have overstated the impact on CMS, but it's -- like you said, it's extremely complex. The one other thing that I wanted to ask, because you mentioned it and you're the only utility so for to mention it. It's another nuance of the tax question. Is the cash flow issue with the NOLs? So if your federal income tax collections go down at the utility level, that's obviously incredibly constructive for customers. It creates more than ample headroom for you to increase your capital expenditures to offset the impact of bonus depreciation should that also occur. But you rightly pointed out it would also reduce your parent cash flows, right? So you mentioned that you might be able to accelerate AMT credits to offset that. But if you can't offset it, doesn't that mean you have to go to the next highest sort of next lowest cost of capital option on the balance sheet, which would mean issuing more debt or some equity to fill the hole?"

And when you have a 35% tax yield like we do today, that's worth more than if we had, pick your number, 20% tax yield, right? So what we all have to do is take noncash hit, whoever has NOLs and credits, right? In year 1 of the tax reform, we'll have to drive a noncash hit to reflect whatever that is, that difference, right through the income statement. I assume everybody will want to adjust that out. But what's useful for us on the NOLs is that we have a long enough life, and we're positioned well enough that we're not going to lose the use of them. So we'll still get them, but they're only worth $0.20 on the dollar instead of 35% on the dollar. And on the AMTs, presently, we plan to use those towards the end of our tax planning. But in this scenario -- and again, who knows what it'll be, but I'm guessing in this scenario, we could lose access to those AMT credits. And for us, there's roughly $300 million. Well, rather than do that, we'll reconstruct how much we use bonus depreciation this year and last year for tax reporting. And we'll work in the AMT credit so we don't lose that $300 million, but we'll do it in a way so our customers at the utility are whole. We wouldn't ask them to take any penalty in this process. So we feel pretty good about what we can do, but gosh, we got to figure out what it really, really is first before we can adjust our tax planning. So we've got 6 months, I think, of Washington, D.C. work before something settles out."

So at the utility, we are assuming backfill or whatever is opened up with the federal government. So if you just think of that and a big picture as neutral free cash flow as we'll need to do it soon. We have to do it early on in the process. Now go over to a little businesslike Enterprises, the nonutility business, we'll see the pickup in terms of benefit just like every nonutility, which would be pretty normal. But since we already aren't in a position on paying taxes, then you're not going to see a tax cash flow change, if you're with me on that, right? Because we're already in a position where we don't play -- pay taxes. And then on EnerBank, that will actually see a kickup, because now instead of losing the -- instead of paying taxes on the profit that we would make there inside of that business unit, we'll see that, that gets offset with the netting with parent interest. So they'll get good news. But then when we consolidate it up through the company, we already assume we're not paying any taxes. So I'm trying to tell you that there's not going to be much of a cash hurt or help. The big write-offs we do around the NOLs, that was asked about earlier and AMT credits, they mean that's how that works, the noncash thing, but will turn around on the AMT credits, and we will try to get advantage of those upfront. And so everyone might conclude, great, $300 million of better cash flow, depends on what you compare to. This is just substituting for bonus depreciation. So there's really no change to cash flow. So not a lot of change early on is my answer, and I made it complicated because it really is complicated and then you compare it to where you are today where you don't pay taxes, which we love, by the way. I think this is a great country. Any other questions?"

Welcome to our 2016 year-end earnings call. We had another great year, and we look forward to sharing the highlights with you today. I'll review our 2016 results and 2017 focus and priorities, and Tom will cover",1411,"Thank you, Sri. Welcome, and good morning. Welcome to our 2016 year-end earnings call. We had another great year, and we look forward to sharing the highlights with you today. I'll review our 2016 results and 2017 focus and priorities, and Tom will cover the financial results and outlook.
As you know, we released this morning that we again hit our top end of guidance at 7% year-over-year adjusted EPS growth at $2.02. That makes 14 years in a row of consistent performance at the top-end. Based on our 2016 actual performance, we're raising our 2017 full year guidance to the range of $2.14 to $2.18, or 6% to 8% adjusted EPS growth. As our earnings are growing among the best, we match that with equally strong dividend growth. Therefore, we once again increased our dividend 7% in line with our EPS growth.
As you've come to expect, our financial performance is not an accident. Our financial performance is supported by our operational strength. We are proud to share that we had our safest year on record, which is a 20% improvement over last year's previous best. We also had the best generation reliability on record. We delivered this performance while, at the same time, we retired 7 of our 12 coal field generation units. During operational success like this -- delivering operational success like this, while at the same time transitioning our fleet so significantly, requires a disciplined team focused on results. We once again delivered best-in-class cost reductions as well. In fact, O&M is down 6.5% year-over-year. This fuels our 10-year investment plan of $2.5 billion from our projection last year.
Lots of people ask so I'll definitely provide more details about how we continue to do this. We are well underway for another great year with emphasis on the new energy laws, our clean and lean capacity replacement strategy and the Consumers Energy way. 
Let's start by reviewing the energy law highlights. The Michigan legislature and governor in concert with the Michigan Agency for Energy and the MPSC have delivered solid policy for our state. At the highest level, this new law addresses the retail open access cross subsidy, enabling more competitive prices and eliminates the risk of energy shortfalls in Michigan. We're reminding everyone that Michigan is open for business. This new law creates a framework for our clean and lean generation strategy led by improved energy efficiency and demand response incentives, a 15% RPS standard and a very constructive net metering framework that removes the subsidy for the future producers of private solar.
Also, there's an integrated resource planning process that will allow for longer-term planning as well as upfront prudency review of our supply and demand strategy, which will result in a modern, reliable and affordable energy supply for Michigan.
Let me take a minute to share a bit more about what we mean when we refer to clean and lean. Our recent Palisades PPA termination application is a great example. We have long said that an inflexible, above-market PPA is not a cost-effective option for our customers and provides no long-term value for our investors. At the same time, we want to assure that we have sufficient resources to serve the load in Michigan. The traditional approach would be to replace the PPA with the megawatt for megawatt central station power plant. Instead, we believe we can use this change as an opportunity to build out a cleaner and leaner resource mix that assures reliability at the lowest cost possible that is a win for both customers and investors. By cleaner, we mean replacing Palisades with more energy efficiency, demand response, additional coal to gas switching and renewable energy as called for in our new law. By leaner, we mean when replacing Palisades, we can reduce demand on the peaks and fully utilize our existing gas assets. This saves our customers both energy and money. We're rightsizing our asset to match demand, thereby eliminating waste and still assuring reliability. We can de-risk our entire capital plan by freeing up dollars that would be traditionally captive in a big bet capital project for many smaller options, that meet more of our customer's needs with less risk and less waste. And as we often remind you, we have plenty of that work that needs to be done. We are confident that we have a solid capacity replacement plan for Palisades that will ensure reliability and increasingly clean and affordable supply for the people of Michigan for years to come. I hope you're picking up on our continued theme of lean thinking. It's lean thinking that underpins not only our generation strategy but it is the heart of our CE way. Lean is not just low cost, it's about waste elimination that improves value for our customers at the lowest cost. Our business model is based on this lean way of thinking. We're deploying our CE way in all areas of our business. We are far from perfect and we can find areas for continuous improvement and waste elimination in every aspect of our work. We can then deploy the value created in waste elimination to drive sustainable growth.
By teaching our entire team to see and eliminate waste, we will provide a safe and reliable system for our customers at the lowest cost possible and grow our business. It may seem simple, but it's not easy. This lean way of thinking is how we will deliver world-class business results and why we can promise many years of further improvement.
The CE way really is a sustainable way of running our business where we don't make trade-offs between key constituents, but rather we intend to focus on our triple bottom line: People, planet and profit, underpinned by our unwavering commitment to world-class performance. In fact, we were selected by Sustainalytics as the #1 utility in America for sustainable business practices in 2016.
Our simple but powerful business model is the manifestation of our commitment to people, planet and profit. Our system needs improvements and without the hard work that our team does to reduce absolute cost year over year over year, our investment requirements would be too expensive for our customers. We insist on both: serving our customers and doing it at the lowest cost possible.
We're not chasing profits or cost cuts at the expense of safety or reliability of our system. Rather we're delivering consistent profits and performance, because we are focused on the heart of our business, our customers.
Our 10-year capital investment plan reflects our lean thinking and our growth strategy. As a reminder, we announced in December that we've increased our 10-year capital plan to $18 billion. Our new law increased our renewable portfolio standard by 15% by 2021, and so we have added more renewable generation to our plan, in line with our clean and lean approach. We've also added an additional $500 million in our large gas system to continue to reduce costs and improve safety and deliverability over the next 10 years. The governor's infrastructure commission's report was published at the end of 2016, and he reinforced in a State of the State address that investment in infrastructure in Michigan is a top priority. The report found that our existing regulatory model works well to provide the funding and oversight needed for critical infrastructure investments in electricity and gas. Michigan's regulatory model, which was improved by the 2016 energy law is the ultimate public-private partnership in service of the people of Michigan.
This is not a blank check in our mind. We're always self-constrained by our customers' ability to pay, which is why our ongoing cost-reduction performance serves both investors and customers. As we reduce costs over time, we can grow our business, do more CapEx for areas like grid modernization, more gas infrastructure and PPA replacements in the future without unduly burdening our customers. High quality, safe and reliable service at the lowest cost possible. This is lean thinking.
One thing I have learned over the passing of time is that performance is power. When our performance is strong, when our processes are in control and our promises are kept, we can be flexible and adapt as the weather, the economy, policymakers and policies evolve. Our business model has and will continue to stand the test of time in a changing environment when it is backed by world-class performance delivered in a hometown way. That's the CE way."

As you can see here, adjusted 2016 earnings at $2.02 a share grew by $0.13 or 7%, no surprise. Our GAAP earnings at $1.98 a share were up $0.09 or 5%. This included the voluntary separation pro",1544,"Thanks, Patti, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. As you can see here, adjusted 2016 earnings at $2.02 a share grew by $0.13 or 7%, no surprise. Our GAAP earnings at $1.98 a share were up $0.09 or 5%. This included the voluntary separation program we announced last summer and tentative settlement of small gas reporting cases. All of our businesses improved year-to-year.
This is our standard look at our earnings per share outlook for 2016, throughout 2016. Early on, we offset abnormal storms and a warmer winter. Later we put to work upside from another strong year of cost performance and a warm summer. If we had not reinvested, our earnings per share could have been up 15%. Our reinvestment in O&M, however, was big. It included improvements in reliability in service. We also prefunded parent debt and made meaningful contributions to low income funds as well as our foundation. In total, our O&M cost was down 6.5% for 2016 compared with 2015 -- yup, 6.5% lower after all the ups and downs.
Our 2016 performance adds one more year on a long track record of adjusted earnings per share growth at 7%. And imagine, during the last 4 years, we reinvested $0.333 billion for our customers. Half of this was made possible by favorable weather, half by cost reduction. Cost reduction is much better than planned. We achieved all of our financial targets for 2016. These included strong capital investment, healthy balance sheet ratios, competitive customer price improvements, robust operating cash flow growth, earnings per share growth at the top end of guidance and as announced last week, another 7% increase in our dividend. The increase keeps pace with our high-end EPS growth, which, of course, is at the high end of peers.
For 2017, we're pleased to have raised our guidance to reflect adjusted 6% to 8% growth on top of 2016 results. We're at -- which were at the top end of our guidance. So we continue to build success upon success, no recess year.
As shown here, our rate cases primarily reflect capital investment. They also permit us to flow through productivity improvements to our customers. We expect to reduce O&M costs another 2% this year and perhaps that's a little conservative based on -- after a top -- being at the top end for the decade in annual cost reductions of around 3%. This keeps our base rate increases at or below the level of inflation. On a real basis, this reduces the rate.
This level of cost reduction is not easy to do as Patti mentioned. New utilities can do it. This enables our rapidly growing customer investment. Looking ahead now, we should have an order on our electric rate case next month. We expect an ROE in the 10.1% to 10.3% range. This would mirror recent orders at DTE. We're in the middle of the process of our pending gas case. While the safe-implementation is lower-than-expected, we have no reservations about working with the commission to complete a satisfactory result.
Here is our cost-reduction track record. You know we're proud of it, but what's important is our commitment to continue for a long time. This comes from good business decisions that permit productivity gains as the workforce turns over, the shift from coal to gas generation, the introduction of smart meters and the elimination of waste. As we improve customer quality through better work processes, we'll see an overtime cost save as well as temporary workers save by doing it right the first time. We already are seeing evidence of our Consumers Energy way process improvements. These drive up quality and they drive down cost. We work to improve customer service, and we eliminate waste.
Now for 2014, '15 and '16, we reduced our costs by more than 3% a year, and we plan conservatively to reduce cost a further 2% in each of the next 3 years. This helps fund that growing investment for customers.
For the last dozen years, our gross operating cash flow has been growing by more than $100 million a year. Since 2004, it's increased from $353 million to $2.1 billion last year. Over the next 5 years, it will grow about $800 million to $2.9 billion.
Our NOLs, bonus depreciation and AMT credits, help us provide and avoid the need for a block equity. If tax reform occurs, we expect that we'll still have a chance to use our NOLs, although at a lower rate. We also would expect to access our AMT credits early, but let's talk about that more in just a few minutes. So this is our sensitivity slide, and we give this to you each quarter to help you assess our prospect.
You can see that with reasonable planning assumptions and with robust risk mitigation, the probability of large variances from our plan are minimized. There are always ups and downs. Already this year, certain property taxes are expected to be lower, improving EPS by about $0.03. And energy efficiency incentives increased under the new energy law helping maybe by about $0.02. Now please keep in mind, if the electric rate case ROE comes in at 10.1% next month, that would hurt by about $0.03.
We may have an opportunity to invest even more with anticipated tax reform. We are all trying to shed useful light on this complicated subject. None of us really knows what tax reform will include or if it will occur. Here is one set of assumptions: corporate tax rates could drop to 15%. We could lose deductibility of interest expenses and state income taxes, and 100% asset expensing might occur.
Now we hope you'll find it helpful by seeing how this impacts each of our businesses, our utility enterprises and the parent. At the utility, we're fortunate to have substantial organic investment, not yet included in our plan, investment for gas infrastructure, PPA replacements and more renewables. Utilities in this situation will appreciate asset expensing to help fund new investment growth. At consumers, it would take only $100 million of new investment a year to backfill the 100% asset expensing. We've essentially already done that by raising our capital investment guidance from $17 billion to $18 billion last December. So happy face for the utility.
Our nonutility business, Enterprises, will be impacted like normal nonutility. Tax reform would help, but for us, it's a small business. The profit improvement would be a little under $10 million a year. Here's the great news. Interest income may be used to offset interest expense. Our parent debt interest expense may be offset by our EnerBank interest income. And this assumes that none of the old debt is grandfathered. We still have to see how that turns out.
So again, as you can see on the right, with forecasted interest income at EnerBank at about $130 million, we can offset parent debt interest expense. Even if none of the legacy interest expenses went well, it's a happy face for the parent, too. Again, none of us really know how the tax reform will end up. So on the left here, we have shown some alternatives to help you see different impacts. This shows the amount of CapEx backfill needed to offset a 100% asset expensing at various tax rates. At 15%, we'd add $100 million each year. That would rise to $300 million each year at 25%. Recall, we have investment opportunities of at least $3 billion. Our customers will enjoy rate reductions until we reach about a 25% tax rate. As we approach a 25% tax rate, with all the other assumptions being equal, we expect that our customers' investors would lose.
And of course, minor changes in tax reform could make all of this very different. In each alternative, we still are able to use our NOLs, although remember, the benefit will be smaller. We also hope to accelerate use of our AMT credit to improve cash. We have not factored the use of the AMT credits in our planning yet, though there may be a little more upside there. Excluding tax reform -- here's our new report card for 2017 and beyond. We anticipate another great year this year. With no big bets and robust risk mitigation, our model serves us and -- serves you and our customers well. Few companies are able to deliver top end earnings growth while improving value and service for customers year after year after year. We're pleased to have another outstanding consistent performance in 2016, and we expect to do the same in 2017.
With another consistent strong year ahead, 15 years in a row, we are able to continue to deliver robust adjusted earnings per share growth. With our capital investment already raised from $17 billion to $18 billion over the next 10 years, we expect to grow earnings 6% to 8% each year. Our approach to funding capital investment, both for customers and for investors, makes our earnings per share and cash flow growth sustainable for the decade ahead. 
So thank you, again, for joining our call today. This is my 58th in a row, still humming along. Operator, we would be pleased if you open up to take questions. Thank you."

So as you look at 2017, when I say next year, this year, we expect the industrial side to be up about 5%, and then we expect our residential and commercial will be down and be down around 1%, something like that. And that nets out all the energy efficiency. So we've been having great success from energy efficiencies. And don't forget, we are fortunate in our state to be able to earn incentives around that work and that's been about $17 million, $18 million a year, which is on top of our authorized ROE. The new law will permit us to almost double that when we get a full year effect. So we're really happy with what -- how that plays out. Now for this year, we ended up the year, the fourth quarter, with residential down a touch, commercial flat and industrial up. And so industrial was up about 1.5%. And so we ended up the year about roughly 0.5% up. We've seen a mixture of things going on out there in this last quarter. And I'll try to give you just a little bit of a feel about it. In the industrial side, on plastics, we saw good growth; fabricated steel, good growth, better than planned. On the auto side, that growth has continued, cautionary tale, though, because we're seeing the actual sales flatten out a little bit for auto at probably record levels for many of them, but still, in terms of growth, flattening out. We saw similar utilities that we serve doing really well. And then in food, that was mixed. So we saw some of our companies and customers doing really well and some backing off just a little bit. And then on chemicals, we saw things ease off. So we have quite a mix on the industrial side. Here's what we are reading. We see apprehension, first excitement. If you -- don't think the stock market, think about our customers and what they're doing in their businesses. We saw a lot of excitement and then the fourth quarter kind of eased off on some uncertainty. I think this first quarter is going to be an important one to watch, because we're going to see what confidence is out there on the consumer side, and we're going to see what our businesses do. And I wouldn't be surprised if some of them hold back a little bit trying to get a better feel for tax reform, money they may bring in from overseas and what they're going to do with their investment programs. But what I will tell you when we go talk to our major customers face-to-face, even though there's a little trepidation, they're pretty upbeat. So I think we're in for a good year and a 1% growth is probably a very reasonable place to be."

Or is it better that we keep it outside, providing that sort of emergency backup as it was needed in a fashion as well as the business that we know? There is good interest. The upsides at DIG still look attractive. People are still interested in doing more capacity contracts with us, but we're not doing those right now because we're making sure that, that backup plan is available to us.

So if your federal income tax collections go down at the utility level, that's obviously incredibly constructive for customers. It creates more than ample headroom for you to increase your capital expenditures to offset the impact of bonus depreciation should that also occur. But you rightly pointed out it would also reduce your parent cash flows, right? So you mentioned that you might be able to accelerate AMT credits to offset that.

And when you have a 35% tax yield like we do today, that's worth more than if we had, pick your number, 20% tax yield, right? So what we all have to do is take noncash hit, whoever has NOLs and credits, right? In year 1 of the tax reform, we'll have to drive a noncash hit to reflect whatever that is, that difference, right through the income statement. I assume everybody will want to adjust that out. But what's useful for us on the NOLs is that we have a long enough life, and we're positioned well enough that we're not going to lose the use of them. So we'll still get them, but they're only worth $0.20 on the dollar instead of 35% on the dollar. And on the AMTs, presently, we plan to use those towards the end of our tax planning. But in this scenario -- and again, who knows what it'll be, but I'm guessing in this scenario, we could lose access to those AMT credits. And for us, there's roughly $300 million. Well, rather than do that, we'll reconstruct how much we use bonus depreciation this year and last year for tax reporting. And we'll work in the AMT credit so we don't lose that $300 million, but we'll do it in a way so our customers at the utility are whole. We wouldn't ask them to take any penalty in this process. So we feel pretty good about what we can do, but gosh, we got to figure out what it really, really is first before we can adjust our tax planning. So we've got 6 months, I think, of Washington, D.C. work before something settles out."

As you can imagine, their biggest concern and it's our concern too is to assure that we have resource adequacy in Michigan. We do have a nice securitization law in Michigan that makes a proceeding like this limited in the amount of appeals, and so there's some real advantages to making sure that we ask and answer all these questions so that when the commission approves the securitization application, they really understand what are the customer benefits and savings and that we have adequate resource. And so the commission has asked for basically additional time through the end of August to go through that entire proceeding, but it's all under the umbrella of the securitization.

So at the utility, we are assuming backfill or whatever is opened up with the federal government. So if you just think of that and a big picture as neutral free cash flow as we'll need to do it soon. We have to do it early on in the process. Now go over to a little businesslike Enterprises, the nonutility business, we'll see the pickup in terms of benefit just like every nonutility, which would be pretty normal. But since we already aren't in a position on paying taxes, then you're not going to see a tax cash flow change, if you're with me on that, right? Because we're already in a position where we don't play -- pay taxes. And then on EnerBank, that will actually see a kick up, because now instead of losing the -- instead of paying taxes on the profit that we would make there inside of that business unit, we'll see that, that gets offset with the netting with parent interest. So they'll get good news. But then when we consolidate it up through the company, we already assume we're not paying any taxes. So I'm trying to tell you that there's not going to be much of a cash hurt or help. The big write-offs we do around the NOLs, that was asked about earlier and AMT credits, they mean that's how that works, the noncash thing, but will turn around on the AMT credits, and we will try to get advantage of those upfront. And so everyone might conclude, great, $300 million of better cash flow, depends on what you compare to. This is just substituting for bonus depreciation. So there's really no change to cash flow. So not a lot of change early on is my answer, and I made it complicated because it really is complicated and then you compare it to where you are today where you don't pay taxes, which we love, by the way. I think this is a great country. Any other questions?"

I'll be covering our first quarter results, I'll talk about our commitment to the triple bottom line of people, planet and profit, underpinned by world-class performance, enabled by our Consumers Energy way, because I will also show her my story of the month as always, and Tom will recover -- will cover our results and outlook. We're off to a strong start for the year, in spite of a mild winter and several storms. We're up $0.12 over 2016, and when we weather normalize that's up over 20% or $0.14. We're reaffirming our full year adjusted guidance for 2017 as 6% to 8% or $2.14 to $2.18.
We can sustainably and consistently deliver this performance by remaining true to our stand for people, planet and profit, underpinned by world-class performance. When we say people, we mean our customers, our communities, our coworkers and other critical stakeholders. And our commitment to the planet is demonstrated by our track record of going about beyond environmental regulation to leave the planet better than the founded. We do not compromise profitability in these pursuits because we believe in the and around the year. Our triple bottom line is made possible because we are squarely focused on world-class performance and it underpins everything we do.
Given the passage of the Energy Law at the end of 2016 and its implementation in flight, it's very helpful that Governor Snyder reinforce this stability and strength of our Michigan Public Service Commission by extending Chairman, Howard's term to July 2021. This was enabled by swapping terms with Commissioner, The governor also reappointed Eubank to July of 2023. The new law serves our customers very well and strengthens our regulatory construct in Michigan. We're working with the commission to implement several aspects, such as the new energy efficiency and waste reduction standard, the 10-month filing calendar, the 15% renewable portfolio standard and the new state reliability mechanism. In addition, we have active gas and electric rate case as well as our Palisades early determination securitization filing. We've asked a lot of our commission and their staff, their continuity and experience is a real advantage and we are thankful to have such professionals in place.
We gauge our effectiveness with our customers through their feedback to us. We're proud of the improvements for both our residential and our business customers. Our customers are noticing that we're continuously improving their experience. Despite our progress, however, we are still dissatisfied. Our customer feedback scores put us very close to the best in our industry, but are still over 200 points on a 1000 point scale from perfect. We're in pursuit of world-class and won't be satisfied until we demonstrate excellence in every interaction with our customers and when they believe that we are in fact the very best.
One area where our customers and others are taking note is the transformation of our generation fleet. As you can see, we've made big progress in reducing our reliance on coal for both capacity and energy, by retiring more coal plants than any other investors and utility and investing and renewables as well as fully utilizing our low-cost gas plants. We call this our clean and lean approach. It seems to make sense for people that when we say clean, it affects our commitment to the planet by replacing our coal plants with investments in renewable assets in gas plants. People to still ask us, however, what we mean when we mean, lean. Lean, the heart of Consumers Energy way, reflects the commitment to waste elimination and improving our performance at the same time, not just cost reduction for cost reduction sake. For example, we could have built a brand-new oversize got gas plant to replace our coal unit, but instead, we purchased low-cost, underutilized gas plant. We are fully utilizing it now and running it really well. This saved our customers over $0.5 billion, allowed us to deploy our capital to an area of greater value and reduced our carbon footprint simultaneously. Like all things we tackle, we serve people, the planet and the profit, no trade-offs. 
Our MCV PPA expires in 2025, which may seem off, but it's actually just around the corner from a generation and supply planning perspective. The replacement of that PPA will provide a great opportunity to deploy our clean and lean strategy and transition from an expensive PPA in this case to a single renewable capital investment -- a significant renewable capital investment in the $3 billion zone at a lower cost for customers and in a modular phase-in to match demand, a great example of clean and lean.
On March 8, we experienced one of the worst wind events in Michigan's history. Approximately 1 in 3 people in Michigan were affected and it's times like these in our team is at its best. In fact, we have several utility executives as well as our governor reach out on our performance and ask us how we did it. We're very proud of our team for their externally performance. 
Our customers don't hold us accountable for Mother Nature, but they do want to know what to expect during an outage. We are finding that they want to have frequent an accurate conversations with us during a major event. A shout out to our customer service reps, who handled over 116,000 calls during the storm, our IT team who supports our outage map, which took 355 hits per second on the first day of the storm, and our social media team, who answered every single posting personally, 24 hours a day on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. This is a new standard and capability for us.  And that isn't even my story of the month. 
Smart meters during storms is my story for this month. Smart meters are part of the answer to how our performance continues to improve during major events. During a separate event in April, our traditional tools told us that our Nashville, remote with circuit short of full circuit lockout in 1,175 customers on that circuit were without power. Our ability to proactively ping those meters allowed for remote confirmations that only 178 of those customers were actually out of power. In the past, we would have run trucks for all those outages. Imagine the ways we eliminated by more surgically being able to determine the location of the interruptions. We would have wasted time and valuable resources needed in other areas of the restoration effort. We were able to accurately quantify that we reduced over 3,000 hours of customer interruption and over 50 truck rolls, as a result of this one circuit and 1 storm, thanks to our smart meters.  We don't even have our meters fully deployed yet, that scheduled to occur by year-end. The value of our investment in the technology is just beginning to materialize. It's our favorites kind of capital investment, 1 that improve the customer experience, at a lower operating cost and provide the real return to you, our investors. We have a proven track record to deliver for you, in spite of the changes in the economy, storms, policymakers and company leadership. This just confirms -- we, in fact have a CMS Energy way, continuously improving everything we do. Take away, Tom."

This is our fifteenth year of earnings calls with consistent adjusted earnings growth averaging more than 7% a year, and as usual, there are no surprises in our results. 
Our first quarter earnings are up $0.12 or 20%, while this includes another mild winter and records storm damage, we offset fully the challenges to deliver another strong quarter.  On a weather normalized basis, 2017 earnings are up $0.14 or 20%. You can see the favorable comparison of 2017 with 2016 first quarter results on this waterfall chart. Operations are performing well, our cost reductions are ahead of plan and our enterprises and interbank businesses also are ahead of plan. By managing our work well, we offset the adverse weather and storm impact to $0.04 in the first quarter. The storm cost was $30 million, our insurance offset was $11 million. The O&M portion of the storm cost net of the insurance was $10 million or $0.02 a share. Cost savings of $0.08 included property tax savings of $0.03, coal plant retirement savings of $0.02, a variety of lean process improvements at $0.1.5, and stock-based compensation accounting benefits of another $0.1.5. While we earlier adopted the new accounting standard 2016 - 09 last year, we benefited another $6 million this quarter. This simply reflects share added routinely as well as the higher price of our stock. Favorable rate increases net of associated capital investment helped another $0.02 and favorable utility sales combined with strong business performance at enterprises helped another $0.06. While our weather normalized sales were up 1.2% in the quarter without the benefit of the leap year day in 2016, they would have been up a little more than 2%.
These sales result bode well for our full year forecast increase of little less than 1%. Our total year-to-year earnings improvement for the quarter was $0.12 a share again or 20%. As you can see, our progress for the rest of the year is strong. 
Here's how the earnings per share forecast curve looks this year. I know many of you are familiar with this carve that projects our earnings per share growth for the full year, at any point during the year. We fully offset the adverse weather in the first quarter with excellent performance and look forward to strong results for the year.
We were able to accelerate some attractive financing and make use of higher energy efficiency incentives that are permitted under our new energy law. Sales mix also is stronger than expected. Other examples include continuing reductions in uncollectible accounts in part because customer bills will be lower after the mild winter, but in part because of the continuing strong consumers energy way process improvement. Our 2017 performance is a continuation of what we've done over a long cleared of time. Our track record of earnings per share growth has been at 7% a year, year-after-year after year. And imagine during the last 4 years, we reinvested in O&M, 1/3 of the billion dollars for our customers. Half of this was made possible by favorable weather, half by cost reductions, cost reductions much better than we originally had planned.
Here is the model that makes possible a consistent 7% earnings per share growth over the last decade and the next with our extensive inventory of self-funded organic capital investment projects, abundant cost reduction opportunities and diverse economy you can see why this works, especially with the continued focus on process improvements and cost reductions. This model can continue for many years to come. Here is the customer-driven capital investment plan that's included in our model for next 10 years.
We're investing $18 billion to improve performance with better service and better value for our customers. Here is what it looks like with additional opportunities that would increase our capital investments to $21 billion. This includes in highest gas infrastructure, grid modernization, replacement of PPS like our palaces contract and more renewables. And here you can see that the opportunity could be as much as $7 billion, reaching $25 billion of capital investment over the next 10 years. This reflects our clean and lean strategy with more emphasis on renewables during the course of the next decade. The model is sustainable over many years and it's made possible by lean thinking and in performance. As you can see, on the left of the slide, we have been EBITDA a leader in this area and each year become of it new and innovative ways to deliver those savings for our customers. For Investors, this creates capital investment headroom. For customers, cost reductions have been and continue to be an important part of our self-funded model. There are lots of ups and downs, we include them all and delivered net savings.
We don't or just for things that do seem out of our control. Over the last decade, we've been able to reduce our O&M cost by more than 3% a year. We've continued that over the last 3 years. We're projecting to continue this space at about 2%, with our underpromised, over deliver mentality, with the actual results a bit to your imagination. That's O&M. We eliminate waste, whether it's O&M, capital investment or fuel. And we self fund a portion of the investments the tax savings.
Base rate increase a stay low and we grow cash flow resources to support a healthy necessary capital structure. Over the last dozen years, our operating cash flow has been growing by more than $100 million each year. Since 2004, it's increased from $353 million to $2.1 billion last year. Over the next 5 years, operating cash flow will grow about $800 million to $2.9 billion. Our NOLs, bonus depreciation and AMT credits among several tax planning tools, help us avoid the need for block equity. If tax reform occurs, we expect we will still have time to use our NOLs also at a lower rate. We also would expect to access our AMT credits early. With or without tax reforms, we believe that we're in excellent position to avoid the need for block equity to fund our planned investments for some time.
We do all of this to improve the lot of our customers. We've been reducing rates rapidly. Industrial rates were 26% above our Midwest peers, just a few years ago. We've reduced that by 20 points and plan to keep going. Our business electric customer satisfaction is up 22% since 2010 and and we improved that much, much more. Process improvement to the Consumers Energy way make it possible. Beyond the utility, our enterprise business continues to grow, potential upsides are shown here on this bigger slides. we are experiencing winning bids for 2018 planning year at around $4.25 per kilowatt month. A nice upside for our plan. It's not yet been determined how much of our capacity upside, if any, may be needed for the utility, either by contract or asset sales. This is part of the assessment being conducted with our commission over the next several months.
This is our sensitivity slide for the total company. We provide this update each quarter to assist you with assessing our prospects. You can see with the reasonable planning assumptions and a robust risk mitigation, the probability of large variances from our plant minimized. There are always ups and downs, already this year, property taxes are lower than we expected and we anticipate further opportunities in other locations. The opportunity for energy efficiencies incentive are doubled under our new energy law.
Being conservative, we've included half the increase in our forecast with as shown here another $0.02 opportunity yet to be reflected. 
The rating agencies appreciate our approach, as you can see, here both S&P and Fitch, who upgraded as last year, have stable outlooks on our credit rating. Moody's just upgraded our ratings another notch at CMS Energy and the utility. So what makes this consistent improvement possible? We just stay focused on our business model. It is simple and perhaps it's a little unique, but we believe it provides a good opportunity to continue making improvements for our investors and our customers for the decade ahead.
Our organic capital investment has grown, driving our adjusted earnings per share growth to a bit better than 7% every year. Because we don't make any adjustments, our operating cash flow gross at the same pace.  Another part of our model that might be little unique is the work hard to reduce our O&M cost every year, not to improve profits, but rather to self fund a good portion of our capital investment for our customers. With base rate increases at or below the level of inflation, this is the model that provides customers with improvements from investments, without asking to raise their rates is very. This makes model sustainable for the decade ahead. As you can see, here, this model has been recognized by many of you, our investors and it is our intention to continue our strong business performance in a manner that improves a lot of our customers every day. We believe this can result in adjusted earnings per share growth of 6% to 8% a year, a commensurate increase in our dividend and continued healthy performance of our stock. Here's our latest report card for 2017 and beyond.

But we're also happy, if it ends up inside the utility to this process, because it does, it will going at a fair price that's good for our customers, so it meets the needs of the patient Palisades, saving them lot of money as we projected.

One of the interesting things with renewables right now that we are observing is that our large industrial customers, particularly those that are brand facing, are very interested in us working with them to provide renewables. So for example, General Motors, our switched data centers. They've made public commitments to 100% renewables and they want those renewables to be additive. So our cross wins to expansion that were underway right now is going to be fulfilling the needs of switch for the data center that they built in Grand Rapids to provide the additive renewable generation to serve their load. So we don't think that there will be a ratemaking that goes into formula as well.

This is what we have observed that the low-cost -- or the low price in that MISO auction tells us a couple of things. One, it says that MISO is predominantly regulated, and so there was a definitely low-price bidding strategy. However, I think it also is fair to say that 1-year forward auction is not the good tell tail for generation planning and resource adequacy. Last year's Zone 7, as you all know was that $72 a megawatt day and when we compared that obviously to this year's $150, we saw more energy efficiency and demand responce. We'll be studying Zone 7 more in detail specifically. But what it tells us is it is not a good planning tool. It can be read flag, it can be a warning bell, but it's a warning bell that's too late. So we're very helpful that we passed Energy Law in the end of 2016. We really thought the FERC was going to approve the MISO 3-year auction and when they didn't, it was great that Energy Law had gone into place because it provides the 3-year visibility, in fact, 4 years of visibility for both the utilities and the alternative energy suppliers for who is providing the load. And so the transparency, the forward-looking nature of the process that's been put in place by the commission is going to serve the much better forward-looking telltale than the MISO option currently does."

And in a matured industry like us, the idea of having underutilized major capital investments feels counter intuitive to what we're seeing in the industries. So the idea that we would right size our assets to match the actual demand so that our capital is available to deployed the other areas, since we have ample need for CapEx in another part of system it really is the leanest way to board deploy capital and provide the generation matched to demand."

Obviously citing, this volume of wind turbines, if we assume current technology, we're talking about 900 wind turbines, it would take new sites beyond what we have today, but here's the good news. First of all, in Michigan, we have -- I don't know if you've been to Northern Michigan, but there's lot of land and there's a lot of areas. We need to complete wind studies and confirm the best places. We would not rule out doing outside state generation with transition, if that was more viable for customers. But it is really early, Jonathan, we got a lot of time. And technology can really evolve. And there is lot of things that could happen between here and there. But as a placeholder, we think that our pass is a sniff test of possibilities."

I could imagine pricing changes and rate design versus per unit-based pricing, maybe there is a different way to do pricing in this business. So when you're asking me long-term, 10 years out, that's what I'm looking at. Short term, we've got a strong regulatory construct in Michigan. We've got a great law that was passed in December. We're in the process of implementing it. As I mentioned in the call, there's lot of work on the commission's plate. So frankly, just implementing the current law is going to keep us busy for a good several years. But we are looking long-term. And I think that's one of the sense of this commission that they are long-term thinkers and the extension of their terms enables them to think long-term.

I'll talk about our commitment to the triple bottom line of people, planet and profit, underpinned by world-class performance, enabled by our Consumers Energy way. Standby, because I will also share my story of the month, as always, and Tom will recover -- will cover our results and outlook.
We're off to a strong start for the year, in spite of a mild winter and several storms. We're up $0.12 over 2016, and when we weather-normalized that's up over 20% or $0.14. We're reaffirming our full year adjusted guidance for 2017 at 6% to 8% or $2.14 to $2.18.
We can sustainably and consistently deliver this performance by remaining true to our stand for people, planet and profit, underpinned by world-class performance. When we say people, we mean our customers, our communities, our coworkers and other critical stakeholders. And our commitment to the planet is demonstrated by our track record of going above and beyond environmental regulation to leave the planet better than we found it. We do not compromise profitability in these pursuits because we believe in the end around here. Our triple bottom line is made possible because we are squarely focused on world-class performance and it underpins everything we do.
Given the passage of the Energy Law at the end of 2016 and its implementation in flight, it's very helpful that Governor Snyder reinforce the stability and strength of our Michigan Public Service Commission by extending Chairman, Talberg's term to July 2021. This was enabled by swapping terms with Commissioner, Saari. The Governor also reappointed Commissioner Eubanks to July of 2023.
The new law serves our customers very well and strengthens our regulatory construct in Michigan. We're working with the commission to implement several aspects, such as the new energy efficiency and waste reduction standard, the 10-month filing calendar, the 15% renewable portfolio standard and the new state reliability mechanism. In addition, we have active gas and electric rate cases as well as our Palisades early termination securitization filing. We've asked a lot of our commission and their staff. Their continuity and experience is a real advantage, and we're thankful to have such professionals in place.
We gauge our effectiveness with our customers through their feedback to us. We're proud of the improvements for both our residential and our business customers. Our customers are noticing that we're continuously improving their experience. Despite our progress, however, we are still dissatisfied. Our customer feedback scores put us very close to the best in our industry, but are still over 200 points on a 1000-point scale from perfect. We are in pursuit of world-class and won't be satisfied until we demonstrate excellence in every interaction with our customers and when they believe that we are in fact the very best.
One area where our customers and others are taking note is the transformation of our generation fleet. As you can see, we've made big progress in reducing our reliance on coal for both capacity and energy, by retiring more coal plants than any other investor on utility and investing in renewables as well as fully utilizing our low-cost gas plants. We call this our clean and lean approach. It seems to make sense for people that when we say clean, it reflects our commitment to the planet by replacing our coal plants with investments in renewable assets in gas plants. People do still ask us, however, what we mean when we say lean. Lean, the heart of Consumers Energy way, reflects the commitment to waste elimination and improving our performance at the same time, not just cost reduction for cost reduction sake. For example, we could have built a brand-new oversize gas plant to replace our coal unit, but instead, we purchased a low-cost, underutilized gas plant. We are fully utilizing it now and running it really well. This saved our customers over $0.5 billion, allowed us to deploy our capital to an area of greater value and reduced our carbon footprint simultaneously. Like all things we tackle, we serve people, the planet and profit, no trade-offs.
Our MCV PPA expires in 2025, which may seem a ways off, but it's actually just around the corner from a generation and supply planning perspective. The replacement of that PPA will provide a great opportunity to deploy our clean and lean strategy and transition from an expensive PPA in this case to a single renewable capital investment -- a significant renewable capital investment in the $3 billion zone at a lower cost for customers and in a modular phase-in to match demand, a great example of clean and lean.
On March 8, we experienced one of the worst wind events in Michigan's history. Approximately 1 in 3 people in Michigan were affected, and it's times like these when our team is at its best. In fact, we had several utility executives as well as our Governor reach out to congratulate us on our performance and ask us how we did it. We're very proud of our team for their extraordinary performance.
Our customers don't hold us accountable for Mother Nature, but they do want to know what to expect during an outage. We are finding that they want to have frequent and accurate conversations with us during a major event. A shout-out to our customer service reps, who handled over 116,000 calls during the storm; our IT team, who supports our outage map, which took 355 hits per second on the first day of the storm; and our social media team, who answered every single posting personally, 24 hours a day on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. This is a new standard and capability for us. And that isn't even my story of the month.
Smart meters during storms is my story for this month. Smart meters are part of the answer to how our performance continues to improve during major events. During a separate event in April, our traditional tools told us that our Nashville-Vermontville circuit showed a full circuit lockout and 1,175 customers on that circuit were without power. Our ability to proactively ping those meters allowed for remote confirmation that only 178 of those customers were actually out of power. In the past, we would have run trucks for all those outages. Imagine the ways we eliminated by more surgically being able to determine the location of the interruptions. We would have wasted time and valuable resources needed in other areas of the restoration effort. We were able to accurately quantify that we reduced over 3,000 hours of customer interruption and over 50 truck rolls, as a result of this one circuit and one storm, thanks to our smart meters.  We don't even have our meters fully deployed yet, that's scheduled to occur by year-end. The value of our investment in the cellular technology is just beginning to materialize. It's our favorite kind of capital investment, one that improves the customer experience, at a lower operating cost and provides the real return to you, our investors.
We have a proven track record to deliver for you, in spite of the changes in the economy, storms, policymakers and company leadership. This just confirms we, in fact, have a CMS Energy way; continuously improving everything we do.
Take it away, Tom."
257682,428038364,1184137,"CMS Energy Corporation, Q1 2017 Earnings Call, May 01, 2017",2017-05-01,"Earnings Calls","CMS Energy Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Patti, and thank you again for joining us today, everyone. This is our 15th year of earnings calls with consistent adjusted earnings growth averaging more than 7% a year, and as usual, there are no surprises in our results.Our first quarter earn",1714,"Thanks, Patti, and thank you again for joining us today, everyone. This is our 15th year of earnings calls with consistent adjusted earnings growth averaging more than 7% a year, and as usual, there are no surprises in our results.
Our first quarter earnings are up $0.12 or 20%. While this includes another mild winter and record storm damage, we offset fully the challenges to deliver another strong quarter.  On a weather-normalized basis, 2017 earnings are up $0.14 or 20%.
You can see the favorable comparison of 2017 with 2016 first quarter results on this waterfall chart. Operations are performing well, our cost reductions are ahead of plan, and our enterprises and interbank businesses also are ahead of plan. By managing our work well, we offset the adverse weather and storm impact to $0.04 in the first quarter. The storm cost was $30 million, our insurance offset was $11 million. The O&M portion of the storm cost net of the insurance was $10 million or $0.02 a share. Cost savings of $0.08 included property tax savings of $0.03, coal plant retirement savings of $0.02, a variety of lean process improvements at $0.015 and stock-based compensation accounting benefits of another $0.015. While we earlier adopted the new accounting standard in 2016-09 last year, we benefited another $6 million this quarter. This simply reflects shares added routinely as well as the higher price of our stock. Favorable rate increases net of associated capital investment helped another $0.02 and favorable utility sales combined with strong business performance at enterprises helped another $0.06. While our weather-normalized sales were up 1.2% in the quarter without the benefit of the leap year day in 2016, they would have been up a little more than 2%.  These sales results bode well for our full year forecast increase of a little less than 1%. Our total year-to-year earnings improvement for the quarter was $0.12 a share again or 20%. As you can see, our progress for the rest of the year is strong.
Here's how the earnings per share forecast curve looks this year. I know many of you are familiar with this curve that projects our earnings per share growth for the full year, at any point during the year. We fully offset the adverse weather in the first quarter with excellent performance and look forward to strong results for the year.
We were able to accelerate some attractive financing and make use of higher energy efficiency incentives that are permitted under our new energy law. Sales mix also is a strong -- is stronger than expected. Other examples include continuing reductions in uncollectible accounts in part because customer bills will be lower after the mild winter, but in part because of the continuing strong Consumers Energy way process improvement.
Our 2017 performance is a continuation of what we've done over a long period of time. Our track record of earnings per share growth has been at 7% a year, year after year after year. And imagine during the last 4 years, we reinvested in O&M $0.3333 billion for our customers. Half of this was made possible by favorable weather, half by cost reductions, cost reductions much better than we originally had planned.
Here's the model that makes possible a consistent 7% earnings per share growth over the last decade and the next. With our extensive inventory of self-funded organic capital investment projects, abundant cost reduction opportunities and a diverse economy, you can see why this works, especially with continued focus on process improvements and cost reductions. This model can continue for many years to come.
Here is the customer-driven capital investment plan that's included in our model for next 10 years. We're investing $18 billion to improve performance with better service and better value for our customers.
Here's what it looks like with additional opportunities that could increase our capital investment to $21 billion. This includes enhanced gas infrastructure, grid modernization, replacement of PPAs, like our Palisades contract, and more renewables.
And here you can see that the opportunity could be as much as $7 billion, reaching $25 billion of capital investment over the next 10 years. This reflects our clean and lean strategy with more emphasis on renewables during the course of the next decade. The model is sustainable over many years and it's made possible by lean thinking and lean performance. As you can see, on the left of this slide, we've been bit of a little leader in this area and each year we come up with new and innovative ways to deliver those savings for our customers. For investors, this creates capital investment headroom. For customers, cost reductions have been and continue to be an important part of our self-funded model. There are lots of ups and downs, we include them all and deliver net savings.
We don't adjust for things that do seem out of our control. Over the last decade, we've been able to reduce our O&M costs by more than 3% a year. We've continued that over the last 3 years. We're projecting to continue this pace at about 2%, with our underpromise, overdeliver mentality, I'll leave the actual results a bit to your imagination.
That's O&M. We eliminate waste, whether it's O&M, capital investment or fuel. And we self-fund a portion of the investment with tax savings. Base rate increases stay low, and we grow cash flow resources to support a healthy necessary capital structure.
Over the last dozen years, our operating cash flow has been growing by more than $100 million each year. Since 2004, it's increased from $353 million to $2.1 billion last year. Over the next 5 years, operating cash flow will grow about $800 million to $2.9 billion. Our NOLs, bonus depreciation and AMT credits, among several tax planning tools, help us avoid the need for block equity. If tax reform occurs, we expect we'll still have time to use our NOLs, although at a lower rate. We also would expect to access our AMT credits early. With or without tax reform, we believe that we're in excellent position to avoid the need for block equity to fund our planned investments for some time.
We do all of this to improve the lot of our customers. We've been reducing rates rapidly. Industrial rates were 26% above our Midwest peers, just a few years ago. We've reduced that by 20 points and plan to keep going. Our business electric customer satisfaction is up 22% since 2010, and we intend to improve that much, much more. Process improvements through the Consumers Energy way make it possible.
Beyond the utility, our enterprise business continues to grow. Potential upsides are shown here on this [indiscernible] slide. We are experiencing winning bids in the bilateral market for the 2018 planning year at around $4.25 per kilowatt month. A nice upside for our plan. It's not yet been determined how much of our capacity upside, if any, may be needed for the utility, either by contract or asset sales. This is part of the assessment being conducted with our commission over the next several months.
This is our sensitivity slide for the total company. We provide this update each quarter to assist you with assessing our prospects. You can see with reasonable planning assumptions and the robust risk mitigation, the probability of large variances from our plant minimized. There are always ups and downs. Already this year, property taxes are lower than we expected, and we anticipate further opportunities at other locations. The opportunity for energy efficiencies, incentives are doubled under our new energy law.
Being conservative, we've included half the increase in our forecast, with us showing here another $0.02 opportunity, yet to be reflected.
The rating agencies appreciate our approach, as you can see, here both S&P and Fitch, who upgraded us last year, have stable outlooks on our credit rating. Moody's just upgraded our ratings another notch at CMS Energy and the utility.
So what makes this consistent improvement possible? We just stay focused on our business model. It is simple and perhaps it's a little unique, but we believe it provides a good opportunity to continue making improvements for our investors and our customers for the decade ahead.
Our organic capital investment has grown, driving our adjusted earnings per share growth to a bit better than 7% every year. Because we don't make any adjustments, our operating cash flow gross at the same pace. Another part of our model that might be a little unique is that we work hard to reduce our O&M cost every year, not to improve profits, but rather to self-fund a good portion of our capital investment for our customers. With base rate increases at or below the level of inflation, this is a model that provides customers with improvements for -- from investments, without asking to raise their rates unreasonably. This makes the model sustainable for the decade ahead.
As you can see here, this model has been recognized by many of you, our investors, and it is our intention to continue our strong business performance in a manner that improves a lot of our customers every day. We believe this can result in adjusted earnings per share growth of 6% to 8% a year, a commensurate increase in our dividend and continued healthy performance of our stock.
Here's our latest report card for 2017 and beyond. We anticipate another great year, this year and for many years to come. With no big bets and robust risk mitigation, we believe our model serves our customers and you well. Few companies have been able to deliver top-end earnings growth, while improving value and service for customers every year, year after year after year. We are pleased to have another fast start to another outstanding performance in 2017 and expect the same for years to come. Our focus on world-class performance delivering a hometown service, permits us to improve each and every year. We can and will continue this improvement. It's our passion for you and our customers.
Thank you again for your support for the last 15 years. Thank you for your confidence in our future. Patti, Rejji and I will leave it better than we found it. Operator, would you please open the line?"

But that will depend on all the competitive bids that are out there and it's a third-party process and it's an affiliate. So it's one that's been conducted by somebody else, not by us, and we'll be watching that with great interest. So what I would tell you is we're very prepared to have DIG outside the utility, because we see these opportunities that show in the yellow bar on Slide 23, where you can kind of figure out from what I said, we're approaching that $20 million upside as it is in the near couple of years. But we're also happy, if it ends up inside the utility through this process, because if it does, it'll go in at a fair price that's, one, good for our customers, so it meets the needs of replacing the Palisades plant, saving them a lot of money as we projected. But it will also be attractive to investors, because it would be at a profitable level and that's the level, of course, that would be bid into that process. So that gives you the framework. If it's in the utility or if it's outside the utility, it's really a nice opportunity for us."

Now if we're to add $7 billion and it didn't have offsets, that would be a different story and that can always happen, where I'd assume we'd have a really good project to show you and it would make good sense and you wouldn't want to make the incremental investment, so the block equity would make sense.

We do have one in our gas case -- our gas structure today, in our enhanced infrastructure replacement program. It's about $75 million annual program to replace mains and distributions, and that is a -- has a true-up annually. We have been achieving it, and so we're getting a good track record.

But we are not putting into our full year forecast this uptick that we're seeing on residential and commercial. We're still going to show those as down. Now we may be wrong, but it's my theory in life, one quarter does not make a year, especially when you're looking at sales. I'd like to get another quarter under our belt to see what's really happening before we make any upside adjustments to that. So our full year forecast is still in that zone of something between 0.5% and 1%. I would make a note that I was surprised, somebody called us and asked us about the leap year day last year. And again, we don't really pay a lot of attention of those sort of things, but we checked it out and we said, ""Oh, yes.""

One of the interesting things with renewables right now that we're observing is that our large industrial customers, particularly those that are brand facing, are very interested in us working with them to provide renewables. So for example, General Motors switched data centers. They've made public commitments to 100% renewables and they want those renewables to be additive. So our cross wins to expansion that we're underway right now is going to be fulfilling the needs of switch for the data center that they built in Grand Rapids to provide the additive renewable generation to serve their load. And so we don't think that there will be ratemaking that goes into the formula as well.

I'm sure there's going to be -- there are others who have questions about the MISO auction. And this is what we observed that the low-cost -- or the low price in that MISO auction tells us a couple of things. One, it says that MISO is predominantly regulated and so there was definitely a low-price bidding strategy. However, I think it also is fair to say that a 1-year forward auction is not a good telltale for generation planning and resource adequacy. Last year's Zone 7, as you all know, was at $72 a megawatt day and when we compare that, obviously, to this year's $150, we saw more energy efficiency and demand response. We'll be studying Zone 7 more in detail specifically. But what it tells us is it's not a good planning tool. It can be a red flag. It can be a warning bell, but it's a warning bell that's too late. And so we're very grateful that we passed the energy law at the end of 2016. We really thought the FERC was going to approve the MISO 3-year auction and when they didn't, it was great that the energy law had gone into place because it provides the 3-year visibility, in fact, 4 years of visibility for both the utilities and the alternative energy suppliers for who is providing the load. And so the transparency, the forward-looking nature of the process that's been put in place by the commission is going to serve a much better forward-looking telltale than the MISO option currently does."

So we'll -- DIG is, obviously, a viable candidate. We will see how it stacks up against the other offers. And like in the past, if there's a more economic solution for customers, we'll take it. We'll use the data to make a good decision."

We're always doing forward-looking planning, and as we build out that generation strategy and we're really trying to explore what are the limits to clean and lean, we see this as a key -- it will be the big next step change for us in generation replacement. And so, as we've looked at, does clean and lean hold, when you're looking at 1,200 megawatts of a gas PPA, and we can see there's real potential that it could. We're just trying to reinforce that we really are serious about this generation replacement strategy. We're, obviously, deploying it currently on the PPA from Palisades. If we have any other short-term plant closings of our own fleet, we would also deploy it there as well. And so we're always looking but we want to make clear that there are future opportunities that just continue to strengthen this business model for the next decade. I think a lot of people might struggle to have a 10-year CapEx plan, and so we like to be sure that you all are clear that it's legit. We're -- we have a legitimate plan for the 10-year time horizon that we can see that meets both the CapEx demand and the affordability commitment that we have for customers."

Will it be more than where we are today or will it be less, as efficiency of motors and equipments and lighting, does it change our mix? And so what. This whole lean idea that we would build to match close -- more closely to demand, I think is different. And so I feel a need to continue to just kind of explain it and reinforce that the idea here in the past, traditionally utility model, you build a big generating plant and you grow into it. Your CapEx is tied up, your operation has a big project that they are tied up in and then you're waiting to grow in to the full utilization of that asset. And in a matured industry, like ours, the idea of having underutilized major capital investments are counterintuitive to what we've seen in other industries. And so the idea that we would right-size our assets to match the actual demand so that our capital is available to be deployed to other areas, since we have ample need for CapEx in another parts of our system, it really is the leanest way to deploy capital and provide the generation match to demand."

That was pretty -- that helped us really realize that we are competitive in the building of generation. So we can stay true to our commitment to customers to be the low-cost provider and given that, we would want to build our own because we've proven ourselves competitive. Obviously, citing this volume of wind turbines, if we assume current technology, we're talking about 900 wind turbines, it would take new sites beyond what we have today, but here's the good news. First of all, in Michigan, we have -- I don't know if you've been in Northern Michigan, but there's a lot of land and there's a lot of areas. We need to complete wind studies and confirm the best places. We would not rule out doing outside-state generation with transition, if that was more viable for customers.

And so we think that potentially that would be some transitions from our current regulatory model. I could imagine pricing changes in rate design versus per unit-based pricing, maybe there's a different way to do pricing in this business. So when you're asking me long term, 10 years out, that's what I'm looking at. Short term, we've got a strong regulatory construct in Michigan. We've got a great law that was passed in December. We're in the process of implementing it. As I mentioned in the call, there's a lot of work on the commission's plate. And so frankly, just implementing the current law is going to keep us busy for a good several years. But we are looking long term.

Standby, because I will also share my story of the month, as always, and Tom will recover -- will cover our results and outlook.
We're off to a strong start for the year, in spite of a mild winter and several storms. We're up $0.12 over 2016 and, when we weather-normalize, that's up over 20% or $0.14. We're reaffirming our full year adjusted guidance for 2017 at 6% to 8% or $2.14 to $2.18.
We can sustainably and consistently deliver this performance by remaining true to our stand for people, planet and profit, underpinned by world-class performance. When we say people, we mean our customers, our communities, our coworkers and other critical stakeholders. And our commitment to the planet is demonstrated by our track record of going above and beyond environmental regulation to leave the planet better than we found it. We do not compromise profitability in these pursuits because we believe in the and around here. Our triple bottom line is made possible because we are squarely focused on world-class performance and it underpins everything we do.
Given the passage of the Energy Law at the end of 2016 and its implementation in flight, it's very helpful that Governor Snyder reinforced the stability and strength of our Michigan Public Service Commission by extending Chairman, Talberg's term to July 2021. This was enabled by swapping terms with Commissioner Saari. The Governor also reappointed Commissioner Eubanks to July of 2023.
The new law serves our customers very well and strengthens our regulatory construct in Michigan. We're working with the commission to implement several aspects, such as the new energy efficiency and waste reduction standard, the 10-month filing calendar, the 15% renewable portfolio standard and the new state reliability mechanism. In addition, we have active gas and electric rate cases as well as our Palisades early termination securitization filing. We've asked a lot of our commission and their staff. Their continuity and experience is a real advantage, and we're thankful to have such professionals in place.
We gauge our effectiveness with our customers through their feedback to us. We're proud of the improvements for both our residential and our business customers. Our customers are noticing that we're continuously improving their experience. Despite our progress, however, we are still dissatisfied. Our customer feedback scores put us very close to the best in our industry, but are still over 200 points, on a 1000-point scale, from perfect. We are in pursuit of world-class and won't be satisfied until we demonstrate excellence in every interaction with our customers and when they believe that we are, in fact, the very best.
One area where our customers and others are taking note is the transformation of our generation fleet. As you can see, we've made big progress in reducing our reliance on coal for both capacity and energy, by retiring more coal plants than any other investor-owned utility and investing in renewables as well as fully utilizing our low-cost gas plants. We call this our clean and lean approach. It seems to make sense for people that when we say clean, it reflects our commitment to the planet by replacing our coal plants with investments in renewable assets in gas plants. People do still ask us, however, what we mean when we say lean. Lean, the heart of Consumers Energy way, reflects the commitment to waste elimination and improving our performance at the same time, not just cost reduction for cost reduction's sake. For example, we could have built a brand-new oversize gas plant to replace our coal unit, but instead, we purchased a low-cost, underutilized gas plant. We are fully utilizing it now and running it really well. This saved our customers over $0.5 billion, allowed us to deploy our capital to an area of greater value and reduced our carbon footprint simultaneously. Like all things we tackle, we serve people, the planet and profit, no trade-offs.
Our MCV PPA expires in 2025, which may seem a ways off, but it's actually just around the corner from a generation and supply planning perspective. The replacement of that PPA will provide a great opportunity to deploy our clean and lean strategy and transition from an expensive PPA in this case to a single renewable capital investment -- a significant renewable capital investment in the $3 billion zone at a lower cost for customers and in a modular phase-in to match demand, a great example of clean and lean.
On March 8, we experienced one of the worst wind events in Michigan's history. Approximately 1 in 3 people in Michigan were affected, and it's times like these when our team is at its best. In fact, we had several utility executives, as well as our Governor, reach out to congratulate us on our performance and ask us how we did it. We're very proud of our team for their extraordinary performance.
Our customers don't hold us accountable for Mother Nature, but they do want to know what to expect during an outage. We are finding that they want to have frequent and accurate conversations with us during a major event. A shout-out to our customer service reps, who handled over 116,000 calls during the storm; our IT team, who supports our outage map, which took 355 hits per second on the first day of the storm; and our social media team, who answered every single posting personally, 24 hours a day on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. This is a new standard and capability for us. And that isn't even my story of the month.
Smart meters during storms is my story for this month. Smart meters are part of the answer to how our performance continues to improve during major events. During a separate event in April, our traditional tools told us that our Nashville-Vermontville circuit showed a full circuit lockout and 1,175 customers on that circuit were without power. Our ability to proactively ping those meters allowed for remote confirmation that only 178 of those customers were actually out of power. In the past, we would have run trucks for all those outages. Imagine the waste we eliminated by more surgically being able to determine the location of the interruptions. We would have wasted time and valuable resources needed in other areas of the restoration effort. We were able to accurately quantify that we reduced over 3,000 hours of customer interruption and over 50 truck rolls as a result of this one circuit and one storm, thanks to our smart meters.  We don't even have our meters fully deployed yet, that's scheduled to occur by year-end. The value of our investment in this cellular technology is just beginning to materialize. It's our favorite kind of capital investment, one that improves the customer experience at a lower operating cost and provides the real return to you, our investors.
We have a proven track record to deliver for you, in spite of the changes in the economy, storms, policymakers and company leadership. This just confirms we, in fact, have a CMS Energy way; continuously improving everything we do.
Take it away, Tom."
257682,428038364,1184213,"CMS Energy Corporation, Q1 2017 Earnings Call, May 01, 2017",2017-05-01,"Earnings Calls","CMS Energy Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Patti, and thank you again for joining us today, everyone. This is our 15th year of earnings calls with consistent adjusted earnings growth averaging more than 7% a year and, as usual, there are no surprises in our results.Our first quarter earn",1713,"Thanks, Patti, and thank you again for joining us today, everyone. This is our 15th year of earnings calls with consistent adjusted earnings growth averaging more than 7% a year and, as usual, there are no surprises in our results.
Our first quarter earnings are up $0.12 or 20%. While this includes another mild winter and record storm damage, we offset fully the challenges to deliver another strong quarter.  On a weather-normalized basis, 2017 earnings are up $0.14 or 20%.
You can see the favorable comparison of 2017 with 2016 first quarter results on this waterfall chart. Operations are performing well, our cost reductions are ahead of plan, and our enterprises and interbank businesses also are ahead of plan. By managing our work well, we offset the adverse weather and storm impact of $0.04 in the first quarter. The storm cost was $30 million, our insurance offset was $11 million. The O&M portion of the storm cost, net of the insurance, was $10 million or $0.02 a share. Cost savings of $0.08 included property tax savings of $0.03, coal plant retirement savings of $0.02, a variety of lean process improvements at $0.015 and stock-based compensation accounting benefits of another $0.015. While we early-adopted the new accounting standard in 2016-09 last year, we benefited another $6 million this quarter. This simply reflects shares added routinely as well as the higher price of our stock. Favorable rate increases net of associated capital investment helped another $0.02 and favorable utility sales combined with strong business performance at enterprises helped another $0.06. While our weather-normalized sales were up 1.2% in the quarter, without the benefit of the leap year day in 2016, they would have been up a little more than 2%.  These sales results bode well for our full year forecast increase of a little less than 1%. Our total year-to-year earnings improvement for the quarter was $0.12 a share again or 20%. As you can see, our progress for the rest of the year is strong.
Here's how the earnings per share forecast curve looks this year. I know many of you are familiar with this curve that projects our earnings per share growth for the full year, at any point during the year. We fully offset the adverse weather in the first quarter with excellent performance and look forward to strong results for the year.
We were able to accelerate some attractive financing and make use of higher energy efficiency incentives that are permitted under our new energy law. Sales mix also is a strong -- is stronger than expected. Other examples include continuing reductions in uncollectible accounts, in part, because customer bills will be lower after the mild winter, but, in part, because of the continuing strong Consumers Energy way process improvement.
Our 2017 performance is a continuation of what we've done over a long period of time. Our track record of earnings per share growth has been at 7% a year, year after year after year. And imagine during the last 4 years, we reinvested in O&M $0.3333 billion for our customers. Half of this was made possible by favorable weather, half by cost reductions, cost reductions much better than we originally had planned.
Here's the model that makes possible a consistent 7% earnings per share growth over the last decade and the next. With our extensive inventory of self-funded organic capital investment projects, abundant cost reduction opportunities and a diverse economy, you can see why this works, especially with continued focus on process improvements and cost reductions. This model can continue for many years to come.
Here is the customer-driven capital investment plan that's included in our model for next 10 years. We're investing $18 billion to improve performance with better service and better value for our customers.
Here's what it looks like with additional opportunities that could increase our capital investment to $21 billion. This includes enhanced gas infrastructure, grid modernization, replacement of PPAs, like our Palisades contract, and more renewables.
And here you can see that the opportunity could be as much as $7 billion, reaching $25 billion of capital investment over the next 10 years. This reflects our clean and lean strategy with more emphasis on renewables during the course of the next decade. The model is sustainable over many years and it's made possible by lean thinking and lean performance. As you can see, on the left of this slide, we've been bit of a little leader in this area and each year we come up with new and innovative ways to deliver those savings for our customers. For investors, this creates capital investment headroom. For customers, cost reductions have been and continue to be an important part of our self-funded model. There are lots of ups and downs, we include them all and deliver net savings.
We don't adjust for things that do seem out of our control. Over the last decade, we've been able to reduce our O&M costs by more than 3% a year. We've continued that over the last 3 years. We're projecting to continue this pace at about 2%, with our under-promise, over-deliver mentality, I'll leave the actual results a bit to your imagination.
That's O&M. We eliminate waste, whether it's O&M, capital investment or fuel. And we self-fund a portion of the investment with tax savings. Base rate increases stay low, and we grow cash flow resources to support a healthy necessary capital structure.
Over the last dozen years, our operating cash flow has been growing by more than $100 million each year. Since 2004, it's increased from $353 million to $2.1 billion last year. Over the next 5 years, operating cash flow will grow about $800 million to $2.9 billion. Our NOLs, bonus depreciation and AMT credits, among several tax planning tools, help us avoid the need for block equity. If tax reform occurs, we expect we'll still have time to use our NOLs, although at a lower rate. We also would expect to access our AMT credits early. With or without tax reform, we believe that we're in an excellent position to avoid the need for block equity to fund our planned investments for some time.
We do all of this to improve the lot of our customers. We've been reducing rates rapidly. Industrial rates were 26% above our Midwest peers, just a few years ago. We've reduced that by 20 points and plan to keep going. Our business electric customer satisfaction is up 22% since 2010, and we intend to improve that much, much more. Process improvements through the Consumers Energy way make it possible.
Beyond the utility, our enterprise business continues to grow. Potential upsides are shown here on this familiar slide. We are experiencing winning bids in the bilateral market for the 2018 planning year at around $4.25 per kilowatt month. A nice upside for our plan. It's not yet been determined how much of our capacity upside, if any, may be needed for the utility, either by contract or asset sales. This is part of the assessment being conducted with our commission over the next several months.
This is our sensitivity slide for the total company. We provide this update each quarter to assist you with assessing our prospects. You can see, with reasonable planning assumptions and with robust risk mitigation, the probability of large variances from our plant minimized. There are always ups and downs. Already this year, property taxes are lower than we expected, and we anticipate further opportunities at other locations. The opportunity for energy efficiencies incentives are doubled under our new energy law.
Being conservative, we've included half the increase in our forecast, with, as shown here, another $0.02 opportunity yet to be reflected.
The rating agencies appreciate our approach, as you can see here, both S&P and Fitch, who upgraded us last year, have stable outlooks on our credit rating. Moody's just upgraded our ratings another notch at CMS Energy and the utility.
So what makes this consistent improvement possible? We just stay focused on our business model. It is simple and perhaps it's a little unique, but we believe it provides a good opportunity to continue making improvements for our investors and our customers for the decade ahead.
Our organic capital investment has grown, driving our adjusted earnings per share growth to a bit better than 7% every year. Because we don't make any adjustments, our operating cash flow grows at the same pace. Another part of our model that might be a little unique is that we work hard to reduce our O&M cost every year, not to improve profits, but, rather, to self-fund a good portion of our capital investment for our customers. With base rate increases at or below the level of inflation, this is a model that provides customers with improvements for -- from investments without asking to raise their rates unreasonably. This makes the model sustainable for the decade ahead.
As you can see here, this model has been recognized by many of you, our investors, and it is our intention to continue our strong business performance in a manner that improves the lot of our customers every day. We believe this can result in adjusted earnings per share growth of 6% to 8% a year, a commensurate increase in our dividend and continued healthy performance of our stock.
Here's our latest report card for 2017 and beyond. We anticipate another great year, this year and for many years to come. With no big bets and robust risk mitigation, we believe our model serves our customers and you well. Few companies have been able to deliver top-end earnings growth, while improving value and service for customers every year, year after year after year. We are pleased to have another fast start to another outstanding performance in 2017 and expect the same for years to come. Our focus on world-class performance delivering hometown service, permits us to improve each and every year. We can and will continue this improvement. It's our passion for you and our customers.

So we are in the process right now that the Public Service Commission's conducting, which could have DIG, providing for some of the short-term sales and it could have DIG actually being purchased into the utility. But that will depend on all the competitive bids that are out there and it's a third-party process since it's an affiliate. So it's one that's been conducted by somebody else, not by us, and we'll be watching that with great interest. So what I would tell you is we're very prepared to have DIG outside the utility, because we see these opportunities that show in the yellow bar on Slide 23, where you can kind of figure out from what I said, we're approaching that $20 million upside, as it is, in the near couple of years. But we're also happy if it ends up inside the utility through this process, because if it does, it'll go in at a fair price that's, one, good for our customers, so it meets the needs of replacing the Palisades plant, saving them a lot of money, as we projected. But it will also be attractive to investors, because it would be at a profitable level and that's the level, of course, that would be bid into that process. So that gives you the framework. If it's in the utility or if it's outside the utility, it's really a nice opportunity for us."

We do have one in our gas case -- our gas structure today in our enhanced infrastructure replacement program. It's about a $75 million annual program to replace mains and distributions, and that is a -- has a true-up annually. We've been achieving it, and so we're getting a good track record.

But we are not putting into our full year forecast this uptick that we're seeing on residential and commercial. We're still going to show those as down. Now we may be wrong, but it's my theory in life, one quarter does not make a year, especially when you're looking at sales. I'd like to get another quarter under our belt to see what's really happening before we make any upside adjustments to that. So our full year forecast is still in that zone of something between 0.5% and 1%. I would make a note that I was surprised, somebody called us and asked us about the leap year day last year. And again, we don't really pay a lot of attention of those sort of things, but we checked it out and we said, ""Oh, yes.""

Without the tax credits, it's a closer call. So what we don't have factored into our thinking is, will the turbines get better? Will they be more efficient? Because remember a lot of these that we're talking about are something for years, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10. We're further out. We're a long ways out. So for some of those opportunities, we may see some technology improvements that eventually make that tax credit not needed. I cannot tell you that is in hand today at the capacity factors that we look at. Now there are some people with capacity factors down in the Oklahoma Panhandle and maybe up in Montana which are making that pretty close. So I'd say in our neck of the woods, we have some more work to do. And then I think, maybe, for the commission in the process that we would follow, I'll pass that over to Patti for a couple of comments."

One of the interesting things with renewables right now that we're observing is that our large industrial customers, particularly those that are brand facing, are very interested in us working with them to provide renewables. So for example, General Motors, our switch data centers, they've made public commitments to 100% renewables and they want those renewables to be additive. So our cross winds to expansion that were underway right now is going to be fulfilling the needs of switch for the data center that they built in Grand Rapids to provide the additive renewable generation to serve their load. And so we do think that there will be ratemaking that goes into the formula as well. And so it's an exciting time, and I do think our clean and lean strategy is well placed with the demands of customers, their desires, as well as the ability to replace our high-cost PPAs right now."

I'm sure there's going to be -- there are others who have questions about the MISO auction. And this is what we observe, that the low cost -- or the low price in that MISO auction tells us a couple of things. One, it says that MISO is predominantly regulated and so there was definitely a low-price bidding strategy. However, I think it also is fair to say that a 1-year forward auction is not a good telltale for generation planning and resource adequacy. Last year's Zone 7, as you all know, was at $72 a megawatt day and when we compare that, obviously, to this year's $150, we saw more energy efficiency and demand response. We'll be studying Zone 7 more in detail specifically. But what it tells us is that it's not a good planning tool. It can be a red flag. It can be a warning bell, but it's a warning bell that's too late. And so we're very grateful that we passed the energy law at the end of 2016. We really thought the FERC was going to approve the MISO 3-year auction and when they didn't, it was great that the energy law had gone into place because it provides the 3-year visibility, in fact, 4 years of visibility for both the utilities and the alternative energy suppliers for who is providing the load. And so the transparency, the forward-looking nature of the process that's been put in place by the commission is going to serve a much better forward-looking telltale than the MISO auction currently does."

We're just trying to reinforce that we really are serious about this generation replacement strategy. We're obviously deploying it currently on the PPA from Palisades. If we have any other short-term plant closings of our own fleet, we would also deploy it there as well. And so we're always looking but we want to make clear that there are future opportunities that just continue to strengthen this business model for the next decade.

Will it be more than where we are today or will it be less, as efficiency of motors and equipment and lighting, does it change our mix? And so what. This whole lean idea that we would build to match close -- more closely to demand, I think is different. And so I feel a need to continue to just kind of explain it and reinforce that the idea here, in the past, the traditionally utility model, you build a big generating plant and you grow into it. Your CapEx is tied up, your operation has a big project that they are tied up in and then you're waiting to grow into the full utilization of that asset. And in a mature industry like ours, the idea of having underutilized major capital investments feels counterintuitive to what we've seen in other industries. And so the idea that we would rightsize our assets to match the actual demand so that our capital is available to be deployed to other areas, since we have ample need for CapEx in another parts of our system, it really is the leanest way to both deploy capital and provide the generation match to demand."

Obviously, citing this volume of wind turbines, if we assume current technology, we're talking about 900 wind turbines, it would take new sites beyond what we have today, but here's the good news. First of all, in Michigan, we have -- I don't know if you've been in Northern Michigan, but there's a lot of land and there's a lot of areas.

It is my privilege to introduce Rejji Hayes, our new Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Joining us with a decade of experience in our industry at both Exelon and ITC, following his time at Lazard and Banc of America. Rejji is a great addition to the CMS Energy family.
Now, you know we take succession planning very seriously here. This news is just another example of how we prepare for orderly transitions of our management team. In fact, at my very first board meeting as CEO, I discussed my own potential successors. We require that our senior executives retire at the age of 65, and Tom is nearing that time. We are right on plan.
Tom has been named Vice Chairman and will work with Rejji and the rest of the management team for the next 6 months to assure a smooth transition. We still have lots of work for Tom to do, so don't be in too much of a hurry to say goodbye just yet. We have plenty of time for that between now and November. In fact, Tom, Rejji, and I will see many of you next week during our roadshow. Both Tom and I have confidence, and you should, too, that the team, now including Rejji, will continue to deliver the consistent financial results that you have come to expect.

I'll talk about our commitment to the triple bottom line of people, planet and profit, underpinned by world-class performance, enabled by our Consumers Energy way. Standby, because I will also share my story of the month, as always, and Tom will recover -- will cover our results and outlook.
We're off to a strong start for the year, in spite of a mild winter and several storms. We're up $0.12 over 2016 and, when we weather-normalize, that's up over 20% or $0.14. We're reaffirming our full year adjusted guidance for 2017 at 6% to 8% or $2.14 to $2.18.
We can sustainably and consistently deliver this performance by remaining true to our stand for people, planet and profit, underpinned by world-class performance. When we say people, we mean our customers, our communities, our coworkers and other critical stakeholders. And our commitment to the planet is demonstrated by our track record of going above and beyond environmental regulation to leave the planet better than we found it. We do not compromise profitability in these pursuits because we believe in the and around here. Our triple bottom line is made possible because we are squarely focused on world-class performance and it underpins everything we do.
Given the passage of the Energy Law at the end of 2016 and its implementation in flight, it's very helpful that Governor Snyder reinforced the stability and strength of our Michigan Public Service Commission by extending Chairman, Talberg's term to July 2021. This was enabled by swapping terms with Commissioner Saari. The Governor also reappointed Commissioner Eubanks to July of 2023.
The new law serves our customers very well and strengthens our regulatory construct in Michigan. We're working with the commission to implement several aspects, such as the new energy efficiency and waste reduction standard, the 10-month filing calendar, the 15% renewable portfolio standard and the new state reliability mechanism. In addition, we have active gas and electric rate cases as well as our Palisades early termination securitization filing. We've asked a lot of our commission and their staff. Their continuity and experience is a real advantage, and we're thankful to have such professionals in place.
We gauge our effectiveness with our customers through their feedback to us. We're proud of the improvements for both our residential and our business customers. Our customers are noticing that we're continuously improving their experience. Despite our progress, however, we are still dissatisfied. Our customer feedback scores put us very close to the best in our industry, but are still over 200 points, on a 1000-point scale, from perfect. We are in pursuit of world-class and won't be satisfied until we demonstrate excellence in every interaction with our customers and when they believe that we are, in fact, the very best.
One area where our customers and others are taking note is the transformation of our generation fleet. As you can see, we've made big progress in reducing our reliance on coal for both capacity and energy, by retiring more coal plants than any other investor-owned utility and investing in renewables as well as fully utilizing our low-cost gas plants. We call this our clean and lean approach. It seems to make sense for people that when we say clean, it reflects our commitment to the planet by replacing our coal plants with investments in renewable assets in gas plants. People do still ask us, however, what we mean when we say lean. Lean, the heart of Consumers Energy way, reflects the commitment to waste elimination and improving our performance at the same time, not just cost reduction for cost reduction's sake. For example, we could have built a brand-new oversize gas plant to replace our coal unit, but instead, we purchased a low-cost, underutilized gas plant. We are fully utilizing it now and running it really well. This saved our customers over $0.5 billion, allowed us to deploy our capital to an area of greater value and reduced our carbon footprint simultaneously. Like all things we tackle, we serve people, the planet and profit, no trade-offs.
Our MCV PPA expires in 2025, which may seem a ways off, but it's actually just around the corner from a generation and supply planning perspective. The replacement of that PPA will provide a great opportunity to deploy our clean and lean strategy and transition from an expensive PPA in this case to a single renewable capital investment -- a significant renewable capital investment in the $3 billion zone at a lower cost for customers and in a modular phase-in to match demand, a great example of clean and lean.
On March 8, we experienced one of the worst wind events in Michigan's history. Approximately 1 in 3 people in Michigan were affected, and it's times like these when our team is at its best. In fact, we had several utility executives, as well as our Governor, reach out to congratulate us on our performance and ask us how we did it. We're very proud of our team for their extraordinary performance.
Our customers don't hold us accountable for Mother Nature, but they do want to know what to expect during an outage. We are finding that they want to have frequent and accurate conversations with us during a major event. A shout-out to our customer service reps, who handled over 116,000 calls during the storm; our IT team, who supports our outage map, which took 355 hits per second on the first day of the storm; and our social media team, who answered every single posting personally, 24 hours a day on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. This is a new standard and capability for us. And that isn't even my story of the month.
Smart meters during storms is my story for this month. Smart meters are part of the answer to how our performance continues to improve during major events. During a separate event in April, our traditional tools told us that our Nashville-Vermontville circuit showed a full circuit lockout and 1,175 customers on that circuit were without power. Our ability to proactively ping those meters allowed for remote confirmation that only 178 of those customers were actually out of power. In the past, we would have run trucks for all those outages. Imagine the waste we eliminated by more surgically being able to determine the location of the interruptions. We would have wasted time and valuable resources needed in other areas of the restoration effort. We were able to accurately quantify that we reduced over 3,000 hours of customer interruption and over 50 truck rolls as a result of this one circuit and one storm, thanks to our smart meters.  We don't even have our meters fully deployed yet, that's scheduled to occur by year-end. The value of our investment in this cellular technology is just beginning to materialize. It's our favorite kind of capital investment, one that improves the customer experience at a lower operating cost and provides the real return to you, our investors.
We have a proven track record to deliver for you, in spite of the changes in the economy, storms, policymakers and company leadership. This just confirms we, in fact, have a CMS Energy way; continuously improving everything we do.
Take it away, Tom."
257682,428038364,1186557,"CMS Energy Corporation, Q1 2017 Earnings Call, May 01, 2017",2017-05-01,"Earnings Calls","CMS Energy Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Patti, and thank you again for joining us today, everyone. This is our 15th year of earnings calls with consistent adjusted earnings growth averaging more than 7% a year and, as usual, there are no surprises in our results.Our first quarter earn",1713,"Thanks, Patti, and thank you again for joining us today, everyone. This is our 15th year of earnings calls with consistent adjusted earnings growth averaging more than 7% a year and, as usual, there are no surprises in our results.
Our first quarter earnings are up $0.12 or 20%. While this includes another mild winter and record storm damage, we offset fully the challenges to deliver another strong quarter.  On a weather-normalized basis, 2017 earnings are up $0.14 or 20%.
You can see the favorable comparison of 2017 with 2016 first quarter results on this waterfall chart. Operations are performing well, our cost reductions are ahead of plan, and our enterprises and interbank businesses also are ahead of plan. By managing our work well, we offset the adverse weather and storm impact of $0.04 in the first quarter. The storm cost was $30 million, our insurance offset was $11 million. The O&M portion of the storm cost, net of the insurance, was $10 million or $0.02 a share. Cost savings of $0.08 included property tax savings of $0.03, coal plant retirement savings of $0.02, a variety of lean process improvements at $0.015 and stock-based compensation accounting benefits of another $0.015. While we early-adopted the new accounting standard in 2016-09 last year, we benefited another $6 million this quarter. This simply reflects shares added routinely as well as the higher price of our stock. Favorable rate increases net of associated capital investment helped another $0.02 and favorable utility sales combined with strong business performance at enterprises helped another $0.06. While our weather-normalized sales were up 1.2% in the quarter, without the benefit of the leap year day in 2016, they would have been up a little more than 2%.  These sales results bode well for our full year forecast increase of a little less than 1%. Our total year-to-year earnings improvement for the quarter was $0.12 a share again or 20%. As you can see, our progress for the rest of the year is strong.
Here's how the earnings per share forecast curve looks this year. I know many of you are familiar with this curve that projects our earnings per share growth for the full year, at any point during the year. We fully offset the adverse weather in the first quarter with excellent performance and look forward to strong results for the year.
We were able to accelerate some attractive financing and make use of higher energy efficiency incentives that are permitted under our new energy law. Sales mix also is a strong -- is stronger than expected. Other examples include continuing reductions in uncollectible accounts, in part, because customer bills will be lower after the mild winter, but, in part, because of the continuing strong Consumers Energy way process improvement.
Our 2017 performance is a continuation of what we've done over a long period of time. Our track record of earnings per share growth has been at 7% a year, year after year after year. And imagine during the last 4 years, we reinvested in O&M $0.3333 billion for our customers. Half of this was made possible by favorable weather, half by cost reductions, cost reductions much better than we originally had planned.
Here's the model that makes possible a consistent 7% earnings per share growth over the last decade and the next. With our extensive inventory of self-funded organic capital investment projects, abundant cost reduction opportunities and a diverse economy, you can see why this works, especially with continued focus on process improvements and cost reductions. This model can continue for many years to come.
Here is the customer-driven capital investment plan that's included in our model for next 10 years. We're investing $18 billion to improve performance with better service and better value for our customers.
Here's what it looks like with additional opportunities that could increase our capital investment to $21 billion. This includes enhanced gas infrastructure, grid modernization, replacement of PPAs, like our Palisades contract, and more renewables.
And here you can see that the opportunity could be as much as $7 billion, reaching $25 billion of capital investment over the next 10 years. This reflects our clean and lean strategy with more emphasis on renewables during the course of the next decade. The model is sustainable over many years and it's made possible by lean thinking and lean performance. As you can see, on the left of this slide, we've been bit of a little leader in this area and each year we come up with new and innovative ways to deliver those savings for our customers. For investors, this creates capital investment headroom. For customers, cost reductions have been and continue to be an important part of our self-funded model. There are lots of ups and downs, we include them all and deliver net savings.
We don't adjust for things that do seem out of our control. Over the last decade, we've been able to reduce our O&M costs by more than 3% a year. We've continued that over the last 3 years. We're projecting to continue this pace at about 2%, with our under-promise, over-deliver mentality, I'll leave the actual results a bit to your imagination.
That's O&M. We eliminate waste, whether it's O&M, capital investment or fuel. And we self-fund a portion of the investment with tax savings. Base rate increases stay low, and we grow cash flow resources to support a healthy necessary capital structure.
Over the last dozen years, our operating cash flow has been growing by more than $100 million each year. Since 2004, it's increased from $353 million to $2.1 billion last year. Over the next 5 years, operating cash flow will grow about $800 million to $2.9 billion. Our NOLs, bonus depreciation and AMT credits, among several tax planning tools, help us avoid the need for block equity. If tax reform occurs, we expect we'll still have time to use our NOLs, although at a lower rate. We also would expect to access our AMT credits early. With or without tax reform, we believe that we're in an excellent position to avoid the need for block equity to fund our planned investments for some time.
We do all of this to improve the lot of our customers. We've been reducing rates rapidly. Industrial rates were 26% above our Midwest peers, just a few years ago. We've reduced that by 20 points and plan to keep going. Our business electric customer satisfaction is up 22% since 2010, and we intend to improve that much, much more. Process improvements through the Consumers Energy way make it possible.
Beyond the utility, our enterprise business continues to grow. Potential upsides are shown here on this familiar slide. We are experiencing winning bids in the bilateral market for the 2018 planning year at around $4.25 per kilowatt month. A nice upside for our plan. It's not yet been determined how much of our capacity upside, if any, may be needed for the utility, either by contract or asset sales. This is part of the assessment being conducted with our commission over the next several months.
This is our sensitivity slide for the total company. We provide this update each quarter to assist you with assessing our prospects. You can see, with reasonable planning assumptions and with robust risk mitigation, the probability of large variances from our plant minimized. There are always ups and downs. Already this year, property taxes are lower than we expected, and we anticipate further opportunities at other locations. The opportunity for energy efficiencies incentives are doubled under our new energy law.
Being conservative, we've included half the increase in our forecast, with, as shown here, another $0.02 opportunity yet to be reflected.
The rating agencies appreciate our approach, as you can see here, both S&P and Fitch, who upgraded us last year, have stable outlooks on our credit rating. Moody's just upgraded our ratings another notch at CMS Energy and the utility.
So what makes this consistent improvement possible? We just stay focused on our business model. It is simple and perhaps it's a little unique, but we believe it provides a good opportunity to continue making improvements for our investors and our customers for the decade ahead.
Our organic capital investment has grown, driving our adjusted earnings per share growth to a bit better than 7% every year. Because we don't make any adjustments, our operating cash flow grows at the same pace. Another part of our model that might be a little unique is that we work hard to reduce our O&M cost every year, not to improve profits, but, rather, to self-fund a good portion of our capital investment for our customers. With base rate increases at or below the level of inflation, this is a model that provides customers with improvements for -- from investments without asking to raise their rates unreasonably. This makes the model sustainable for the decade ahead.
As you can see here, this model has been recognized by many of you, our investors, and it is our intention to continue our strong business performance in a manner that improves the lot of our customers every day. We believe this can result in adjusted earnings per share growth of 6% to 8% a year, a commensurate increase in our dividend and continued healthy performance of our stock.
Here's our latest report card for 2017 and beyond. We anticipate another great year, this year and for many years to come. With no big bets and robust risk mitigation, we believe our model serves our customers and you well. Few companies have been able to deliver top-end earnings growth, while improving value and service for customers every year, year after year after year. We are pleased to have another fast start to another outstanding performance in 2017 and expect the same for years to come. Our focus on world-class performance delivering hometown service, permits us to improve each and every year. We can and will continue this improvement. It's our passion for you and our customers.

So we are in the process right now that the Public Service Commission's conducting, which could have DIG, providing for some of the short-term sales and it could have DIG actually being purchased into the utility. But that will depend on all the competitive bids that are out there and it's a third-party process since it's an affiliate. So it's one that's been conducted by somebody else, not by us, and we'll be watching that with great interest. So what I would tell you is we're very prepared to have DIG outside the utility, because we see these opportunities that show in the yellow bar on Slide 23, where you can kind of figure out from what I said, we're approaching that $20 million upside, as it is, in the near couple of years. But we're also happy if it ends up inside the utility through this process, because if it does, it'll go in at a fair price that's, one, good for our customers, so it meets the needs of replacing the Palisades plant, saving them a lot of money, as we projected. But it will also be attractive to investors, because it would be at a profitable level and that's the level, of course, that would be bid into that process. So that gives you the framework. If it's in the utility or if it's outside the utility, it's really a nice opportunity for us."

We see these PPAs coming off that enable the CapEx without putting pressure on the affordability. In fact, it saves customer money. So for example, our PPA with Palisades, we're going to save customers about $45 million a year, even after we replaced that PPA with new generating assets, so when we look at building out the plan, we see that as the headroom creation that's required to be able to bump up the CapEx."

And it also protects us from the need for having our rates go up very fast for our customers. That's part of the and on what we're doing. So I would say where we are is in great shape. Now if we were to add $7 billion and it didn't have offsets, that would be a different story and that can always happen, where, I would assume, we'd have a really good project to show you and it would make good sense and you'd want to make the incremental investment, so the block equity would make sense.

So I would suggest that there's interest in looking at longer-term CapEx planning as it rewards customers. And so I would think that as we work with the commission further on having better visibility to multi-year plans, it makes it a lot easier for a commission to agree to a multi-year investment recovery mechanism. We do have one in our gas case -- our gas structure today in our enhanced infrastructure replacement program. It's about a $75 million annual program to replace mains and distributions, and that is a -- has a true-up annually. We've been achieving it, and so we're getting a good track record.

But we are not putting into our full year forecast this uptick that we're seeing on residential and commercial. We're still going to show those as down. Now we may be wrong, but it's my theory in life, one quarter does not make a year, especially when you're looking at sales. I'd like to get another quarter under our belt to see what's really happening before we make any upside adjustments to that. So our full year forecast is still in that zone of something between 0.5% and 1%. I would make a note that I was surprised, somebody called us and asked us about the leap year day last year. And again, we don't really pay a lot of attention of those sort of things, but we checked it out and we said, ""Oh, yes."" So the uptick that we saw in the first quarter, 1.2%, if you adjust out the leap year from last year, the day, it's 2.3%. But I would caution everybody, please don't get too excited about the sales.

So for some of those opportunities, we may see some technology improvements that eventually make that tax credit not needed. I cannot tell you that is in hand today at the capacity factors that we look at.

One of the interesting things with renewables right now that we're observing is that our large industrial customers, particularly those that are brand facing, are very interested in us working with them to provide renewables. So for example, General Motors, our switch data centers, they've made public commitments to 100% renewables and they want those renewables to be additive. So our cross winds to expansion that were underway right now is going to be fulfilling the needs of switch for the data center that they built in Grand Rapids to provide the additive renewable generation to serve their load. And so we do think that there will be ratemaking that goes into the formula as well. And so it's an exciting time, and I do think our clean and lean strategy is well placed with the demands of customers, their desires, as well as the ability to replace our high-cost PPAs right now."

I'm sure there's going to be -- there are others who have questions about the MISO auction. And this is what we observe, that the low cost -- or the low price in that MISO auction tells us a couple of things. One, it says that MISO is predominantly regulated and so there was definitely a low-price bidding strategy. However, I think it also is fair to say that a 1-year forward auction is not a good telltale for generation planning and resource adequacy. Last year's Zone 7, as you all know, was at $72 a megawatt day and when we compare that, obviously, to this year's $150, we saw more energy efficiency and demand response. We'll be studying Zone 7 more in detail specifically. But what it tells us is that it's not a good planning tool. It can be a red flag. It can be a warning bell, but it's a warning bell that's too late. And so we're very grateful that we passed the energy law at the end of 2016. We really thought the FERC was going to approve the MISO 3-year auction and when they didn't, it was great that the energy law had gone into place because it provides the 3-year visibility, in fact, 4 years of visibility for both the utilities and the alternative energy suppliers for who is providing the load. And so the transparency, the forward-looking nature of the process that's been put in place by the commission is going to serve a much better forward-looking telltale than the MISO auction currently does."

This whole lean idea that we would build to match close -- more closely to demand, I think is different. And so I feel a need to continue to just kind of explain it and reinforce that the idea here, in the past, the traditionally utility model, you build a big generating plant and you grow into it. Your CapEx is tied up, your operation has a big project that they are tied up in and then you're waiting to grow into the full utilization of that asset. And in a mature industry like ours, the idea of having underutilized major capital investments feels counterintuitive to what we've seen in other industries. And so the idea that we would rightsize our assets to match the actual demand so that our capital is available to be deployed to other areas, since we have ample need for CapEx in another parts of our system, it really is the leanest way to both deploy capital and provide the generation match to demand."

And so we think that potentially that would be some transitions from our current regulatory model. I could imagine pricing changes in rate design versus a per unit-based pricing, maybe there's a different way to do pricing in this business. So when you're asking me long term, 10 years out, that's what I'm looking at. Short term, we've got a strong regulatory construct in Michigan. We've got a great law that was passed in December. We're in the process of implementing it. As I mentioned in the call, there's a lot of work on the commission's plate. And so frankly, just implementing the current law is going to keep us busy for a good several years. But we are looking long term. And I think that's one of the strengths of this commission that they are long-term thinkers and the extension of their terms enables them to think long term. And that's exciting, and I think it is a big strength for us here in Michigan."

So we see O&M reducing, enabled by CapEx, but we also see some fuel cost reductions and PSCR and GCR reductions that enable affordability for customers.

Thanks for joining the call. It's great to be with you this morning. I'll be sharing our first half results and then operational update and then Rejji will give the details of our first half financial performance and our outlook. 
Our stand for people, planet and profit will be reflected in our presentation today. And frankly, it's what we work on everyday. Our ability to commit to all 3 is enabled by our performance, which were continuously improving through the CE way. I look forward to sharing our latest updates and not to worry, I've a got great story to announce for you. 
We are happy to report, in spite of record breaking storms in our service territory and mild weather in the first half of the year, we're up 7% on a weather normalized basis. And perhaps more importantly, we're ahead our plan by $0.04 year-to-date. And therefore, we are affirming our year-end adjusted EPS guidance of 6% to 8%, or $2.14 to $2.18. As you come to expect, our delivery of profit takes a form of a consistent 7% growth over the past 14 years, no matter the conditions we faced. Because of our confident about that continued consistent performance, we continue to reaffirm a range of 6% to 8% EPS growth for this year and many years to come. 
In tough external conditions, consistent top and financial performance only comes through extraordinary efforts of extraordinary people, one of the cornerstones of our triple bottom line. Now we've been best-in-class in employee engagement for several years, but we must confess, we were thrilled to be named the #1 employer in Michigan in the annual Forbes Best Large Employer survey in May. And it's no coincidence that the customers served by this engaged team has named us the most trusted brand through a survey conducted by Market Strategy International. 
As a result of the Energy Law passing in December, our regulatory calendar is full and active. We recognized and appreciate our MPSC staff and commissioners for all their hard work. The Energy Law implementation is going well and is on track. The MPSC Chairman, [ Sally ] has done a great job of organizing the working groups and leading a very systematic process to implement this high-value legislation. 
The state reliability mechanism is being evaluated and designed as we speak. It's scheduled for a final determination in December with a June 2018 implementation. Our energy efficiency team is ramping up the new 1.5% electric and 1% gas energy efficiency targets enabling the new incentive the mechanism to go into place. And simultaneously, we have a gas rate case that's scheduled for a final order this coming Monday and our electric rate case will be self-implemented in October. 
Finally, our Palisades early termination securitization is scheduled for a final order at the end of September. So this proceeding has no impact on our earnings, and it is not baked into our plan. We do believe that this early termination is in the best interest of Michigan. We don't have too many opportunities to save our customers $45 million a year, so we would love to pass this along to them. 
We also believe that the early termination out of market PPA enables the Governor's energy agenda through the elimination of energy waste and improving energy affordability in Michigan while not jeopardizing reliability as a result of our replacement plan, which serves both people and the planet. 
Our promise to improve the planet is coming to fruition at a rapid rate. The closure of our 7 coal plants in 2016 moved us from 49% coal generation to 22%, more coal retired than any other investor-owned utility in the nation. Our actions resulted in a reduction in carbon intensity of 30% and ranking us as the #1 U.S. utility by sustained analytics, and we aren't in finished. Our clean and lean strategy enables further coal reductions without big bets to achieve the replacement. Fulfilling the RPS standard and providing for large business customer preferences for renewables, creates the perfect condition to modernize our generation fleet in a cost-efficient, low-risk way. 
Now when we talk about our commitment to the planet, we're talking about reducing our environmental impact including reductions in water, land use, emissions and carbon. We self-imposed improvement targets that go beyond environmental compliance and we're ahead of our plan in all of these areas. There was a time when this would have implied higher cost for customers but not at CMS. We find a way to deliver the end in clean and lean. Lean has many descriptions and attributes, one of which is the concept of waste and waste elimination. An example of waste in our business is the underutilization of assets. Traditionally, generation planters forecast load growth, build a plant big enough to serve that growth and add additional spending reserves. We see modular additions of renewables as a more flexible way to provide adequate supply resources with smaller bets and less potential waste. Modular renewable are a great choice for us because we have ample capital opportunities outside of generation. We have more upgrades than our customers can afford across the entire business. So we're always making choices that maximize customer benefits, while at the same time, reducing cost so we can deliver more customer value for every dollar invested. 
Our customers will benefit from investments in our backlog of upgrades on our grid and on our gas system and our investors can rely on a sustainable growth strategy. In addition to our own vision for clean and lean generation fleet, the new Michigan Energy Law requires, and our customers are asking, for more renewable energy. We're expanding our Cross Winds to wind parks to grow toward a 15% RPS standard. We conducted an RFP and we were the most competitively priced bidder, therefore we're bidding that expansion ourselves. 
In addition to our renewable expansions, we work closely with some of our largest and most energy conscious customers to develop a pricing package that both meets their desired price points and their commitment to the planet. We recently requested approval of this pricing option with the MPSC. This pricing design can enable real traction to our service territory and serve as an important part of our economic development strategy to grow Michigan. 
Our residential customers don't want to be left out of the mix. To serve them, we've launched our solar gardens, a utility scale community solar program and the pilot to operate rooftop solar package for residential and small commercial customers. These are clean alternatives delivered with a lean mindset. 
Our lean mindset carries over to all of our investments. For example, the deployment of our smart meter technology have improved our meter reading accuracy and rate, but we did not just rely on technology deployment. We simultaneously improved the work process through applying our CE waste skill. In fact, the remaining meters to be read for our gas-only customers and customers that have opted out of smart meters can be very inefficient to read but for our reading teams improvement efforts. And the results are frankly stunning. We've improved the reader rates to 99% and improved reads per hour by 45% year-over-year, which contributed to ancillary benefits such as 64% reduction in invoice rework and a reduction of 2 million calls to our call center. The net impact, over $8 million of savings since 2015 while at the same time, improving the customer experience through more accurate billing and virtually, eliminating estimated meter reads. 
We use these cost savings to offset the capital investment and infrastructure, which delivers the value our customers deserve and helps keep rates affordable. This is a great example of our business model put into action. And it's not even my story the month. 
My story of the month is about a fueling pilot in our Flint service center. We have a vision of our blue and whites falling out of our 43 service centers all across Michigan every morning after Q quick safety briefing in a daily huddle ready to serve. One thing that slows down our crews today is the time they spent gathering materials, equipment, filling the vehicles, but this is changing. We started a pilot implant where lower cost night shifts has been established to pre-fuel the vehicles and have them prepped and ready to go before the crews arrive in the morning. In Flint alone, this is saving 15 to 30 minutes per person daily. When we extrapolate this to a statewide implementation, the savings potential growth through elimination of over 100,000 hours of wasted time per year. We can replace those wasted hours with time for our crews to do the value-adding work that our customers need. 
I'm reminded every time we are implementing one of these seemingly simple improvements that we're just strip scratching the surface of our full potential. You can definitely put this story in a low-hanging fruit category. It's what gives us the confidence that we have lots more cost-savings opportunity that deliver a better customer experience. 
Our commitment to the triple bottom line powered by performance in the CE way is why we are so sure that we can continue to improve the experience for our customers and sustain the performance you've come to expect. This model's been working for more than a decade and in spite of many changes that are outside of our control, come what may, the CMS team will deliver for our customers and our investors. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Rejji."

As we have highlighted in the past, we deeply appreciate your interest in our company. We view the investment community as a key element of the people aspect of the triple bottom line alongside customers, employees and everyone we serve. 
Our second quarter results of $0.33 per share, down $0.12 from last year, largely due to continued mild winter and record storm activity on our service territory. Put the level of storms into context, year-to-date, we've had 5 official major event days  in 2017 compared to 3 for all of 2016, which led to approximately $31 million in service restoration cost to the second quarter, which more than $10 million above our 5-year average at this time of the year and roughly double the amount spent in the first half of 2016. With that in mind, we don't make excuses and already have taken steps to mitigate the unfavorable weather impacts. 
For the first half of the year, adjusted earnings of $1.04 per share were flat from last year and up $0.08 or 7% on a weather normalized basis, which positions us well to meet our annual financial objective. As Patti mentioned, we are quite pleased with our performance to date and remain $0.04 ahead of plan even with the unfavorable weather and record storm activity in the first half of the year. 
As indicated in the waterfall chart, we have managed to offset $0.11 of mild weather and record storms fully in the first half of the year with cost savings, outperformance in enterprises and rate relief net of revenue investments, among other factors. Our business model, which focuses on achieving cost savings, coupled with modest sales and other countermeasures to minimize customer rate inflation has enabled us to end the first half of 2017 ahead of plan, which bodes well for the remainder of the year. 
For the second half of 2017, we have assumed $0.07 of additional rate relief, net of investments and as always, we're implementing numerous cost control measures. Lastly, we will also benefit from the absence of discretionary activities, which occurred in the second half of 2016 such as our debt refunding and relatively high volume of donations to some of which equates to $0.14 of potential EPS pickup in the back half of this year. In summary, we believe these factors provide us with significant flexibility through the rest of the year. As such, we remain highly confident in our ability to deliver 6% to 8% adjusted EPS growth in 2017. 
I know you're all well acquainted with this EPS forecast curve, which illustrates our progress on meeting our targets -- in meeting our earnings targets as we move through the year. This year, we started out with mild weather and significant storm activity but took actions to remain ahead of plan in the first half of the year. This chart also overlays the curve from 2016. As highlighted, we enjoyed favorable weather and great cost performance in the second half of 2016 which permitted substantial reinvestment back in the business in the fourth quarter. This, as you can imagine, makes a comparison a bit easier for 2017 to a right in course for another solid, predictable year in 2017. 
The EPS curves for the past decade remind us that the every year is different but the results are the same. We delivered consistent, industry-leading EPS growth by managing the business on behalf of customers and investors. During periods of better-than-expected weather and cost performance, we have reinvested in the business, as evidenced by the $340 million in aggregate that we put to work over the past 4 years to achieve customer improvements. Conversely, during periods of unfavorable weather, or other unexpected negative variances, we have made a difference through cost savings and good business decisions without compromising our commitments to our customers and employees. Irrespective of the circumstances, we've managed to deliver within our earnings guidance annually and this year will be no different. 
Having spent a good deal of the past 3 months with the investment community, many have asked how CMS has achieved, and will continue to achieve, consistent industry-leading earnings growth without raising customer rates above inflation year in and year out. Admittedly, even I asked discussion when I was on the outside looking in. Well, the answer is that we have a robust capital plan of needed customer investments, largely funded by annual cost savings of 2% to 3% a year; modest utility sales growth; and other enhancements such as thoughtful tax planning, which eliminates the need for dilutive block equity issuance worth about 2%. All of this equates to a self-funding roughly 70% of our capital plan, which minimizes customer rate impacts to level at/or below inflation, while our growth continues its 6% to 8%. This simple but unique business model has driven our historical success and offers a sustainable path forward to benefit our customers' investments. 
Our customer-driven capital plan is comprised of needed investments, which will enable the delivery of safe, reliable and efficient electricity and natural gas to those we serve. We had forecast a base case of approximately $18 billion capital investments over the next 10 years and alignment with our clean and lean strategy, which Patti highlighted earlier. As we've noted in the past, we anticipate additional opportunities of approximately $7 billion in a form of enhanced gas infrastructure, grid monetization and cost-efficient PPA replacement through renewables and other sources. As always, affordability from a customer and balance sheet perspective, commission alignment and execution capabilities will dictate the pace at which we take on such opportunities. 
As to the latter point around execution risk, this slide illustrates our confidence in our ability to execute on our 10-year plan. As highlighted, over 90% of our 10-year capital plan of $18 billion is represented by projects less than $200 million in size, which compares favorably to our capital plan composition over the past 10 years. Broadly speaking, project size offers directional guidance as to the complexity and duration of projects. As such, our capital plan is not only increasing in size but is decreasing in terms of risk profile, which bodes well for customers and investors. Our capital plan embodies the modular nature of the clean and lean strategy and perpetuates our no big bets investment philosophy.
A key driver of our ability to execute on our capital plan in an affordable manner is made possible by lean thinking and performance, which drives sustainable cost savings. As you can see on the left-hand side of this slide, CMS has been a leader in this area and our employees have embraced the CE way to continue to come up with new and innovative ways to deliver those savings to our customers. For investors, this creates capital investment headroom and fulfills our self-imposed commitment to keep base rate increases at/or below inflation. Over the last decade, we have been able to reduce our OEM cost by more than 3% per year and the past 3 years were not exception. We're projecting conservatively to continue at this pace about 2% over the next 3 years without compromising our commitments to customers in the form of service upgrades and while keeping employee salaries and benefits competitive, 2 key constituents and the people element of the triple bottom line. 
Our capital investment strategy and support of regulatory outcomes, coupled with annual cost savings and tax planning, have enabled us to grow our operating cash flow by about $100 million annually. In fact, we've increased our opening cash flow by $1.8 billion in aggregate since 2004. Our path in perspective cash flow generation has and will continue to eliminate the need for dilutive block equity issuance going forward, which further supports the self-funding strategy. For reference, as of June 30, 2017, we've generated over $1.1 billion of operating cash flow, which is slightly ahead of plan and the corresponding period in 2016. 
Switching gears to sales. The economic outlook for our service territory, particularly in Grand Rapids, the largest city in our service territory and in the heart of our footprint, remains relatively strong as indicated on this slide. As stated in the past, we don't rely heavily on sales growth, as evidenced by our forecast of 0.5% to 1% for 2017 but we continue to be encouraged by the increased expansion and diversification of our service territory. We continue to work closely with the Governor's office, the legislative branch and key regulators to bring business to Michigan because we win when Michigan wins. 
Moving on to enterprises. They continues to drive in the performance of this business unit. Enterprises was ahead of both the plan and the corresponding period in 2016 due to operational efficiencies attributable to upgrades completed in 2015 and higher capacity prices. As you'll note on the bottom of this slide, capacity remains open in future years to take further advantage of attractive pricing. As Patti noted, we'll have more visibility on the Palisades result by the end of September, which will dictate our longer-term plans for DIG and as stated in the past, we remain cautiously optimistic as to the outcome of the Palisades preceding, but have to factored that pending decision into our plan. 
As it refers to back half of 2017, we continue to evaluate potential risk and corresponding mitigating factors to minimize volatility in our plan as evidenced by our sensitivity slide. A noteworthy opportunity includes: Energy efficiency incentives, which were doubled under our new Energy Law, but we have only counted for half of the increase in our financial planning with another $0.02 of potential upside yet to be reflected. 
In closing, the last slide provides a reminder of our financial objectives for 2017, all of which are well on track. Needless to say, we remain acutely focused on delivering another year of consistent industry-leading growth with minimal rate impacts to the benefit of customers, investors. 
At this point, Brandon, please open up the lines for questions."

But I would say I've been pleasantly surprised on the inside now at how well the company has managed to not only execute on its capital plan, which, as you know, is quite robust as well as risk mitigated but also to realize significant savings year in and year out. And so you're familiar with that slide where we show our benchmark relative to the sector, and that's real achievement of O&M cost reductions of 3% per year over the last 10 years. And if you look at the next 3 years going forward, we think that there's significant opportunities to realize additional O&M cost reductions. And we've talked about this in the past but candidly, I would submit that a lot of the cost savings realized in the past are really through sheer will and just a lot of good discipline. But through the CE way, we think we can offer much greater level of sophistication and realizing cost savings in a scalable and replicable way and so we think a combination of process oriented related savings as well as technology-enabled savings through smart meters and other measures should continue to lead us down this path of consistent cost reductions in years to come. So I've seen a lot of opportunities within these walls, and if you look at some of the other metrics that Patti highlights in our stories of the month, there's a lot of low-hanging fruit here, and so that's what encouraged me that this path we've been on for so long is sustainable in the long run."

Next couple of months, we expect to hear the result of that tariff approval. What we like about it and what we think is particularly unique is that it is -- does not have a cross cost shift. It really provides the access for our large business customers to have access to renewable energy, they remain a full bundled customer but then they're able -- they have a couple options. They can either bring their own PPA, which we're agnostics too, or we will provide the renewables for them and they can then sell that in MISO and if prices go up, then they get upside because we signed a fixed contract with them. So that's very appealing to them. What's appealing to us is they remain full bundled customers and we're able to provide the energy in the form that they prefer. So what we've heard from our large business customers is -- I mean, a direct quote from one of them was, this is the first time a utility has figured this out. This is exactly what we need and it makes Michigan very attractive. So we're optimistic that the commission will approve the tariff, especially since it doesn't have any kind of cost shift to others."

Well the reason why we feel confident in our ability to close this gap is that we have all the activities that we put in place, which are really discretionary in the second half of 2016, which we don't need to replicate in this year as we think about closing this gap. And so the only specificity we have as it pertains to the cost savings is other is this math here that closes the gap between the discretionary items that we won't have to replicated again, in 2017 and then this cost savings in other line item, that gets to the $0.12 to $0.16. But we believe that we can realize cost savings beyond that. So just to be clear, that number is effectively just a plug here for illustrative purposes, but we believe we can realize more cost savings over the course of the second half of the year. We're already seeing that in the form of customer operations. Patti highlighted a lot of good achievements [indiscernible] and we think there are much more cost beyond what's just on this page.

What remains to be seen is how much of that upside we can realize in this year because as you may know, the new Energy Law came into effect in April of this year and so there's only a question about whether that should be prorated earnings or should it be the full year. If it's full year, it could be worth $0.02. If it's prorated portion, it could be $0.01. And so that's the only concern we have at this point but we, looking at our historical track record, are highly confident we can execute on realizing those customer savings then realizing the benefits associated there with."

And so as we think about what may allow us to pull those levers, it really is the historical constraints, and that's customer affordability and/or the need to fund that in a efficient way in our balance sheet. And so as the signpost we'd need to see is how economic this will become over time, what cost savings are we able to realize to self-fund the business and again, permit us to fund or execute on the capital plan of that magnitude. And again, if the economic associated with renewables or other potential alternative means to replace that MCV PPA come into effect.

Thanks for joining the call. It's great to be with you this morning. I'll be sharing our first half results and an operational update, and then Rejji will give the details of our first half financial performance and our outlook. 
Our stand for people, planet and profit will be reflected in our presentation today. And frankly, it's what we work on every day. Our ability to commit to all 3 is enabled by our performance, which we're continuously improving through the CE Way. I look forward to sharing our latest updates, and not to worry, I've got a great story of the month for you. 
We are happy to report, in spite of record-breaking storms in our service territory and mild weather in the first half of the year, we're up 7% on a weather-normalized basis, and perhaps more importantly, we're ahead our plan by $0.04 year-to-date. And therefore, we are affirming our year-end adjusted EPS guidance of 6% to 8% or $2.14 to $2.18. As you've come to expect, our delivery of profits takes the form of a consistent 7% growth over the past 14 years, no matter the conditions we've faced. Because we're confident about that continued consistent performance, we continue to reaffirm a range of 6% to 8% EPS growth for this year and many years to come. 
In tough external conditions, consistent top-end financial performance only comes through extraordinary efforts of extraordinary people, one of the cornerstones of our triple bottom line. Now we've been best-in-class in employee engagement for several years, but we must confess, we were thrilled to be named the #1 employer in Michigan in the annual Forbes' Best Large Employers survey in May. And it's no coincidence that the customers served by this engaged team have named us the most trusted brand through a survey conducted by Market Strategies International. 
As a result of the energy law passing in December, our regulatory calendar is full and active. We recognized and appreciate our MPSC staff and commissioners for all their hard work. The energy law implementation is going well and is on track. The MPSC Chairman, Sally Talberg, has done a great job of organizing the working groups and leading a very systematic process to implement this high-value legislation. 
The state reliability mechanism is being evaluated and designed as we speak. It's scheduled for a final determination in December with a June 2018 implementation. Our energy efficiency team is ramping up the new 1.5% electric and 1% gas energy efficiency targets, enabling the new incentive mechanism to go into place. And simultaneously, we have a gas rate case that's scheduled for a final order this coming Monday, and our electric rate case will be self-implemented in October. 
Finally, our Palisades early termination securitization is scheduled for a final order at the end of September. Though this proceeding has no impact on our earnings and it is not baked into our plan, we do believe that this early termination is in the best interest of Michigan. We don't have too many opportunities to save our customers $45 million a year, so we would love to pass this along to them. 
We also believe that the early termination of this out-of-market PPA enables the governor's energy agenda through the elimination of energy waste and improving energy affordability in Michigan while not jeopardizing reliability as a result of our replacement plan, which serves both people and the planet. 
Our promise to improve the planet is coming to fruition at a rapid rate. The closure of our 7 coal plants in 2016 moved us from 49% coal generation to 22%, more coal retired than any other investor-owned utility in the nation. Our actions resulted in a reduction in carbon intensity of 30% and ranking us as the #1 U.S. utility by Sustainalytics. And we aren't finished. Our clean and lean strategy enables further coal reductions without big bets to achieve the replacement. Fulfilling the RPS standard and providing for large business customer preferences for renewables, creates the perfect condition to modernize our generation fleet in a cost-efficient, low-risk way. 
Now when we talk about our commitment to the planet, we're talking about reducing our environmental impact, including reductions in water, land use, emissions and carbon. We've self-imposed improvement targets that go beyond environmental compliance, and we're ahead of our plan in all of these areas. There was a time when this would have implied higher costs for customers, but not at CMS. We find a way to deliver the and in clean and lean. Lean has many descriptors and attributes, one of which is the concept of waste and waste elimination. 
An example of waste in our business is the underutilization of assets. Traditionally, generation planners forecast load growth, build a plant big enough to serve that growth and add additional spending reserves. We see modular additions of renewables as a more flexible way to provide adequate supply resources, with smaller bets and less potential waste. Modular renewables are a great choice for us because we have ample capital opportunities outside of generation. We have more upgrades than our customers can afford across the entire business. So we're always making choices that maximize customer benefits while, at the same time, reducing cost so we can deliver more customer value for every dollar invested. Our customers will benefit from investments in our backlog of upgrades on our grid and on our gas systems, and our investors can rely on a sustainable growth strategy. 
In addition to our own vision for clean and lean generation fleet, the new Michigan energy law requires, and our customers are asking, for more renewable energy. We're expanding our Cross Winds to -- wind park to grow toward our 15% RPS standard. We conducted an RFP, and we were the most competitively priced bidder. Therefore, we're building that expansion ourselves. 
In addition to our renewable expansions, we worked closely with some of our largest and most energy-conscious customers to develop a pricing package that both meets their desired price points and their commitment to the planet. We recently requested approval of this pricing option with the MPSC. This pricing design can enable real traction to our service territory and serve as an important part of our economic development strategy to grow Michigan. 
Our residential customers don't want to be left out of the mix. To serve them, we've launched our Solar Gardens, a utility-scale community solar program and a pilot to operate rooftop solar package for residential and small commercial customers. These are clean alternatives delivered with a lean mindset. 
Our lean mindset carries over to all of our investments. For example, the deployment of our smart meter technology has improved our meter reading accuracy and rate, but we did not just rely on technology deployment. We've simultaneously improved the work process through applying our CE Way skills. In fact, the remaining meters to be read for our gas-only customers and customers that have opted out of smart meters can be very inefficient to read but for our meter reading teams' improvement efforts. And the results are, frankly, stunning. We've improved the read rate to 99% and improved reads per hour by 45% year-over-year, which contributed to ancillary benefits, such as 64% reduction in invoice rework and a reduction of 2 million calls to our call center. The net impact, over $8 million of savings since 2015 while, at the same time, improving the customer experience through more accurate billing and virtually eliminating estimated meter reads. 
We use these cost savings to offset the capital investment in infrastructure, which delivers the value our customers deserve and helps keep rates affordable. This is a great example of our business model put into action. And it's not even my story of the month. 
My story of the month is about a fueling pilot in our Flint service center. We have a vision of our blue and whites falling out of our 43 service centers all across Michigan every morning after a quick safety briefing and a daily huddle, ready to serve. One thing that slows down our crews today is the time they spend gathering materials, equipment, fueling their vehicles, but this is changing. We started a [ pilot in plant ] where a lower-cost night shift has been established to pre-fuel the vehicles and have them prepped and ready to go before the crews arrive in the morning. In Flint alone, this is saving 15 to 30 minutes per person daily. When we extrapolate this to a statewide implementation, the savings potential grows to an elimination of over 100,000 hours of wasted time per year. We can replace those wasted hours with time for our crews to do the value-adding work that our customers need. 
I'm reminded every time we are implementing one of these seemingly simple improvements that we're just scratching the surface of our full potential. You can definitely put this story in the low-hanging fruit category. It's what gives us the confidence that we have lots more cost-savings opportunities that deliver a better customer experience. 
Our commitment to the triple bottom line, powered by performance and the CE Way, is why we are so sure that we can continue to improve the experience for our customers and sustain the performance you've come to expect. This model's been working for more than a decade. And in spite of many changes that are outside of our control, come what may, the CMS team will deliver for our customers and our investors. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Rejji."

As we have highlighted in the past, we deeply appreciate your interest in our company. We view the investment community as a key element of the people aspect of the triple bottom line, alongside customers, employees and everyone we serve. 
Our second quarter results of $0.33 per share are down $0.12 from last year, largely due to continued mild winter and record storm activity in our service territory. Put the level of storms into context, year-to-date, we have had 5 official major event days in 2017 compared to 3 for all of 2016, which led to approximately $31 million in service restoration costs through the second quarter, which is more than $10 million above our 5-year average at this time of the year and roughly double the amount spent in the first half of 2016. With that in mind, we don't make excuses and already have taken steps to mitigate the unfavorable weather impacts. 
For the first half of the year, adjusted earnings of $1.04 per share were flat from last year and up $0.08 or 7% on a weather-normalized basis, which positions us well to meet our annual financial objectives. As Patti mentioned, we are quite pleased with our performance to date and remain $0.04 ahead of plan even with the unfavorable weather and record storm activity in the first half of the year. 
As indicated in the waterfall chart, we have managed to offset $0.11 of mild weather and record storms fully in the first half of the year with cost savings, outperformance at enterprises and rate relief net of investments, among other factors. Our business model, which focuses on achieving cost savings, coupled with modest sales and other countermeasures to minimize customer rate inflation, has enabled us to end the first half of 2017 ahead of plan, which bodes well for the remainder of the year. 
For the second half of 2017, we have assumed $0.07 of additional rate relief, net of investments. And as always, we're implementing numerous cost control measures. 
Lastly, we will also benefit from the absence of discretionary activities, which occurred in the second half of 2016, such as our debt prefunding and relatively high volume of donations, the sum of which equates to $0.14 of potential EPS pickup in the back half of this year. 
In summary, we believe these factors provide us with significant flexibility for the rest of the year. As such, we remain highly confident in our ability to deliver 6% to 8% adjusted EPS growth in 2017. 
I know you all are well acquainted with this EPS forecast curve, which illustrates our progress on meeting our targets -- or in meeting our earnings targets as we move through the year. This year, we started out with mild weather and significant storm activity but took actions to remain ahead of plan in the first half of the year. This chart also overlays the curve from 2016. As highlighted, we enjoyed favorable weather and great cost performance in the second half of 2016, which permitted substantial reinvestment back into the business in the fourth quarter. This, as you can imagine, makes the comparison a bit easier for 2017. So we're right on course for another solid, predictable year in 2017. 
The EPS curves for the past decade remind us that every year is different, but the results are the same: we deliver consistent, industry-leading EPS growth by managing the business on behalf of customers and investors. During periods of better-than-expected weather and cost performance, we have reinvested in the business, as evidenced by the $340 million in aggregate that we have put to work over the past 4 years to achieve customer improvements. Conversely, during periods of unfavorable weather or other unexpected negative variances, we have made up the difference through cost savings and good business decisions without compromising our commitments to our customers and employees. Irrespective of the circumstances, we have managed to deliver within our earnings guidance annually, and this year will be no different. 
Having spent a good deal of the past 3 months with the investment community, many have asked how CMS has achieved and will continue to achieve consistent, industry-leading earnings growth without raising customer rates above inflation year in and year out. Admittedly, even I asked this question when I was on the outside looking in. Well, the answer is that we have a robust capital plan of needed customer investments, largely funded by annual cost savings of 2% to 3% a year; modest utility sales growth; and other enhancements such as thoughtful tax planning, which eliminates the need for dilutive block equity issuance worth about 2%. All this equates to us self-funding roughly 70% of our capital plan, which minimizes customer rate impacts to a level at or below inflation while our growth continues at 6% to 8%. This simple but unique business model has driven our historical success and offers a sustainable path forward to benefit our customers and investors. 
Our customer-driven capital plan is comprised of needed investments, which will enable the delivery of safe, reliable and efficient electricity and natural gas to those we serve. We have forecasted a base case of approximately $18 billion of capital investments over the next 10 years, in alignment with our clean and lean strategy, which Patti highlighted earlier. As we have noted in the past, we anticipate additional opportunities of approximately $7 billion in the form of enhanced gas infrastructure, grid monetization and cost-efficient PPA replacement through renewables and other sources. As always, affordability from a customer and balance sheet perspective, commission alignment and execution capabilities will dictate the pace at which we take on such opportunities. 
As to the latter point around execution risk, this slide illustrates our confidence in our ability to execute on our 10-year plan. As highlighted, over 90% of our 10-year capital plan of $18 billion is represented by projects less than $200 million in size, which compares favorably to our capital plan composition over the past 10 years. Broadly speaking, project size offers directional guidance as to the complexity and duration of projects. As such, our capital plan is not only increasing in size but is decreasing in terms of risk profile, which bodes well for customers and investors. Our capital plan embodies the modular nature of the clean and lean strategy and perpetuates our ""no big bets"" investment philosophy.
A key driver of our ability to execute on our capital plan in an affordable manner is made possible by lean thinking and performance, which drives sustainable cost savings. As you can see on the left-hand side of this slide, CMS has been a leader in this area, and our employees have embraced the CE Way to continue to come up with new and innovative ways to deliver those savings to our customers. 
For investors, this creates capital investment headroom and fulfills our self-imposed commitment to keep base rate increases at or below inflation. Over the last decade, we have been able to reduce our O&M costs by more than 3% per year, and the past few years were no exception. We're projecting conservatively to continue at this pace of about 2% over the next 3 years without compromising our commitments to customers in the form of service upgrades and while keeping employee salaries and benefits competitive, 2 key constituents and the people element of the triple bottom line. 
Our capital investment strategy and support of regulatory outcomes, coupled with annual cost savings and tax planning, have enabled us to grow our operating cash flow by about $100 million annually. In fact, we've increased our opening cash flow by $1.8 billion in aggregate since 2004. Our past and prospective cash flow generation has and will continue to eliminate the need for dilutive block equity issuance going forward, which further supports the self-funding strategy. For reference, as of June 30, 2017, we have generated over $1.1 billion of operating cash flow, which is slightly ahead of plan and the corresponding period in 2016. 
Switching gears to sales. The economic outlook for our service territory, particularly in Grand Rapids, the largest city in our service territory and in the heart of our footprint, remains relatively strong, as indicated on this slide. As stated in the past, we don't rely heavily on sales growth, as evidenced by our forecast of 0.5% to 1% of -- for 2017, but we continue to be encouraged by the increased expansion and diversification of our service territory. We continue to work closely with the Governor's Office, the legislative branch and key regulators to bring business to Michigan because we win when Michigan wins. 
Moving on to enterprises. DIG continues to drive the performance of this business unit. Enterprises was ahead of both the plan and the corresponding period in 2016 due to operational efficiencies attributable to upgrades completed in 2015 and higher capacity prices. As you'll note on the bottom of this slide, capacity remains open in future years to take further advantage of attractive pricing. 
As Patti noted, we'll have more visibility on the Palisades result by the end of September, which will dictate our longer-term plans for DIG. And as stated in the past, we remain cautiously optimistic as to the outcome of the Palisades proceeding but have not factored that pending decision into our plan. 
As we approach the back half of 2017, we continue to evaluate potential risks and corresponding mitigating factors to minimize volatility in our plan, as evidenced by our sensitivity slide. A noteworthy opportunity includes energy efficiency incentives, which were doubled under our new energy law, but we have only accounted for half of the increase in our financial planning, with another $0.02 of potential upside yet to be reflected. 
In closing, the last slide provides a reminder of our financial objectives for 2017, all of which are well on track. Needless to say, we remain acutely focused on delivering another year of consistent, industry-leading growth with minimal rate impacts to the benefit of customers and investors. 
At this point, Brandon, please open up the lines for questions."

But I would say I have been pleasantly surprised on the inside now at how well the company has managed to not only execute on its capital plan, which, as you know, is quite robust as well as risk mitigated, but also to realize significant savings year in and year out. And so you're familiar with that slide where we show our benchmark relative to the sector. And that's a real achievement of O&M cost reductions of 3% per year over the last 10 years. And if you look at the next 3 years going forward, we think that there are significant opportunities to realize additional O&M cost reductions. And we've talked about this in the past, but candidly, I would submit that a lot of the cost savings realized in the past are really through sheer will and just a lot of good discipline. But through the CE Way, we think we can offer a much greater level of sophistication in realizing cost savings in a scalable and replicable way. And so we think a combination of process-oriented and related savings as well as technology-enabled savings through smart meters and other measures should continue to lead us down this path of consistent cost reduction in years to come. So I have seen a lot of opportunities within these walls. And if you look at some of the other metrics that Patti highlights in our stories of the month, there's a lot of low-hanging fruit here. And so that's what encouraged me that this path we've been on for so long is sustainable in the long run."

Next couple of months, we expect to hear the result of that tariff approval. What we like about it and what we think is particularly unique is that it is -- does not have a cross -- cost shift. It really provides the access for our large business customers to have access to renewable energy. They remain a full-bundled customer, but then they are able -- they have a couple options. They can either bring their own PPA, which we're agnostic to, or we will provide the renewables for them, and they can then sell that on -- in MISO. And if prices go up, then they get the upside because we've signed a fixed contract with them. So that's very appealing to them. What's appealing to us is they remain full-bundled customers, and we're able to provide the energy in the form that they prefer. So what we've heard from our large business customers is -- I mean, a direct quote from one of them was, ""This is the first time a utility has figured this out. This is exactly what we need, and it makes Michigan very attractive."" So we're optimistic that the commission will approve the tariff especially since it doesn't have any kind of cost shift to others."

Well, I mean, the reason why we feel confident in our ability to close this gap is that we have all of these activities that we've put in place, which are really discretionary in the second half of 2016, which we don't need to replicate in this year as we think about closing this gap. And so the only specificity we have as it pertains to the cost savings and other is just this math here that closes the gap between the discretionary items that we won't have to replicate again in 2017, and then there's cost savings and other line item, that gets you to the $0.12 to $0.16. But we believe that we can realize cost savings beyond that. So just to be clear, that number is effectively just a plug here for illustrative purposes, but we believe we can realize more cost savings over the course of the second half of the year. We're already seeing that in the form of customer operations [indiscernible] Patti highlighted a lot of good achievements [indiscernible] utilize uncollectible accounts. And we think there are much more cost savings beyond what's just on this page.

And then secondly, more conceptually, when you talk about the ability to keep customer rates at or below inflation, one of the categories that you put in that is the no block equity requirement. So I mean, intuitively, the equity, whether you want to issue or not, shouldn't have a direct impact on customer rates. But to interpret that, is that saying, to get to the 6% to 8% growth rate, to solve for that equation, the fact that you don't need equity helps you in keeping customer rates down? Is that the way to interpret that?"

And so we take pride in the fact that we have enough capability on the cost-cutting side to fund a good portion of that capital investment backlog execution, the $18 billion plan. We've been realizing cost cuts to, say, 2% to 3% over the last 10 years and are forecasting that going forward. And so that, coupled with the very good tax planning that has allowed us to not pay federal taxes for the last several years and for the next 4 or 5 years forward, coupled with a little bit of sales performance at the utility, has enabled us to avoid doing those real dilutive block equity deals, which others may need to do. And that obviously keeps our EPS right where we'd like it to be, at that healthy 6% to 8% adjusted growth level."

And so we feel good about our ability to execute on that. What remains to be seen is how much of that upside we can realize in this year because as you may know, the new energy law came into effect in April of this year. And so there's only a question about whether that should be prorated earnings or should it be the full year. If it's full year, it could be worth $0.02. If it's a prorated portion, it could be $0.01.

You've got gas infrastructure, which is just north of about $2.25 billion. And then you've got, call it, just under $0.75 billion attributable to grid modernization and then potential Palisades replacement. And the balance is really a potential replacement option for the MCV contract, which expires in 2025. And that's about, call it, $3.5 billion or thereabouts if you include potential wind replacement, coupled with gas peaker plant support. And so as we think about what may allow us to pull those levers, it really is the historical constraints. And that's customer affordability and/or the need to fund that in a efficient way on our balance sheet. And so as the signpost we'd need to see is how economic does wind become over time, what cost savings are we able to realize to self-fund the business and, again, permit us to fund or execute on the capital plan of that magnitude and, again, if the economics associated with renewables or other potential alternative means to replace that MCV PPA come into effect. So it's combination of, let's say, affordability and balance sheet capacity in order to take that on."

Thanks for joining the call. It's great to be with you this morning. I'll be sharing our first half results and an operational update, and then Rejji will give the details of our first half financial performance and our outlook. 
Our stand for people, planet and profit will be reflected in our presentation today, and frankly, it's what we work on every day. Our ability to commit to all 3 is enabled by our performance, which we're continuously improving through the CE Way. I look forward to sharing our latest updates, and not to worry, I've got a great story of the month for you. 
We are happy to report, in spite of record-breaking storms in our service territory and mild weather in the first half of the year, we're up 7% on a weather-normalized basis, and perhaps more importantly, we're ahead of our plan by $0.04 year-to-date. And therefore, we are reaffirming our year-end adjusted EPS guidance of 6% to 8% or $2.14 to $2.18. 
As you've come to expect, our delivery of profits takes the form of a consistent 7% growth over the past 14 years, no matter the conditions we've faced. Because we're confident about that continued consistent performance, we continue to reaffirm a range of 6% to 8% EPS growth for this year and many years to come. 
In tough external conditions, consistent top-end financial performance only comes through extraordinary efforts of extraordinary people, one of the cornerstones of our triple bottom line. Now we've been best-in-class in employee engagement for several years, but we must confess, we were thrilled to be named the #1 employer in Michigan in the annual Forbes' Best Large Employers survey in May. And it's no coincidence that the customers served by this engaged team have named us a most trusted brand through a survey conducted by Market Strategies International. 
As a result of the energy law passing in December, our regulatory calendar is full and active. We recognize and appreciate our MPSC staff and commissioners for all their hard work. The energy law implementation is going well and is on track. The MPSC Chairman, Sally Talberg, has done a great job of organizing the working groups and leading a very systematic process to implement this high-value legislation. 
The state reliability mechanism is being evaluated and designed as we speak. It's scheduled for a final determination in December with a June 2018 implementation. Our energy efficiency team is ramping up new 1.5% electric and 1% gas energy efficiency targets, enabling the new incentive mechanism to go into place. And simultaneously, we have a gas rate case that's scheduled for a final order this coming Monday, and our electric rate case will be self-implemented in October. 
Finally, our Palisades early termination securitization is scheduled for a final order at the end of September. Though this proceeding has no impact on our earnings and it is not baked into our plan, we do believe that this early termination is in the best interest of Michigan. We don't have too many opportunities to save our customers $45 million a year, so we would love to pass this along to them. 
We also believe that the early termination of this out-of-market PPA enables the governor's energy agenda through the elimination of energy waste and improving energy affordability in Michigan while not jeopardizing reliability as a result of our replacement plan, which serves both people and the planet. 
Our promise to improve the planet is coming to fruition at a rapid rate. The closure of our 7 coal plants in 2016 moved us from 49% coal generation to 22%, more coal retired than any other investor-owned utility in the nation. Our actions resulted in a reduction in carbon intensity of 30% and ranking us as the #1 U.S. utility by Sustainalytics. And we aren't finished. 
Our clean-and-lean strategy enables further coal reductions without big bets to achieve the replacement. Fulfilling the RPS standard and providing for large-business customer preferences for renewables, creates the perfect conditions to modernize our generation fleet in a cost-efficient, low-risk way. 
Now when we talk about our commitment to the planet, we're talking about reducing our environmental impact, including reductions in water, land use, emissions and carbon. We've self-imposed improvement targets that go beyond environmental compliance, and we're ahead of our plan in all of these areas. There was a time when this would have implied higher costs for customers but not at CMS. We find a way to deliver the ""and"" in clean and lean. 
Lean has many descriptors and attributes, one of which is the concept of waste and waste elimination. An example of waste in our business is the underutilization of assets. Traditionally, generation planners forecast load growth, build a plant big enough to serve that growth and add additional spending reserve. We see modular additions of renewables as a more flexible way to provide adequate supply resources with smaller bets and less potential waste. 
Modular renewables are a great choice for us because we have ample capital opportunities outside of generation. We have more upgrades than our customers can afford across the entire business. So we're always making choices that maximize customer benefits while, at the same time, reducing cost so we can deliver more customer value for every dollar invested. Our customers will benefit from investments in our backlog of upgrades on our grid and on our gas system, and our investors can rely on a sustainable growth strategy. 
In addition to our own vision for clean and lean generation fleet, the new Michigan energy law requires and our customers are asking for more renewable energy. We're expanding our Cross Winds to a wind park to grow toward our 15% RPS standard. We conducted an RFP, and we were the most competitively priced bidder. Therefore, we're building that expansion ourselves. 
In addition to our renewable expansions, we worked closely with some of our largest and most energy-conscious customers to develop a pricing package that both meets their desired price point and their commitment to the planet. We recently requested approval of this pricing option with the MPSC. This pricing design can enable real attraction to our service territory and serve as an important part of our economic development strategy to grow Michigan. 
Our residential customers don't want to be left out of the mix. To serve them, we've launched our Solar Gardens, a utility-scale community solar program, and a pilot to operate rooftop solar package for residential and small commercial customers. These are clean alternatives delivered with a lean mindset. 
Our lean mindset carries over to all of our investments. For example, the deployment of our smart meter technology has improved our meter reading accuracy and rate, but we did not just rely on technology deployment. We've simultaneously improved the work process through applying our CE Way skills. In fact, the remaining meters to be read for our gas-only customers and customers that have opted out of smart meters can be very inefficient to read but for our meter reading teams' improvement efforts. 
And the results are, frankly, stunning. We've improved the read rate to 99% and improved reads per hour by 45% year-over-year, which contributed to ancillary benefits, such as 64% reduction in invoice rework and a reduction of 2 million calls to our call center. The net impact: over $8 million of savings since 2015 while, at the same time, improving the customer experience through more accurate billing and virtually eliminating estimated meter reads. 
We use these cost savings to offset the capital investment in infrastructure, which delivers the value our customers deserve and helps keep rates affordable. This is a great example of our business model put into action. And it's not even my story of the month. 
My story of the month is about a fueling pilot in our Flint service center. We have a vision of our blue and whites pulling out of our 43 service centers all across Michigan every morning after a quick safety briefing and a daily huddle, ready to serve. One thing that slows down our crews today is the time they spend gathering materials, equipment, fueling their vehicles, but this is changing. 
We started a pilot in Flint where a lower-cost night shift has been established to prefuel the vehicles and have them prepped and ready to go before the crews arrive in the morning. In Flint alone, this is saving 15 to 30 minutes per person daily. When we extrapolate this to a statewide implementation, the savings potential grows to an elimination of over 100,000 hours of wasted time per year. We can replace those wasted hours with time for our crews to do the value-adding work that our customers need. 
I'm reminded every time we are implementing one of these seemingly simple improvements that we're just scratching the surface of our full potential. You can definitely put this story in the low-hanging fruit category. It's what gives us the confidence that we have lots more cost-savings opportunities that deliver a better customer experience. 
Our commitment to the triple bottom line, powered by performance and the CE Way, is why we are so sure that we can continue to improve the experience for our customers and sustain the performance you've come to expect. This model's been working for more than a decade. And in spite of many changes that are outside of our control, come what may, the CMS team will deliver for our customers and our investors. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Rejji."

As we have highlighted in the past, we deeply appreciate your interest in our company. We view the investment community as a key element of the people aspect of the triple bottom line, alongside customers, employees and everyone we serve. 
Our second quarter results of $0.33 per share are down $0.12 from last year largely due to continued mild winter and record storm activity in our service territory. Put the level of storms into context, year-to-date, we have had 5 official major event days in 2017 compared to 3 for all of 2016, which led to approximately $31 million in service restoration costs through the second quarter, which is more than $10 million above our 5-year average at this time of the year and roughly double the amount spent in the first half of 2016. With that in mind, we don't make excuses and already have taken steps to mitigate the unfavorable weather impacts.  
For the first half of the year, adjusted earnings of $1.04 per share were flat from last year and up $0.08 or 7% on a weather-normalized basis, which positions us well to meet our annual financial objectives. As Patti mentioned, we are quite pleased with our performance to-date and remain $0.04 ahead of plan even with the unfavorable weather and record storm activity in the first half of the year. 
As indicated in the waterfall chart, we have managed to offset $0.11 of mild weather and record storms fully in the first half of the year with cost savings, outperformance at enterprises and rate relief net of investments, among other factors. Our business model, which focuses on achieving cost savings coupled with modest sales and other countermeasures to minimize customer rate inflation, has enabled us to end the first half of 2017 ahead of plan, which bodes well for the remainder of the year. 
For the second half of 2017, we have assumed $0.07 of additional rate relief, net of investments. And as always, we're implementing numerous cost-control measures. 
Lastly, we will also benefit from the absence of discretionary activities, which occurred in the second half of 2016, such as our debt prefunding and relatively high volume of donations, the sum of which equates to $0.14 of potential EPS pickup in the back half of this year. 
In summary, we believe these factors provide us with significant flexibility for the rest of the year. As such, we remain highly confident in our ability to deliver 6% to 8% adjusted EPS growth in 2017. 
I know you all are well acquainted with this EPS forecast curve, which illustrates our progress on meeting our targets -- or in meeting our earnings targets as we move through the year. This year, we started out with mild weather and significant storm activity but took actions to remain ahead of plan in the first half of the year. This chart also overlays the curve from 2016. As highlighted, we enjoyed favorable weather and great cost performance in the second half of 2016, which permitted substantial reinvestment back in the business in the fourth quarter. This, as you can imagine, makes the comparison a bit easier for 2017. So we're right on course for another solid, predictable year in 2017. 
The EPS curves for the past decade remind us that every year is different, but the results are the same: we deliver consistent, industry-leading EPS growth by managing the business on behalf of customers and investors. During periods of better-than-expected weather and cost performance, we have reinvested in the business, as evidenced by the $340 million in aggregate that we have put to work over the past 4 years to achieve customer improvements. 
Conversely, during periods of unfavorable weather or other unexpected negative variances, we have made up the difference through cost savings and good business decisions without compromising our commitments to our customers and employees. Irrespective of the circumstances, we have managed to deliver within our earnings guidance annually, and this year will be no different. 
Having spent a good deal of the past 3 months with the investment community, many have asked how CMS has achieved and will continue to achieve consistent, industry-leading earnings growth without raising customer rates above inflation year in and year out. Admittedly, even I asked this question when I was on the outside looking in. Well, the answer is that we have a robust capital plan of needed customer investments largely funded by annual cost savings of 2% to 3% a year; modest utility sales growth; and other enhancements, such as thoughtful tax planning, which eliminate the need for dilutive block equity issuance worth about 2%. 
All this equates to us self-funding roughly 70% of our capital plan, which minimizes customer rate impacts to a level at or below inflation while our growth continues at 6% to 8%. This simple but unique business model has driven our historical success and offers a sustainable path forward to benefit our customers and investors. 
Our customer-driven capital plan is comprised of needed investments, which will enable the delivery of safe, reliable and efficient electricity and natural gas to those we serve. We have forecasted a base case of approximately $18 billion of capital investments over the next 10 years, in alignment with our clean and lean strategy, which Patti highlighted earlier. 
As we've noted in the past, we anticipate additional opportunities of approximately $7 billion in the form of enhanced gas infrastructure, grid monetization and cost-efficient PPA replacement through renewables and other sources. As always, affordability from a customer and balance-sheet perspective, commission alignment, and execution capabilities will dictate the pace at which we take on such opportunities. 
As to the latter point around execution risk, this slide illustrates our confidence in our ability to execute on our 10-year plan. As highlighted, over 90% of our 10-year capital plan of $18 billion is represented by projects less than $200 million in size, which compares favorably to our capital plan composition over the past 10 years. Broadly speaking, project size offers directional guidance as to the complexity and duration of projects. As such, our capital plan is not only increasing in size but is decreasing in terms of risk profile, which bodes well for customers and investors. Our capital plan embodies the modular nature of the clean-and-lean strategy and perpetuates our ""no big bets"" investment philosophy.
A key driver of our ability to execute on our capital plan in an affordable manner is made possible by lean thinking and performance, which drives sustainable cost savings. As you can see on the left-hand side of this slide, CMS has been a leader in this area, and our employees have embraced the CE Way to continue to come up with new and innovative ways to deliver those savings to our customers. 
For investors, this creates capital investment headroom and fulfills our self-imposed commitment to keep base rate increases at or below inflation. Over the last decade, we have been able to reduce our O&M cost by more than 3% per year, and the past 3 years were no exception. We're projecting conservatively to continue at this pace of about 2% over the next 3 years without compromising our commitments to customers in the form of service upgrades and while keeping employee salaries and benefits competitive, 2 key constituents and the people element of the triple bottom line. 
Our capital investment strategy and support of regulatory outcomes, coupled with annual cost savings and tax planning, have enabled us to grow our operating cash flow by about $100 million annually. In fact, we've increased our operating cash flow by $1.8 billion in aggregate since 2004. Our past and prospective cash flow generation has and will continue to eliminate the need for dilutive block equity issuance going forward, which further supports the self-funding strategy. For reference, as of June 30, 2017, we have generated over $1.1 billion of operating cash flow, which is slightly ahead of plan and the corresponding period in 2016. 
Switching gears to sales. The economic outlook for our service territory, particularly in Grand Rapids, the largest city in our service territory and in the heart of our footprint, remains relatively strong, as indicated on this slide. As stated in the past, we don't rely heavily on sales growth, as evidenced by our forecast of 0.5% to 1% of -- for 2017, but we continue to be encouraged by the increased expansion and diversification of our service territory. We continue to work closely with the Governor's Office, the legislative branch and key regulators to bring business to Michigan because we win when Michigan wins. 
Moving on to enterprises. DIG continues to drive the performance of this business unit. Enterprises was ahead of both the plan and the corresponding period in 2016 due to operational efficiencies attributable to upgrades completed in 2015 and higher capacity prices. As you'll note on the bottom of this slide, capacity remains open in future years to take further advantage of attractive pricing. 
As Patti noted, we'll have more visibility on the Palisades result by the end of September, which will dictate our longer-term plans for DIG. And as stated in the past, we remain cautiously optimistic as to the outcome of the Palisades proceeding but have not factored that pending decision into our plan. 
As we approach the back half of 2017, we continue to evaluate potential risks and corresponding mitigating factors to minimize volatility in our plan, as evidenced by our sensitivities slide. A noteworthy opportunity includes energy efficiency incentives, which were doubled under a new energy law, but we've only accounted for half of the increase in our financial planning with another $0.02 of potential upside yet to be reflected. 
In closing, the last slide provides a reminder of our financial objectives for 2017, all of which are well on track. Needless to say, we remain acutely focused on delivering another year of consistent, industry-leading growth with minimal rate impacts to the benefit of customers and investors. 
At this point, Brandon, please open up the lines for questions."

Look, first, I would say skeptical is a paraphrase. That was not a quote. But I would say I have been pleasantly surprised on the inside now at how well the company has managed to not only execute on its capital plan, which as you know, is quite robust as well as risk mitigated but also to realize significant savings year in and year out. And so you're familiar with that slide where we show our benchmark relative to the sector. And that's a real achievement of O&M cost reductions of 3% per year over the last 10 years. And if you look at the next 3 years going forward, we think that there are significant opportunities to realize additional O&M cost reductions. And we've talked about this in the past, but candidly, I would submit that a lot of the cost savings we've realized in the past are really through sheer will and just a lot of good discipline. But through the CE Way, we think we can offer a much greater level of sophistication realizing cost savings in a scalable and replicable way. And so we think a combination of process-oriented and related savings as well as technology-enabled savings through smart meters and other measures should continue to lead us down this path of consistent cost reduction in years to come. So I have seen a lot of opportunities within these walls. And if you look at some of the other metrics that Patti highlights in our stories of the month, there's a lot of low-hanging fruit here. And so that's what encouraged me that this path we've been on for so long is sustainable in the long run."

Next couple of months, we expect to hear the results of that tariff approval. What we like about it and what we think is particularly unique is that it is -- does not have a cross -- cost shift. It really provides the access for our large-business customers to have access to renewable energy. They remain a full-bundled customer, but then they're able -- they have a couple options. They can either bring their own PPA, which we're agnostic to, or we will provide the renewables for them, and they can then sell that on -- in MISO. And if prices go up, then they get the upside because we've signed a fixed contract with them. So that's very appealing to them. What's appealing to us is they remain full-bundled customers, and we're able to provide the energy in the form that they prefer. So what we've heard from our large-business customers is -- I mean, a direct quote from one of them was, ""This is the first time a utility has figured this out. This is exactly what we need, and it makes Michigan very attractive."" So we're optimistic that the commission will approve the tariff, especially since it doesn't have any kind of cost shift to others."

Well, I mean, the reason why we feel confident in our ability to close this gap is that we have all of these activities that we've put in place, which are really discretionary in the second half of 2016, which we don't need to replicate in this year as we think about closing this gap. And so the only specificity we have as it pertains to the cost savings as other is just this math here that closes the gap between the discretionary items that we won't have to replicate again in 2017, and then there's cost savings and other line item. That gets you to the $0.12 to $0.16. But we believe that we can realize cost savings beyond that. So just to be clear, that number is effectively just a plug here for illustrative purposes, but we believe we can realize more cost savings over the course of the second half of the year. We're already seeing that in the form of customer operations [indiscernible] Patti highlighted a lot of good achievements [indiscernible] utilize in uncollected accounts. And we think there are much more cost [indiscernible] beyond what's just on this page.

We have said for some time now that we foresee weather-adjusted electric sales at about 0.5% to 1%. And as you may recall in Q4 or on the Q4 earnings call and also on the Q1 earnings call, we historically had attributed that to strong performance on the industrial side. And we have very good visibility on the performance of that segment, as you probably saw. That has been tailing off quite a bit. But what encourages us and the reason why we still feel good about that 0.5% to 1% forecast is we're seeing a wonderful trend in terms of sales mix. And so our residential performance has been well in excess of our expectations. And so we're about 0.5% up for residential on the electric side on a weather-adjusted basis and almost 2% up for commercial. And so we've seen a nice bit of favorable sales mix, which gives us confidence in that 0.5% to 1%. And what I would also say, just peeling the onion a bit on industrial, the downward trend you see for industrial, that's largely attributable to our retail open-access customers and then one large customer who has had lower-than-expected performance. And so those are lower-margin customers, and our remaining balance of industrial customers have performed quite well. And so we feel very good about the 0.5% to 1% weather-adjusted sales forecast."

So I mean, intuitively, the equity, whether you want to issue or not, shouldn't have a direct impact on customer rates. But to interpret that, is that saying, to get to the 6% to 8% growth rate to solve for that equation, the fact that you don't need equity helps you in keeping customer rates down? Is that the way to interpret that?"

And so we take pride in the fact that we have enough capability on the cost-cutting side to fund a good portion of that capital investment backlog execution, the $18 billion plan. We've been realizing cost cuts to, say, 2% to 3% over the last 10 years and are forecasting that going forward. And so that, coupled with the very good tax planning that has allowed us to not pay federal taxes for the last several years and for the next 4 or 5 years forward, coupled with a little bit of sales performance at the utility, has enabled us to avoid doing those real dilutive block equity deals, which others may need to do.

And so we feel good about our ability to execute on that. What remains to be seen is how much of that upside we can realize in this year because, as you may know, the new energy law came into effect in April of this year. And so there's only a question about whether that should be a prorated earnings or should it be the full year. If it's full year, it could be worth $0.02. If it's a prorated portion, it could be $0.01. And so that's the only concern we have at this point.

You've got gas infrastructure, which is just north of about $2.25 billion. And then you've got, call it, just under $0.75 billion attributable to grid modernization and then potential Palisades replacement. And the balance is really a potential replacement option for the MCV contract, which expires in 2025. And that's about, call it, $3.5 billion or thereabouts if you include potential wind replacement coupled with gas peaker plant support. And so as we think about what may allow us to pull those levers, it really is the historical constraints. And that's customer affordability and/or the need to fund that in a efficient way on our balance sheet. And so as the signpost we'd need to see is how economic does wind become over time, what cost savings are we able to realize to self-fund the business and, again, permit us to fund or execute on the capital plan of that magnitude and, again, if the economics associated with renewables or other potential alternative means to replace that MCV PPA come into effect. So it's combination of, I'd say, affordability and balance sheet capacity in order to take that on."

Thanks for joining the call. It's great to be with you this morning. I'll be sharing our first half results and an operational update, and then Rejji will give the details of our first half financial performance and our outlook. 
Our stand for people, planet and profit will be reflected in our presentation today. And frankly, it's what we work on every day. Our ability to commit to all 3 is enabled by our performance, which we're continuously improving through the CE Way. I look forward to sharing our latest updates, and not to worry, I've got a great story of the month for you. 
We are happy to report, in spite of record-breaking storms in our service territory and mild weather in the first half of the year, we're up 7% on a weather-normalized basis, and perhaps more importantly, we're ahead of our plan by $0.04 year-to-date. And therefore, we are reaffirming our year-end adjusted EPS guidance of 6% to 8% or $2.14 to $2.18. 
As you've come to expect, our delivery of profits takes the form of a consistent 7% growth over the past 14 years, no matter the conditions we've faced. Because we're confident about that continued consistent performance, we continue to reaffirm a range of 6% to 8% EPS growth for this year and many years to come. 
In tough external conditions, consistent top-end financial performance only comes through extraordinary efforts of extraordinary people, one of the cornerstones of our triple bottom line. Now we've been best-in-class in employee engagement for several years, but we must confess, we were thrilled to be named the #1 employer in Michigan in the annual Forbes' Best Large Employers survey in May. And it's no coincidence that the customers served by this engaged team have named us a most trusted brand through a survey conducted by Market Strategies International. 
As a result of the energy law passing in December, our regulatory calendar is full and active. We recognize and appreciate our MPSC staff and commissioners for all their hard work. The energy law implementation is going well and is on track. The MPSC Chairman, Sally Talberg, has done a great job of organizing the working groups and leading a very systematic process to implement this high-value legislation. 
The state reliability mechanism is being evaluated and designed as we speak. It's scheduled for a final determination in December with a June 2018 implementation. Our energy efficiency team is ramping up new 1.5% electric and 1% gas energy efficiency targets, enabling the new incentive mechanism to go into place. And simultaneously, we have a gas rate case that's scheduled for a final order this coming Monday, and our electric rate case will be self-implemented in October. 
Finally, our Palisades early termination securitization is scheduled for a final order at the end of September. Though this proceeding has no impact on our earnings and it is not baked into our plan, we do believe that this early termination is in the best interest of Michigan. We don't have too many opportunities to save our customers $45 million a year, so we would love to pass this along to them. 
We also believe that the early termination of this out-of-market PPA enables the governor's energy agenda through the elimination of energy waste and improving energy affordability in Michigan while not jeopardizing reliability as a result of our replacement plan, which serves both people and the planet. 
Our promise to improve the planet is coming to fruition at a rapid rate. The closure of our 7 coal plants in 2016 moved us from 49% coal generation to 22%, more coal retired than any other investor-owned utility in the nation. Our actions resulted in a reduction in carbon intensity of 30% and ranking us as the #1 U.S. utility by Sustainalytics. And we aren't finished. 
Our clean and lean strategy enables further coal reductions without big bets to achieve the replacement. Fulfilling the RPS standard and providing for large-business customer preferences for renewables, creates the perfect conditions to modernize our generation fleet in a cost-efficient, low-risk way. 
Now when we talk about our commitment to the planet, we're talking about reducing our environmental impact, including reductions in water, land use, emissions and carbon. We've self-imposed improvement targets that go beyond environmental compliance, and we're ahead of our plan in all of these areas. There was a time when this would have implied higher costs for customers but not at CMS. We find a way to deliver the and in clean and lean. 
Lean has many descriptors and attributes, one of which is the concept of waste and waste elimination. An example of waste in our business is the underutilization of assets. Traditionally, generation planners forecast load growth, build a plant big enough to serve that growth and add additional spending reserve. We see modular additions of renewables as a more flexible way to provide adequate supply resources with smaller bets and less potential waste. 
Modular renewables are a great choice for us because we have ample capital opportunities outside of generation. We have more upgrades than our customers can afford across the entire business. So we're always making choices that maximize customer benefits while, at the same time, reducing cost so we can deliver more customer value for every dollar invested. Our customers will benefit from investments in our backlog of upgrades on our grid and on our gas system, and our investors can rely on a sustainable growth strategy. 
In addition to our own vision for clean and lean generation fleet, the new Michigan energy law requires, and our customers are asking for more renewable energy. We're expanding our Cross Winds to a wind park to grow toward our 15% RPS standard. We conducted an RFP, and we were the most competitively priced bidder. Therefore, we're building that expansion ourselves. 
In addition to our renewable expansions, we worked closely with some of our largest and most energy-conscious customers to develop a pricing package that both meets their desired price point and their commitment to the planet. We recently requested approval of this pricing option with the MPSC. This pricing design can enable real attraction to our service territory and serve as an important part of our economic development strategy to grow Michigan. 
Our residential customers don't want to be left out of the mix. To serve them, we've launched our Solar Gardens, a utility-scale community solar program, and a pilot to operate rooftop solar package for residential and small commercial customers. These are clean alternatives delivered with a lean mindset. 
Our lean mindset carries over to all of our investments. For example, the deployment of our smart meter technology has improved our meter reading accuracy and rate, but we did not just rely on technology deployment. We've simultaneously improved the work process through applying our CE Way skills. In fact, the remaining meters to be read for our gas-only customers and customers that have opted out of smart meters can be very inefficient to read but for our meter reading teams' improvement efforts. 
And the results are, frankly, stunning. We've improved the read rate to 99% and improved reads per hour by 45% year-over-year, which contributed to ancillary benefits, such as 64% reduction in invoice rework and a reduction of 2 million calls to our call center. The net impact, over $8 million of savings since 2015 while, at the same time, improving the customer experience through more accurate billing and virtually eliminating estimated meter reads. 
We use these cost savings to offset the capital investment in infrastructure, which delivers the value our customers deserve and helps keep rates affordable. This is a great example of our business model put into action. And it's not even my story of the month. 
My story of the month is about a fueling pilot in our Flint service center. We have a vision of our blue and whites pulling out of our 43 service centers all across Michigan every morning after a quick safety briefing and a daily huddle, ready to serve. One thing that slows down our crews today is the time they spend gathering materials, equipment, fueling their vehicles, but this is changing. 
We started a pilot in Flint where a lower-cost night shift has been established to prefuel the vehicles and have them prepped and ready to go before the crews arrive in the morning. In Flint alone, this is saving 15 to 30 minutes per person daily. When we extrapolate this to a statewide implementation, the savings potential grows to an elimination of over 100,000 hours of wasted time per year. We can replace those wasted hours with time for our crews to do the value-adding work that our customers need. 
I'm reminded every time we are implementing one of these seemingly simple improvements that we're just scratching the surface of our full potential. You can definitely put this story in the low-hanging fruit category. It's what gives us the confidence that we have lots more cost-savings opportunities that deliver a better customer experience. 
Our commitment to the triple bottom line, powered by performance and the CE Way, is why we are so sure that we can continue to improve the experience for our customers and sustain the performance you've come to expect. This model's been working for more than a decade. And in spite of many changes that are outside of our control, come what may, the CMS team will deliver for our customers and our investors. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Rejji."

As we have highlighted in the past, we deeply appreciate your interest in our company. We view the investment community as a key element of the people aspect of the triple bottom line, alongside customers, employees and everyone we serve. 
Our second quarter results of $0.33 per share are down $0.12 from last year largely due to continued mild winter and record storm activity in our service territory. Put the level of storms into context, year-to-date, we have had 5 official major event days in 2017 compared to 3 for all of 2016, which led to approximately $31 million in service restoration costs through the second quarter, which is more than $10 million above our 5-year average at this time of the year and roughly double the amount spent in the first half of 2016. With that in mind, we don't make excuses and already have taken steps to mitigate the unfavorable weather impacts. 
For the first half of the year, adjusted earnings of $1.04 per share were flat from last year and up $0.08 or 7% on a weather-normalized basis, which positions us well to meet our annual financial objectives. As Patti mentioned, we are quite pleased with our performance to date and remain $0.04 ahead of plan even with the unfavorable weather and record storm activity in the first half of the year. 
As indicated in the waterfall chart, we have managed to offset $0.11 of mild weather and record storms fully in the first half of the year with cost savings, outperformance at enterprises and rate relief net of investments, among other factors. Our business model, which focuses on achieving cost savings, coupled with modest sales and other countermeasures to minimize customer rate inflation, has enabled us to end the first half of 2017 ahead of plan, which bodes well for the remainder of the year. 
For the second half of 2017, we have assumed $0.07 of additional rate relief, net of investments. And as always, we're implementing numerous cost-control measures. 
Lastly, we will also benefit from the absence of discretionary activities, which occurred in the second half of 2016, such as our debt prefunding and relatively high volume of donations, the sum of which equates to $0.14 of potential EPS pickup in the back half of this year. 
In summary, we believe these factors provide us with significant flexibility for the rest of the year. As such, we remain highly confident in our ability to deliver 6% to 8% adjusted EPS growth in 2017. 
I know you all are well acquainted with this EPS forecast curve, which illustrates our progress on meeting our targets -- or in meeting our earnings targets as we move through the year. This year, we started out with mild weather and significant storm activity but took actions to remain ahead of plan in the first half of the year. This chart also overlays the curve from 2016. As highlighted, we enjoyed favorable weather and great cost performance in the second half of 2016, which permitted substantial reinvestment back in the business in the fourth quarter. This, as you can imagine, makes the comparison a bit easier for 2017. So we're right on course for another solid, predictable year in 2017. 
The EPS curves for the past decade remind us that every year is different, but the results are the same: we deliver consistent, industry-leading EPS growth by managing the business on behalf of customers and investors. During periods of better-than-expected weather and cost performance, we have reinvested in the business, as evidenced by the $340 million in aggregate that we have put to work over the past 4 years to achieve customer improvements. 
Conversely, during periods of unfavorable weather or other unexpected negative variances, we have made up the difference through cost savings and good business decisions without compromising our commitments to our customers and employees. Irrespective of the circumstances, we have managed to deliver within our earnings guidance annually, and this year will be no different. 
Having spent a good deal of the past 3 months with the investment community, many have asked how CMS has achieved and will continue to achieve consistent, industry-leading earnings growth without raising customer rates above inflation year in and year out. Admittedly, even I asked this question when I was on the outside looking in. Well, the answer is that we have a robust capital plan of needed customer investments largely funded by annual cost savings of 2% to 3% a year; modest utility sales growth; and other enhancements, such as thoughtful tax planning, which eliminate the need for dilutive block equity issuance worth about 2%. 
All this equates to us self-funding roughly 70% of our capital plan, which minimizes customer rate impacts to a level at or below inflation while our growth continues at 6% to 8%. This simple but unique business model has driven our historical success and offers a sustainable path forward to benefit our customers and investors. 
Our customer-driven capital plan is comprised of needed investments, which will enable the delivery of safe, reliable and efficient electricity and natural gas to those we serve. We have forecasted a base case of approximately $18 billion of capital investments over the next 10 years, in alignment with our clean and lean strategy, which Patti highlighted earlier. 
As we've noted in the past, we anticipate additional opportunities of approximately $7 billion in the form of enhanced gas infrastructure, grid monetization and cost-efficient PPA replacement through renewables and other sources. As always, affordability from a customer and balance sheet perspective, commission alignment, and execution capabilities will dictate the pace at which we take on such opportunities. 
As to the latter point around execution risk, this slide illustrates our confidence in our ability to execute on our 10-year plan. As highlighted, over 90% of our 10-year capital plan of $18 billion is represented by projects less than $200 million in size, which compares favorably to our capital plan composition over the past 10 years. Broadly speaking, project size offers directional guidance as to the complexity and duration of projects. As such, our capital plan is not only increasing in size but is decreasing in terms of risk profile, which bodes well for customers and investors. Our capital plan embodies the modular nature of the clean and lean strategy and perpetuates our ""no big bets"" investment philosophy.
A key driver of our ability to execute on our capital plan in an affordable manner is made possible by lean thinking and performance, which drives sustainable cost savings. As you can see on the left-hand side of this slide, CMS has been a leader in this area, and our employees have embraced the CE Way to continue to come up with new and innovative ways to deliver those savings to our customers. 
For investors, this creates capital investment headroom and fulfills our self-imposed commitment to keep base rate increases at or below inflation. Over the last decade, we have been able to reduce our O&M cost by more than 3% per year, and the past 3 years were no exception. We're projecting conservatively to continue at this pace of about 2% over the next 3 years without compromising our commitments to customers in the form of service upgrades and while keeping employee salaries and benefits competitive, 2 key constituents and the people element of the triple bottom line. 
Our capital investment strategy and support of regulatory outcomes, coupled with annual cost savings and tax planning, have enabled us to grow our operating cash flow by about $100 million annually. In fact, we've increased our operating cash flow by $1.8 billion in aggregate since 2004. Our past and prospective cash flow generation has and will continue to eliminate the need for dilutive block equity issuance going forward, which further supports the self-funding strategy. For reference, as of June 30, 2017, we have generated over $1.1 billion of operating cash flow, which is slightly ahead of plan and the corresponding period in 2016. 
Switching gears to sales. The economic outlook for our service territory, particularly in Grand Rapids, the largest city in our service territory and in the heart of our footprint, remains relatively strong, as indicated on this slide. As stated in the past, we don't rely heavily on sales growth, as evidenced by our forecast of 0.5% to 1% of -- for 2017, but we continue to be encouraged by the increased expansion and diversification of our service territory. We continue to work closely with the Governor's Office, the legislative branch and key regulators to bring business to Michigan because we win when Michigan wins. 
Moving on to enterprises. DIG continues to drive the performance of this business unit. Enterprises was ahead of both the plan and the corresponding period in 2016 due to operational efficiencies attributable to upgrades completed in 2015 and higher capacity prices. As you'll note on the bottom of this slide, capacity remains open in future years to take further advantage of attractive pricing. 
As Patti noted, we'll have more visibility on the Palisades result by the end of September, which will dictate our longer-term plans for DIG. And as stated in the past, we remain cautiously optimistic as to the outcome of the Palisades proceeding but have not factored that pending decision into our plan. 
As we approach the back half of 2017, we continue to evaluate potential risks and corresponding mitigating factors to minimize volatility in our plan, as evidenced by our sensitivities slide. A noteworthy opportunity includes energy efficiency incentives, which were doubled under a new energy law, but we've only accounted for half of the increase in our financial planning with another $0.02 of potential upside yet to be reflected. 
In closing, the last slide provides a reminder of our financial objectives for 2017, all of which are well on track. Needless to say, we remain acutely focused on delivering another year of consistent, industry-leading growth with minimal rate impacts to the benefit of customers and investors. 
At this point, Brandon, please open up the lines for questions."

But I would say I have been pleasantly surprised on the inside now at how well the company has managed to not only execute on its capital plan, which as you know, is quite robust as well as risk mitigated but also to realize significant savings year in and year out. And so you're familiar with that slide where we show our benchmark relative to the sector. And that's a real achievement of O&M cost reductions of 3% per year over the last 10 years. And if you look at the next 3 years going forward, we think that there are significant opportunities to realize additional O&M cost reductions. And we've talked about this in the past, but candidly, I would submit that a lot of the cost savings we've realized in the past are really through sheer will and just a lot of good discipline. But through the CE Way, we think we can offer a much greater level of sophistication realizing cost savings in a scalable and replicable way. And so we think a combination of process-oriented and related savings as well as technology-enabled savings through smart meters and other measures should continue to lead us down this path of consistent cost reduction in years to come. So I have seen a lot of opportunities within these walls. And if you look at some of the other metrics that Patti highlights in our stories of the month, there's a lot of low-hanging fruit here. And so that's what encouraged me that this path we've been on for so long is sustainable in the long run."

Next couple of months, we expect to hear the results of that tariff approval. What we like about it and what we think is particularly unique is that it is -- does not have a cross -- cost shift. It really provides the access for our large-business customers to have access to renewable energy. They remain a full-bundled customer, but then they're able -- they have a couple options. They can either bring their own PPA, which we're agnostic to, or we will provide the renewables for them, and they can then sell that on -- in MISO. And if prices go up, then they get the upside because we've signed a fixed contract with them. So that's very appealing to them. What's appealing to us is they remain full-bundled customers, and we're able to provide the energy in the form that they prefer. So what we've heard from our large-business customers is -- I mean, a direct quote from one of them was, ""This is the first time a utility has figured this out. This is exactly what we need, and it makes Michigan very attractive.""

Well, I mean, the reason why we feel confident in our ability to close this gap is that we have all of these activities that we've put in place, which are really discretionary in the second half of 2016, which we don't need to replicate in this year as we think about closing this gap. And so the only specificity we have as it pertains to the cost savings as other is just this math here that closes the gap between the discretionary items that we won't have to replicate again in 2017, and then there's cost savings and other line item. That gets you to the $0.12 to $0.16. But we believe that we can realize cost savings beyond that. So just to be clear, that number is effectively just a plug here for illustrative purposes, but we believe we can realize more cost savings over the course of the second half of the year.

And we have very good visibility on the performance of that segment, as you probably saw. That has been tailing off quite a bit. But what encourages us and the reason why we still feel good about that 0.5% to 1% forecast is we're seeing a wonderful trend in terms of sales mix. And so our residential performance has been well in excess of our expectations. And so we're about 0.5% up for residential on the electric side on a weather-adjusted basis and almost 2% up for commercial. And so we've seen a nice bit of favorable sales mix, which gives us confidence in that 0.5% to 1%. And what I would also say, just peeling the onion a bit on industrial, the downward trend you see for industrial, that's largely attributable to our retail open-access customers and then one large customer who has had lower-than-expected performance. And so those are lower-margin customers, and our remaining balance of industrial customers have performed quite well. And so we feel very good about the 0.5% to 1% weather-adjusted sales forecast."

And so that, coupled with the very good tax planning that has allowed us to not pay federal taxes for the last several years and for the next 4 or 5 years forward, coupled with a little bit of sales performance at the utility, has enabled us to avoid doing those real dilutive block equity deals, which others may need to do.

And the balance is really a potential replacement option for the MCV contract, which expires in 2025. And that's about, call it, $3.5 billion or thereabouts if you include potential wind replacement coupled with gas peaker plant support. And so as we think about what may allow us to pull those levers, it really is the historical constraints. And that's customer affordability and/or the need to fund that in a efficient way on our balance sheet. And so as the signpost we'd need to see is how economic does wind become over time, what cost savings are we able to realize to self-fund the business and, again, permit us to fund or execute on the capital plan of that magnitude and, again, if the economics associated with renewables or other potential alternative means to replace that MCV PPA come into effect.

I know that we saw many of your on Investor Day on September 25th and we'll see many of you at EEI, so I'll be brief this morning. But we do have a few updates to share, including our results for the quarter, and not to worry, we have another exciting story of the month. But we will walk you through the financial results and our outlook. 
We're happy to announce that for the first 9 months of 2017, we reported $1.66 of adjusted EPS. On a weather normalized basis, this is up 8% from last year. Despite challenging weather and storms through the year, we are well on track to meet our guidance, and we're raising our bottom end of our full year guidance from $2.14 to $2.15 per share. Our top end remains unchanged at $2.18 per share. 
We're also introducing 2018 full year guidance of $2.29 to $2.33 per share, which implies another year of 6% to 8% annual growth. 
Now this is a good opportunity for me to remind you what we mean when we say 6% to 8%. For 14 years in a row, we have delivered 7%, so it would be easy to assume that we when moved from 5% to 7% to 6% to 8%, we meant to imply 8%. What we actually signaled is our confidence in 7%, and frankly, we took 5% off the table. Our self funding model and our adaptability under a variety of changing conditions each year puts us in a unique position to deliver sustainable 6% to 8% annual growth. This is why we have confidence in the midpoint of our range. 
In years where we have, particularly, strong performance and don't have high priorities for the investment, we could go to the high end. However, are biased is to reinvest in the business and that for next year and deliver our growth trajectory for longer. We know it is both our growth rate and the consistency of it that is valued. To that end, we remain unwavering in our commitment to the triple bottom line. Our focus on people, planet and profit underpinned by our performance will deliver the consistent and sustainable results that you have come to expect. When we say people, we're referring to our customers, coworkers, our communities, and of course, our investors. Driving economic development in Michigan is a great way to enable growth and to serve the people of Michigan. We know that when Michigan wins, our business wins. It's a competitive environment and these large site selection efforts and Michigan is winning. In part, due to the speed of our in-house economic development team which has identified 23 energy-ready sites, so that when a company wants to locate year, we can could you have defined the site that's available and best to their needs. For example, we were pleased that when Lear Corporation, a large auto supplier was looking for a place to locate in the manufacturing facility, we were ready. As a result, Lear recently announced plans to invest in a new plant in Flint, community we are proud to serve. This is another way for Michigan creating approximately 450 new jobs. Turning to the planet, we're thrilled with the response to a renewable tariff. This program allows to partner with our large business customers their commitment to renewable energy and a very competitive price. We're already looking for ways to expand the subprogram to keep up with our customers demand and partner with them to protect the planet. Finally, commitment to people and the planet can be fulfilled without the critical capital that you have all provided. We know that pensioners, retirees in moms in pops have entrusted you with their life savings to invest and save in reliable places. We want you to count on us to be just that sort of place. Therefore, we are equally committed to delivering consistent and predictable financial results. We continue to progress on the regulatory agenda and look for ways to support longer-term planning. The 2016 energy lock creates a framework for the governor's long-term energy plan and our commission has been systematically implementing the different elements of it. For example, we'll be filing our integrated resource plan required with the new law next year. Combined with the commissions ordered 5 electric distribution plan, we'll be providing a vivid picture of the replacement, upgrades and enhancements to our large and Asian electric supply and distribution system in partnership with the commission and its staff, yielding more transparency and identities certainty going forward. Our rate cases remain on track. Our gas rate case was approved at $29 million and is included and expanded $18 million capital tracking mechanism. We plan to file our upcoming gas case in the next couple of weeks. Our new electric rates were self implemented at $130 million on October 1. We expect a final order in March of 2018. These rate cases enabled the infrastructure improvement that deliver real value to our customers and reflect the cost savings that help reduce the price of that infrastructure. One way, we're driving our ongoing cost savings through the implementation of the Consumers Energy Way, our LEAN operating system. Most of the coverage about Consumers Energy Way has been about the benefit of those cost savings. My story for this month, however, demonstrates the power of the CE Way to not only reduce cost and waste elimination but also to enable better system performance and areas liability to the benefit of our customers. You know we've been in business for 130 years, and yet, we still find things we can improve every single day. About a year ago, we realized that our approach to improving reliability was just not working as fast as you want it, so we stepped back and leveraging our CE Way playbook, we capitaled the systemic issue in a whole new way. The result speaks for itself. In spite of challenging wider and some activity, we had our best system reliability ever recorded this quarter. Our talented team tackled the problem through the use of data and applied problem solving techniques, and as a result, we improved the prioritization of capital investments on our worst-performing circuits, we actually call those our dirty 30. We had more targeted tree trimming and we realized more effectively engineer animal mitigation at our substation. Yes, the CE Way even helps us protect our local craters. This core needed effort resulted in 40% improvement and the liability for this quarter versus our last 10 year average. Every dollar we spend is more effective. The waste is eliminated, and our customers have a better experience. I'm sure this sounds simplistic, but when we apply the CE Way every day all across our system in big and small we, we fuel our simple but powerful business model, higher value at lower cost built on our consistent past and yields a sustainable future that you and your clients can count on. Now I'll turn the call over to Rejji."

We now have visited this time of the year for the investment community, and as such, we greatly appreciate your interest in our company. As posted earlier this morning, we reported $0.61 earnings per share on",1143,"Thank you, Patti, and good morning, everyone. We now have visited this time of the year for the investment community, and as such, we greatly appreciate your interest in our company. As posted earlier this morning, we reported $0.61 earnings per share on a GAAP basis for the 3rd quarter and $0.62 per share on an adjusted basis. Our 3rd quarter results are down $0.08 from last year, largely due to continued mild weather, however, on a weather normalized basis, adjusted EPS per quarter was up 7% year-over-year. Year-to-date, we reported per-share earnings per share $1.65 on a GAAP basis and $1.66 on adjusted basis, which is down $0.07 in the prior year due to mild weather and significant productivity, but up 8% year-over-year on a weather normalized basis. We remain quite pleased with our performance to-date, which is $0.16 per share, ahead of plan, largely due to favorable sales mix and strong cost performance. We're well on track to meet our annual financial objectives, and as a result, as Patti highlighted, we decide to raise low end of our 2017 EPS guidance range, so revised range is now $2.15 to $2.18 per share. 
As you can see on the waterfall chart on Slide 8, weathering storms have negatively impacted year-to-date results by $0.24 per share. As noted, we have largely offset those impacts through strong cost performance and favorable sales mix, coupled with rate relief and our performance at enterprises which positions us well for the fourth quarter. As we look ahead to the remainder of the year, you'll note that the regulatory outcomes achieved this year, including the aforementioned electric way case self implementation of $130 million provided $0.08 of pickup relative to last year, which gets us over 1/3 of the way home. As we've discussed in the past, in the fourth quarter of 2016, we took on a number of discretionary reinvestment activities which equated to $0.14 per share on aggregate that we do not need to replicate this year. But some of those 2 factors alone put us within the applied range for quality EPS outperformance versus Q4 of 2016 to meet our revised 2017 EPS guidance range. Consequently,, we have a great deal of functionality and the final month of the year to manage weather uncertainty and towards reinvestment business to support our future financial and operational objectives. 
Our 2017 EPS outlook curve on Slide 9 embodies our efforts today and the good financial flexibility that we have going into the 4th quarter. As you know, weather and storms ever hurt us in every quarter this year and every quarter and we responded with sound operational and financial planning to stay on course to meet our financial objectives while delivering world-class customer experience. As mentioned, favorable sales mix has been in for today and we supplemented that with strong cost performance, including lower than them plan financing cost, higher energy efficiency incentives and strong property and income tax planned. As always, every year offers rating levels of uncertainty such as weather and storm activity, but we've always managed to work and driven cost savings to position ourselves well to deliver another year of consistent financial performance. As Patti noticed -- as Patti noted, our bias is to reinvest in the business, to stack the deck for the next year, and we are cautiously optimistic about our ability to do so again next year. In order to stay on this path over the long term, we remain focused on executing our capital planet utility going forward while self funding, roughly, 70% of that great-based growth. This approach minimizes customer rate impact and allows us to grow at 6% to 8% annually. This simple, but unique, business model has driven our historical success in offers a sustainable plan to deliver the triple bottom line in the years to come. At our Investor Day, we highlighted the current customer investment plan at $18 billion over 10 years. We also reiterated the incremental $7 billion of customer investment opportunities which is evenly split between infrastructure and supply investments. We have relatively large system and our proposed investments would improve system reliability and safety to the benefit of our customers and investors. We will look to execute on these incremental opportunities overtime, assuming we can continue to identify cost savings opportunities to fund such investments. As we said in the past, our key constraint is customer affordability and we do not intend to compromise that principal going forward. To that end, in order to fund autobus capital plan, we will continue to scour our savings opportunities. We've emphasized O&M as a key component of our cost-reduction strategy in the past and we'll continue to do so. But O&M only represents about $1 billion of, roughly, $5 billion cost structure, so we don't limit our thinking to just O&M. For example, future expirations of above market EPS will reduce fuel and power supply cost and our clean and LEAN capital investment philosophy with productized model investments to reduce cost and allow us to adapt to changing your patterns. Through the CE Way, we will identify process improvements and efficiency to eliminate waste and we'll couple that with good business decision such as attrition management to reduce future O&M cost and we'll always seek opportunistic, nonoperating savings on our balance sheet or through good tax planning which will supplement operational efforts as we've done for the past several years. These are just a few examples that would enable us to reduce cost in the future for our customers and create headroom for future investments. 
Moving to operating cash flow, we've generated approximately $1.2 billion year-to-date and we feel good about our ability to deliver approximately $1.65 billion for the full year with steady growth thereafter. As a reminder, cash flow generation coupled with strong tax planning will enable us to fund our capital plan cost efficiently by avoiding lack equity issuances. 
On Slide 14, we show our historical EPS trajectory for the past 3 years and where we're headed. And it should come as no surprise that our guidance is consistent with the past and reflects our long-term growth aspirations. As we've done the past, we've raised the bottom end of this year's guidance and initiated next year's base in the midpoint. As you know, we grow up our actual results without adjusting for things like weather, or rebasing off our prior midpoint. Needless to say, we've been on the steady climb for more than a decade and we plan to continue to deliver well into the future. In closing, as we look ahead, we see a number of customer investments and cost-reduction opportunities that will enable us to continue to deliver to the bottom line of people, planet and profit by performance. And with that, we would like to open up for Q&A."

And so that is we've said has been a benefit in the past and should be an ongoing benefit in the years to come. So specifically, on average, we've got about 350 to 400 employee who turn over who are on to find benefit plans which, obviously, are not as cost-effective as defined perturbation plants and we froze those plans in the early [ oughts ] and now when we have new employees come in by definition there on to find contribution plans, we generally save about $40,000 per FTE when we have turnover between defined benefit plan employees and then defined contribution plans employees coming in. And so if you have $40,000 of savings per FTE and you turnover about $400 per year, that generates about $16 million of savings per year. And you think about our cost structure and the O&M side of the about $1 billion, that's got about 1.5% savings. And so that gets us a good portion of the way there. Obviously, we always look to do opportunistic refinancings and so we do have some high coupon bonds in our portfolio that we may look to be opportunistic around. And so that introduces opportunities for savings. And clearly, as mentioned before, we are always looking at tax planning opportunities on our property tax and income tax side. And so there's a variety of opportunities we look for. And then also, the mentioned because we're in reinvestment mode for the fourth quarter, this is the time of the year where we look for pool heads and if there are operational-related expenses that we have currently forecasted in 2018 that we can pull forward because we're trending more this year and we'll look to do that as well.

We'll be submitting a final plan in January. And as through that plan and this is what I think is really a great part of what the commission is leading right now, these longer-term viewpoints of where the right investments in infrastructure exist. And so what will -- filling in our IRP in the spring of next year in conjunction with his T&E distribution, in particular, 5-year modernization plan, we'll have a really good picture about with investment opportunities are and have some real alignment with the commission and agreement about what those investments will be. And frankly, because of the age and the size and scope of our system, we have internal competition with trying to decide where best to pull the dollars because there's so many parts of the distribution system and the supply system that acquired investment, and when you later in our gas, large gas system, we've got -- our consent is not to be a capital we can do, the constraint is customer's ability to pay, which is why we put so much emphasis on reducing the cost of that infrastructure in any way possible, so that we can provide more value for every dollar that we invest. And so that's where been working on. And so with the 5-year distribution plan and the IRP combined, we'll be able to build off that 5-year investment strategy in much more detailed and with a lot more certainty."

And so there's a lot of opportunities there, if you extrapolate on that math there, well in excess of the $25 million that we highlighted in our $18 billion 10-year plan plus $7 billion of upside opportunity. So there's a lot of capital investment opportunities. And as Patti noted, the key constraint is, obviously, affordability, so if we can accelerate the cost reduction or savings and that will allow us to execute on the upside opportunities as well."

So it was helpful but it's not we're hanging our hat on. And as always, we managed to work accordingly in the event we have unexpected variances like weather like storms and they should just another example of us identifying cost savings opportunities. So that's the quick answer to the last part of the questions. That's the initial part.

We actually feel like we're trending quite well on about the normalized basis. And as you may recall on our fourth quarter earnings call, we forecasted about 0.5% growth on the weather normalized electric shields. And that's net of energy efficiency programs. And if you look at the data on Page 13 of our pack, we're about, call it, 40 basis points. And what has been really in excess of our expectations has been the performance on the commercial side. And so you can see from a commercial perspective, we are about 1.5% up year-over-year. Industrial, which was down 1% in the first half of the year is now, basically, flat and so that's starting to turn around, so we're seeing good industrial activity. And residential was strong for the 1tg half of the year, up about 50 basis points or 0.5% and it's now about flat. But I think what the residential trends do not pick up in the third quarter is that, like most of the country, we had very nice weather and the latter part of September, which effectively is not picked up in a performance but will be picked up in October. So effectively, those sales are still on the meter. So we're trying not only on target to get to about 0.5% to 1% growth year-over-year by the end of the year, but also the sales mix has been quite favorable over the first half of the year and it continues on to this Q3.

I know that we saw many of your at our Investor Day on September 25th and we'll see many of you at EEI, so I'll be brief this morning. But we do have a few updates to share, including our results for the quarter, and not to worry, we have another exciting story of the month. Rejji will walk you through the financial results and our outlook. 
We're happy to announce that for the first 9 months of 2017, we reported $1.66 of adjusted EPS. On a weather normalized basis, this is up 8% from last year. Despite challenging weather and storms through the year, we are well on track to meet our guidance, and we're raising our bottom end of our top -- of our full year guidance from $2.14 to $2.15 per share. Our top end remains unchanged at $2.18 per share. 
We're also introducing 2018 full year guidance of $2.29 to $2.33 per share, which implies another year of 6% to 8% annual growth.
Now this is a good opportunity for me to remind you what we mean when we say 6% to 8%. For 14 years in a row, we have delivered 7%, so it would be easy to assume that we when moved from 5% to 7% to 6% to 8%, we meant to imply 8%. What we actually signaled is our confidence in 7%, and frankly, we took 5% off the table. Our self funding model and our adaptability under a variety of changing conditions each year puts us in a unique position to deliver sustainable 6% to 8% annual growth. This is why we have confidence in the midpoint of our range. 
In years where we have particularly strong performance and don't have higher priorities for reinvestment, we could go to the high end. However, our bias is to reinvest in the business and to stack the deck for next year and deliver our growth trajectory for longer. We know it is both our growth rate and the consistency of it that is valued. To that end, we remain unwavering in our commitment to the triple bottom line. Our focus on people, planet and profit underpinned by our performance will deliver the consistent and sustainable results that you have come to expect. When we say people, we're referring to our customers, our coworkers, our communities, and of course, our investors. Driving economic development in Michigan is a great way to enable growth and to serve the people of Michigan. We know that when Michigan wins, our business wins. It's a competitive environment and these large site selection efforts and Michigan is winning. In part, due to the speed of our in-house economic development team which has identified 23 energy-ready sites, so that when a company wants to locate here, we can quickly help them find a site that's available and best suited to their needs. For example, we were pleased that when Lear Corporation, a large auto supplier was looking for a place to locate a new manufacturing facility, we were ready. As a result, Lear recently announced plans to invest in a new plant in Flint, a community we are proud to serve. This is another win for Michigan creating approximately 450 new jobs. Turning to the planet, we're thrilled with the response to our renewable tariff. This program allows us to partner with our large business customers to meet their commitment to renewable energy at a very competitive price. We're already looking for ways to expand this program to keep up with our customers demand and partner with them to protect the planet. Finally, our commitment to people and the planet can be fulfilled without the critical capital that you have all provided. We know that pensioners, retirees and moms and pops have entrusted you with their life savings to invest in safe and reliable places. We want you to count on us to be just that sort of place. Therefore, we are equally committed to delivering consistent and predictable financial results. We continue to progress on the regulatory agenda and look for ways to support longer-term planning. The 2016 energy law creates a framework for the governor's long-term energy plan and our commission has been systematically implementing the different elements of it. For example, we'll be filing our integrated resource plan required by the new law next year. Combined with the commissions ordered 5-year electric distribution plan, we'll be providing a vivid picture of the future replacements, upgrades and enhancements to our large and aging electric supply and distribution system in partnership with the commission and its staff, yielding more transparency and regulatory certainty going forward. Our rate cases remain on track. Our gas rate case was approved at $29 million and it included and expanded $18 million capital tracking mechanism. We plan to file our upcoming gas case in the next couple of weeks. Our new electric rates were self implemented at $130 million on October 1. We expect a final order in March of 2018. These rate cases enabled the infrastructure improvement that deliver real value to our customers and reflect the cost savings that help reduce the price of that infrastructure. One way we're driving our ongoing cost savings is through the implementation of the Consumers Energy Way, our lean operating system. Most of the coverage about the Consumers Energy Way has been about the benefits of those cost savings. My story for this month, however, demonstrates the power of the CE Way to not only reduce cost through waste elimination but also to enable better system performance and areas like electric reliability to the benefit of our customers. You know we've been in business for 130 years, and yet, we still find things we can improve every single day. About a year ago, we realized that our approach to improving reliability was just not working as fast as we wanted, so we stepped back and leveraging our CE Way playbook, we [ catapulted ] the systemic issue in a whole new way. The result speaks for themselves. In spite of challenging weather and storm activity, we had our best system reliability ever recorded this quarter. Our talented team tackled the problem through the use of data and applied problem solving techniques, and as a result, we improved the prioritization of capital investments on our worst-performing circuits, we actually call those our Dirty Thirty. We had more targeted tree trimming and we realized that we could effectively engineer animal mitigation at our substations. Yes, the CE Way even helps us protect our local craters. This coordinated effort resulted in a 40% improvement in reliability for this quarter versus our last 10 year average. Every dollar we spend is more effective. The waste is eliminated, and our customers have a better experience. I'm sure this sounds simplistic, but when we apply the CE Way every day all across our system in big and small way, we fuel our simple but powerful business model, higher value at lower cost built on our consistent past and yields a sustainable future that you and your clients can count on. Now I'll turn the call over to Rejji."

We now are busy, this time of the year is for the investment community, and as such, we greatly appreciate your interest in our company. As posted earlier this morning, we reported $0.61 earnings per share on",1161,"Thank you, Patti, and good morning, everyone. We now are busy, this time of the year is for the investment community, and as such, we greatly appreciate your interest in our company. As posted earlier this morning, we reported $0.61 earnings per share on a GAAP basis for the third quarter and $0.62 per share on an adjusted basis. Our third quarter results are down $0.08 from last year, largely due to continued mild weather, however, on a weather-normalized basis, adjusted EPS for the quarter was up 7% year-over-year. Year-to-date, we reported per-share earnings per share of $1.65 on a GAAP basis and $1.66 on an adjusted basis, which is down $0.07 from the prior year due to mild weather and significant storm activity, but up 8% year-over-year on a weather-normalized basis. We remain quite pleased with our performance to-date, which is $0.16 per share, ahead of plan, largely due to favorable sales mix and strong cost performance. We're well on track to meet our annual financial objectives, and as a result, as Patti highlighted, we decide to raise low end of our 2017 EPS guidance range, so our revised range is now $2.15 to $2.18 per share.
As you can see on the waterfall chart on Slide 8, weather and storms have negatively impacted our year-to-date results by $0.24 per share. As noted, we have largely offset those impacts through strong cost performance and favorable sales mix, coupled as rate relief and our performance at enterprises which positions us well for the fourth quarter. As we look ahead to the remainder of the year, you'll note that the regulatory outcomes achieved this year, including the aforementioned electric rate case self implementation of $130 million provided $0.08 of pickup relative to last year, which gets us over 1/3 of the way home. As we've discussed in the past, in the fourth quarter of 2016, we took on a number of discretionary reinvestment activities which equated to $0.14 per share on aggregate that we do not need to replicate this year. But some of those 2 factors alone put us within the implied range for required EPS outperformance versus Q4 of 2016 to meet our revised 2017 EPS guidance range. Consequently, we have a great deal of optionality in the final month of the year to manage weather uncertainty and/or to reinvestment business to support our future financial and operational objectives. 
Our 2017 EPS outlook curve on Slide 9 embodies our efforts to date and the goods financial flexibility that we have going into the 4th quarter. As you'll know, weather and storms have hurt us in every quarter this year. And every quarter, we've responded with sound operational and financial planning to stay on course to meet our financial objectives while delivering world-class customer experience. As mentioned, favorable sales mix has been helpful to date and we have supplemented that with strong cost performance, including lower than them planned financing cost, higher energy efficiency incentives and strong property and income tax planned. As always, every year offers varying levels of uncertainty such as weather and storm activity, but we've always managed to work and driven cost savings to position ourselves well to deliver another year of consistent financial performance. As Patti noticed -- as Patti noted, our bias is to reinvest in the business, to stack the deck for the next year, and we are cautiously optimistic about our ability to do so again next year. In order to stay on this path over the long term, we remain focused on executing our capital planet utility going forward while self funding, roughly, 70% of that rate-based growth. This approach minimizes customer rate impact and allows us to grow at 6% to 8% annually. This simple, but unique, business model has driven our historical success in offers a sustainable plan to deliver the triple bottom line in the years to come. At our Investor Day, we highlighted the current customer investment plan at $18 billion over 10 years. We also reiterated the incremental $7 billion of customer investment opportunities which is evenly split between infrastructure and supply investments. We have a relatively large and old system and our proposed investments would improve system reliability and safety to the benefit of our customers and investors. We will look to execute on these incremental opportunities overtime, assuming we can continue to identify cost savings opportunities to fund such investments. As we've said in the past, our key constraint is customer affordability and we do not intend to compromise that principal going forward. To that end, in order to fund our robust capital plan, we will continue to scour our cost structure for savings opportunities. We've emphasized O&M as a key component of our cost-reduction strategy in the past and we'll continue to do so. But O&M only represents about $1 billion of, roughly, $5 billion cost structure, so we don't limit our thinking to just O&M. For example, future expirations of above market PPAs will reduce fuel and power supply cost and our clean and lean capital investment philosophy will prioritize modular investments to reduce cost and allow us to adapt to changing load patterns. Through the CE Way, we will identify process improvements and efficiencies to eliminate waste and we'll couple that with good business decisions such as attrition management to reduce future O&M cost and we'll always seek opportunistic, nonoperating savings on our balance sheet or through good tax planning to supplement our operational efforts as we've done to the past several years. These are just a few examples that would enable us to reduce cost well into the future for our customers and create headroom for future investments. 
Moving to operating cash flow, we've generated approximately $1.2 billion year-to-date and we feel good about our ability to deliver approximately $1.65 billion for the full year with steady growth thereafter. As a reminder, our cash flow generation coupled with strong tax planning will enable us to fund our capital plan cost efficiently by avoiding black equity issuances.
On Slide 14, we show our historical EPS trajectory for the past few years and where we're headed. And it should come as no surprise that our guidance is consistent with the past and reflects our long-term growth aspirations. As we've done the past, we've raised the bottom end of this year's guidance and initiated next year's base in the midpoint. As you know, we grow up our actual results without adjusting for things like weather, or rebasing off a prior midpoint. Needless to say, we've been on the steady climb for more than a decade and we plan to continue to deliver well into the future. In closing, as we look ahead, we see a number of customer investments and cost-reduction opportunities that will enable us to continue to deliver the triple bottom line of people, planet and profit underpinned by performance. And with that, we would like to open it up for Q&A."

And so when we talk about, particularly, O&M cost-reduction opportunities, we've talked in the past about very nice annuity that we gotten through attrition management over the years. And so that has been something that we've said has been a benefit in the past, and should be an ongoing benefit in the years to come. So specifically, on average, we've got about 350 to 400 employee who turn over, who are on defined benefit plans, which obviously are not as cost-effective as defined contribution plans and we froze those plans in their early aughts. And so now when we have new employees come in, by definition they are on defined contribution plans. We generally save about $40,000 per FTE when we have turnover between defined benefit plan employees and then defined contribution plans employees coming in. And so if you have $40,000 of savings per FTE and you turnover about $400 per year, that generates about $16 million of savings per year. And you think about our cost structure and the O&M side of about $1 billion, that's got about 1.5% savings. And so that gets us a good portion of the way there. Obviously, we always look to do opportunistic refinancings and so we do have some high coupon bonds in our portfolio that we may look to be opportunistic around. And so that introduces opportunities for savings. And clearly, as mentioned before, we are always looking at tax planning opportunities on the property tax or income tax side. And so there's a variety of opportunities we look for. And then also as I mentioned, because we're in reinvestment mode for the fourth quarter, this is the time of the year where we look for pull-aheads and if there are operational-related expenses that we have currently forecasted in 2018 that we can pull forward because we're trending well this year, we'll look to do that as well. So that's a small list of the opportunities that we have before us, Julian."

But we would feel good about our ability to hit our fourth quarter full year, and then going forward, feel good about hitting our financial objectives, irrespective of whether this tax opportunity came about. The reality is, we're $0.16 ahead of plan and the tax savings that we realized in this quarter would have -- absent that, would have still be about $0.10 ahead of plan. So it was helpful but it's not where hanging our hat on. And as always, we managed to work accordingly in the event we have unexpected variances like weather like storms and this is just yet another example of us identifying cost savings opportunities. So that's sort of quick answer to the last part of the questions. As for the initial part, we've actually been evaluating this deferred income tax reduction opportunity for some time and what allowed us to take advantage of it this quarter was that there were couple legal precedents that emerged that allowed us -- and [indiscernible] more disclosure around this in the cube but allowed us to revisit our methodology for portioning electric sales into MISO and that's really the gist of why we took advantage of this opportunity now."

We actually feel like we're trending quite well on weather normalized basis. And so as you may recall on our fourth quarter earnings call, we forecasted about 0.5% growth on the weather normalized electric sales. And that's net of energy efficiency programs. And if you look at the data on Page 13 of our pack, we're about, call it, 40 basis points. And what has been really in excess of our expectations has been the performance on the commercial side. And so you can see from a commercial perspective, we are about 1.5% up year-over-year. Industrial, which was down 1% in the first half of the year is now, basically, flat and so that's starting to turn around, so we're seeing good industrial activity. And residential was strong for the first half of the year, up about 50 basis points or 0.5% and it's now about flat. But I think what the residential trends do not pick up in the third quarter is that, like most of the country, we had very nice weather and the latter part of September, which effectively is not picked up in our performance but will be picked up in October. So effectively, those sales are still on the meter. So we're trending not only on target to get to about 0.5% to 1% growth year-over-year by the end of the year, but also the sales mix has been quite favorable over the first half of the year and it continues on to this Q3. So we're very pleased, actually, with the performance to-date. Is that helpful?"

But we obviously, as we always do, we pass this on as quickly as we can through the annual rate filings.

I know that we saw many of your at our Investor Day on September 25th and we'll see many of you at EEI, so I'll be brief this morning. But we do have a few updates to share, including our results for the quarter, and not to worry, we have another exciting story of the month. Rejji will walk you through the financial results and our outlook. 
We're happy to announce that for the first 9 months of 2017, we reported $1.66 of adjusted EPS. On a weather normalized basis, this is up 8% from last year. Despite challenging weather and storms through the year, we are well on track to meet our guidance, and we're raising our bottom end of our top -- of our full year guidance from $2.14 to $2.15 per share. Our top end remains unchanged at $2.18 per share. 
We're also introducing 2018 full year guidance of $2.29 to $2.33 per share, which implies another year of 6% to 8% annual growth.
Now this is a good opportunity for me to remind you what we mean when we say 6% to 8%. For 14 years in a row, we have delivered 7%, so it would be easy to assume that we when moved from 5% to 7% to 6% to 8%, we meant to imply 8%. What we actually signaled is our confidence in 7%, and frankly, we took 5% off the table. Our self funding model and our adaptability under a variety of changing conditions each year puts us in a unique position to deliver sustainable 6% to 8% annual growth. This is why we have confidence in the midpoint of our range. 
In years where we have particularly strong performance and don't have higher priorities for reinvestment, we could go to the high end. However, our bias is to reinvest in the business and to stack the deck for next year and deliver our growth trajectory for longer. We know it is both our growth rate and the consistency of it that is valued. To that end, we remain unwavering in our commitment to the triple bottom line. Our focus on people, planet and profit underpinned by our performance will deliver the consistent and sustainable results that you have come to expect. When we say people, we're referring to our customers, our coworkers, our communities, and of course, our investors. Driving economic development in Michigan is a great way to enable growth and to serve the people of Michigan. We know that when Michigan wins, our business wins. It's a competitive environment and these large site selection efforts and Michigan is winning. In part, due to the speed of our in-house economic development team which has identified 23 energy-ready sites, so that when a company wants to locate here, we can quickly help them find a site that's available and best suited to their needs. For example, we were pleased that when Lear Corporation, a large auto supplier was looking for a place to locate a new manufacturing facility, we were ready. As a result, Lear recently announced plans to invest in a new plant in Flint, a community we are proud to serve. This is another win for Michigan creating approximately 450 new jobs. Turning to the planet, we're thrilled with the response to our renewable tariff. This program allows us to partner with our large business customers to meet their commitment to renewable energy at a very competitive price. We're already looking for ways to expand this program to keep up with our customers demand and partner with them to protect the planet. Finally, our commitment to people and the planet can't be fulfilled without the critical capital that you have all provided. We know that pensioners, retirees and moms and pops have entrusted you with their life savings to invest in safe and reliable places. We want you to count on us to be just that sort of place. Therefore, we are equally committed to delivering consistent and predictable financial results. We continue to progress on the regulatory agenda and look for ways to support longer-term planning. The 2016 energy law creates a framework for the governor's long-term energy plan and our commission has been systematically implementing the different elements of it. For example, we'll be filing our integrated resource plan required by the new law next year. Combined with the commissions ordered 5-year electric distribution plan, we'll be providing a vivid picture of the future replacements, upgrades and enhancements to our large and aging electric supply and distribution system in partnership with the commission and its staff, yielding more transparency and regulatory certainty going forward. Our rate cases remain on track. Our gas rate case was approved at $29 million and it included and expanded $18 million capital tracking mechanism. We plan to file our upcoming gas case in the next couple of weeks. Our new electric rates were self implemented at $130 million on October 1. We expect a final order in March of 2018. These rate cases enable the infrastructure improvement that deliver real value to our customers and reflect the cost savings that help reduce the price of that infrastructure. One way we're driving our ongoing cost savings is through the implementation of the Consumers Energy Way, our lean operating system. Most of the coverage about the Consumers Energy Way has been about the benefits of those cost savings. My story for this month, however, demonstrates the power of the CE Way to not only reduce cost through waste elimination but also to enable better system performance and areas like electric reliability to the benefit of our customers. You know we've been in business for 130 years, and yet, we still find things we can improve every single day. About a year ago, we realized that our approach to improving reliability was just not working as fast as we wanted, so we stepped back and leveraging our CE Way playbook, we tackled the systemic issue in a whole new way. The result speaks for themselves. In spite of challenging weather and storm activity, we had our best system reliability ever recorded this quarter. Our talented team tackled the problem through the use of data and applied problem solving techniques, and as a result, we improved the prioritization of capital investments on our worst-performing circuits, we actually call those our Dirty Thirty. We had more targeted tree trimming and we realized that we could effectively engineer animal mitigation at our substations. Yes, the CE Way even helps us protect our local critters. This coordinated effort resulted in a 40% improvement in reliability for this quarter versus our last 10 year average. Every dollar we spend is more effective. The waste is eliminated, and our customers have a better experience. I'm sure this sounds simplistic, but when we apply the CE Way every day all across our system in big and small ways, we fuel our simple but powerful business model, higher value at lower cost built on our consistent past and yields a sustainable future that you and your clients can count on. Now I'll turn the call over to Rejji."
257682,540508975,1321466,"CMS Energy Corporation, Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2017",2017-10-26,"Earnings Calls","CMS Energy Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Patti, and good morning, everyone. We know how busy, this time of the year is for the investment community, and as such, we greatly appreciate your interest in our company. As posted earlier this morning, we reported $0.61 earnings per share on",1162,"Thank you, Patti, and good morning, everyone. We know how busy, this time of the year is for the investment community, and as such, we greatly appreciate your interest in our company. As posted earlier this morning, we reported $0.61 earnings per share on a GAAP basis for the third quarter and $0.62 per share on an adjusted basis. Our third quarter results are down $0.08 from last year, largely due to continued mild weather, however, on a weather-normalized basis, adjusted EPS for the quarter was up 7% year-over-year. Year-to-date, we reported per-share earnings per share of $1.65 on a GAAP basis and $1.66 on an adjusted basis, which is down $0.07 from the prior year due to mild weather and significant storm activity, but up 8% year-over-year on a weather-normalized basis. We remain quite pleased with our performance to-date, which is $0.16 per share, ahead of plan, largely due to favorable sales mix and strong cost performance. We're well on track to meet our annual financial objectives, and as a result, as Patti highlighted, we decide to raise the low end of our 2017 EPS guidance range, so our revised range is now $2.15 to $2.18 per share.
As you can see on the waterfall chart on Slide 8, weather and storms have negatively impacted our year-to-date results by $0.24 per share. As noted, we have largely offset those impacts through strong cost performance and favorable sales mix, coupled with rate relief and our performance at enterprises which positions us well for the fourth quarter. As we look ahead to the remainder of the year, you'll note that the regulatory outcomes achieved this year, including the aforementioned electric rate case self implementation of $130 million provided $0.08 of pickup relative to last year, which gets us over 1/3 of the way home. As we've discussed in the past, in the fourth quarter of 2016, we took on a number of discretionary reinvestment activities which equated to $0.14 per share on aggregate that we do not need to replicate this year. But some of those 2 factors alone put us within the implied range for required EPS outperformance versus Q4 of 2016 to meet our revised 2017 EPS guidance range. Consequently, we have a great deal of optionality in the final months of the year to manage weather uncertainty and/or to reinvestment business to support our future financial and operational objectives. 
Our 2017 EPS outlook curve on Slide 9 embodies our efforts to date and the goods financial flexibility that we have going into the 4th quarter. As you'll note, weather and storms have hurt us in every quarter this year. And every quarter, we've responded with sound operational and financial planning to stay on course to meet our financial objectives while delivering world-class customer experience. As mentioned, favorable sales mix has been helpful to date and we have supplemented that with strong cost performance, including lower than planned financing cost, higher energy efficiency incentives and strong property and income tax planned. As always, every year offers varying levels of uncertainty such as weather and storm activity, but we've always managed to work and driven cost savings to position ourselves well to deliver another year of consistent financial performance. As Patti noticed -- as Patti noted, our bias is to reinvest in the business, to stack the deck for the next year, and we are cautiously optimistic about our ability to do so again this year. In order to stay on this path over the long term, we remain focused on executing on our capital planet utility going forward while self funding, roughly, 70% of that rate-based growth. This approach minimizes customer rate impact and allows us to grow at 6% to 8% annually. This simple, but unique, business model has driven our historical success and offers a sustainable plan to deliver the triple bottom line in the years to come. At our Investor Day, we highlighted the current customer investment plan at $18 billion over 10 years. We also reiterated the incremental $7 billion of customer investment opportunities which is evenly split between infrastructure and supply investments. We have a relatively large and old system and our proposed investments would improve system reliability and safety to the benefit of our customers and investors. We will look to execute on these incremental opportunities overtime, assuming we can continue to identify cost savings opportunities to fund such investments. As we've said in the past, our key constraint is customer affordability and we do not intend to compromise that principal going forward. To that end, in order to fund our robust capital plan, we will continue to scour our cost structure for savings opportunities. We've emphasized O&M as a key component of our cost-reduction strategy in the past and we'll continue to do so. But O&M only represents about $1 billion of, roughly, $5 billion cost structure, so we don't limit our thinking to just O&M. For example, future expirations of above market PPAs will reduce fuel and power supply cost and our clean and lean capital investment philosophy will prioritize modular investments to reduce cost and allow us to adapt to changing load patterns. Through the CE Way, we will identify process improvements and efficiencies to eliminate waste and we'll couple that with good business decisions such as attrition management to reduce future O&M cost and we'll always seek opportunistic, nonoperating savings on our balance sheet or through good tax planning to supplement our operational efforts as we've done to the past several years. These are just a few examples that would enable us to reduce cost well into the future for our customers and create headroom for future investments. 
Moving to operating cash flow, we've generated approximately $1.2 billion year-to-date and we feel good about our ability to deliver approximately $1.65 billion for the full year with steady growth thereafter. As a reminder, our cash flow generation coupled with strong tax planning will enable us to fund our capital plan cost efficiently by avoiding black equity issuances.
On Slide 14, we show our historical EPS trajectory for the past few years and where we're headed. And it should come as no surprise that our guidance is consistent with the past and reflects our long-term growth aspirations. As we've done the past, we've raised the bottom end of this year's guidance and initiated next year's base in the midpoint. As you know, we grow up our actual results without adjusting for things like weather, or rebasing off a prior midpoint. Needless to say, we've been on the steady climb for more than a decade and we plan to continue to deliver well into the future. In closing, as we look ahead, we see a number of customer investments and cost-reduction opportunities that will enable us to continue to deliver the triple bottom line of people, planet and profit underpinned by performance. And with that, we would like to open it up for Q&A."

And so when we talk about, particularly, O&M cost-reduction opportunities, we've talked in the past about the very nice annuity that we gotten through attrition management over the years. And so that has been something that we've said has been a benefit in the past, and should be an ongoing benefit in the years to come. So specifically, on average, we've got about 350 to 400 employees who turn over, who are on defined benefit plans, which obviously are not as cost-effective as defined contribution plans and we froze those plans in their early aughts. And so now when we have new employees come in, by definition they are on defined contribution plans. We generally save about $40,000 per FTE when we have turnover between defined benefit plan employees and then defined contribution plans employees coming in. And so if you have $40,000 of savings per FTE and you turnover about $400 per year, that generates about $16 million of savings per year. And you think about our cost structure and the O&M side of about $1 billion, that's got about 1.5% savings. And so that gets us a good portion of the way there. Obviously, we always look to do opportunistic refinancings and so we do have some high coupon bonds in our portfolio that we may look to be opportunistic around. And so that introduces opportunities for savings. And clearly, as mentioned before, we are always looking at tax planning opportunities on the property tax or income tax side. And so there's a variety of opportunities we look for. And then also as I mentioned, because we're in reinvestment mode for the fourth quarter, this is the time of the year where we look for pull-aheads and if there are operational-related expenses that we have currently forecasted in 2018 that we can pull forward because we're trending well this year, we'll look to do that as well. So that's a small list of the opportunities that we have before us, Julian."

And so what will -- filling in our IRP in the spring of next year in conjunction with this T&D distribution, in particular, 5-year modernization plan, we'll have a really good picture about where the investment opportunities are and have some real alignment with the commission and agreement about what those investments will be. And frankly, because of the age and the size and scope of our system, we have internal competition with trying to decide where best to put the dollars because there's so many parts of the distribution system and the supply system that require investment. And then when you layer in our gas, our large gas system, we've got -- our constraint is not ""Do we have capital we can do?"" The constraint is customer's ability to pay, which is why we put so much emphasis on reducing the cost of that infrastructure in any way possible, so that we can provide more value for every dollar that we invest.

And if you look at the data on Page 13 of our pack, we're about, call it, 40 basis points. And what has been really in excess of our expectations has been the performance on the commercial side. And so you can see from a commercial perspective, we are about 1.5% up year-over-year. Industrial, which was down 1% in the first half of the year is now, basically, flat and so that's starting to turn around, so we're seeing good industrial activity. And residential was strong for the first half of the year, up about 50 basis points or 0.5% and it's now about flat. But I think what the residential trends do not pick up in the third quarter is that, like most of the country, we had very nice weather and the latter part of September, which effectively is not picked up in our performance but will be picked up in October. So effectively, those sales are still on the meter. So we're trending not only on target to get to about 0.5% to 1% of growth year-over-year by the end of the year, but also the sales mix has been quite favorable over the first half of the year and it continues on to this Q3.

A lot of people do point to our business model and I love it and it's straightforward and I can see why we would. But one of the core strengths of this company, and Rejji highlighted it in his remarks, is the fact that no matter what comes we managed to work it out because we don't have big bets, because we're not waiting on one big regulatory outcome because we're not waiting on one big project to get approved, we can adapt to make those changes throughout the year and manage to deliver for all of you.

I know that we saw many of your at our Investor Day on September 25th and we'll see many of you at EEI, so I'll be brief this morning. But we do have a few updates to share, including our results for the quarter, and not to worry, we have another exciting story of the month. Rejji will walk you through the financial results and our outlook. 
We're happy to announce that for the first 9 months of 2017, we reported $1.66 of adjusted EPS. On a weather normalized basis, this is up 8% from last year. Despite challenging weather and storms through the year, we are well on track to meet our guidance, and we're raising our bottom end of our top -- of our full year guidance from $2.14 to $2.15 per share. Our top end remains unchanged at $2.18 per share. 
We're also introducing 2018 full year guidance of $2.29 to $2.33 per share, which implies another year of 6% to 8% annual growth.
Now this is a good opportunity for me to remind you what we mean when we say 6% to 8%. For 14 years in a row, we have delivered 7%, so it would be easy to assume that we when moved from 5% to 7% to 6% to 8%, we meant to imply 8%. What we actually signaled is our confidence in 7%, and frankly, we took 5% off the table. Our self-funding model and our adaptability under a variety of changing conditions each year puts us in a unique position to deliver sustainable 6% to 8% annual growth. This is why we have confidence in the midpoint of our range. 
In years where we have particularly strong performance and don't have higher priorities for reinvestment, we could go to the high end. However, our bias is to reinvest in the business and to stack the deck for next year and deliver our growth trajectory for longer. We know it is both our growth rate and the consistency of it that is valued. To that end, we remain unwavering in our commitment to the triple bottom line. Our focus on people, planet and profit underpinned by our performance will deliver the consistent and sustainable results that you have come to expect. When we say people, we're referring to our customers, our coworkers, our communities, and of course, our investors. Driving economic development in Michigan is a great way to enable growth and to serve the people of Michigan. We know that when Michigan wins, our business wins. It's a competitive environment and these large site selection efforts and Michigan is winning. In part, due to the speed of our in-house economic development team which has identified 23 energy-ready sites, so that when a company wants to locate here, we can quickly help them find a site that's available and best suited to their needs. For example, we were pleased that when Lear Corporation, a large auto supplier was looking for a place to locate a new manufacturing facility, we were ready. As a result, Lear recently announced plans to invest in a new plant in Flint, a community we are proud to serve. This is another win for Michigan creating approximately 450 new jobs. Turning to the planet, we're thrilled with the response to our renewable tariff. This program allows us to partner with our large business customers to meet their commitment to renewable energy at a very competitive price. We're already looking for ways to expand this program to keep up with our customers demand and partner with them to protect the planet. Finally, our commitment to people and the planet can't be fulfilled without the critical capital that you have all provided. We know that pensioners, retirees and moms and pops have entrusted you with their life savings to invest in safe and reliable places. We want you to count on us to be just that sort of place. Therefore, we are equally committed to delivering consistent and predictable financial results. We continue to progress on the regulatory agenda and look for ways to support longer-term planning. The 2016 energy law creates a framework for the governor's long-term energy plan and our commission has been systematically implementing the different elements of it. For example, we'll be filing our integrated resource plan required by the new law next year. Combined with the commissions ordered 5-year electric distribution plan, we'll be providing a vivid picture of the future replacements, upgrades and enhancements to our large and aging electric supply and distribution system in partnership with the commission and its staff, yielding more transparency and regulatory certainty going forward. Our rate cases remain on track. Our gas rate case was approved at $29 million and it included and expanded $18 million capital tracking mechanism. We plan to file our upcoming gas case in the next couple of weeks. Our new electric rates were self-implemented at $130 million on October 1. We expect a final order in March of 2018. These rate cases enable the infrastructure improvement that deliver real value to our customers and reflect the cost savings that help reduce the price of that infrastructure. One way we're driving our ongoing cost savings is through the implementation of the Consumers Energy Way, our lean operating system. Most of the coverage about the Consumers Energy Way has been about the benefits of those cost savings. My story for this month, however, demonstrates the power of the CE Way to not only reduce cost through waste elimination but also to enable better system performance and areas like electric reliability to the benefit of our customers. You know we've been in business for 130 years, and yet, we still find things we can improve every single day. About a year ago, we realized that our approach to improving reliability was just not working as fast as we wanted, so we stepped back and leveraging our CE Way playbook, we tackled the systemic issue in a whole new way. The result speaks for themselves. In spite of challenging weather and storm activity, we had our best system reliability ever recorded this quarter. Our talented team tackled the problem through the use of data and applied problem solving techniques, and as a result, we improved the prioritization of capital investments on our worst-performing circuits, we actually call those our Dirty Thirty. We had more targeted tree trimming and we realized that we could effectively engineer animal mitigation at our substations. Yes, the CE Way even helps us protect our local critters. This coordinated effort resulted in a 40% improvement in reliability for this quarter versus our last 10 year average. Every dollar we spend is more effective. The waste is eliminated, and our customers have a better experience. I'm sure this sounds simplistic, but when we apply the CE Way every day all across our system in big and small ways, we fuel our simple but powerful business model, higher value at lower cost built on our consistent past and yields a sustainable future that you and your clients can count on. Now I'll turn the call over to Rejji."
257682,540508975,1323594,"CMS Energy Corporation, Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2017",2017-10-26,"Earnings Calls","CMS Energy Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Patti, and good morning, everyone. We know how busy, this time of the year is for the investment community, and as such, we greatly appreciate your interest in our company. As posted earlier this morning, we reported $0.61 earnings per share on",1160,"Thank you, Patti, and good morning, everyone. We know how busy, this time of the year is for the investment community, and as such, we greatly appreciate your interest in our company. As posted earlier this morning, we reported $0.61 earnings per share on a GAAP basis for the third quarter and $0.62 per share on an adjusted basis. Our third quarter results are down $0.08 from last year, largely due to continued mild weather, however, on a weather-normalized basis, adjusted EPS for the quarter was up 7% year-over-year. Year-to-date, we reported per-share earnings per share of $1.65 on a GAAP basis and $1.66 on an adjusted basis, which is down $0.07 from the prior year due to mild weather and significant storm activity, but up 8% year-over-year on a weather-normalized basis. We remain quite pleased with our performance to-date, which is $0.16 per share, ahead of plan, largely due to favorable sales mix and strong cost performance. We're well on track to meet our annual financial objectives, and as a result, as Patti highlighted, we decide to raise the low end of our 2017 EPS guidance range, so our revised range is now $2.15 to $2.18 per share.
As you can see on the waterfall chart on Slide 8, weather and storms have negatively impacted our year-to-date results by $0.24 per share. As noted, we have largely offset those impacts through strong cost performance and favorable sales mix, coupled with rate relief and our performance at enterprises which positions us well for the fourth quarter. As we look ahead to the remainder of the year, you'll note that the regulatory outcomes achieved this year, including the aforementioned electric rate case self-implementation of $130 million provided $0.08 of pickup relative to last year, which gets us over 1/3 of the way home. As we've discussed in the past, in the fourth quarter of 2016, we took on a number of discretionary reinvestment activities which equated to $0.14 per share on aggregate that we do not need to replicate this year. But some of those 2 factors alone put us within the implied range for required EPS outperformance versus Q4 of 2016 to meet our revised 2017 EPS guidance range. Consequently, we have a great deal of optionality in the final months of the year to manage weather uncertainty and/or to reinvestment business to support our future financial and operational objectives. 
Our 2017 EPS outlook curve on Slide 9 embodies our efforts to date and the goods financial flexibility that we have going into the 4th quarter. As you'll note, weather and storms have hurt us in every quarter this year. And every quarter, we've responded with sound operational and financial planning to stay on course to meet our financial objectives while delivering world-class customer experience. As mentioned, favorable sales mix has been helpful to date and we have supplemented that with strong cost performance, including lower than planned financing cost, higher energy efficiency incentives and strong property and income tax planned. As always, every year offers varying levels of uncertainty such as weather and storm activity, but we've always managed to work and driven cost savings to position ourselves well to deliver another year of consistent financial performance. As Patti noticed -- as Patti noted, our bias is to reinvest in the business, to stack the deck for the next year, and we are cautiously optimistic about our ability to do so again this year. In order to stay on this path over the long term, we remain focused on executing on our capital planet utility going forward while self-funding, roughly, 70% of that rate-based growth. This approach minimizes customer rate impact and allows us to grow at 6% to 8% annually. This simple, but unique, business model has driven our historical success and offers a sustainable plan to deliver the triple bottom line in the years to come. At our Investor Day, we highlighted the current customer investment plan at $18 billion over 10 years. We also reiterated the incremental $7 billion of customer investment opportunities which is evenly split between infrastructure and supply investments. We have a relatively large and old system and our proposed investments would improve system reliability and safety to the benefit of our customers and investors. We will look to execute on these incremental opportunities overtime, assuming we can continue to identify cost savings opportunities to fund such investments. As we've said in the past, our key constraint is customer affordability and we do not intend to compromise that principal going forward. To that end, in order to fund our robust capital plan, we will continue to scour our cost structure for savings opportunities. We've emphasized O&M as a key component of our cost-reduction strategy in the past and we'll continue to do so. But O&M only represents about $1 billion of, roughly, $5 billion cost structure, so we don't limit our thinking to just O&M. For example, future expirations of above market PPAs will reduce fuel and power supply cost and our clean and lean capital investment philosophy will prioritize modular investments to reduce cost and allow us to adapt to changing load patterns. Through the CE Way, we will identify process improvements and efficiencies to eliminate waste and we'll couple that with good business decisions such as attrition management to reduce future O&M cost and we'll always seek opportunistic, nonoperating savings on our balance sheet or through good tax planning to supplement our operational efforts as we've done to the past several years. These are just a few examples that would enable us to reduce cost well into the future for our customers and create headroom for future investments. 
Moving to operating cash flow, we've generated approximately $1.2 billion year-to-date and we feel good about our ability to deliver approximately $1.65 billion for the full year with steady growth thereafter. As a reminder, our cash flow generation coupled with strong tax planning will enable us to fund our capital plan cost efficiently by avoiding black equity issuances.
On Slide 14, we show our historical EPS trajectory for the past few years and where we're headed. And it should come as no surprise that our guidance is consistent with the past and reflects our long-term growth aspirations. As we've done the past, we've raised the bottom end of this year's guidance and initiated next year's base in the midpoint. As you know, we grow up our actual results without adjusting for things like weather, or rebasing off a prior midpoint. Needless to say, we've been on the steady climb for more than a decade and we plan to continue to deliver well into the future. In closing, as we look ahead, we see a number of customer investments and cost-reduction opportunities that will enable us to continue to deliver the triple bottom line of people, planet and profit underpinned by performance. And with that, we would like to open it up for Q&A."

And so when we talk about, particularly, O&M cost-reduction opportunities, we've talked in the past about the very nice annuity that we gotten through attrition management over the years. And so that has been something that we've said has been a benefit in the past, and should be an ongoing benefit in the years to come. So specifically, on average, we've got about 350 to 400 employees who turn over, who are on defined benefit plans, which obviously are not as cost-effective as defined contribution plans and we froze those plans in their early aughts. And so now when we have new employees come in, by definition they are on defined contribution plans. We generally save about $40,000 per FTE when we have turnover between defined benefit plan employees and then defined contribution plans employees coming in. And so if you have $40,000 of savings per FTE and you turnover about $400 per year, that generates about $16 million of savings per year. And you think about our cost structure and the O&M side of about $1 billion, that's got about 1.5% savings. And so that gets us a good portion of the way there. Obviously, we always look to do opportunistic refinancings and so we do have some high coupon bonds in our portfolio that we may look to be opportunistic around. And so that introduces opportunities for savings. And clearly, as mentioned before, we are always looking at tax planning opportunities on the property tax or income tax side. And so there's a variety of opportunities we look for. And then also as I mentioned, because we're in reinvestment mode for the fourth quarter, this is the time of the year where we look for pull-aheads and if there are operational-related expenses that we have currently forecasted in 2018 that we can pull forward because we're trending well this year, we'll look to do that as well. So that's a small list of the opportunities that we have before us, Julian."

And as through that plan -- and this is what I think is really a great part of what the commission is leading right now, these longer-term viewpoints of where the right investments in infrastructure exist. And so what will -- filling in our IRP in the spring of next year in conjunction with this T&D distribution, in particular, 5-year modernization plan, we'll have a really good picture about where the investment opportunities are and have some real alignment with the commission and agreement about what those investments will be. And frankly, because of the age and the size and scope of our system, we have internal competition with trying to decide where best to put the dollars because there's so many parts of the distribution system and the supply system that require investment. And then when you layer in our gas, our large gas system, we've got -- our constraint is not ""Do we have capital we can do?"" The constraint is customer's ability to pay, which is why we put so much emphasis on reducing the cost of that infrastructure in any way possible, so that we can provide more value for every dollar that we invest. And so that's where been working on. And so with the 5-year distribution plan and the IRP combined, we'll be able to build out that 5-year investment strategy in much more detail and with a lot more certainty."

And so there's a lot of opportunities there, if you extrapolate on that math, there well in excess of the $25 billion that we've highlighted in our $18 billion 10-year plan plus $7 billion of upside opportunity. So there's a lot of capital investment opportunities. And as Patti noted, the key constraint is, obviously, affordability, so if we can accelerate the cost reduction or savings and that will allow us to execute on the upside opportunities as well."

So it was helpful but it's not what where hanging our hat on.

We actually feel like we're trending quite well on a weather normalized basis. And so as you may recall on our fourth quarter earnings call, we forecasted about 0.5% growth on the weather normalized electric sales. And that's net of energy efficiency programs. And if you look at the data on Page 13 of our pack, we're about, call it, 40 basis points. And what has been really in excess of our expectations has been the performance on the commercial side. And so you can see from a commercial perspective, we are about 1.5% up year-over-year. Industrial, which was down 1% in the first half of the year is now, basically, flat and so that's starting to turn around, so we're seeing good industrial activity. And residential was strong for the first half of the year, up about 50 basis points or 0.5% and it's now about flat. But I think what the residential trends do not pick up in the third quarter is that, like most of the country, we had very nice weather and the latter part of September, which effectively is not picked up in our performance but will be picked up in October. So effectively, those sales are still on the meter. So we're trending not only on target to get to about 0.5% to 1% of growth year-over-year by the end of the year, but also the sales mix has been quite favorable over the first half of the year and it continues on to this Q3.
