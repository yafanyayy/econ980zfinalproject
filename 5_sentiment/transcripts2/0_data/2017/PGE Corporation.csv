2016 was a really pivotal year for PG&E. We continue to deliver strong operational and financial results and resolved a number of important regulatory and legal matters. We also announced that next month, Geisha Williams will be taking over as CEO and President of PG&E Corporation, and Nick Stavropoulos will be taking over as President and Chief Operating Officer of our Utility Pacific Gas & Electric. Both Geisha and Nick have done an outstanding job over the last several years and have established proven track records for delivering results, so I couldn't be more thrilled about their appointments and look forward to continuing to work with them in my capacity as Chairman. 
Today, I'm going to spend a few minutes reviewing some of the highlights from 2016, and then, I'll turn it over to Geisha for a few remarks, and then, Jason will walk us through the financials. 
So let me start with our safety and operational performance. In 2016, we experienced some of the most severe storms we've seen in years. While this is good news for our hydro generation and for the drought, it impacted our ability to meet our 2016 reliability targets. Despite all of the storms, however, we were still able to deliver the second-best electric reliability performance in the company's history. This was in part due to our continued investments in a modern self-healing grid that automatically isolates and minimizes customer outages. And we continued to strengthen our gas system by inspecting and upgrading hundreds of miles of transmission pipeline and replacing over 100 miles of distribution main. We also continued to deliver industry-leading results on our gas and electric emergency response times. 
On the customer side, I'm excited to share that our most recent J.D. Power results for our electric business customers improved to first quartile. Customers continue to notice and appreciate the operational improvements that we made. 
So turning to regulatory and legal issues. We made a lot of progress in 2016. In December, we received a final phase 2 decision in our gas transmission and storage rate case, which gives us certainty on our gas transmission revenues through 2018. In our general rate case, we're waiting for a proposed decision on our all-party settlement agreement. If approved, it will provide certainty on our gas and electric distribution and electric generation revenues through 2019. We also reached a settlement agreement in our cost of capital case. The terms include a 2-year extension, which takes us through the end of 2019, a true-up for authorized cost of debt beginning in 2018 and reinstatement of the trigger mechanism for 2019. We also agreed to reduce our return on equity from 10.4% to 10.25% beginning in 2018. We're hopeful the settlement will be approved in the coming months. 
I also want to acknowledge the recent decision in the criminal case. In January, the court sentenced us to a $3 million fine, a 5-year probation period, oversight by a third-party monitor and certain requirements related to advertising and community service. As you'll recall, last year, we announced we would not appeal the 5 integrity management counts. We've also now decided not to appeal the obstruction of justice count. As we focus on the future, I want to assure all of our stakeholders that the San Bruno incident has fundamentally changed the way we operate this company. We remain absolutely committed to ensuring that we meet the high safety standards that all of our stakeholders and we ourselves demand and expect. 
As we look to the future of the industry, despite the uncertainty at the federal level, California will continue to lead the way in transitioning to a clean energy economy. PG&E will be a critical partner in these efforts and is well-positioned to help the state achieve its goals. In 2016, nearly 70% of the energy we delivered was greenhouse gas-free. Nearly 33% of our portfolio was RPS eligible, which puts us about 4 years ahead of the state's 2020 target. We remain confident that we can meet or exceed our target of 55% renewable resources by 2031. 
We continue to have more electric vehicles and private rooftop solar installations in our service territory than anywhere else in the country. And with the transportation sector accounting for about 40% of California's greenhouse gas emissions, we expect to play a significant role in helping the state address these emissions by investing in the infrastructure necessary to enable electric vehicle adoption. To that end, last December, the commission authorized $130 million over the next 3 years to install the infrastructure necessary to support about 7,500 EV charging stations. In January, we filed a request to spend an additional $250 million, primarily for the infrastructure to support electrification of medium- and heavy-duty vehicles, like transit buses. The request also includes infrastructure for fast chargers as well as some smaller pilots. With the state targeting 1.5 million electric vehicles by 2025, we see the potential to expand these programs in the coming years. 
In closing, I want to say how much I have truly enjoyed leading this company over the last 5.5 years. The good news for me is that I will continue to work with one of the most talented executive teams in our industry as Executive Chairman. Geisha and Nick are absolutely the right people to lead this company into the future, and we have recently restructured the team to better take advantage of the opportunities we have in the coming years. 
So with that, let me turn it over to Geisha to share a few words."

He's done a tremendous job leading us through a challenging period and has really set us up for a successful future, so thank you, Tony, really, really appreciate all you've done. 
I also want to say how truly excited I am to lead this iconic company at such an amazing time in our industry. As we look forward, I'm going to be focused on 3 areas: first, and always first, continuing to build on the strong safety and operational progress we've made in the last several years; second, providing first class customer service and maintaining affordable bills so that we can be our customers' preferred provider of choice; and third, positioning PG&E for success within the changing utility industry, because as Tony said, California will continue to be at the forefront of this change. 
So it's really an exciting time to be in this industry, particularly here in California. We are confident in our ability to execute on a strong growth plan through continued investments in upgrading and modernizing our system as we help the state achieve its clean energy goals. 
I've enjoyed meeting many of you over the last few months, and I look forward to meeting many of you throughout the year. 
So with that, I'm going to turn things over to Jason to walk us through the financials."
139813,416878121,1134900,"PG&E Corporation, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 16, 2017",2017-02-16,"Earnings Calls","PG&E Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Geisha, and hello, everyone.

Before I review our financial results, I know that tax reform has been top of mind for many of you, so I thought I would share at a high level how we're thinking about it. 
Given that we don't know the scope or timing of reform, there's still a lot of uncertainty around what the final legislation will include. I'll base my comments on the health republic and blueprint, which includes a 20% corporate tax rate, no interest deductibility and 100% expensing of capital. 
Overall, we believe we're well-positioned to address the impacts of tax reform. Income taxes are part of our regulated cost of service and we would expect that the net benefit or cost of any of the proposed changes would largely flow to our customers. With respect to the reduction in corporate tax rates, customers would benefit in a couple of ways. First, the lower tax rate creates excess deferred taxes that will be refunded to our customers over time. 
As indicated on Slide 5, utility has about a $10.5 billion net deferred tax liability. This balance would be reduced by about 1/3 of the corporate tax rate is lowered to 20%. Second, customer rates would be reduced to reflect the net impact of the lower tax rate going forward. At the holding company, our net deferred tax assets are about $300 million. A reduction in the federal tax rate to 20% would reduce the value of these assets by about 40%. While this amount would not be recoverable from customers, it also would not increase equity needs as these balances are not factored into the utility's equity ratio. Finally, the lower tax rate will be a net positive from a rate base perspective as it will result in slower future growth of deferred taxes. 
The next component I'll cover is the additional tax expense created from the elimination of the interest deduction, which would be passed to customers through the cost of capital. We don't expect a material shareholder impact from the loss of the interest expense deduction, given that we don't have significant outstanding debt at the holding company. 
Turning to the component that would allow for full expensing of capital. We expect the impact to be the minimal in the near-term, given our net operating loss. Longer-term, we'd expect this to moderate our rate base growth. We're not quantifying the potential rate base impacts at this point as we're still very early in the process and there are a lot of variables that could impact certain tax deductions in our NOL. 
Finally, just a few words on cash flows. On a net basis, we do not expect these proposed tax reforms to have a significant near-term impact on cash flows. On the tax payments side, this is because of our NOL. On the revenue side, this is because we're currently expensing about $1 billion in capital via repayers and flowing that benefit back to customers. The revenue reduction from the lower federal tax rate would be mitigated by the reduced flow-through benefit. To the bottom line is we're in a good position with respect to various tax reform proposals. We believe that the net impact of these reforms will create bill capacity that may provide opportunities to increase our capital spend related to incremental infrastructure and great modernization benefits, which we will balance with our goal of maintaining affordable service for our customers. 
So let me shift to our fourth quarter and year-end results, which are on Slide 6. Earnings from operations came in at $1.33 for the quarter and $3.76 for the year. GAAP earnings, including the items impacting comparability, are also shown here. Pipeline-related expenses were $33 million pretax for the quarter and $113 million pretax for the year. We incurred legal and regulatory-related expenses of $18 million pretax for the quarter and $72 million pretax for the year. These last 2 items are consistent with the guidance we previously provided. Fines and penalties came in at $170 million pretax for the quarter and $498 million pretax for the year. This is primarily related to the San Bruno penalty decision and disallowances imposed for the ex parte communications in phase 2 of the gas transmission and storage rate case decision. Butte fire-related costs, net of insurance, were $46 million pretax for the quarter and $232 million pretax for the year. 
Now as you'll recall, in the first quarter of last year, we took a charge for $350 million pretax, which represented the low end of the range for third-party property damages. It did not include any costs for fire suppression, personnel injury or other damages that PG&E could be liable for if we were found to be negligent. While our position continues to be that we were not negligent, this question would ultimately be decided by a jury if we were to go to trial. This quarter, we've increased the low end of the range to $750 million pretax, which takes into account the risk of all known claims, including negligence. We continue to be unable to estimate the high end of the range at this time. We also incurred legal costs related to the fire of $27 million pretax. We've increased the insurance receivable to $625 million, which represents the low end of the range for insurance recoveries. As we noted last year, we expect to seek full recovery for all insured losses, so this amount should not be viewed as a ceiling on recovery. Finally, as a reminder, last year, we took charges totaling about $80 million for cleanup and repair costs that are not recoverable. 
Moving to the next item. We reported $29 million pretax for the quarter and $219 million pretax for the year related to the capital disallowances ordered in the phase 1 gas transmission rate case decision. As you'll recall, the phase 1 decision included a number of cost caps and one-way balancing accounts and we took a charge in the second quarter to reflect our best estimate of capital program costs that would exceed authorized amounts over the rate case period. The increase this quarter reflects our updated estimate of these costs based on more detailed project planning. Lastly, we booked revenue of $325 million pretax for both the quarter and year, which reflects recognition of gas transmission revenues in excess of our 2016 cost of service. We originally estimated $350 million based on high-level revenue assumptions. The actual out-of-period revenues were slightly lower. 
On Slide 7, you'll see our quarter-over-quarter comparison of earnings from operations of $0.50 in Q4 of last year to $1.33 in Q4 of this year. With the final phase 2 gas transmission decision, we were able to record revenues that were $0.48 higher compared to the same quarter last year. As a reminder, we'll be recovering the gas transmission under-collection over 36 months and can record only 29 months of that revenue in 2016. The remaining 7 months of the under-collection will be recorded in the first quarter of 2017. Timing of taxes was $0.20 positive for the quarter and results in a net 0 impact for the year. We had $0.06 favorable as a result of the Diablo Canyon refueling outage in 2015 that we didn't have in the same period in 2016. Rate base earnings increased to $0.05 for the quarter. We had $0.01 negative for the increase in outstanding shares and $0.05 favorable for a number of miscellaneous items. Miscellaneous includes the full severance charge for the organizational changes we announced in January. This was partially offset by lower contract costs as a result of efficiency measures in the fourth quarter and lower incentive compensation in 2016 compared to 2015. 
Transitioning now to Slide 8. We are reaffirming 2017 earnings from operations guidance of $3.55 to $3.75 per share. 
Our underlying assumptions are on Page 9. While our overall capital expenditures in 2017 are consistent with what we shared last quarter, we've had some movement between planned rate cases. Capacity-related project delays have reduced our electric transmission spend. These projects weren't slated to come online for several years, so you'll notice that our rate base is unchanged. These reductions were offset by incremental planned spend, primarily in our gas distribution and transmission businesses. It remains our objective to earn the CPUC authorized return on equity across the enterprise as a whole. 
Moving to Slide 10. We have 2 updates to our 2017 items impacting comparability. First, fines and penalties now reflects $15 million for the portion of the ex parte penalty imposed in the gas transmission phase 2 decision that we will recognize in the first quarter of 2017. This item does not include an estimate for potential future fines that may result from other proceedings, including the ongoing ex parte order instituting investigation. Second, the gas transmission revenue timing impact has been reduced by $10 million for a total of $150 million. This will also be recorded in the first quarter. As I mentioned, actual out of period revenues were slightly lower than what we have forecasted. 
On Slide 11, we're reaffirming our 2017 equity needs with a range of $400 million to $600 million. In 2018 and 2019, we still expect our equity needs to be met largely through internal programs, which historically have contributed approximately $350 million annually to our equity needs. 
Finally, on Slides 12 and 13, we're affirming our CapEx and rate base guidance through 2019. While we're still targeting 6.5% to 7% rate base growth through 2019, there are a couple of changes to the underlying assumptions on Slide 13. The base case now incorporates the final electric vehicle infrastructure decision that we received last December. It does not yet include our recent filings to support medium- and heavy-duty vehicle electrification. While we're not providing monitoring EPS guidance, it remains our objective to earn our CPUC authorized return on equity across the enterprise in 2018 and 2019. Assuming the commission approves the cost of capital settlement, our authorized return on equity will be 10.25% in 2018. 
I'll close by saying it's been a strong year for the company. As Geisha said, our focus on upgrading and modernizing our system to support the state's clean energy goals provides a strong growth trajectory in the future. Assuming the cost of capital settlement is approved, we'll have certainty on our cost of capital structure and return on equity through 2019. And we continue to target 6.5% to 7% rate base growth and a 60% dividend payout ratio by 2019. 
So with that, let's open up the lines for questions."

As it relates to the electric transmission business, there's a couple of competing pressures on that business. One, load is moderating in the state, and so that would sort of reduce the need for incremental capacity projects. That being said, we are increasing our renewable portfolio standards, so there will be more large-scale utility or renewable projects coming online and need to be connected to the grid. And so, we think, currently, today, our conservative assumption around holding 2018 and 2019 spend flat to what we've received in the 2017 rate case and what we've requested in the 2017 rate case appears reasonable. The Gas Transmission and Storage business, we really stepped up our spending quite a bit in the 2015 rate case that we just received. And so when I look at 2019, there's still a lot of work that needs to be done on the system. The drivers that we see supporting that CapEx spend are very much longer term in nature. But I will say that, first, that 2015 rate case was the first time that we really stepped up our revenues post San Bruno. So I think, that increase was a bit of an anomaly and I wouldn't factor that in going forward. I do think the real opportunity is in helping the state facilitate its longer-term carbon goals, particularly around electrification. So as Tony mentioned, we recently filed an initial application for medium- and heavy-duty vehicles. But really, we think that helping support further electrification in the state provides upside to these plans longer-term."

Just to give a little clarity, that we have definitely seen uptick in concerns around winter bills, particularly for gas usage for some of our customers. Just to give a little context for that, in August of last year, we actually implemented an increase in the gas transmission rates to incorporate the phase 1 decision from GT&S. That accounted for about a 19% increase for the average residential customer. As we talk about, there was a substantial step up in spending in that case, and it was delayed pretty substantially from the initial time period when the rates were going to effect. To help kind of moderate that, in January, we actually implemented a reduction in rates of about 8%, which is the reflection of the phase 2 decision, where they then implemented the San Bruno penalty and the ex parte fine in that proceeding. So we really think that will help to moderate it. Obviously, we've had a stronger winter here in California this year than prior years, which has also led to increased usage. It's something we pay a lot of attention to. We're very focused on it. We are really committed to, as Geisha said, make sure we keep our bills affordable for our customers. So we work with them when there are concerns to help them understand how they can reduce their usage through efficiency programs and other things and help save. So something we pay a lot of attention to."

So that's sort of, I think, an easy rule of thumb to think about load from that standpoint. And I think from a growth standpoint, financially, the state has a goal of having 1.5 million electric vehicles on the road in California by 2025. That would equate to about 600,000 vehicles in our service territory. We think and the state thinks that we [indiscernible] distribute a charging stations for every 4 vehicles that are on the road.

But we think the number's generally right, it's just going to happen over a longer period of time. What we're doing in terms of preparing for that, of course, is the first and most important, is we have a really flexible energy supply portfolio. So for example, about 55% of the energy that we deliver to our customers is actually procured from third parties. And those contracts tend to be a combination of both long-term and spot market purchases. So of the 55% that we have now under contract, nearly 40% represents megawatt hours that we do not have a contractual obligation to take in 2021. And the reason I bring that up is, as CCA adoption grows, we're really executing on our very flexible energy portfolio. So we believe we've got the triggers that we need to be able to meet the load over time. And I hope that answers your question."

We also announced that next month, Geisha Williams will be taking over as CEO and President of PG&E Corporation, and Nick Stavropoulos will be taking over as President and Chief Operating Officer of our Utility Pacific Gas & Electric. Both Geisha and Nick have done an outstanding job over the last several years and have established proven track records for delivering results, so I couldn't be more thrilled about their appointments and look forward to continuing to work with them in my capacity as Chairman. 
Today, I'm going to spend a few minutes reviewing some of the highlights from 2016, and then, I'll turn it over to Geisha for a few remarks, and then, Jason will walk us through the financials. 
So let me start with our safety and operational performance. In 2016, we experienced some of the most severe storms we've seen in years. While this is good news for our hydro generation and for the drought, it impacted our ability to meet our 2016 reliability targets. Despite all of the storms, however, we were still able to deliver the second-best electric reliability performance in the company's history. This was in part due to our continued investments in a modern self-healing grid that automatically isolates and minimizes customer outages. And we continued to strengthen our gas system by inspecting and upgrading hundreds of miles of transmission pipeline and replacing over 100 miles of distribution main. We also continued to deliver industry-leading results on our gas and electric emergency response times. 
On the customer side, I'm excited to share that our most recent J.D. Power results for our electric business customers improved to first quartile. Customers continue to notice and appreciate the operational improvements that we made. 
So turning to regulatory and legal issues. We made a lot of progress in 2016. In December, we received a final phase 2 decision in our gas transmission and storage rate case, which gives us certainty on our gas transmission revenues through 2018. In our general rate case, we're waiting for a proposed decision on our all-party settlement agreement. If approved, it will provide certainty on our gas and electric distribution and electric generation revenues through 2019. We also reached a settlement agreement in our cost of capital case. The terms include a 2-year extension, which takes us through the end of 2019, a true-up for authorized cost of debt beginning in 2018 and reinstatement of the trigger mechanism for 2019. We also agreed to reduce our return on equity from 10.4% to 10.25% beginning in 2018. We're hopeful the settlement will be approved in the coming months. 
I also want to acknowledge the recent decision in the criminal case. In January, the court sentenced us to a $3 million fine, a 5-year probation period, oversight by a third-party monitor and certain requirements related to advertising and community service. As you'll recall, last year, we announced we would not appeal the 5 integrity management counts. We've also now decided not to appeal the obstruction of justice count. As we focus on the future, I want to assure all of our stakeholders that the San Bruno incident has fundamentally changed the way we operate this company. We remain absolutely committed to ensuring that we meet the high safety standards that all of our stakeholders and we ourselves demand and expect. 
As we look to the future of the industry, despite the uncertainty at the federal level, California will continue to lead the way in transitioning to a clean energy economy. PG&E will be a critical partner in these efforts and is well-positioned to help the state achieve its goals. In 2016, nearly 70% of the energy we delivered was greenhouse gas-free. Nearly 33% of our portfolio was RPS eligible, which puts us about 4 years ahead of the state's 2020 target. We remain confident that we can meet or exceed our target of 55% renewable resources by 2031. 
We continue to have more electric vehicles and private rooftop solar installations in our service territory than anywhere else in the country. And with the transportation sector accounting for about 40% of California's greenhouse gas emissions, we expect to play a significant role in helping the state address these emissions by investing in the infrastructure necessary to enable electric vehicle adoption. To that end, last December, the commission authorized $130 million over the next 3 years to install the infrastructure necessary to support about 7,500 EV charging stations. In January, we filed a request to spend an additional $250 million, primarily for the infrastructure to support electrification of medium- and heavy-duty vehicles, like transit buses. The request also includes infrastructure for fast chargers as well as some smaller pilots. With the state targeting 1.5 million electric vehicles by 2025, we see the potential to expand these programs in the coming years. 
In closing, I want to say how much I have truly enjoyed leading this company over the last 5.5 years. The good news for me is that I will continue to work with one of the most talented executive teams in our industry as Executive Chairman. Geisha and Nick are absolutely the right people to lead this company into the future, and we have recently restructured the team to better take advantage of the opportunities we have in the coming years. 
So with that, let me turn it over to Geisha to share a few words."

I also want to say how truly excited I am to lead this iconic company at such an amazing time in our industry. As we look forward, I'm going to be focused on 3 areas: first, and always first, continuing to build on the strong safety and operational progress we've made in the last several years; second, providing first class customer service and maintaining affordable bills so that we can be our customers' preferred provider of choice; and third, positioning PG&E for success within the changing utility industry, because as Tony said, California will continue to be at the forefront of this change. 
So it's really an exciting time to be in this industry, particularly here in California. We are confident in our ability to execute on a strong growth plan through continued investments in upgrading and modernizing our system as we help the state achieve its clean energy goals. 
I've enjoyed meeting many of you over the last few months, and I look forward to meeting many of you throughout the year.

139813,416878121,1135054,"PG&E Corporation, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 16, 2017",2017-02-16,"Earnings Calls","PG&E Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Geisha, and hello, everyone. Before I review our financial results, I know that tax reform has been top of mind for many of you, so I thought I would share at a high level how we're thinking about it.

Before I review our financial results, I know that tax reform has been top of mind for many of you, so I thought I would share at a high level how we're thinking about it. 
Given that we don't know the scope or timing of reform, there's still a lot of uncertainty around what the final legislation will include. I'll base my comments on the health republic and blueprint, which includes a 20% corporate tax rate, no interest deductibility and 100% expensing of capital. 
Overall, we believe we're well-positioned to address the impacts of tax reform. Income taxes are part of our regulated cost of service and we would expect that the net benefit or cost of any of the proposed changes would largely flow to our customers. With respect to the reduction in corporate tax rates, customers would benefit in a couple of ways. First, the lower tax rate creates excess deferred taxes that will be refunded to our customers over time. 
As indicated on Slide 5, utility has about a $10.5 billion net deferred tax liability. This balance would be reduced by about 1/3 of the corporate tax rate is lowered to 20%. Second, customer rates would be reduced to reflect the net impact of the lower tax rate going forward. At the holding company, our net deferred tax assets are about $300 million. A reduction in the federal tax rate to 20% would reduce the value of these assets by about 40%. While this amount would not be recoverable from customers, it also would not increase equity needs as these balances are not factored into the utility's equity ratio. Finally, the lower tax rate will be a net positive from a rate base perspective as it will result in slower future growth of deferred taxes. 
The next component I'll cover is the additional tax expense created from the elimination of the interest deduction, which would be passed to customers through the cost of capital. We don't expect a material shareholder impact from the loss of the interest expense deduction, given that we don't have significant outstanding debt at the holding company. 
Turning to the component that would allow for full expensing of capital. We expect the impact to be the minimal in the near-term, given our net operating loss. Longer-term, we'd expect this to moderate our rate base growth. We're not quantifying the potential rate base impacts at this point as we're still very early in the process and there are a lot of variables that could impact certain tax deductions in our NOL. 
Finally, just a few words on cash flows. On a net basis, we do not expect these proposed tax reforms to have a significant near-term impact on cash flows. On the tax payments side, this is because of our NOL. On the revenue side, this is because we're currently expensing about $1 billion in capital via repayers and flowing that benefit back to customers. The revenue reduction from the lower federal tax rate would be mitigated by the reduced flow-through benefit. To the bottom line is we're in a good position with respect to various tax reform proposals. We believe that the net impact of these reforms will create bill capacity that may provide opportunities to increase our capital spend related to incremental infrastructure and great modernization benefits, which we will balance with our goal of maintaining affordable service for our customers. 
So let me shift to our fourth quarter and year-end results, which are on Slide 6. Earnings from operations came in at $1.33 for the quarter and $3.76 for the year. GAAP earnings, including the items impacting comparability, are also shown here. Pipeline-related expenses were $33 million pretax for the quarter and $113 million pretax for the year. We incurred legal and regulatory-related expenses of $18 million pretax for the quarter and $72 million pretax for the year. These last 2 items are consistent with the guidance we previously provided. Fines and penalties came in at $170 million pretax for the quarter and $498 million pretax for the year. This is primarily related to the San Bruno penalty decision and disallowances imposed for the ex parte communications in phase 2 of the gas transmission and storage rate case decision. Butte fire-related costs, net of insurance, were $46 million pretax for the quarter and $232 million pretax for the year. 
Now as you'll recall, in the first quarter of last year, we took a charge for $350 million pretax, which represented the low end of the range for third-party property damages. It did not include any costs for fire suppression, personnel injury or other damages that PG&E could be liable for if we were found to be negligent. While our position continues to be that we were not negligent, this question would ultimately be decided by a jury if we were to go to trial. This quarter, we've increased the low end of the range to $750 million pretax, which takes into account the risk of all known claims, including negligence. We continue to be unable to estimate the high end of the range at this time. We also incurred legal costs related to the fire of $27 million pretax. We've increased the insurance receivable to $625 million, which represents the low end of the range for insurance recoveries. As we noted last year, we expect to seek full recovery for all insured losses, so this amount should not be viewed as a ceiling on recovery. Finally, as a reminder, last year, we took charges totaling about $80 million for cleanup and repair costs that are not recoverable. 
Moving to the next item. We reported $29 million pretax for the quarter and $219 million pretax for the year related to the capital disallowances ordered in the phase 1 gas transmission rate case decision. As you'll recall, the phase 1 decision included a number of cost caps and one-way balancing accounts and we took a charge in the second quarter to reflect our best estimate of capital program costs that would exceed authorized amounts over the rate case period. The increase this quarter reflects our updated estimate of these costs based on more detailed project planning. Lastly, we booked revenue of $325 million pretax for both the quarter and year, which reflects recognition of gas transmission revenues in excess of our 2016 cost of service. We originally estimated $350 million based on high-level revenue assumptions. The actual out-of-period revenues were slightly lower. 
On Slide 7, you'll see our quarter-over-quarter comparison of earnings from operations of $0.50 in Q4 of last year to $1.33 in Q4 of this year. With the final phase 2 gas transmission decision, we were able to record revenues that were $0.48 higher compared to the same quarter last year. As a reminder, we'll be recovering the gas transmission under-collection over 36 months and can record only 29 months of that revenue in 2016. The remaining 7 months of the under-collection will be recorded in the first quarter of 2017. Timing of taxes was $0.20 positive for the quarter and results in a net 0 impact for the year. We had $0.06 favorable as a result of the Diablo Canyon refueling outage in 2015 that we didn't have in the same period in 2016. Rate base earnings increased to $0.05 for the quarter. We had $0.01 negative for the increase in outstanding shares and $0.05 favorable for a number of miscellaneous items. Miscellaneous includes the full severance charge for the organizational changes we announced in January. This was partially offset by lower contract costs as a result of efficiency measures in the fourth quarter and lower incentive compensation in 2016 compared to 2015. 
Transitioning now to Slide 8. We are reaffirming 2017 earnings from operations guidance of $3.55 to $3.75 per share. 
Our underlying assumptions are on Page 9. While our overall capital expenditures in 2017 are consistent with what we shared last quarter, we've had some movement between planned rate cases. Capacity-related project delays have reduced our electric transmission spend. These projects weren't slated to come online for several years, so you'll notice that our rate base is unchanged. These reductions were offset by incremental planned spend, primarily in our gas distribution and transmission businesses. It remains our objective to earn the CPUC authorized return on equity across the enterprise as a whole. 
Moving to Slide 10. We have 2 updates to our 2017 items impacting comparability. First, fines and penalties now reflects $15 million for the portion of the ex parte penalty imposed in the gas transmission phase 2 decision that we will recognize in the first quarter of 2017. This item does not include an estimate for potential future fines that may result from other proceedings, including the ongoing ex parte order instituting investigation. Second, the gas transmission revenue timing impact has been reduced by $10 million for a total of $150 million. This will also be recorded in the first quarter. As I mentioned, actual out of period revenues were slightly lower than what we have forecasted. 
On Slide 11, we're reaffirming our 2017 equity needs with a range of $400 million to $600 million. In 2018 and 2019, we still expect our equity needs to be met largely through internal programs, which historically have contributed approximately $350 million annually to our equity needs. 
Finally, on Slides 12 and 13, we're affirming our CapEx and rate base guidance through 2019. While we're still targeting 6.5% to 7% rate base growth through 2019, there are a couple of changes to the underlying assumptions on Slide 13. The base case now incorporates the final electric vehicle infrastructure decision that we received last December. It does not yet include our recent filings to support medium- and heavy-duty vehicle electrification. While we're not providing monitoring EPS guidance, it remains our objective to earn our CPUC authorized return on equity across the enterprise in 2018 and 2019. Assuming the commission approves the cost of capital settlement, our authorized return on equity will be 10.25% in 2018. 
I'll close by saying it's been a strong year for the company. As Geisha said, our focus on upgrading and modernizing our system to support the state's clean energy goals provides a strong growth trajectory in the future. Assuming the cost of capital settlement is approved, we'll have certainty on our cost of capital structure and return on equity through 2019. And we continue to target 6.5% to 7% rate base growth and a 60% dividend payout ratio by 2019. 
So with that, let's open up the lines for questions."

As it relates to the electric transmission business, there's a couple of competing pressures on that business. One, load is moderating in the state, and so that would sort of reduce the need for incremental capacity projects. That being said, we are increasing our renewable portfolio standards, so there will be more large-scale utility or renewable projects coming online and need to be connected to the grid. And so, we think, currently, today, our conservative assumption around holding 2018 and 2019 spend flat to what we've received in the 2017 rate case and what we've requested in the 2017 rate case appears reasonable. The Gas Transmission and Storage business, we really stepped up our spending quite a bit in the 2015 rate case that we just received. And so when I look at 2019, there's still a lot of work that needs to be done on the system. The drivers that we see supporting that CapEx spend are very much longer term in nature. But I will say that, first, that 2015 rate case was the first time that we really stepped up our revenues post San Bruno. So I think, that increase was a bit of an anomaly and I wouldn't factor that in going forward. I do think the real opportunity is in helping the state facilitate its longer-term carbon goals, particularly around electrification. So as Tony mentioned, we recently filed an initial application for medium- and heavy-duty vehicles. But really, we think that helping support further electrification in the state provides upside to these plans longer-term."

Just to give a little clarity there, we have definitely seen uptick in concerns around winter bills, particularly for gas usage for some of our customers. Just to give a little context for that, in August of last year, we actually implemented an increase in the gas transmission rates to incorporate the phase 1 decision from GT&S. That accounted for about a 19% increase for the average residential customer. As we've talked about, there was a substantial step up in spending in that case, and it was delayed pretty substantially from the initial time period when the rates would going to effect. To help kind of moderate that, in January, we actually implemented a reduction in rates of about 8%, which is the reflection of the phase 2 decision, where they then implemented the San Bruno penalty and the ex parte fine in that proceeding.

It's something we pay a lot of attention to. We're very focused on it. We are really committed to, as Geisha said, make sure we keep our bills affordable for our customers. So we work with them when there are concerns to help them understand how they can reduce their usage through efficiency programs and other things and help save. So it's something we pay a lot of attention to."

So you can think of, for every 2 electric vehicles we add to the system, essentially, we're offsetting the decline that we see from distributed generation. So that's sort of, I think, an easy rule of thumb to think about load from that standpoint. And I think, from a growth standpoint, financially, the state has a goal of having 1.5 million electric vehicles on the road in California by 2025. That would equate to about 600,000 vehicles in our service territory. We think and the state thinks that we need distributed charging stations for every 4 vehicles that are on the road. So that would be a need for approximately 150,000 charging stations in our service territory. We think we're best positioned to facilitate that buildout and provide that service to our customers in our service territory. And so this initial application, which we just recently had approved, that was only for 7,500 charging stations, so we see the opportunity for fairly significant growth over the next several years to help enable the state to meet its overall policy goals."

But we think the number's generally right, it's just going to happen over a longer period of time. What we're doing in terms of preparing for that, of course, is the first and most important, is we have a really flexible energy supply portfolio. So for example, about 55% of the energy that we deliver to our customers is actually procured from third-parties. And those contracts tend to be a combination of both long-term and spot market purchases. So of the 55% that we have now under contract, nearly 40% represents megawatt hours that we do not have a contractual obligation to take in 2021. And the reason I bring that up is, as CCA adoption grows, we're really executing on our very flexible energy portfolio. So we believe we've got the triggers that we need to be able to meet the load over time. And I hope that answers your question."

2016 was a really pivotal year for PG&E. We continue to deliver strong operational and financial results and resolved a number of important regulatory and legal matters. We also announced that next month, Geisha Williams will be taking over as CEO and President of PG&E Corporation, and Nick Stavropoulos will be taking over as President and Chief Operating Officer of our Utility Pacific Gas & Electric. Both Geisha and Nick have done an outstanding job over the last several years and have established proven track records for delivering results, so I couldn't be more thrilled about their appointments and look forward to continuing to work with them in my capacity as Chairman. 
Today, I'm going to spend a few minutes reviewing some of the highlights from 2016, and then, I'll turn it over to Geisha for a few remarks, and then, Jason will walk us through the financials. 
So let me start with our safety and operational performance. In 2016, we experienced some of the most severe storms we've seen in years. While this is good news for our hydro generation and for the drought, it impacted our ability to meet our 2016 reliability targets. Despite all of the storms, however, we were still able to deliver the second-best electric reliability performance in the company's history. This was in part due to our continued investments in a modern self-healing grid that automatically isolates and minimizes customer outages. And we continued to strengthen our gas system by inspecting and upgrading hundreds of miles of transmission pipeline and replacing over 100 miles of distribution main. We also continued to deliver industry-leading results on our gas and electric emergency response times. 
On the customer side, I'm excited to share that our most recent J.D. Power results for our electric business customers improved to first quartile. Customers continue to notice and appreciate the operational improvements that we made. 
So turning to regulatory and legal issues. We made a lot of progress in 2016. In December, we received a final phase 2 decision in our gas transmission and storage rate case, which gives us certainty on our gas transmission revenues through 2018. In our general rate case, we're waiting for a proposed decision on our all-party settlement agreement. If approved, it will provide certainty on our gas and electric distribution and electric generation revenues through 2019. We also reached a settlement agreement in our cost of capital case. The terms include a 2-year extension, which takes us through the end of 2019, a true-up for authorized cost of debt beginning in 2018 and reinstatement of the trigger mechanism for 2019. We also agreed to reduce our return on equity from 10.4% to 10.25% beginning in 2018. We're hopeful the settlement will be approved in the coming months. 
I also want to acknowledge the recent decision in the criminal case. In January, the court sentenced us to a $3 million fine, a 5-year probation period, oversight by a third-party monitor and certain requirements related to advertising and community service. As you'll recall, last year, we announced we would not appeal the 5 integrity management counts. We've also now decided not to appeal the obstruction of justice count. As we focus on the future, I want to assure all of our stakeholders that the San Bruno incident has fundamentally changed the way we operate this company. We remain absolutely committed to ensuring that we meet the high safety standards that all of our stakeholders and we ourselves demand and expect. 
As we look to the future of the industry, despite the uncertainty at the federal level, California will continue to lead the way in transitioning to a clean energy economy. PG&E will be a critical partner in these efforts and is well-positioned to help the state achieve its goals. In 2016, nearly 70% of the energy we delivered was greenhouse gas-free. Nearly 33% of our portfolio was RPS eligible, which puts us about 4 years ahead of the state's 2020 target. We remain confident that we can meet or exceed our target of 55% renewable resources by 2031. 
We continue to have more electric vehicles and private rooftop solar installations in our service territory than anywhere else in the country. And with the transportation sector accounting for about 40% of California's greenhouse gas emissions, we expect to play a significant role in helping the state address these emissions by investing in the infrastructure necessary to enable electric vehicle adoption. To that end, last December, the commission authorized $130 million over the next 3 years to install the infrastructure necessary to support about 7,500 EV charging stations. In January, we filed a request to spend an additional $250 million, primarily for the infrastructure to support electrification of medium- and heavy-duty vehicles, like transit buses. The request also includes infrastructure for fast chargers as well as some smaller pilots. With the state targeting 1.5 million electric vehicles by 2025, we see the potential to expand these programs in the coming years. 
In closing, I want to say how much I have truly enjoyed leading this company over the last 5.5 years. The good news for me is that I will continue to work with one of the most talented executive teams in our industry as Executive Chairman. Geisha and Nick are absolutely the right people to lead this company into the future, and we have recently restructured the team to better take advantage of the opportunities we have in the coming years. 
So with that, let me turn it over to Geisha to share a few words."

I also want to say how truly excited I am to lead this iconic company at such an amazing time in our industry.

139813,416878121,1135189,"PG&E Corporation, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 16, 2017",2017-02-16,"Earnings Calls","PG&E Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Geisha, and hello, everyone. Before I review our financial results, I know that tax reform has been top of mind for many of you, so I thought I would share at a high level how we're thinking about it.

Before I review our financial results, I know that tax reform has been top of mind for many of you, so I thought I would share at a high level how we're thinking about it. 
Given that we don't know the scope or timing of reform, there's still a lot of uncertainty around what the final legislation will include. I'll base my comments on the House Republican blueprint, which includes a 20% corporate tax rate, no interest deductibility and 100% expensing of capital. 
Overall, we believe we're well-positioned to address the impacts of tax reform. Income taxes are part of our regulated cost of service, and we would expect that the net benefit or cost of any of the proposed changes would largely flow to our customers. With respect to the reduction in corporate tax rates, customers would benefit in a couple of ways. First, the lower tax rate creates excess deferred taxes that will be refunded to our customers over time. 
As indicated on Slide 5, the utility has about a $10.5 billion net deferred tax liability. This balance would be reduced by about 1/3 of the corporate tax rate is lowered to 20%. Second, customer rates would be reduced to reflect the net impact of the lower tax rate going forward. At the holding company, our net deferred tax assets are about $300 million. A reduction in the federal tax rate to 20% would reduce the value of these assets by about 40%. While this amount would not be recoverable from customers, it also would not increase equity needs as these balances are not factored into the utility's equity ratio. Finally, the lower tax rate will be a net positive from a rate base perspective as it will result in slower future growth of deferred taxes. 
The next component I'll cover is the additional tax expense created from the elimination of the interest deduction, which would be passed to customers through the cost of capital. We don't expect a material shareholder impact from the loss of the interest expense deduction, given that we don't have significant outstanding debt at the holding company. 
Turning to the component that would allow for full expensing of capital. We expect the impact to be the minimal in the near-term, given our net operating loss. Longer-term, we'd expect this to moderate our rate base growth. We're not quantifying the potential rate base impacts at this point as we're still very early in the process and there are a lot of variables that could impact certain tax deductions in our NOL. 
Finally, just a few words on cash flows. On a net basis, we do not expect these proposed tax reforms to have a significant near-term impact on cash flows. On the tax payments side, this is because of our NOL. On the revenue side, this is because we're currently expensing about $1 billion in capital via repayers and flowing that benefit back to customers. The revenue reduction from the lower federal tax rate would be mitigated by the reduced flow-through benefit. So the bottom line is we're in a good position with respect to various tax reform proposals. We believe that the net impact of these reforms will create bill capacity that may provide opportunities to increase our capital spend related to incremental infrastructure and great modernization benefits, which we will balance with our goal of maintaining affordable service for our customers. 
So let me shift to our fourth quarter and year-end results, which are on Slide 6. Earnings from operations came in at $1.33 for the quarter and $3.76 for the year. GAAP earnings, including the items impacting comparability, are also shown here. Pipeline-related expenses were $33 million pretax for the quarter and $113 million pretax for the year. We incurred legal and regulatory-related expenses of $18 million pretax for the quarter and $72 million pretax for the year. These last 2 items are consistent with the guidance we previously provided. Fines and penalties came in at $170 million pretax for the quarter and $498 million pretax for the year. This is primarily related to the San Bruno penalty decision and disallowances imposed for the ex parte communications in phase 2 of the gas transmission and storage rate case decision. Butte fire-related costs, net of insurance, were $46 million pretax for the quarter and $232 million pretax for the year. 
Now as you'll recall, in the first quarter of last year, we took a charge for $350 million pretax, which represented the low end of the range for third-party property damages. It did not include any costs for fire suppression, personnel injury or other damages that PG&E could be liable for if we were found to be negligent. While our position continues to be that we were not negligent, this question would ultimately be decided by a jury if we were to go to trial. This quarter, we've increased the low end of the range to $750 million pretax, which takes into account the risk of all known claims, including negligence. We continue to be unable to estimate the high end of the range at this time. We also incurred legal costs related to the fire of $27 million pretax. We've increased the insurance receivable to $625 million, which represents the low end of the range for insurance recoveries. As we noted last year, we expect to seek full recovery for all insured losses, so this amount should not be viewed as a ceiling on recovery. Finally, as a reminder, last year, we took charges totaling about $80 million for cleanup and repair costs that are not recoverable. 
Moving to the next item. We reported $29 million pretax for the quarter and $219 million pretax for the year related to the capital disallowances ordered in the phase 1 gas transmission rate case decision. As you'll recall, the phase 1 decision included a number of cost caps and one-way balancing accounts and we took a charge in the second quarter to reflect our best estimate of capital program costs that would exceed authorized amounts over the rate case period. The increase this quarter reflects our updated estimate of these costs based on more detailed project planning. Lastly, we booked revenue of $325 million pretax for both the quarter and year, which reflects recognition of gas transmission revenues in excess of our 2016 cost of service. We originally estimated $350 million based on high-level revenue assumptions. The actual out-of-period revenues were slightly lower. 
On Slide 7, you'll see our quarter-over-quarter comparison of earnings from operations of $0.50 in Q4 of last year to $1.33 in Q4 of this year. With the final phase 2 gas transmission decision, we were able to record revenues that were $0.48 higher compared to the same quarter last year. As a reminder, we'll be recovering the gas transmission under-collection over 36 months and can record only 29 months of that revenue in 2016. The remaining 7 months of the under-collection will be recorded in the first quarter of 2017. Timing of taxes was $0.20 positive for the quarter and results in a net 0 impact for the year. We had $0.06 favorable as a result of the Diablo Canyon refueling outage in 2015 that we didn't have in the same period in 2016. Rate base earnings increased $0.05 for the quarter. We had $0.01 negative for the increase in outstanding shares and $0.05 favorable for a number of miscellaneous items. Miscellaneous includes the full severance charge for the organizational changes we announced in January. This was partially offset by lower contract costs as a result of efficiency measures in the fourth quarter and lower incentive compensation in 2016 compared to 2015. 
Transitioning now to Slide 8. We are reaffirming 2017 earnings from operations guidance of $3.55 to $3.75 per share. 
Our underlying assumptions are on Page 9. While our overall capital expenditures in 2017 are consistent with what we shared last quarter, we've had some movement between planned rate cases. Capacity-related project delays have reduced our electric transmission spend. These projects weren't slated to come online for several years, so you'll notice that our rate base is unchanged. These reductions were offset by incremental planned spend, primarily in our gas distribution and transmission businesses. It remains our objective to earn the CPUC authorized return on equity across the enterprise as a whole. 
Moving to Slide 10. We have 2 updates to our 2017 items impacting comparability. First, fines and penalties now reflects $15 million for the portion of the ex parte penalty imposed in the gas transmission phase 2 decision that we will recognize in the first quarter of 2017. This item does not include an estimate for potential future fines that may result from other proceedings, including the ongoing ex parte order instituting investigation. Second, the gas transmission revenue timing impact has been reduced by $10 million for a total of $150 million. This will also be recorded in the first quarter. As I mentioned, actual out of period revenues were slightly lower than what we have forecasted. 
On Slide 11, we're reaffirming our 2017 equity needs with a range of $400 million to $600 million. In 2018 and 2019, we still expect our equity needs to be met largely through internal programs, which historically have contributed approximately $350 million annually to our equity needs. 
Finally, on Slides 12 and 13, we're affirming our CapEx and rate base guidance through 2019. While we're still targeting 6.5% to 7% rate base growth through 2019, there are a couple of changes to the underlying assumptions on Slide 13. The base case now incorporates the final electric vehicle infrastructure decision that we received last December. It does not yet include our recent filings to support medium- and heavy-duty vehicle electrification. While we're not providing monitoring EPS guidance, it remains our objective to earn our CPUC authorized return on equity across the enterprise in 2018 and 2019. Assuming the commission approves the cost of capital settlement, our authorized return on equity will be 10.25% in 2018. 
I'll close by saying it's been a strong year for the company. As Geisha said, our focus on upgrading and modernizing our system to support the state's clean energy goals provides a strong growth trajectory in the future. Assuming the cost of capital settlement is approved, we'll have certainty on our cost of capital structure and return on equity through 2019. And we continue to target 6.5% to 7% rate base growth and a 60% dividend payout ratio by 2019. 
So with that, let's open up the lines for questions."

As it relates to the electric transmission business, there's a couple of competing pressures on that business. One, load is moderating in the state, and so that would sort of reduce the need for incremental capacity projects. That being said, we are increasing our renewable portfolio standards, so there will be more large-scale utility or renewable projects coming online and needing to be connected to the grid. And so, we think, currently, today, our conservative assumption around holding 2018 and 2019 spend flat to what we've received in the 2017 rate case and what we've requested in the 2017 rate case appears reasonable. The Gas Transmission & Storage business, we really stepped up our spending quite a bit in the 2015 rate case that we just received. And so when I look at 2019, there's still a lot of work that needs to be done on the system. The drivers that we see supporting that CapEx spend are very much longer term in nature. But I will say that, first, that 2015 rate case was the first time that we really stepped up our revenues post San Bruno. So I think, that increase was a bit of an anomaly and I wouldn't factor that in going forward. I do think the real opportunity is in helping the state facilitate its longer-term carbon goals, particularly around electrification. So as Tony mentioned, we recently filed an initial application for medium- and heavy-duty vehicles. But really, we think that helping support further electrification in the state provides upside to these plans longer-term."

Just to give a little clarity to that, we have definitely seen uptick in concerns around winter bills, particularly for gas usage for some of our customers. Just to give a little context for that, in August of last year, we actually implemented an increase in the gas transmission rates to incorporate the phase 1 decision from GT&S. That accounted for about a 19% increase for the average residential customer. As we've talked about, there was a substantial step up in spending in that case, and it was delayed pretty substantially from the initial time period when the rates would go into effect. To help kind of moderate that, in January, we actually implemented a reduction in rates of about 8%, which is the reflection of the phase 2 decision, where they then implemented the San Bruno penalty and the ex parte fine in that proceeding.

So that's sort of, I think, an easy rule of thumb to think about load from that standpoint. And I think, from a growth standpoint, financially, the state has a goal of having 1.5 million electric vehicles on the road in California by 2025. That would equate to about 600,000 vehicles in our service territory. We think and the state thinks that we need distributed charging stations for every 4 vehicles that are on the road. So that would be a need for approximately 150,000 charging stations in our service territory. We think we're best positioned to facilitate that buildout and provide that service to our customers in our service territory.

So I think, when I saw the same number, the 40% from President Picker, I think, you're thinking about it in a statewide context. Our service area is a little bit different. Our service area is made up of many small municipalities and counties. So in our case, we think that, that transition to higher levels of CCA adoption are going to take a little bit longer. But we think the number's generally right, it's just going to happen over a longer period of time. What we're doing in terms of preparing for that, of course, is the first and most important, is we have a really flexible energy supply portfolio. So for example, about 55% of the energy that we deliver to our customers is actually procured from third-parties. And those contracts tend to be a combination of both long-term and spot market purchases. So of the 55% that we have now under contract, nearly 40% represents megawatt hours that we do not have a contractual obligation to take in 2021. And the reason I bring that up is, as CCA adoption grows, we're really executing on our very flexible energy portfolio. So we believe we've got the triggers that we need to be able to meet the load over time. And I hope that answers your question."

2016 was a really pivotal year for PG&E. We continue to deliver strong operational and financial results and resolved a number of important regulatory and legal matters. We also announced that next month, Geisha Williams will be taking over as CEO and President of PG&E Corporation, and Nick Stavropoulos will be taking over as President and Chief Operating Officer of our Utility Pacific Gas & Electric. Both Geisha and Nick have done an outstanding job over the last several years and have established proven track records for delivering results, so I couldn't be more thrilled about their appointments and look forward to continuing to work with them in my capacity as Chairman. 
Today, I'm going to spend a few minutes reviewing some of the highlights from 2016, and then, I'll turn it over to Geisha for a few remarks, and then, Jason will walk us through the financials. 
So let me start with our safety and operational performance. In 2016, we experienced some of the most severe storms we've seen in years. While this is good news for our hydro generation and for the drought, it impacted our ability to meet our 2016 reliability targets. Despite all of the storms, however, we were still able to deliver the second-best electric reliability performance in the company's history. This was in part due to our continued investments in a modern self-healing grid that automatically isolates and minimizes customer outages. And we continued to strengthen our gas system by inspecting and upgrading hundreds of miles of transmission pipeline and replacing over 100 miles of distribution main. We also continued to deliver industry-leading results on our gas and electric emergency response times. 
On the customer side, I'm excited to share that our most recent J.D. Power results for our electric business customers improved to first quartile. Customers continue to notice and appreciate the operational improvements that we made. 
So turning to regulatory and legal issues. We made a lot of progress in 2016. In December, we received a final phase 2 decision in our gas transmission and storage rate case, which gives us certainty on our gas transmission revenues through 2018. In our general rate case, we're waiting for a proposed decision on our all-party settlement agreement. If approved, it will provide certainty on our gas and electric distribution and electric generation revenues through 2019. We also reached a settlement agreement in our cost of capital case. The terms include a 2-year extension, which takes us through the end of 2019, a true-up for authorized cost of debt beginning in 2018 and reinstatement of the trigger mechanism for 2019. We also agreed to reduce our return on equity from 10.4% to 10.25% beginning in 2018. We're hopeful the settlement will be approved in the coming months. 
I also want to acknowledge the recent decision in the criminal case. In January, the court sentenced us to a $3 million fine, a 5-year probation period, oversight by a third-party monitor and certain requirements related to advertising and community service. As you'll recall, last year, we announced we would not appeal the 5 integrity management counts. We've also now decided not to appeal the obstruction of justice count. As we focus on the future, I want to assure all of our stakeholders that the San Bruno incident has fundamentally changed the way we operate this company. We remain absolutely committed to ensuring that we meet the high safety standards that all of our stakeholders and we ourselves demand and expect. 
As we look to the future of the industry, despite the uncertainty at the federal level, California will continue to lead the way in transitioning to a clean energy economy. PG&E will be a critical partner in these efforts and is well-positioned to help the state achieve its goals. In 2016, nearly 70% of the energy we delivered was greenhouse gas-free. Nearly 33% of our portfolio was RPS eligible, which puts us about 4 years ahead of the state's 2020 target. We remain confident that we can meet or exceed our target of 55% renewable resources by 2031. 
We continue to have more electric vehicles and private rooftop solar installations in our service territory than anywhere else in the country. And with the transportation sector accounting for about 40% of California's greenhouse gas emissions, we expect to play a significant role in helping the state address these emissions by investing in the infrastructure necessary to enable electric vehicle adoption. To that end, last December, the commission authorized $130 million over the next 3 years to install the infrastructure necessary to support about 7,500 EV charging stations. In January, we filed a request to spend an additional $250 million, primarily for the infrastructure to support electrification of medium- and heavy-duty vehicles, like transit buses. The request also includes infrastructure for fast chargers as well as some smaller pilots. With the state targeting 1.5 million electric vehicles by 2025, we see the potential to expand these programs in the coming years. 
In closing, I want to say how much I have truly enjoyed leading this company over the last 5.5 years. The good news for me is that I will continue to work with one of the most talented executive teams in our industry as Executive Chairman. Geisha and Nick are absolutely the right people to lead this company into the future, and we have recently restructured the team to better take advantage of the opportunities we have in the coming years. 
So with that, let me turn it over to Geisha to share a few words."

Before I review our financial results, I know that tax reform has been top of mind for many of you, so I thought I would share at a high level how we're thinking about it. Given that we don't know the scope or tim",1770,"Thank you, Geisha, and hello, everyone. Before I review our financial results, I know that tax reform has been top of mind for many of you, so I thought I would share at a high level how we're thinking about it. 
Given that we don't know the scope or timing of reform, there's still a lot of uncertainty around what the final legislation will include. I'll base my comments on the House Republican blueprint, which includes a 20% corporate tax rate, no interest deductibility and 100% expensing of capital. 
Overall, we believe we're well-positioned to address the impacts of tax reform. Income taxes are part of our regulated cost of service, and we would expect that the net benefit or cost of any of the proposed changes would largely flow to our customers. With respect to the reduction in corporate tax rates, customers would benefit in a couple of ways. First, the lower tax rate creates excess deferred taxes that will be refunded to our customers over time. 
As indicated on Slide 5, the utility has about a $10.5 billion net deferred tax liability. This balance would be reduced by about 1/3 of the corporate tax rate is lowered to 20%. Second, customer rates would be reduced to reflect the net impact of the lower tax rate going forward. At the holding company, our net deferred tax assets are about $300 million. A reduction in the federal tax rate to 20% would reduce the value of these assets by about 40%. While this amount would not be recoverable from customers, it also would not increase equity needs as these balances are not factored into the utility's equity ratio. Finally, the lower tax rate will be a net positive from a rate base perspective as it will result in slower future growth of deferred taxes. 
The next component I'll cover is the additional tax expense created from the elimination of the interest deduction, which would be passed to customers through the cost of capital. We don't expect a material shareholder impact from the loss of the interest expense deduction, given that we don't have significant outstanding debt at the holding company. 
Turning to the component that would allow for full expensing of capital. We expect the impact to be the minimal in the near-term, given our net operating loss. Longer-term, we'd expect this to moderate our rate base growth. We're not quantifying the potential rate base impacts at this point as we're still very early in the process and there are a lot of variables that could impact certain tax deductions in our NOL. 
Finally, just a few words on cash flows. On a net basis, we do not expect these proposed tax reforms to have a significant near-term impact on cash flows. On the tax payments side, this is because of our NOL. On the revenue side, this is because we're currently expensing about $1 billion in capital via repayers and flowing that benefit back to customers. The revenue reduction from the lower federal tax rate would be mitigated by the reduced flow-through benefit. So the bottom line is we're in a good position with respect to various tax reform proposals. We believe that the net impact of these reforms will create bill capacity that may provide opportunities to increase our capital spend related to incremental infrastructure and great modernization benefits, which we will balance with our goal of maintaining affordable service for our customers. 
So let me shift to our fourth quarter and year-end results, which are on Slide 6. Earnings from operations came in at $1.33 for the quarter and $3.76 for the year. GAAP earnings, including the items impacting comparability, are also shown here. Pipeline-related expenses were $33 million pretax for the quarter and $113 million pretax for the year. We incurred legal and regulatory-related expenses of $18 million pretax for the quarter and $72 million pretax for the year. These last 2 items are consistent with the guidance we previously provided. Fines and penalties came in at $170 million pretax for the quarter and $498 million pretax for the year. This is primarily related to the San Bruno penalty decision and disallowances imposed for the ex parte communications in phase 2 of the gas transmission and storage rate case decision. Butte fire-related costs, net of insurance, were $46 million pretax for the quarter and $232 million pretax for the year. 
Now as you'll recall, in the first quarter of last year, we took a charge for $350 million pretax, which represented the low end of the range for third-party property damages. It did not include any costs for fire suppression, personnel injury or other damages that PG&E could be liable for if we were found to be negligent. While our position continues to be that we were not negligent, this question would ultimately be decided by a jury if we were to go to trial. This quarter, we've increased the low end of the range to $750 million pretax, which takes into account the risk of all known claims, including negligence. We continue to be unable to estimate the high end of the range at this time. We also incurred legal costs related to the fire of $27 million pretax. We've increased the insurance receivable to $625 million, which represents the low end of the range for insurance recoveries. As we noted last year, we expect to seek full recovery for all insured losses, so this amount should not be viewed as a ceiling on recovery. Finally, as a reminder, last year, we took charges totaling about $80 million for cleanup and repair costs that are not recoverable. 
Moving to the next item. We reported $29 million pretax for the quarter and $219 million pretax for the year related to the capital disallowances ordered in the phase 1 gas transmission rate case decision. As you'll recall, the phase 1 decision included a number of cost caps and one-way balancing accounts and we took a charge in the second quarter to reflect our best estimate of capital program costs that would exceed authorized amounts over the rate case period. The increase this quarter reflects our updated estimate of these costs based on more detailed project planning. Lastly, we booked revenue of $325 million pretax for both the quarter and year, which reflects recognition of gas transmission revenues in excess of our 2016 cost of service. We originally estimated $350 million based on high-level revenue assumptions. The actual out-of-period revenues were slightly lower. 
On Slide 7, you'll see our quarter-over-quarter comparison of earnings from operations of $0.50 in Q4 of last year to $1.33 in Q4 of this year. With the final phase 2 gas transmission decision, we were able to record revenues that were $0.48 higher compared to the same quarter last year. As a reminder, we'll be recovering the gas transmission under-collection over 36 months and can record only 29 months of that revenue in 2016. The remaining 7 months of the under-collection will be recorded in the first quarter of 2017. Timing of taxes was $0.20 positive for the quarter and results in a net 0 impact for the year. We had $0.06 favorable as a result of the Diablo Canyon refueling outage in 2015 that we didn't have in the same period in 2016. Rate base earnings increased $0.05 for the quarter. We had $0.01 negative for the increase in outstanding shares and $0.05 favorable for a number of miscellaneous items. Miscellaneous includes the full severance charge for the organizational changes we announced in January. This was partially offset by lower contract costs as a result of efficiency measures in the fourth quarter and lower incentive compensation in 2016 compared to 2015. 
Transitioning now to Slide 8. We are reaffirming 2017 earnings from operations guidance of $3.55 to $3.75 per share. 
Our underlying assumptions are on Page 9. While our overall capital expenditures in 2017 are consistent with what we shared last quarter, we've had some movement between planned rate cases. Capacity-related project delays have reduced our electric transmission spend. These projects weren't slated to come online for several years, so you'll notice that our rate base is unchanged. These reductions were offset by incremental planned spend, primarily in our gas distribution and transmission businesses. It remains our objective to earn the CPUC authorized return on equity across the enterprise as a whole. 
Moving to Slide 10. We have 2 updates to our 2017 items impacting comparability. First, fines and penalties now reflects $15 million for the portion of the ex parte penalty imposed in the gas transmission phase 2 decision that we will recognize in the first quarter of 2017. This item does not include an estimate for potential future fines that may result from other proceedings, including the ongoing ex parte order instituting investigation. Second, the gas transmission revenue timing impact has been reduced by $10 million for a total of $150 million. This will also be recorded in the first quarter. As I mentioned, actual out of period revenues were slightly lower than what we have forecasted. 
On Slide 11, we're reaffirming our 2017 equity needs with a range of $400 million to $600 million. In 2018 and 2019, we still expect our equity needs to be met largely through internal programs, which historically have contributed approximately $350 million annually to our equity needs. 
Finally, on Slides 12 and 13, we're affirming our CapEx and rate base guidance through 2019. While we're still targeting 6.5% to 7% rate base growth through 2019, there are a couple of changes to the underlying assumptions on Slide 13. The base case now incorporates the final electric vehicle infrastructure decision that we received last December. It does not yet include our recent filings to support medium- and heavy-duty vehicle electrification. While we're not providing monitoring EPS guidance, it remains our objective to earn our CPUC authorized return on equity across the enterprise in 2018 and 2019. Assuming the commission approves the cost of capital settlement, our authorized return on equity will be 10.25% in 2018. 
I'll close by saying it's been a strong year for the company. As Geisha said, our focus on upgrading and modernizing our system to support the state's clean energy goals provides a strong growth trajectory in the future. Assuming the cost of capital settlement is approved, we'll have certainty on our cost of capital structure and return on equity through 2019. And we continue to target 6.5% to 7% rate base growth and a 60% dividend payout ratio by 2019. 
So with that, let's open up the lines for questions."

As it relates to the electric transmission business, there's a couple of competing pressures on that business. One, load is moderating in the state, and so that would sort of reduce the need for incremental capacity projects. That being said, we are increasing our renewable portfolio standards, so there will be more large-scale utility or renewable projects coming online and needing to be connected to the grid. And so, we think, currently, today, our conservative assumption around holding 2018 and 2019 spend flat to what we've received in the 2017 rate case and what we've requested in the 2017 rate case appears reasonable. The Gas Transmission & Storage business, we really stepped up our spending quite a bit in the 2015 rate case that we just received. And so when I look at 2019, there's still a lot of work that needs to be done on the system. The drivers that we see supporting that CapEx spend are very much longer term in nature. But I will say that, first, that 2015 rate case was the first time that we really stepped up our revenues post San Bruno. So I think, that increase was a bit of an anomaly and I wouldn't factor that in going forward. I do think the real opportunity is in helping the state facilitate its longer-term carbon goals, particularly around electrification. So as Tony mentioned, we recently filed an initial application for medium- and heavy-duty vehicles. But really, we think that helping support further electrification in the state provides upside to these plans longer-term."

Just to give a little clarity to that, we have definitely seen uptick in concerns around winter bills, particularly for gas usage for some of our customers. Just to give a little context for that, in August of last year, we actually implemented an increase in the gas transmission rates to incorporate the phase 1 decision from GT&S. That accounted for about a 19% increase for the average residential customer. As we've talked about, there was a substantial step up in spending in that case, and it was delayed pretty substantially from the initial time period when the rates would go into effect. To help kind of moderate that, in January, we actually implemented a reduction in rates of about 8%, which is the reflection of the phase 2 decision, where they then implemented the San Bruno penalty and the ex parte fine in that proceeding. So we really think that will help to moderate it. Obviously, we've had a stronger winter here in California this year than prior years, which has also led to increased usage.

So that's sort of, I think, an easy rule of thumb to think about load from that standpoint. And I think, from a growth standpoint, financially, the state has a goal of having 1.5 million electric vehicles on the road in California by 2025. That would equate to about 600,000 vehicles in our service territory. We think and the state thinks that we need distributed charging stations for every 4 vehicles that are on the road. So that would be a need for approximately 150,000 charging stations in our service territory. We think we're best positioned to facilitate that buildout and provide that service to our customers in our service territory.

But we think the number's generally right, it's just going to happen over a longer period of time. What we're doing in terms of preparing for that, of course, is the first and most important, is we have a really flexible energy supply portfolio. So for example, about 55% of the energy that we deliver to our customers is actually procured from third-parties. And those contracts tend to be a combination of both long-term and spot market purchases. So of the 55% that we have now under contract, nearly 40% represents megawatt hours that we do not have a contractual obligation to take in 2021.

Let me start off by saying how thrilled I am to be leading this iconic company. This is a time of great change and opportunity in the energy industry and I'm product that PG&E is helping to lead the way to a clean energy future. This morning, I'm going to spend a few moments reviewing our progress this past quarter with a focus on the 3 key objectives that I've set for the company, namely: building on our safety and operational performance; delivering on customer expectations; and positioning PG&E for success in the changing energy industry. After my remarks, I'll turn it over to Jason to walk us through the financials. 
But before I begin, I want to acknowledge the tragic death of Zachary Randell, a customer service representative who was killed in a random act of shooter incident in Fresno on April 18. Zack had only been with the company a few weeks but had already established himself as a valued member of our team. Our hearts go out to Zack's wife, their 2 young children as well as a Zack's family, friends and coworkers in the Fresno community. This was a senseless act of violence that has deeply impacted the PG&E team, and I thank you for allowing me a moment to recognize this terrible loss. 
To start our business update this morning. I'd like to report on 2 major developments this past quarter and our continuing efforts to resolve the proceedings stemming from the San Bruno tragedy. First, on March 15, all parties in the shareholder derivative litigation reached a global settlement that resolved all claims. On April 21, the judge in the main derivative cases preliminarily approved the settlement and scheduled a hearing for final approval on July 18. Second, on March 28, PG&E and the other active parties to the CPUC's ex parte investigation jointly submitted a settlement agreement to resolve the case through a combination of financial and nonfinancial remedies. If approved, these 2 settlements will move us substantially closer to resolving the San Bruno related legal matters. 
With those updates, let me begin by talking about our first key objective, and that is building on the safety and operational performance that we've achieved. As you know, safety is our most important responsibility and highest value. We've previously reported on the improvements we're seeing in public safety performance such as faster emergency response times and reductions in gas. Well, I'm happy to report that we're also seeing positive trends in employee safety. Both our OSHA recordable injury rate and preventable motor vehicle incident rate are down 20% in the first quarter of 2017 as compared to the same quarter of 2016. Even better, the number of serious motor vehicle incidents is down 65% this quarter as compared to the same period last year. These improvements are especially notable given the tough weather conditions in which our employees have to work this past quarter and they serve, frankly, as a testament to our employees' commitment to putting safety at the forefront of their work each and every day. 
Speaking of the weather, as we shared last quarter, in 2016 we delivered the second-best reliability in the company's history despite a record-setting winter storm season. Well, mother nature wasn't quite finished with us and strong winds heavy snow and rain continued to pound our service area over the last few months. The good news is that we've been able to minimize outage time for our customers. In fact, nearly 96% of the almost 2.5 million customers who experienced sustained outages during our January and February storms were restored within 24 hours. Now our strong performance can be credited to the tireless efforts of our employees, improvements in our emergency preparedness and response capabilities and the investments we've been making over the years to modernize and upgrade our electric system. In the first quarter alone, we avoided more than 50 million customer outage minutes as a result of our investments in advanced grid automation and self-healing technology. As we continue to install this technology throughout our electric system, our customers will enjoy even greater reliability benefits in the future. 
Of course we can't talk about reliability without mentioning the significant outage we experienced in San Francisco on April 21. This outage was not weather-related it was caused by a fire at one of our substations. We know this outage inconvenienced many of our customers, but thankfully, no public or employee injuries are reported as a result of the incident. I'd like to highlight that we were already underway with a major $100 million upgrade to the substation and we're also working closely with the city of San Francisco to address your questions in the wake of the outage. 
I'd like to turn now to our second key objective which is delivering on our customers' expectations. Our goal is to be our customers' provider of choice. We know that energy customers today want more options and more control and that's driving us to focus on enhancing our customers' experience through continuous innovation and improvement throughout our business, and we're pleased to see these efforts actually paying off. For example, we've recently received the results of our annual customer satisfaction survey for our gas transmission business which showed the second highest rating in the 20-plus years we've conducted the survey. We also recently received EEI 2017 award for outstanding national key accounts customer service. Votes for this award were cast in a nationwide open ballot by a pool of national commercial customers that include some of the country's largest, most sophisticated and most demanding energy consumers. We're proud of the progress we're making with customers and we remain focused on continuing to improve the quality of our service. 
As we continue to invest in our system to provide customers with a level of service they need and expect, we're also committed to affordability. Now earlier this year, we announced $300 million in cost efficiency measures for 2017. I'm happy to report that we're on track to achieve the savings this year, and as we've mentioned before, this effort should be viewed as a first step in an ongoing focus on maintaining affordable service for our customers. 
I'd like to turn now to our third key objective, positioning PG&E for success in the changing energy industry. To us, success goes hand in hand with enabling California clean energy economy, a topic I'm particularly passionate about. With the state of the clean power plant in question, I've been getting inquiries about how we see the national political environment affecting our business strategies on clean energy here in California. We believe that regardless of what happens at the federal level, California will continue to lead the way in transitioning to a clean energy economy, and we are absolutely committed to remaining a key partner in the state's efforts. As we think about California's clean energy future, we know that some changes will be needed in regulations that mirror market changes that have taken place. So for example, last week, PG&E, Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas and Electric collectively filed an application at the CPUC proposing to update the mechanisms used to ensure a fair allocation of energy supply costs to those customers that choose to depart for either CCAs or direct access providers. We are proposing to replace the current mechanism which is known as the PCIA, the power charge indifference adjustment and, which, by the way, all parties agree is in need of reform with an updated approach that more fairly allocates costs and benefits. As California continues to engage in discussions on the utility of the future, we view this as a foundational step for the continued growth of CCAs or other choices that our customers may have in the future. 
Beyond Energy Supply, one of the most promising clean energy opportunities in California is electrification of the transportation sector. Transportation accounts for about 40% of California's GHD emissions. Governor Brown and the California Air Resource Board have both signaled their desire to see a dramatic increase in the number of 0 emission vehicles in California. So it's clear that electric vehicles will play a critical role in helping the state achieve its carbon reduction goals. 
The CPUC's approval last December, we're actively kickstarting our $130 million pilot, which, by the way, is the nation's largest utility infrastructure deployment to support charging of light-duty EVs. At the same time we're also continuing to work with innovative partners to pilot new programs, technologies and approaches in the EV space. So for example, last December, we wrapped up Phase 1 of our smart charging pilot with BMW. Over the 18 months of the pilot, we were able to shift nearly 20-megawatt hours of charging in response to changing grid conditions. We're excited to support the next phase of this pilot which will test the feasibility and the value of more active charge management. 
So to close, I want to reiterate my confidence in our future. We remain focused on continuing to deliver safety and operational excellence in meeting the needs of our customers. And at the same time, we are as committed as ever to working with the states to achieve these clean energy goals. We feel good about the opportunities this represents for PG&E and for our customers. Thank you for your time today. And with that, let me turn it over to Jason to walk us through the financials."

Slide 4 shows our results for the first quarter. Earnings from operations came in at $1.06 per share. GAAP earnings including the items impacting comparability are also shown here. The pretax numbers for the items impacting comparability are in the table at the bottom of the page. Pipeline-related expenses were $28 million pretax for the quarter. We incurred legal and regulatory-related expenses of $4 million pretax. Fines and penalties were $60 million pretax for the quarter. This includes the planed $47 million related to the San Bruno penalty decision and disallowances imposed for ex parte communications in Phase 2 of the gas transmission and storage rate case decision. We have now fully recognized the penalties imposed from these 2 decisions. This item also reflects a $13 million charge as a result of the settlement that we reached at the end of the first quarter in the ex parte order instituting investigation. Fire-related costs net of insurance were $3 million pretax and reflect legal costs associated with the fire. Finally, we booked revenue of $150 million pretax for the quarter which reflects recognition of the gas transmission revenues in excess of our 2017 cost of service. We've now recognized all of the undercollected revenues associated with our 2015 gas transmission and storage rate case. 
On Slide 5, you'll see our quarter-over-quarter comparison of earnings from operations of $0.82 in Q1 of last year and $1.06 in Q1 of this year. We were $0.15 favorable as a result of the timing of the 2015 gas transmission and storage rate case decision which didn't allow us to recognize incremental revenues until the third quarter of 2016. This item is purely timing in nature and will reverse by year-end. We were $0.06 favorable as a result of tax benefits associated with the share-based compensation. There was an accounting standard change last year and we are now booking the tax impact of our annual equity compensation true up through earnings rather than equity. Rate base earnings were $0.03 for the quarter. Miscellaneous items amounted to $0.05 favorable for the quarter which includes tax timing differences that will reverse by year-end. In previous years, we had shown tax timing as a separate driver, but we don't expect the quarter-over-quarter changes to be as significant in 2017. 
A delay in the timing of our 2017 GRC decision resulted in an unfavorable $0.03 for the quarter. This is primarily driven by incremental capital costs such as depreciation and interest without offsetting revenues. The driver for this particular $0.03 is timing, but as a reminder, we do expect the net impact of our 2017 GRC revenues and related costs to be roughly $0.25 negative for the year due to the loss of the incremental tax repair benefits. Additionally, of the proposed GRC decision is approved without modification, we'd expect to see an increase to rate base earnings of approximately $0.08 on an annualized basis. Finally, we are $0.02 negative for the increase in outstanding shares. 
Transitioning now to Slide 6. We are reaffirming our 2017 earnings from operations guidance of $3.55 to $3.75 per share. Our underlying assumptions are on Page 7 and are consistent with what we shared last quarter. It remains our objective to earn the CPUC authorized return on equity across the enterprise as a whole. 
Moving to Slide 8. We have several updates to our 2017 items impacting comparability. First, with respect to our rights-of-way program, we had previously shared that the overall costs would not exceed $500 million. While the current year range for pipeline-related expenses is unchanged from last quarter, we're pleased that the overall cost of our rights-of-way program is now expected to range from $425 million to $475 million. We do, however, expect a small portion of the work will now fall into 2018 due to permitting challenges. 
Second, as a result of the settlements we've reached in the ex parte investigation and the shareholder derivative lawsuits in the first quarter, we expect our legal and regulatory cost to come in around $10 million for the year. We have previously expected these cost to range from $10 million to $40 million. 
Third, fines and penalties now reflect the $30 million in remedies settled as part of the ex parte investigation. The CPUC has not yet ruled on a settlement and the ultimate decision may modify this amount. We previously expected fines and penalties to be roughly $45 million. 
Finally we've added a new item that reflects a settlement we reached in the shareholder derivative lawsuits. If the settlement is approved without modification, the impact would result in a gain of approximately $65 million net of certain legal expenses we agreed to pay on the plaintiff's behalf. 
We're reaffirming our 2017 equity needs on Slide 9 with a range of $400 million to $600 million. In 2018 and 2019, we still expect our equity needs to be met largely through our internal programs which historically have been approximately $350 million annually. 
On Slides 10 and 11, we're reaffirming our CapEx and rate base guidance through 2019. I wanted to highlight one new item with potential upside to our capital plan. As new gas storage regulations are adopted, we need to invest capital on our system to comply with the new regulations. We should know more about the new regulators later this year. 
Finally, we recently had a development in our cost of capital case. Last week, the proposed decision approving that all party settlement was withdrawn from the CPUC's April 22 agenda. This was disappointing, particularly given constructive efforts that went into the settlement in the proposed decision. We remain confident that the all party settlement, which was developed with investor-owned utilities and consumer advocates, is in the best interest of our customers, and we look forward to working with the CPUC in settling parties to reach a timely resolution of this case. While we're not providing longer-term EPS guidance, it remains our objective to earn our CPUC authorized return on equity across the enterprise in 2018 and 2019. 
I'll close by saying we're off to a strong start in 2017. We continue to have solid organic growth with expected capital spend totaling approximately $18 billion over the next 3 years. We're continuing to target above average dividend per share growth with a 60% dividend payout ratio by 2019. Combined, these factors make for an attractive total return. So with that, let's open up the line for questions."

I think it's important to remember, first, when CCAs early form and as the legislature has continued to reinforce, the legislative intent here is that when a customer or a community chooses to go CCA, the customers who remained PG&E-bundled customers should be indifferent to that choice. In other words, any costs that were borne customers who eventually choose to go CCA, they should take those -- their share of those costs with them so that customers who remain behind are indifferent. The mechanism that the commission's put in place to accomplish that, as Geisha said, was the PCIA, and that mechanism, and over time as CCAs have grown, has become more distorted. It's not as effective. It's fully passing through those costs. So what we see today is that about 65% of the costs actually are passed through to customers who go CCA, and the rest remain with our bundle customers. Now that was not a significant issue when CCAs were really small and served a small portion of the load, but we're currently forecasting by the end of this year, they'll be at 13% and growing to 38% by 2020. So in order to really build a sustainable future for those CCAs and for other choices, as Geisha mentioned, we've got to make sure we put in place the right foundational mechanism. So that PAM, the difference in the PAM, versus the PCIA is that it uses -- rather than using administratively set benchmarks to try and value the portfolio that we have put together, it uses actual market prices with true up mechanisms. And importantly, going forward, when -- under the PCIA, when a customer departs, they bear their portion of the cost but they receive no benefits from the portfolio we've currently accrued. And under the PAM, the renewable attributes of the portfolio we've accrued and the resource adequacy would actually be transferred over the CCA for them to use in their portfolio to continue to serve customers. So using the combination of transferring benefits and using market prices, we feel the PAM is a better way to really value the current portfolio and assure those costs are evenly shared. And in doing that, we build the foundation for continued growth."

First, on March 15, all parties in the shareholder derivative litigation reached a global settlement to resolve all claims. On April 21, the judge in the main derivative cases preliminarily approved the settlement and scheduled a hearing for final approval on July 18. Second, on March 28, PG&E and the other active parties of the CPUC's ex parte investigation jointly submitted a settlement agreement to resolve the case through a combination of financial and nonfinancial remedies. If approved, these 2 settlements will move us substantially closer to resolving the San Bruno-related legal matters. 
With those updates, let me begin by talking about our first key objective, and that is building on a safety and operational performance that we've achieved. As you know, safety is our most important responsibility and highest value. We've previously reported on the improvements we're seeing in public safety performance, such as faster emergency response times and reductions in gas diggings. Well, I'm happy to report that we're also seeing positive trends in employee safety. Both our OSHA recordable injury rate and preventable motor vehicle incident rate are down 20% in the first quarter of 2017 as compared to the same quarter of 2016. Even better, the number of serious motor vehicle incidents is down 65% this quarter as compared to the same period last year. These improvements are especially notable given the tough weather conditions in which our employees had to work this past quarter. And they serve, frankly, as a testament to our employees' commitment to putting safety at the forefront of their work each and every day. 
Speaking of the weather, as we shared last quarter, in 2016, we delivered the second-best reliability in the company's history despite a record-setting winter storm season. Well, Mother Nature wasn't quite finished with us, and strong winds, heavy snow and rain continued to pound our service area over the last few months. The good news is that we've been able to minimize outage time for our customers. In fact, nearly 96% of the almost 2.5 million customers who experienced sustained outages during our January and February storms were restored within 24 hours. Now our strong performance can be credited to the tireless efforts of our employees, improvements in our emergency preparedness and response capabilities and the investments we've been making over the years to modernize and upgrade our electric system. In the first quarter alone, we avoided more than 50 million customer outage minutes as a result of our investments in advanced grid automation and self-healing technology. As we continue to install this technology throughout our electric system, our customers will enjoy even greater reliability benefits in the future. 
Of course, we can't talk about reliability without mentioning the significant outage we experienced in San Francisco on April 21. This outage was not weather-related but was caused by a fire at one of our substations. We know this outage inconvenienced many of our customers, but thankfully, no public or employee injuries are reported as a result of the incident. I'd like to highlight that we were already underway with a major $100 million upgrade to the substation, and we're also working closely with the city of San Francisco to address your questions in the wake of the outage. 
I'd like to turn now to our second key objective, which is delivering on our customers' expectations. Our goal is to be our customers' provider of choice. We know that energy customers today want more options and more control, and that's driving us to focus on enhancing our customers' experience through continuous innovation and improvement throughout our business, and we're pleased to see these efforts actually paying off. For example, we've recently received the results of our annual customer satisfaction survey for our gas transmission business, which showed the second highest rating in the 20-plus years we've conducted the survey. We also recently received EEI 2017 award for outstanding national key accounts customer service. Votes for this award were cast in a nationwide open ballot by a pool of national commercial customers that include some of the country's largest, most sophisticated and most demanding energy consumers. We're proud of the progress we're making with customers, and we remain focused on continuing to improve the quality of our service. 
As we continue to invest in our system to provide customers with the level of service they need and expect, we're also committed to affordability. Now earlier this year, we announced $300 million in cost efficiency measures for 2017. I'm happy to report that we're on track to achieve the savings this year, and as we've mentioned before, this effort should be viewed as a first step in an ongoing focus on maintaining affordable service for our customers. 
I'd like to turn now to our third key objective, positioning PG&E for success in the changing energy industry. To us, success goes hand in hand with enabling California's clean energy economy, a topic I'm particularly passionate about. With the state of the clean power plant in question, I've been getting inquiries about how we see the national political environment affecting our business strategies on clean energy here in California. We believe that regardless of what happens at the federal level, California will continue to lead the way in transitioning to a clean energy economy, and we are absolutely committed to remaining a key partner in the state's efforts. As we think about California's clean energy future, we know that some changes will be needed in regulations that mirror market changes that have taken place. So for example, last week, PG&E, Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric collectively filed an application at the CPUC proposing to update the mechanisms used to ensure a fair allocation of energy supply costs to those customers that choose to depart for either CCAs or direct access providers. We are proposing to replace the current mechanism, which is known as the PCIA, the power charge indifference adjustment, and which, by the way, all parties agree is a need of reform with an updated approach that more fairly allocates costs and benefits. As California continues to engage in discussions on the utility of the future, we view this as a foundational step for the continued growth of CCAs or other choices that our customers may have in the future. 
Beyond Energy Supply, one of the most promising clean energy opportunities in California is electrification of the transportation sector. Transportation accounts for about 40% of California's GHG emissions. Governor Brown and the California Air Resource Board have both signaled their desire to see a dramatic increase in the number of 0 emission vehicles in California, so it's clear that electric vehicles will play a critical role in helping the state achieve its carbon reduction goals. 
The CPUC's approval last December, we're actively kickstarting our $130 million pilot, which, by the way, is the nation's largest utility infrastructure deployment to support charging of light-duty EVs. At the same time, we're also continuing to work with innovative partners to pilot new programs, technologies and approaches in the EV space. So for example, last December, we wrapped up Phase 1 of our smart charging pilot with BMW. Over the 18 months of the pilot, we were able to shift nearly 20-megawatt hours of charging in response to changing grid conditions. We're excited to support the next phase of this pilot, which will test the feasibility and the value of more active charge management. 
So to close, I want to reiterate my confidence in our future. We remain focused on continuing to deliver safety and operational excellence in meeting the needs of our customers, and at the same time, we are as committed as ever to working with the states to achieve its clean energy goals. We feel good about the opportunities this represents for PG&E and for our customers. 
Thank you for your time today, and with that, let me turn it over to Jason to walk us through the financials."

GAAP earnings, inclu",1099,"Thank you, Geisha, and hello, everyone. I'll begin by reviewing the first quarter results and then quickly cover the 2017 outlook. 
Slide 4 shows our results for the first quarter. Earnings from operations came in at $1.06 per share. GAAP earnings, including the items impacting comparability, are also shown here. The pretax numbers for the items impacting comparability are in the table at the bottom of the page. Pipeline-related expenses were $28 million pretax for the quarter. We incurred legal and regulatory-related expenses of $4 million pretax. Fines and penalties were $60 million pretax for the quarter. This includes the planned $47 million related to the San Bruno penalty decision and disallowances imposed for ex parte communications in Phase 2 of the gas transmission and storage rate case decision. We have now fully recognized the penalties imposed from these 2 decisions. This item also reflects a $13 million charge as a result of the settlement that we reached at the end of the first quarter in the ex parte order instituting investigation. Butte fire-related costs net of insurance were $3 million pretax and reflect legal costs associated with the fire. Finally, we booked revenue of $150 million pretax for the quarter, which reflects a recognition of the gas transmission revenues in excess of our 2017 cost of service. We have now recognized all of the undercollected revenues associated with our 2015 gas transmission and storage rate case. 
On Slide 5, you'll see our quarter-over-quarter comparison of earnings from operations of $0.82 in Q1 of last year and $1.06 in Q1 of this year. We were $0.15 favorable as a result of the timing of the 2015 gas transmission and storage rate case decision, which didn't allow us to recognize incremental revenues until the third quarter of 2016. This item is purely timing in nature and will reverse by year-end. We were $0.06 favorable as a result of tax benefits associated with share-based compensation. There was an accounting standard change last year, and we are now booking the tax impact of our annual equity compensation true-up through earnings rather than equity. Rate base earnings were $0.03 for the quarter. Miscellaneous items amounted to $0.05 favorable for the quarter, which includes tax timing differences that will reverse by year-end. In previous years, we had shown tax timing as a separate driver, but we don't expect the quarter-over-quarter changes to be as significant in 2017. A delay in the timing of our 2017 GRC decision resulted in an unfavorable $0.03 for the quarter. This is primarily driven by incremental capital costs, such as depreciation and interest, without offsetting revenues. The driver for this particular $0.03 is timing, but as a reminder, we do expect the net impact of our 2017 GRC revenues and related costs to be roughly $0.25 negative for the year due to the loss of the incremental tax repair benefits. Additionally, if the proposed GRC decision is approved without modification, we'd expect to see an increase to rate base earnings of approximately $0.08 on an annualized basis. Finally, we are $0.02 negative for the increase in outstanding shares. 
Transitioning now to Slide 6. We are reaffirming our 2017 earnings from operations guidance of $3.55 to $3.75 per share. Our underlying assumptions are on Page 7 and are consistent with what we shared last quarter. It remains our objective to earn the CPUC authorized return on equity across the enterprise as a whole. 
Moving to Slide 8. We have several updates to our 2017 items impacting comparability. First, with the respect to our rights-of-way program, we had previously shared that the overall cost would not exceed $500 million. While the current year range for pipeline-related expenses is unchanged from last quarter, we're pleased that the overall cost of our rights-of-way program is now expected to range from $425 million to $475 million. We do, however, expect a small portion of the work will now fall into 2018 due to permitting challenges. 
Second, as a result of the settlements we've reached in the ex parte investigation and the shareholder derivative lawsuits in the first quarter, we expect our legal and regulatory cost to come in around $10 million for the year. We have previously expected these costs to range from $10 million to $40 million. 
Third, fines and penalties now reflect the $30 million in remedies settled as part of the ex parte investigation. The CPUC has not yet ruled on a settlement, and the ultimate decision may modify this amount. We have previously expected fines and penalties to be roughly $45 million. 
Finally, we've added a new item that reflects a settlement we reached in the shareholder derivative lawsuits. If the settlement is approved without modification, the impact would result in a gain of approximately $65 million net of certain legal expenses we agreed to pay on the plaintiff's behalf. 
We are reaffirming our 2017 equity needs on Slide 9 with a range of $400 million to $600 million. In 2018 and 2019, we still expect our equity needs to be met largely through our internal programs, which historically have been approximately $350 million annually. 
On Slides 10 and 11, we're reaffirming our CapEx and rate base guidance through 2019. I wanted to highlight one new item with potential upside to our capital plan. As new gas storage regulations are adopted, we'll need to invest capital on our system to comply with the new regulations. We should know more about the new regulators later this year. 
Finally, we recently had a development in our cost of capital case. Last week, the proposed decision approving the all-party settlement was withdrawn from the CPUC's April 22 agenda. This was disappointing, particularly given the constructive efforts that went into the settlement in the proposed decision. We'll remain confident that the all-party settlement, which was developed with investor-owned utilities and consumer advocates, is in the best interest of our customers, and we look forward to working with the CPUC and settling parties to reach a timely resolution of this case. While we're not providing longer-term EPS guidance, it remains our objective to earn our CPUC authorized return on equity across the enterprise in 2018 and 2019. 
I'll close by saying we're off to a strong start in 2017. We continue to have solid organic growth with expected capital spend totaling approximately $18 billion over the next 3 years. We're continuing to target above-average dividend per share growth with a 60% dividend payout ratio by 2019. Combined, these factors make for an attractive total return. 
So with that, let's open up the line for questions."

I think it's important to remember, first, when CCAs' early form and as the legislature has continued to reinforce, the legislative intent here is that when a customer or a",391,"This is Steve Malnight from our strategy and policy team, so let me fill that one. I think it's important to remember, first, when CCAs' early form and as the legislature has continued to reinforce, the legislative intent here is that when a customer or a community chooses to go CCA, the customers who remained PG&E-bundled customers should be indifferent to that choice. In other words, any costs that were borne customers who eventually choose to go CCA, they should take those -- their share of those costs with them so that customers who remain behind are indifferent. The mechanism that the commission has put in place to accomplish that, as Geisha said, was the PCIA. And that mechanism, over time as CCAs have grown, has become more distorted. It's not as effective, fully passing through those costs. So what we see today is that about 65% of the costs actually are passed through to customers who go CCA, and the rest remain with our bundled customers. Now that was not a significant issue when CCAs were really small and served a small portion of the load. But we're currently forecasting that by the end of this year, they'll be at 13% and growing to 38% by 2020. So in order to really build a sustainable future for those CCAs and for other choices, as Geisha mentioned, we've got to make sure we put in place the right foundational mechanism. So the PAM, the difference in the PAM, versus the PCIA is that it uses -- rather than using administratively set benchmarks to try and value the portfolio that we have put together, it uses actual market prices with true-up mechanisms. And importantly, going forward, when -- under the PCIA, when a customer departs, they bear their portion of the cost, but they receive no benefits from the portfolio we've currently accrued. And under the PAM, the renewable attributes of the portfolio we've accrued and the resource adequacy would actually be transferred over to the CCA for them to use in their portfolio to continue to serve customers. So using the combination of transferring benefits and using market prices, we feel the PAM is a better way to really value the current portfolio and assure those costs are evenly shared. And in doing that, we build the foundation for continued growth."

Let me start off by saying how thrilled I am to be leading this iconic company. This is a time of great change and opportunity in the energy industry, and I'm product that PG&E is helping to lead the way to a clean energy future. This morning, I'm going to spend a few minutes reviewing our progress this past quarter with a focus on the 3 key objectives that I've set for the company, namely: building on our safety and operational performance; delivering on customer expectations; and positioning PG&E for success in the changing energy industry. After my remarks, I'll turn it over to Jason to walk us through the financials. 
But before I begin, I want to acknowledge the tragic death of Zackary Randalls, a customer service representative who was killed in a random active shooter incident in Fresno on April 18. Zack had only been with the company a few weeks, but had already established himself as a valued member of our team. Our hearts go out to Zack's wife, their 2 young children as well as Zack's family, friends and coworkers in the Fresno community. This was a senseless act of violence that has deeply impacted the PG&E team, and I thank you for allowing me a moment to recognize this terrible loss. 
To start our business update this morning, I'd like to report on 2 major developments this past quarter and our continuing efforts to resolve the proceedings stemming from the San Bruno tragedy. First, on March 15, all parties in the shareholder derivative litigation reached a global settlement to resolve all claims. On April 21, the judge in the main derivative cases preliminarily approved the settlement and scheduled a hearing for final approval on July 18. Second, on March 28, PG&E and the other active parties to the CPUC's ex parte investigation jointly submitted a settlement agreement to resolve the case through a combination of financial and nonfinancial remedies. If approved, these 2 settlements will move us substantially closer to resolving the San Bruno-related legal matters. 
With those updates, let me begin by talking about our first key objective, and that is building on the safety and operational performance that we've achieved. As you know, safety is our most important responsibility and highest value. We've previously reported on the improvements we're seeing in public safety performance, such as faster emergency response times and reductions in gas dig-ins. Well, I'm happy to report that we're also seeing positive trends in employee safety. Both our OSHA recordable injury rate and preventable motor vehicle incident rate are down 20% in the first quarter of 2017 as compared to the same quarter of 2016. Even better, the number of serious motor vehicle incidents is down 65% this quarter as compared to the same period last year. These improvements are especially notable given the tough weather conditions in which our employees had to work this past quarter. And they serve, frankly, as a testament to our employees' commitment to putting safety at the forefront of their work each and every day. 
Speaking of the weather, as we shared last quarter, in 2016, we delivered the second-best reliability in the company's history despite a record-setting winter storm season. Well, Mother Nature wasn't quite finished with us, and strong winds, heavy snow and rain continued to pound our service area over the last few months. The good news is that we've been able to minimize outage time for our customers. In fact, nearly 96% of the almost 2.5 million customers who experienced sustained outages during our January and February storms were restored within 24 hours. Now our strong performance can be credited to the tireless efforts of our employees, improvements in our emergency preparedness and response capabilities, and the investments we've been making over the years to modernize and upgrade our electric system. In the first quarter alone, we avoided more than 50 million customer outage minutes as a result of our investments in advanced grid automation and self-healing technology. As we continue to install this technology throughout our electric system, our customers will enjoy even greater reliability benefits in the future. 
Of course, we can't talk about reliability without mentioning the significant outage we experienced in San Francisco on April 21. This outage was not weather-related but was caused by a fire at one of our substations. We know this outage inconvenienced many of our customers, but thankfully, no public or employee injuries are reported as a result of the incident. I'd like to highlight that we were already underway with a major $100 million upgrade to the substation, and we're also working closely with the city of San Francisco to address their questions in the wake of the outage. 
I'd like to turn now to our second key objective, which is delivering on our customers' expectations. Our goal is to be our customers' provider of choice. We know that energy customers today want more options and more control, and that's driving us to focus on enhancing our customers' experience through continuous innovation and improvement throughout our business, and we're pleased to see these efforts actually paying off. For example, we've recently received the results of our annual customer satisfaction survey for our gas transmission business, which showed the second highest rating in the 20-plus years we've conducted the survey. We also recently received EEI's 2017 award for outstanding national key accounts customer service. Votes for this award were cast in a nationwide open ballot by a pool of national commercial customers that include some of the country's largest, most sophisticated and most demanding energy consumers. We're proud of the progress we're making with customers, and we remain focused on continuing to improve the quality of our service. 
As we continue to invest in our systems to provide customers with the level of service they need and expect, we're also committed to affordability. Now earlier this year, we announced $300 million in cost efficiency measures for 2017. I'm happy to report that we're on track to achieve the savings this year, and as we've mentioned before, this effort should be viewed as a first step in an ongoing focus on maintaining affordable service for our customers. 
I'd like to turn now to our third key objective: positioning PG&E for success in the changing energy industry. To us, success goes hand in hand with enabling California's clean energy economy, a topic I'm particularly passionate about. With the state of the clean power plant in question, I've been getting inquiries about how we see the national political environment affecting our business strategies on clean energy here in California. We believe that regardless of what happens at the federal level, California will continue to lead the way in transitioning to a clean energy economy, and we are absolutely committed to remaining a key partner in the state's efforts. As we think about California's clean energy future, we know that some changes will be needed in regulations that mirror market changes that have taken place. So for example, last week, PG&E, Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric collectively filed an application at the CPUC proposing to update the mechanisms used to ensure a fair allocation of energy supply costs to those customers that choose to depart for either CCAs or direct access providers. We are proposing to replace the current mechanism, which is known as the PCIA, the power charge indifference adjustment, and which, by the way, all parties agree is in need of reform, with an updated approach that more fairly allocates costs and benefits. As California continues to engage in discussions on the utility of the future, we view this as a foundational step for the continued growth of CCAs or other choices that our customers may have in the future. 
Beyond Energy Supply, one of the most promising clean energy opportunities in California is electrification of the transportation sector. Transportation accounts for about 40% of California's GHG emissions. Governor Brown and the California Air Resource Board have both signaled their desire to see a dramatic increase in the number of zero-emission vehicles in California, so it's clear that electric vehicles will play a critical role in helping the state achieve its carbon reduction goals. 
The CPUC's approval last December, we're actively kickstarting our $130 million pilot, which, by the way, is the nation's largest utility infrastructure deployment to support charging of light-duty EVs. At the same time, we're also continuing to work with innovative partners to pilot new programs, technologies and approaches in the EV space. So for example, last December, we wrapped up Phase 1 of our smart charging pilot with BMW. Over the 18 months of the pilot, we were able to shift nearly 20-megawatt hours of charging in response to changing grid conditions. We're excited to support the next phase of this pilot, which will test the feasibility and the value of more active charge management. 
So to close, I want to reiterate my confidence in our future. We remain focused on continuing to deliver safety and operational excellence in meeting the needs of our customers, and at the same time, we are as committed as ever to working with the state to achieve its clean energy goals. We feel good about the opportunities this represents for PG&E and for our customers. 
Thank you for your time today, and with that, let me turn it over to Jason to walk us through the financials."

GAAP earnings, inclu",1099,"Thank you, Geisha, and hello, everyone. I'll begin by reviewing the first quarter results and then quickly cover the 2017 outlook. 
Slide 4 shows our results for the first quarter. Earnings from operations came in at $1.06 per share. GAAP earnings, including the items impacting comparability, are also shown here. The pretax numbers for the items impacting comparability are in the table at the bottom of the page. Pipeline-related expenses were $28 million pretax for the quarter. We incurred legal and regulatory-related expenses of $4 million pretax. Fines and penalties were $60 million pretax for the quarter. This includes the planned $47 million related to the San Bruno penalty decision and disallowances imposed for ex parte communications in Phase 2 of the gas transmission and storage rate case decision. We have now fully recognized the penalties imposed from these 2 decisions. This item also reflects a $13 million charge as a result of the settlement that we reached at the end of the first quarter in the ex parte order instituting investigation. Butte fire-related costs net of insurance were $3 million pretax and reflect legal costs associated with the fire. Finally, we booked revenue of $150 million pretax for the quarter, which reflects a recognition of the gas transmission revenues in excess of our 2017 cost of service. We have now recognized all of the undercollected revenues associated with our 2015 gas transmission and storage rate case. 
On Slide 5, you'll see our quarter-over-quarter comparison of earnings from operations of $0.82 in Q1 of last year and $1.06 in Q1 of this year. We were $0.15 favorable as a result of the timing of the 2015 gas transmission and storage rate case decision, which didn't allow us to recognize incremental revenues until the third quarter of 2016. This item is purely timing in nature and will reverse by year-end. We were $0.06 favorable as a result of tax benefits associated with share-based compensation. There was an accounting standard change last year, and we are now booking the tax impact of our annual equity compensation true-up through earnings rather than equity. Rate base earnings were $0.03 for the quarter. Miscellaneous items amounted to $0.05 favorable for the quarter, which includes tax timing differences that will reverse by year-end. In previous years, we had shown tax timing as a separate driver, but we don't expect the quarter-over-quarter changes to be as significant in 2017. A delay in the timing of our 2017 GRC decision resulted in an unfavorable $0.03 for the quarter. This is primarily driven by incremental capital costs, such as depreciation and interest, without offsetting revenues. The driver for this particular $0.03 is timing, but as a reminder, we do expect the net impact of our 2017 GRC revenues and related costs to be roughly $0.25 negative for the year due to the loss of the incremental tax repair benefits. Additionally, if the proposed GRC decision is approved without modification, we'd expect to see an increase to rate base earnings of approximately $0.08 on an annualized basis. Finally, we are $0.02 negative for the increase in outstanding shares. 
Transitioning now to Slide 6. We are reaffirming our 2017 earnings from operations guidance of $3.55 to $3.75 per share. Our underlying assumptions are on Page 7 and are consistent with what we shared last quarter. It remains our objective to earn the CPUC authorized return on equity across the enterprise as a whole. 
Moving to Slide 8. We have several updates to our 2017 items impacting comparability. First, with the respect to our rights-of-way program, we had previously shared that the overall cost would not exceed $500 million. While the current year range for pipeline-related expenses is unchanged from last quarter, we're pleased that the overall cost of our rights-of-way program is now expected to range from $425 million to $475 million. We do, however, expect a small portion of the work will now fall into 2018 due to permitting challenges. 
Second, as a result of the settlements we've reached in the ex parte investigation and the shareholder derivative lawsuits in the first quarter, we expect our legal and regulatory costs to come in around $10 million for the year. We had previously expected these costs to range from $10 million to $40 million. 
Third, fines and penalties now reflect the $13 million in remedies settled as part of the ex parte investigation. The CPUC has not yet ruled on a settlement, and the ultimate decision may modify this amount. We had previously expected fines and penalties to be roughly $45 million. 
Finally, we've added a new item that reflects a settlement we reached in the shareholder derivative lawsuits. If the settlement is approved without modification, the impact would result in a gain of approximately $65 million net of certain legal expenses we agreed to pay on the plaintiff's behalf. 
We are reaffirming our 2017 equity needs on Slide 9 with a range of $400 million to $600 million. In 2018 and 2019, we still expect our equity needs to be met largely through our internal programs, which historically have been approximately $350 million annually. 
On Slides 10 and 11, we're reaffirming our CapEx and rate base guidance through 2019. I wanted to highlight one new item with potential upside to our capital plan. As new gas storage regulations are adopted, we'll need to invest capital in our system to comply with the new regulations. We should know more about the new regulations later this year. 
Finally, we recently had a development in our cost of capital case. Last week, the proposed decision approving the all-party settlement was withdrawn from the CPUC's April 27 agenda. This was disappointing, particularly given the constructive efforts that went into the settlement in the proposed decision. We'll remain confident that the all-party settlement, which was developed with investor-owned utilities and consumer advocates, is in the best interest of our customers, and we look forward to working with the CPUC and settling parties to reach a timely resolution of this case. While we're not providing longer-term EPS guidance, it remains our objective to earn our CPUC authorized return on equity across the enterprise in 2018 and 2019. 
I'll close by saying we're off to a strong start in 2017. We continue to have solid organic growth with expected capital spend totaling approximately $18 billion over the next 3 years. We're continuing to target above-average dividend per share growth with a 60% dividend payout ratio by 2019. Combined, these factors make for an attractive total return.

In terms of the future of transportation electrification, we just filed for medium- and heavy-duty vehicles back in late January. We're going to have to work through the CPUC process on that.

I think it's important to remember, first, when CCAs really formed, and as the legislature has continued to reinforce, the legislative intent here is that when a customer or a community chooses to go CCA, the customers who remain PG&E-bundled customers should be indifferent to that choice. In other words, any costs that were borne -- customers who eventually choose to go CCA, they should take those -- their share of those costs with them so that customers who remain behind are indifferent. The mechanism that the commission has put in place to accomplish that, as Geisha said, was the PCIA. And that mechanism, over time as CCAs have grown, has become more distorted. It's not as effective at fully passing through those costs. So what we see today is that about 65% of the costs actually are passed through to customers who go CCA, and the rest remain with our bundled customers. Now that was not a significant issue when CCAs were really small and served a small portion of the load. But we're currently forecasting that by the end of this year, they'll be at 13%, and growing to 38% by 2020. So in order to really build a sustainable future for those CCAs and for other choices, as Geisha mentioned, we've got to make sure we put in place the right foundational mechanism. So the PAM, the difference in the PAM, versus the PCIA, is that it uses -- rather than using administratively set benchmarks to try and value the portfolio that we have put together, it uses actual market prices with true-up mechanisms. And importantly, going forward, when -- under the PCIA, when a customer departs, they bear their portion of the cost, but they receive no benefits from the portfolio we've currently accrued. And under the PAM, the renewable attributes of the portfolio we've accrued and the resource adequacy would actually be transferred over to the CCA for them to use in their portfolio to continue to serve customers. So using the combination of transferring benefits and using market prices, we feel the PAM is a better way to really value the current portfolio and assure those costs are evenly shared. And in doing that, we build the foundation for continued growth."

Let me start off by saying how thrilled I am to be leading this iconic company. This is a time of great change and opportunity in the energy industry, and I'm product that PG&E is helping to lead the way to a clean energy future. This morning, I'm going to spend a few minutes reviewing our progress this past quarter with a focus on the 3 key objectives that I've set for the company, namely: building on our safety and operational performance; delivering on customer expectations; and positioning PG&E for success in the changing energy industry. After my remarks, I'll turn it over to Jason to walk us through the financials. 
But before I begin, I want to acknowledge the tragic death of Zackary Randalls, a customer service representative who was killed in a random active shooter incident in Fresno on April 18. Zack had only been with the company a few weeks, but had already established himself as a valued member of our team. Our hearts go out to Zack's wife, their 2 young children as well as Zack's family, friends and coworkers in the Fresno community. This was a senseless act of violence that has deeply impacted the PG&E team, and I thank you for allowing me a moment to recognize this terrible loss. 
To start our business update this morning, I'd like to report on 2 major developments this past quarter and our continuing efforts to resolve the proceedings stemming from the San Bruno tragedy. First, on March 15, all parties in the shareholder derivative litigation reached a global settlement to resolve all claims. On April 21, the judge in the main derivative cases preliminarily approved the settlement and scheduled a hearing for final approval on July 18. Second, on March 28, PG&E and the other active parties to the CPUC's ex parte investigation jointly submitted a settlement agreement to resolve the case through a combination of financial and nonfinancial remedies. If approved, these 2 settlements will move us substantially closer to resolving the San Bruno-related legal matters. 
With those updates, let me begin by talking about our first key objective, and that is building on the safety and operational performance that we've achieved. As you know, safety is our most important responsibility and highest value. We've previously reported on the improvements we're seeing in public safety performance, such as faster emergency response times and reductions in gas dig-ins. Well, I'm happy to report that we're also seeing positive trends in employee safety. Both our OSHA recordable injury rate and preventable motor vehicle incident rate are down 20% in the first quarter of 2017 as compared to the same quarter of 2016. Even better, the number of serious motor vehicle incidents is down 65% this quarter as compared to the same period last year. These improvements are especially notable given the tough weather conditions in which our employees had to work this past quarter. And they serve, frankly, as a testament to our employees' commitment to putting safety at the forefront of their work each and every day. 
Speaking of the weather, as we shared last quarter, in 2016, we delivered the second-best reliability in the company's history despite a record-setting winter storm season. Well, Mother Nature wasn't quite finished with us, and strong winds, heavy snow and rain continued to pound our service area over the last few months. The good news is that we've been able to minimize outage time for our customers. In fact, nearly 96% of the almost 2.5 million customers who experienced sustained outages during our January and February storms were restored within 24 hours. Now our strong performance can be credited to the tireless efforts of our employees, improvements in our emergency preparedness and response capabilities, and the investments we've been making over the years to modernize and upgrade our electric system. In the first quarter alone, we avoided more than 50 million customer outage minutes as a result of our investments in advanced grid automation and self-healing technology. As we continue to install this technology throughout our electric system, our customers will enjoy even greater reliability benefits in the future. 
Of course, we can't talk about reliability without mentioning the significant outage we experienced in San Francisco on April 21. This outage was not weather-related but was caused by a fire at one of our substations. We know this outage inconvenienced many of our customers, but thankfully, no public or employee injuries are reported as a result of the incident. I'd like to highlight that we were already underway with a major $100 million upgrade to the substation, and we're also working closely with the city of San Francisco to address their questions in the wake of the outage. 
I'd like to turn now to our second key objective, which is delivering on our customers' expectations. Our goal is to be our customers' provider of choice. We know that energy customers today want more options and more control, and that's driving us to focus on enhancing our customers' experience through continuous innovation and improvement throughout our business, and we're pleased to see these efforts actually paying off. For example, we've recently received the results of our annual customer satisfaction survey for our gas transmission business, which showed the second highest rating in the 20-plus years we've conducted the survey. We also recently received EEI's 2017 award for outstanding national key accounts customer service. Votes for this award were cast in a nationwide open ballot by a pool of national commercial customers that include some of the country's largest, most sophisticated and most demanding energy consumers. We're proud of the progress we're making with customers, and we remain focused on continuing to improve the quality of our service. 
As we continue to invest in our systems to provide customers with the level of service they need and expect, we're also committed to affordability. Now earlier this year, we announced $300 million in cost efficiency measures for 2017. I'm happy to report that we're on track to achieve the savings this year, and as we've mentioned before, this effort should be viewed as a first step in an ongoing focus on maintaining affordable service for our customers. 
I'd like to turn now to our third key objective: positioning PG&E for success in the changing energy industry. To us, success goes hand in hand with enabling California's clean energy economy, a topic I'm particularly passionate about. With the state of the clean power plant in question, I've been getting inquiries about how we see the national political environment affecting our business strategies on clean energy here in California. We believe that regardless of what happens at the federal level, California will continue to lead the way in transitioning to a clean energy economy, and we are absolutely committed to remaining a key partner in the state's efforts. As we think about California's clean energy future, we know that some changes will be needed in regulations that mirror market changes that have taken place. So for example, last week, PG&E, Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric collectively filed an application at the CPUC proposing to update the mechanisms used to ensure a fair allocation of energy supply costs to those customers that choose to depart for either CCAs or direct access providers. We are proposing to replace the current mechanism, which is known as the PCIA, the power charge indifference adjustment, and which, by the way, all parties agree is in need of reform, with an updated approach that more fairly allocates costs and benefits. As California continues to engage in discussions on the utility of the future, we view this as a foundational step for the continued growth of CCAs or other choices that our customers may have in the future. 
Beyond Energy Supply, one of the most promising clean energy opportunities in California is electrification of the transportation sector. Transportation accounts for about 40% of California's GHG emissions. Governor Brown and the California Air Resource Board have both signaled their desire to see a dramatic increase in the number of 0-emission vehicles in California, so it's clear that electric vehicles will play a critical role in helping the state achieve its carbon reduction goals. 
The CPUC's approval last December, we're actively kickstarting our $130 million pilot, which, by the way, is the nation's largest utility infrastructure deployment to support charging of light-duty EVs. At the same time, we're also continuing to work with innovative partners to pilot new programs, technologies and approaches in the EV space. So for example, last December, we wrapped up Phase 1 of our smart charging pilot with BMW. Over the 18 months of the pilot, we were able to shift nearly 20-megawatt hours of charging in response to changing grid conditions. We're excited to support the next phase of this pilot, which will test the feasibility and the value of more active charge management. 
So to close, I want to reiterate my confidence in our future. We remain focused on continuing to deliver safety and operational excellence in meeting the needs of our customers, and at the same time, we are as committed as ever to working with the state to achieve its clean energy goals. We feel good about the opportunities this represents for PG&E and for our customers. 
Thank you for your time today, and with that, let me turn it over to Jason to walk us through the financials."

GAAP earnings, inclu",1099,"Thank you, Geisha, and hello, everyone. I'll begin by reviewing the first quarter results and then quickly cover the 2017 outlook. 
Slide 4 shows our results for the first quarter. Earnings from operations came in at $1.06 per share. GAAP earnings, including the items impacting comparability, are also shown here. The pretax numbers for the items impacting comparability are in the table at the bottom of the page. Pipeline-related expenses were $28 million pretax for the quarter. We incurred legal and regulatory-related expenses of $4 million pretax. Fines and penalties were $60 million pretax for the quarter. This includes the planned $47 million related to the San Bruno penalty decision and disallowances imposed for ex parte communications in Phase 2 of the gas transmission and storage rate case decision. We have now fully recognized the penalties imposed from these 2 decisions. This item also reflects a $13 million charge as a result of the settlement that we reached at the end of the first quarter in the ex parte order instituting investigation. Butte fire-related costs net of insurance were $3 million pretax and reflect legal costs associated with the fire. Finally, we booked revenue of $150 million pretax for the quarter, which reflects a recognition of the gas transmission revenues in excess of our 2017 cost of service. We have now recognized all of the undercollected revenues associated with our 2015 gas transmission and storage rate case. 
On Slide 5, you'll see our quarter-over-quarter comparison of earnings from operations of $0.82 in Q1 of last year and $1.06 in Q1 of this year. We were $0.15 favorable as a result of the timing of the 2015 gas transmission and storage rate case decision, which didn't allow us to recognize incremental revenues until the third quarter of 2016. This item is purely timing in nature and will reverse by year-end. We were $0.06 favorable as a result of tax benefits associated with share-based compensation. There was an accounting standard change last year, and we are now booking the tax impact of our annual equity compensation true-up through earnings rather than equity. Rate base earnings were $0.03 for the quarter. Miscellaneous items amounted to $0.05 favorable for the quarter, which includes tax timing differences that will reverse by year-end. In previous years, we had shown tax timing as a separate driver, but we don't expect the quarter-over-quarter changes to be as significant in 2017. A delay in the timing of our 2017 GRC decision resulted in an unfavorable $0.03 for the quarter. This is primarily driven by incremental capital costs, such as depreciation and interest, without offsetting revenues. The driver for this particular $0.03 is timing, but as a reminder, we do expect the net impact of our 2017 GRC revenues and related costs to be roughly $0.25 negative for the year due to the loss of the incremental tax repair benefits. Additionally, if the proposed GRC decision is approved without modification, we'd expect to see an increase to rate base earnings of approximately $0.08 on an annualized basis. Finally, we are $0.02 negative for the increase in outstanding shares. 
Transitioning now to Slide 6. We are reaffirming our 2017 earnings from operations guidance of $3.55 to $3.75 per share. Our underlying assumptions are on Page 7 and are consistent with what we shared last quarter. It remains our objective to earn the CPUC authorized return on equity across the enterprise as a whole. 
Moving to Slide 8. We have several updates to our 2017 items impacting comparability. First, with the respect to our rights-of-way program, we had previously shared that the overall cost would not exceed $500 million. While the current year range for pipeline-related expenses is unchanged from last quarter, we're pleased that the overall cost of our rights-of-way program is now expected to range from $425 million to $475 million. We do, however, expect a small portion of the work will now fall into 2018 due to permitting challenges. 
Second, as a result of the settlements we've reached in the ex parte investigation and the shareholder derivative lawsuits in the first quarter, we expect our legal and regulatory costs to come in around $10 million for the year. We had previously expected these costs to range from $10 million to $40 million. 
Third, fines and penalties now reflect the $13 million in remedies settled as part of the ex parte investigation. The CPUC has not yet ruled on a settlement, and the ultimate decision may modify this amount. We had previously expected fines and penalties to be roughly $45 million. 
Finally, we've added a new item that reflects a settlement we reached in the shareholder derivative lawsuits. If the settlement is approved without modification, the impact would result in a gain of approximately $65 million net of certain legal expenses we agreed to pay on the plaintiff's behalf. 
We are reaffirming our 2017 equity needs on Slide 9 with a range of $400 million to $600 million. In 2018 and 2019, we still expect our equity needs to be met largely through our internal programs, which historically have been approximately $350 million annually. 
On Slides 10 and 11, we're reaffirming our CapEx and rate base guidance through 2019. I wanted to highlight one new item with potential upside to our capital plan. As new gas storage regulations are adopted, we'll need to invest capital in our system to comply with the new regulations. We should know more about the new regulations later this year. 
Finally, we recently had a development in our cost of capital case. Last week, the proposed decision approving the all-party settlement was withdrawn from the CPUC's April 27 agenda. This was disappointing, particularly given the constructive efforts that went into the settlement in the proposed decision. We'll remain confident that the all-party settlement, which was developed with investor-owned utilities and consumer advocates, is in the best interest of our customers, and we look forward to working with the CPUC and settling parties to reach a timely resolution of this case. While we're not providing longer-term EPS guidance, it remains our objective to earn our CPUC authorized return on equity across the enterprise in 2018 and 2019. 
I'll close by saying we're off to a strong start in 2017. We continue to have solid organic growth with expected capital spend totaling approximately $18 billion over the next 3 years. We're continuing to target above-average dividend per share growth with a 60% dividend payout ratio by 2019. Combined, these factors make for an attractive total return. 
So with that, let's open up the line for questions."

I think it's important to remember, first, when CCAs really formed, and as the legislature has continued to reinforce, the legislative intent here is that when a customer",393,"This is Steve Malnight from our strategy and policy team, so let me field that one. I think it's important to remember, first, when CCAs really formed, and as the legislature has continued to reinforce, the legislative intent here is that when a customer or a community chooses to go CCA, the customers who remain PG&E-bundled customers should be indifferent to that choice. In other words, any costs that were borne -- customers who eventually choose to go CCA, they should take those -- their share of those costs with them so that customers who remain behind are indifferent. The mechanism that the commission has put in place to accomplish that, as Geisha said, was the PCIA. And that mechanism, over time as CCAs have grown, has become more distorted. It's not as effective at fully passing through those costs. So what we see today is that about 65% of the costs actually are passed through to customers who go CCA, and the rest remain with our bundled customers. Now that was not a significant issue when CCAs were really small and served a small portion of the load. But we're currently forecasting that by the end of this year, they'll be at 13%, and growing to 38% by 2020. So in order to really build a sustainable future for those CCAs and for other choices, as Geisha mentioned, we've got to make sure we put in place the right foundational mechanism. So the PAM, the difference in the PAM, versus the PCIA, is that it uses -- rather than using administratively set benchmarks to try and value the portfolio that we have put together, it uses actual market prices with true-up mechanisms. And importantly, going forward, when -- under the PCIA, when a customer departs, they bear their portion of the cost, but they receive no benefits from the portfolio we've currently accrued. And under the PAM, the renewable attributes of the portfolio we've accrued and the resource adequacy would actually be transferred over to the CCA for them to use in their portfolio to continue to serve customers. So using the combination of transferring benefits and using market prices, we feel the PAM is a better way to really value the current portfolio and assure those costs are evenly shared. And in doing that, we build the foundation for continued growth."

I'm pleased to report that we had a very strong quarter, one that was marked by continued impressive operational performance, encouraging progress on the regulatory front and solid financial results. I'll start this morning with an update on some important actions we've taken this past quarter to continue strengthening our safety culture and operations. I'll then highlight some key investments we're making to enable us to meet our customers involved expectations while also keeping those affordable. And finally, I'll cover some other recent steps we've taken to help advance California's Clean Energy Economy and position PG&E for continued success. After that, I'll turn things over to our Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, David Thompson, who will walk us through the financials as Jason Wells unfortunately has laryngitis, although he will be available for some questions. 
Before we dive in, I'd like to review the final decision we recently received in the cost of capital case. The decision sets are allowed return on equity at 10.25% through the end of 2019, which is critical, given the nearly $6 billion in annual investments we will be making in our gas and electric system over that same period. Just as importantly, our customers will benefit through lower rates, a savings of roughly $100 million annually. While I recognize it was a challenging process, in the end, the cost of capital decision is yet another example of how coalitions can achieve effective solution. I'm gratified to add this to the list, alongside the agreement we announced last summer in the 2017 GRC all party settlement. 
Let's move now to our review of our safety and operational progress for the quarter. As you may recall, in 2014, we were one of the first utilities in the world to be certified under both the ISO 55001 and PAS 55 safety standards. Every 3 years, we have to go through a rigorous recertification process. The critical requirements of recertification is to demonstrate continuous improvement. While I'm happy to report that Lloyd's Register, the internationally recognized third-party auditor recently recertified us in both ISO 55001 and PAS 55. This is independent third-party confirmation of our continually improving safety culture and industry-leading asset management program. And it's something I'm extremely proud of. I want to take this opportunity to congratulate and thank our teams on a truly great accomplishment, one that reflects our laserlike focus on safety, not just in the gas operations but across the company. 
Staying on the seam of continuous improvement, I'd like to talk about the report that was issued in May
[Audio Gap]
numerous improvements we've made as a company through our safety culture. In fact, the first conclusion of the report affirms that, ""PG&E employees at all levels are committed to safety."" That speaks volume about the culture we're building and I couldn't agree more. Safety is at the heart of everything we do here PG&E. 
Looking at the 68 specific recommendations in the report, most are fully consistent with our own safety plans. While there are a few recommendations in the report that we believe warrant further consideration by the CPUC in the upcoming proceeding, we agree with the vast majority of the recommendations and plan to implement them by the middle of next year. 
Moving on to our operational performance. We had a number of highlights this past quarter and I'd like to focus on 1 in particular. This past June, most of California was hit by a historic heat wave. Millions of customers experience temperatures in the triple digits for nearly a week. Demand on our system at levels hit levels that we haven't seen in over a decade, reaching over 20,000 megawatts on June 22, just shy of our all-time system peak in 2006. The good news is that less than 2% of our larger customers experienced a sustained loss of power during the peak outage day. Our strong ability performance was even more noteworthy, given that one of our Diablo Canyon units was in the planned refueling outage during the same period. And in addition, at certain times during the heatwave, more than half of PG&E's energy supply was met with RPS eligible resources. 
This experience is a testament to the long-term investments we've made to modernize our system and it doesn't straight what we've been saying for quite some time and that is, we can deliver the clean energy that our customers want and still provide great safety and reliability. 
With our strong operational performance in mind, I would like to touch upon a couple of recent regulatory developments that helps at the foundation for our future investments and will enable us to continue to deliver on our customer's evolving needs and expectations. The first is the final decision on our 2017 General Rate Case, which approved the all-party settlement between PG&E and our intervenors, including consumer advocates, churn and ORA. While this gives us a clear line of sight into our distribution and generation revenues for the next 3 years, it also enables our plans for making the infrastructure investments necessary to meet our customer's energy needs. For example, the GRC authorizes CapEx increases related to electric reliability improvement, network cable replacement and capacity increases to support distributed generation resources. These are the same types of investments that enable us to provide safe and reliable service during the recent heat wave. 
We're pleased with outcome of the GRC decision which approves 98% of our rate base request and provides us with the resources needed to support continued investment in the grid. At the same time, we went into those rate case very mindful of the need to keep our customer builds affordable and outcome represents a fairly modest 1% increase in our authorized revenues for 2017. The second regulatory development I'd like to mention this morning is our electric transmission case, TO 19, the application which we filed yesterday at FERC. We're seeking a $74 million increase in revenues starting in 2018 for such key capital investments as system reliability work and substation modernization. It is through these types of investments and these continued investments in our grid that we can help ensure our system is stable and that we can continue providing the high-quality service that our customers have come to expect. 
The last area I'll cover this morning is the work we're doing to position PG&E for success in the future energy markets. In addition to the investments we're making to upgrade and modernize our grid, we are also leveraging our proximity to Silicon Valley to pilot new technologies and systems, in effect, beta testing the grid of the future. The rapid growth of both large-scale renewables and distributed energy resources, or DERs, means that we as a great plan or an operator, we have to find ways of managing third party assets that we don't own or don't control. Assets such as private rooftop solar or electric vehicles. We have to work on this as a system rather than look at these individual items in isolation. In one of our many pilot projects we're working with General Electric, Tesla Energy and Green Charge Networks to test a distributed energy resources management system on 3 interconnected theaters this summer. The pilot includes private, residential rooftop solar with smart inverters, residential battery storage, commercial industrial battery storage and a utility scale battery storage facility that PG&E owns and 1 which has the capability to sell into the wholesale market. What's unique about this pilot is that it gets right to the core of our with modernization work, namely having visibility into all the resources that our customers are connecting to the grid and understanding how they respond when we, as a grid operator, needs to manage them for the overall safety and reliability of the electric system. 
Now in order to succeed in the future energy market, we not only need to invest in their way technologies and systems, we also need to have the right policies in place to help us achieve the state's clean energy goals. You may recall that during our Q1 earnings call, I mentioned the portfolio allocation mechanism or PAM filing that PG&E and the other California investor-owned utilities jointly submitted to the CPUC. In the filings, we proposed to replace the power charge indifference adjustment with an updated approach that more fairly allocates costs and benefits between customers who choose DCAs or direct access and those who stay with their existing energy provider. This is a critical issue for all parties recognized the need for reform. On June 29, the CPUC voted out a new order instituting rulemaking to review, revise and consider alternatives to the power charge indifference adjustment. While the CPUC at the same time dismissed the PAM application, we view the new OIR as a clear recognition of the need for reform to ensure that costs are fairly allocated to all customers in compliance with state law. The CPUC has recognized the issues with the current mechanism and we will have the opportunity to advocate with the other IOUs for the tax reform that were included in the PAM application. 
In closing, I want to reiterate that this has been a strong quarter. We continue to make steady progress in our safety culture and we provided impressive reliability for our customers despite a record-setting heat wave. We also achieved the number of positive regulatory outcomes, including the General Rate Case and the cost of capital decision, which provide a solid foundation for the investments we will be making our system. With that, let me thank you for joining us and let me turn things over to David to walk us through the financials."

I'll start by covering our second quarter results and then provide a couple of updates to our guidance for 2017. Slide 4 shows our results for the second quarter. Earnings from operations came in at $0.86.",936,"Thank you, Geisha, and good morning, everyone. I'll start by covering our second quarter results and then provide a couple of updates to our guidance for 2017. 
Slide 4 shows our results for the second quarter. Earnings from operations came in at $0.86. GAAP earnings, including items impacting comparability are also shown here. Pipeline-related expenses were $29 million pretax for the quarter. Our legal and regulatory-related expenses came in at $3 million pretax. For the Butte fire, we recorded a charge of covers of $46 million pretax this quarter, including the receipt of $32 million from one of our contractor's insurers. This was partially offset by legal cost of $17 million for a net favorable impact of $29 million pretax for the quarter. 
Finally, we have a new item's quarterly of the charges associated with the plant closure of Diablo Canyon. During the quarter, we reached a settlement with parties in our joint proposal to retire Diablo Canyon along with several other intervenors which provides clarity on the recovery of previously incurred license renewal costs and cost incurs for projects that we canceled as a result of retirement. As part of that settlement agreement, we have recorded a $47 million pretax charge for the unrecoverable portion of these costs in the second quarter. This settlement agreement was filed with the CPUC in May and we expect the final decision later this year. 
Moving on, Slide 5 shows the quarter-over-quarter comparison for earnings from operations of $0.66 in Q2 last year and $0.86 in Q2 of this year. Consistent with last quarter, we were $0.15 favorable due to the timing of 2015 GT&S rate case decision, which was received in August of last year. This year-to-date favorable variance of roughly $0.30 will fully reverse in the fourth quarter. Rate base earnings were $0.07 for the quarter. Since we did not receive the 2017 GRC decision until May of this year, our second quarter results reflect 2 quarters of incremental GRC rate base earnings. We expect to see about $0.05 in rate base earnings for each of the next few quarters for a total of $0.20 for the full year. A number of small miscellaneous items totaled $0.04 positive for the quarter, most of which is timing related and is expected to reverse by year end. There were 2 additional items from the 2017 GRC decision that contributed to a negative $0.04. As we mentioned last year, our GRC revenues were adjusted in 2017, resulting in a loss of incremental tax repair benefits of roughly $0.25 annually, including $0.07 this quarter. This was partially offset by $0.03 cents favorable for incremental revenues to recover depreciation and interest costs that we incurred in the first quarter. 
Lastly, we had $0.02 negative related to the issuance of shares. Transitioning now to Slide 6. Today, we are reaffirming our guidance for earnings from operations of $3.55 to $3.75 per share. On Slide 7, we've outlined our underlying assumptions for that guidance. I'll reiterate that it remains our objective to earn the CPUC authorized return on equity across enterprise in 2017. One adjustment of our plane that I'll note here is we are reducing our 2017 CapEx range from approximately $6 billion to roughly $5.9 billion, which primarily reflects the shift in some of our gas transmission and distribution work into 2018. At the same time, we have increased the CapEx forecast for 2018 to $6.1 billion on Slide 10 to reflect this adjustment. 
Turning now to Slide 8. There are a few changes in our items impacting comparability in 2017. Butte Fire related insurance recovery is net of legal costs reflect recorded proceeds and costs through the second quarter. The shareholder derivative settlement was approved by the Court on July 18th and we expect to record a net benefit of $65 million pretax in the third quarter. 
Lastly, we've included the $47 million from the Diablo Canyon-related charges that I mentioned earlier. Moving on to Slide 9. I'm pleased to share the high-end of our equity ranges decreased from $600 million to $500 million. With 2 quarters under our belt, we have better line of sight into our financing plans for the year, coupled with the shift in some capital to 2018. 
On Slides 10 and 11, we've updated our CapEx and rate base reflect the changes I shared earlier. Additionally, as Geisha mentioned, we filed our TO 19 case with FERC yesterday, which includes a roughly $200 million increase to CapEx over our TO17 settlement. This is reflected in the high end of our CapEx and rate base ranges. 
Finally, let's move on Slide 12. At the end of May, we announced that we are raising our quarterly dividend of $0.04 to $0.53 per share. On an annualized basis, this increases our dividend by 8% from $1.96 per share to $2.12 per share. This is another step in our commitment to target a 60% dividend payout ratio by 2019. 
I'll close by echoing Geisha's comments about how pleased we are with the results of this quarter. With favorable regulatory decisions and 2 of our most important cases, the General Rate Case and cost of capital. Rate reliability despite a record heatwave and we're continuing to provide shareholder value with another increase to our dividend. We continue to be confident in our ability to deliver on our plans as we evolve with the changing energy landscape. And while we are providing guidance beyond 2017, our objective is to earn the recently authorized return on equity across the enterprise for 2018 and 2019. With that, let's open up the line for questions."

Let me just give a quick update on that. As we mentioned in the original proceedings, the power cost indifference adjustment of PCIA is really designed to ensure the state law is fulfilled to maintaining difference as some customers choose to leave bundled service and go to either CCAs or direct access. As we have pointed out and as I think the joint utilities pointed out, the current mechanism as it stands today does not fully allocate those costs. So for us, about 35% of those costs really remain with bundled customers which needs to be corrected as CCAs continue to become a bigger and bigger part of the load. With the PCIA OIR that the commission recently launched, we view that as a real positive. The commission's clearly recognize the need for reform the proceeding and has laid out some guiding principles that highlights the need to really maintain what we call bundled customer indifference, which ensures that the state loss is followed. So the commission has not yet issued the schedule, but in many different proceedings in areas they have mentioned, the desire to handle this on an expedited basis and we'll see that quickly. So we're very hopeful that, that comes to pass. And we'll see and follow this proceeding as it goes. I would expect it will hopefully be resolved sometime in 2018."

          Thanks, Ann. Good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report that we had a very strong quarter, one that was marked by continued impressive operational performance, encouraging progress on the regulatory front and solid financial results. I'll start this morning with an update on some important actions we've taken this past quarter to continue strengthening our safety culture and operations. I'll then highlight some key investments we're making to enable us to meet our customers' evolving expectations while also keeping bills affordable. And finally, I'll cover some other recent steps we've taken to help advance California's Clean Energy Economy and position PG&E for continued success. After that, I'll turn things over to our Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, David Thomason, who will walk us through the financials as Jason Wells unfortunately has laryngitis, although he will be available for some questions. 
Before we dive in, I'd like to review the final decision we recently received in the cost of capital case. The decision sets our allowed return on equity at 10.25% through the end of 2019, which is critical, given the nearly $6 billion in annual investments we'll be making in our gas and electric systems over that same period. Just as importantly, our customers will benefit through lower rates, a savings of roughly $100 million annually. While I recognize it was a challenging process, in the end, the cost of capital decision is yet another example of how coalitions can achieve effective solutions. I'm gratified to add this to the list, alongside the Diablo agreement we announced last summer in the 2017 GRC all party settlement. 
Let's move now to a review of our safety and operational progress for the quarter. As you may recall, in 2014, we were one of the first utilities in the world to be certified under both the ISO-55001 and PAS-55 safety standards. Every 3 years, we have to go through a rigorous recertification process. The critical requirement for recertification is to demonstrate continuous improvement. Well, I'm happy to report that Lloyd's Register, the internationally recognized third-party auditor recently recertified us in both ISO-55001 and PAS-55. This is independent third-party confirmation of our continually improving safety culture and industry-leading asset management program, and it's something I'm extremely proud of. I want to take this opportunity to congratulate and thank our teams on a truly great accomplishment, one that reflects our laser-like focus on safety, not just in the gas operations, but across the company. 
Staying on the theme of continuous improvement, I'd like to talk about the report that was issued in May
[Audio Gap]
numerous improvements we've made as a company to our safety culture. In fact, the first conclusion of the report affirms that, ""PG&E employees at all levels are committed to safety."" That speaks volumes about the culture we're building and I couldn't agree more. Safety is at the heart of everything we do here at PG&E. 
Looking at the 68 specific recommendations in the report, most are fully consistent with our own safety plans. While there are a few recommendations in the report that we believe warrant further consideration by the CPUC in the upcoming proceedings, we agree with the vast majority of the recommendations and plan to implement them by the middle of next year. 
Moving on to our operational performance. We had a number of highlights this past quarter and I'd like to focus on 1 in particular. This past June, most of California was hit by a historic heat wave. Millions of customers experienced temperatures in the triple digits for nearly a week. Demand on our system hit levels that we haven't seen in over a decade, reaching over 20,000 megawatts on June 22, just shy of our all-time system peak in 2006. The good news is that less than 2% of our electric customers experienced a sustained loss of power during the peak outage day. Our strong reliability performance was even more noteworthy, given that one of our Diablo Canyon units was in a planned refueling outage during the same period. And in addition, at certain times during the heatwave, more than half of PG&E's energy supply was met with RPS eligible resources. 
This experience is a testament to the long-term investments we've made to modernize our system and it demonstrates what we've been saying for quite some time, and that is, we can deliver the clean energy that our customers want and still provide great safety and reliability. 
With our strong operational performance in mind, I'd like to touch upon a couple of recent regulatory developments that help set the foundation for our future investments and will enable us to continue to deliver on our customers' evolving needs and expectations. The first is the final decision on our 2017 General Rate Case, which approved the all-party settlement between PG&E and our intervenors, including consumer advocates TURN and ORA. While this gives us a clear line of sight into our distribution and generation revenues for the next 3 years, it also enables our plans for making the infrastructure investments necessary to meet our customers' energy needs. For example, the GRC authorizes CapEx increases related to electric reliability improvement, network cable replacement and capacity increases to support distributed generation resources. These are the same types of investments that enabled us to provide safe and reliable service during the recent heat wave. 
We're pleased with outcome of the GRC decision which approves 98% of our rate base request and provides us with the resources needed to support continued investment in the grid. At the same time, we went into this rate case very mindful of the need to keep our customer bills affordable, and the outcome represents a fairly modest 1% increase in our authorized revenues for 2017. The second regulatory development I'd like to mention this morning is our electric transmission case, TO19, the application which filed yesterday at FERC. We're seeking a $74 million increase in revenues starting in 2018 for such key capital investments as system reliability work and substation modernization. It is through these types of investments and these continued investments in our grid that we can help ensure our system is stable and that we can continue providing the high-quality service that our customers have come to expect. 
The last area I'll cover this morning is the work we're doing to position PG&E for success in the future energy markets. In addition to the investments we're making to upgrade and modernize our grid, we are also leveraging our proximity to Silicon Valley to pilot new technologies and systems, in effect, beta testing the grid of the future. The rapid growth of both large-scale renewables and distributed energy resources, or DERs, means that we, as a grid planner and operator, we have to find ways of managing third party assets that we don't own or don't control. Assets such as private rooftop solar or electric vehicles. We have to work on this as a system rather than look at these individual items in isolation. In one of our many pilot projects we're working with General Electric, Tesla Energy and Green Charge Networks to test a distributed energy resources management system on 3 interconnected feeders this summer. The pilot includes private residential rooftop solar with smart inverters, residential battery storage, commercial industrial battery storage and a utility scale battery storage facility that PG&E owns, and 1 which has the capability to sell into the wholesale market. What's unique about this pilot is that it gets right to the core of our with modernization work, namely having visibility into all the resources that our customers are connecting to the grid and understanding how they respond when we, as a grid operator, needs to manage them for the overall safety and reliability of the electric system. 
Now in order to succeed in the future energy market, we not only need to invest in the right technologies and systems, we also need to have the right policies in place to help us achieve the state's clean energy goals. You may recall that during our Q1 earnings call, I mentioned the portfolio allocation mechanism or PAM filing that PG&E and the other California investor-owned utilities jointly submitted to the CPUC. In the filing, we proposed to replace the power charge indifference adjustment with an updated approach that more fairly allocates costs and benefits between customers who choose CCAs or direct access and those who stay with their existing energy provider. This is a critical issue where all parties recognize the need for reform. On June 29, the CPUC voted out a new order instituting rulemaking to review, revise and consider alternatives to the power charge indifference adjustment. While the CPUC at the same time dismissed the PAM application, we view the new OIR as a clear recognition of the need for reform to ensure that costs are fairly allocated to all customers in compliance with the state law. The CPUC has recognized the issues with the current mechanism and we will have the opportunity to advocate with the other IOUs for the types of reform that were included in the PAM application. 
In closing, I want to reiterate that this has been a strong quarter. We continue to make steady progress in our safety culture and we provided impressive reliability for our customers despite a record-setting heat wave. We also achieved a number of positive regulatory outcomes, including the General Rate Case and the cost of capital decision, which provide a solid foundation for the investments we will be making our system. With that, let me thank you for joining us and let me turn things over to David to walk us through the financials."

I'll start by covering our second quarter results and then provide a couple of updates to our guidance for 2017. Slide 4 shows our results for the second quarter. Earnings from operations came in at $0.86.",938,"Thank you, Geisha, and good morning, everyone. I'll start by covering our second quarter results and then provide a couple of updates to our guidance for 2017. 
Slide 4 shows our results for the second quarter. Earnings from operations came in at $0.86. GAAP earnings, including items impacting comparability, are also shown here. Pipeline-related expenses were $29 million pretax for the quarter. Our legal and regulatory related expenses came in at $3 million pretax. For the Butte fire, we recorded insurance recoveries of $46 million pretax this quarter, including the receipt of $32 million from one of our contractor's insurers. This was partially offset by legal costs of $17 million for a net favorable impact of $29 million pretax for the quarter. 
Finally, we have a new item this quarter related to charges associated with the planned closure of Diablo Canyon. During the quarter, we reached a settlement with parties in our joint proposal to retire Diablo Canyon, along with several other intervenors which provides clarity on the recovery of previously incurred license renewal costs and costs incurred for projects that will be canceled as a result of the retirement. As part of that settlement agreement, we have recorded a $47 million pretax charge for the unrecoverable portion of these costs in the second quarter. This settlement agreement was filed with the CPUC in May and we expect the final decision later this year. 
Moving on, Slide 5 shows the quarter-over-quarter comparison for earnings from operations of $0.66 in Q2 last year and $0.86 in Q2 of this year. Consistent with last quarter, we were $0.15 favorable due to the timing of 2015 GT&S rate case decision, which was received in August of last year. This year-to-date favorable variance of roughly $0.30 will fully reverse in the fourth quarter. Rate base earnings were $0.07 for the quarter. Since we did not receive the 2017 GRC decision until May of this year, our second quarter results reflect 2 quarters of incremental GRC rate base earnings. We expect to see about $0.05 in rate base earnings for each of the next few quarters for a total of $0.20 for the full year. A number of small miscellaneous items totaled $0.04 positive for the quarter, most of which is timing related and is expected to reverse by year end. There were 2 additional items from the 2017 GRC decision that contributed to a negative $0.04. As we mentioned last year, our GRC revenues were adjusted in 2017, resulting in a loss of incremental tax repair benefits of roughly $0.25 annually, including $0.07 this quarter. This was partially offset by $0.03 favorable for incremental revenues to recover depreciation and interest costs that we incurred in the first quarter. 
Lastly, we had $0.02 negative related to the issuance of shares. Transitioning now to Slide 6. Today, we are reaffirming our guidance for earnings from operations of $3.55 to $3.75 per share. On Slide 7, we've outlined our underlying assumptions for that guidance. I'll reiterate that it remains our objective to earn the CPUC authorized return on equity across enterprise in 2017. One adjustment of our plan that I'll note here is we are reducing our 2017 CapEx range from approximately $6 billion to roughly $5.9 billion, which primarily reflects the shift in some of our gas transmission and distribution work into 2018. At the same time, we have increased the CapEx forecast for 2018 to $6.1 billion on Slide 10 to reflect this adjustment. 
Turning now to Slide 8. There are a few changes in our items impacting comparability in 2017. Butte fire-related insurance recoveries net of legal costs reflect recorded proceeds and costs through the second quarter. The shareholder derivative settlement was approved by the court on July 18 and we expect to record a net benefit of $65 million pretax in the third quarter. 
Lastly, we've included the $47 million for the Diablo Canyon-related charges that I mentioned earlier. Moving now to Slide 9. I'm pleased to share that the high end of our equity range has decreased from $600 million to $500 million. With 2 quarters under our belt, we have better line of sight into our financing plans for the year, coupled with the shift in some capital to 2018. 
On Slides 10 and 11, we've updated our CapEx and rate base to reflect the changes I shared earlier. Additionally, as Geisha mentioned, we filed our TO19 case with FERC yesterday, which includes a roughly $200 million increase to CapEx over our TO17 settlement. This is reflected in the high end of our CapEx and rate base ranges. 
Finally, let's move onto Slide 12. At the end of May, we announced that we were raising our quarterly dividend of $0.04 to $0.53 per share. On an annual basis, this increases our dividend by 8% from $1.96 per share to $2.12 per share. This is another step in our commitment to target a 60% dividend payout ratio by 2019. 
I'll close by echoing Geisha's comments about how pleased we are with the results of this quarter. With favorable regulatory decisions in 2 of our most important cases, the General Rate Case and cost of capital, rate reliability despite a record heatwave and we're continuing to provide shareholder value with another increase to our dividend. We continue to be confident in our ability to deliver on our plans as we evolve with a changing energy landscape. And while we are providing guidance beyond 2017, our objective is to earn the recently authorized return on equity across the enterprise for 2018 and 2019. With that, let's open up the line for questions."

          So Jonathan, this is Steve Malnight. In terms of where the proceedings sit, so yes, the record in the proceeding is now closed and we're awaiting the proposed decision from the judge. It has evolved and changed pretty substantially since it was originally filed. So as you noted, we filed a settlement with the joint parties to withdraw some of the procurement that we have proposed to do in this proceeding and instead defer that to the commission's integrated resource plan proceeding. So we still have the energy efficiency replacement that is in this case but we've deferred the remainder to the IRP. In the case, we still have the cost for employee retention programs as well as the retraining programs. We have the community mitigation payments that we proposed. And as David mentioned in the call, we recently filed an additional settlement that resolved some of the uncertainty around -- that would resolve some of the uncertainty around both the license cost recovery as well as canceled projects. So at this point, we're awaiting a proposed decision from the judge on all of those items."

          Yes, so this is Steve Malnight again. Let me just give a quick update on that. As we mentioned in the original proceeding, the power cost indifference adjustment, the PCIA, is really designed to ensure that the state law is fulfilled to maintain indifference as some customers choose to leave bundled service and go to either CCAs or direct access. As we have pointed out and as I think the joint utilities pointed out, the current mechanism as it stands today does not fully allocate those costs. So for us, about 35% of those costs really remain with bundled customers, which needs to be corrected as CCAs continue to become a bigger and bigger part of load. With the PCIA OIR that the commission recently launched, we view that as a real positive. The commission's clearly recognized the need for reform in that proceeding, and has laid out some guiding principles that highlight the need to really maintain what we call bundled customer indifference, which ensures that the state law is followed. So the commission has not yet issued a schedule, but in many different proceedings and areas, they have mentioned the desire to handle this on an expedited basis and move through that quickly. So we're very hopeful that, that comes to pass. And we'll see and follow this proceeding as it goes. I would expect it will hopefully be resolved sometime in 2018."

          Travis, this is Steve Malnight again. So thanks for the question.  I should say another important part of the existing proposal that I failed to mentioned before, actually, is the mechanism to ensure that the rate base for Diablo Canyon is appropriately depreciated through the rest of its useful life. So under our proposal, we will put in place the mechanisms to ensure that the depreciation is fully recovered in that plant by the time it shuts down. So that's part of the proposal we have now. On the decommissioning, as you know, that's going to be a very long-term endeavor at Diablo Canyon as we go through that. We have regular proceedings to look at the cost of decommissioning. We recently had the decision in the current case that did not fully support our estimated cost. But we will have the opportunity in 2018 to come back and refile that. And as a part of our plan for decommissioning, we're now going to be conducting a site-specific study, which will look in detail at the estimated cost. So

I'm pleased to report that we had a very strong quarter, one that was marked by continued impressive operational performance, encouraging progress on the regulatory front and solid financial results. I'll start this morning with an update on some important actions we've taken this past quarter to continue strengthening our safety culture and operations. I'll then highlight some key investments we're making to enable us to meet our customers' evolving expectations while also keeping bills affordable. And finally, I'll cover some other recent steps we've taken to help advance California's clean energy economy and position PG&E for continued success. After that, I'll turn things over to our Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, David Thomason, to walk us through the financials, as Jason Wells, unfortunately, has laryngitis, although he will be available for some questions. 
Before we dive in, I'd like to review the final decision we recently received in the cost of capital case. The decision sets our allowed return on equity at 10.25% through the end of 2019, which is critical given the nearly $6 billion in annual investments we'll be making in our gas and electric systems over that same period. Just as importantly, our customers will benefit through lower rates, a savings of roughly $100 million annually. While I recognize it was a challenging process, in the end the cost of capital decision is yet another example of how coalitions can achieve effective solutions. I'm gratified to add this to the list, alongside the Diablo agreement we announced last summer and the 2017 GRC all-party settlement. 
Let's move now to a review of our safety and operational progress for the quarter. As you may recall, in 2014 we were one of the first utilities in the world to be certified under both the ISO-55001 and PAS-55 safety standards. Every 3 years, we have to go through a rigorous recertification process. The critical requirement for recertification is to demonstrate continuous improvement. Well, I'm happy to report that Lloyd's Register, the internationally recognized third-party auditor, recently recertified us in both ISO-55001 and PAS-55. This is independent third-party confirmation of our continually improving safety culture and industry-leading asset management program, and it's something I'm extremely proud of. I want to take this opportunity to congratulate and thank our teams on a truly great accomplishment, one that reflects our laser-like focus on safety, not just in the gas operations but across the company. 
Staying on the theme of continuous improvement, I'd like to talk about the report that was issued in May
[Audio Gap]
numerous improvements we've made as a company to our safety culture. In fact, the first conclusion of the report affirms that, ""PG&E employees at all levels are committed to safety."" That speaks volumes about the culture we're building, and I couldn't agree more. Safety is at the heart of everything we do here at PG&E. 
Looking at the 68 specific recommendations in the report, most are fully consistent with our own safety plans. While there are a few recommendations in the report that we believe warrant further consideration by the CPUC in the upcoming proceedings, we agree with the vast majority of the recommendations and plan to implement them by the middle of next year. 
Moving on to our operational performance. We had a number of highlights this past quarter, and I'd like to focus on one in particular. This past June, most of California was hit by a historic heat wave. Millions of customers experienced temperatures in the triple digits for nearly a week. Demand on our system hit levels that we haven't seen in over a decade, reaching over 20,000 megawatts on June 22, just shy of our all-time system peak in 2006. The good news is that less than 2% of our electric customers experienced a sustained loss of power during the peak outage day. Our strong reliability performance was even more noteworthy, given that one of our Diablo Canyon units was in a planned refueling outage during the same period. And in addition, at certain times during the heatwave, more than half of PG&E's energy supply was met with RPS-eligible resources. 
This experience is a testament to the long-term investments we've made to modernize our system, and it demonstrates what we've been saying for quite some time, and that is, we can deliver the clean energy that our customers want and still provide great safety and reliability. 
With our strong operational performance in mind, I'd like to touch upon a couple of recent regulatory developments that help set the foundation for our future investments and will enable us to continue to deliver on our customers' evolving needs and expectations. The first is the final decision on our 2017 General Rate Case, which approved the all-party settlement between PG&E and our intervenors, including consumer advocates TURN and ORA. While this gives us a clear line of sight into our distribution and generation revenues for the next 3 years, it also enables our plans for making the infrastructure investments necessary to meet our customers' energy needs. For example, the GRC authorizes CapEx increases related to electric reliability improvement, network cable replacement and capacity increases to support distributed generation resources. These are the same types of investments that enabled us to provide safe and reliable service during the recent heat wave. 
We're pleased with the outcome of the GRC decision, which approves 98% of our rate base request and provides us with the resources needed to support continued investment in the grid. At the same time, we went into this rate case very mindful of the need to keep our customer bills affordable, and the outcome represents a fairly modest 1% increase in our authorized revenues for 2017. The second regulatory development I'd like to mention this morning is our electric transmission case, TO19, the application which we filed yesterday at FERC. We're seeking a $74 million increase in revenues starting in 2018 for such key capital investments as system reliability work and substation modernization. It is through these types of investments and these continued investments in our grid that we can help ensure our system is stable and that we can continue providing the high-quality service that our customers have come to expect. 
The last area I'll cover this morning is the work we're doing to position PG&E for success in the future energy markets. In addition to the investments we're making to upgrade and modernize our grid, we are also leveraging our proximity to Silicon Valley to pilot new technologies and systems, in effect beta testing the grid of the future. The rapid growth of both large-scale renewables and distributed energy resources, or DERs, means that we as a grid planner and operator we have to find ways of managing third-party assets that we don't own or don't control, assets such as private rooftop solar or electric vehicles. We have to work on this as a system rather than look at these individual items in isolation. In one of our many pilot projects, we're working with General Electric, Tesla Energy and Green Charge Networks to test a distributed energy resources management system on 3 interconnected feeders this summer. The pilot includes private residential rooftop solar with smart inverters, residential battery storage, commercial industrial battery storage and a utility-scale battery storage facility that PG&E owns and 1 which has the capability to sell into the wholesale market. What's unique about this pilot is that it gets right to the core of our grid modernization work, namely having visibility into all the resources that our customers are connecting to the grid and understanding how they respond when we as a grid operator needs to manage them for the overall safety and reliability of the electric system. 
Now in order to succeed in the future energy market, we not only need to invest in the right technologies and systems, we also need to have the right policies in place to help us achieve the state's clean energy goals. You may recall that during our Q1 earnings call I mentioned the portfolio allocation mechanism or PAM filing that PG&E and the other California investor-owned utilities jointly submitted to the CPUC. In the filing, we proposed to replace the power charge indifference adjustment with an updated approach that more fairly allocates costs and benefits between customers who choose CCAs or direct access and those who stay with their existing energy provider. This is a critical issue where all parties recognize the need for reform. On June 29, the CPUC voted out a new order instituting rulemaking to review, revise and consider alternatives to the power charge indifference adjustment. While the CPUC at the same time dismissed the PAM application, we view the new OIR as a clear recognition of the need for reform to ensure that costs are fairly allocated to all customers in compliance with the state law. The CPUC has recognized the issues with the current mechanism, and we will have the opportunity to advocate with the other IOUs for the types of reform that were included in the PAM application. 
In closing, I want to reiterate that this has been a strong quarter. We continue to make steady progress in our safety culture, and we provided impressive reliability for our customers despite a record-setting heat wave. We also achieved a number of positive regulatory outcomes, including the General Rate Case and the cost of capital decision, which provide a solid foundation for the investments we will be making our system. With that, let me thank you for joining us, and let me turn things over to David to walk us through the financials."
139813,528851004,1258027,"PG&E Corporation, Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2017",2017-07-27,"Earnings Calls","PG&E Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Geisha. And good morning, everyone. I'll start by covering our second quarter results and then provide a couple of updates to our guidance for 2017. Slide 4 shows our results for the second quarter. Earnings from operations came in at $0.86.",937,"Thank you, Geisha. And good morning, everyone. I'll start by covering our second quarter results and then provide a couple of updates to our guidance for 2017. 
Slide 4 shows our results for the second quarter. Earnings from operations came in at $0.86. GAAP earnings, including items impacting comparability, are also shown here. Pipeline-related expenses were $29 million pretax for the quarter. Our legal and regulatory related expenses came in at $3 million pretax. For the Butte fire, we recorded insurance recoveries of $46 million pretax this quarter, including the receipt of $32 million from one of our contractor's insurers. This was partially offset by legal costs of $17 million, for a net favorable impact of $29 million pretax for the quarter. 
Finally, we have a new item this quarter related to charges associated with the planned closure of Diablo Canyon. During the quarter, we reached a settlement with parties in our joint proposal to retire Diablo Canyon, along with several other intervenors, which provides clarity on the recovery of previously incurred license renewal costs and costs incurred for projects that will be canceled as a result of the retirement. As part of that settlement agreement, we have recorded a $47 million pretax charge for the unrecoverable portion of these costs in the second quarter. This settlement agreement was filed with the CPUC in May, and we expect a final decision later this year. 
Moving on. Slide 5 shows the quarter-over-quarter comparison for earnings from operations of $0.66 in Q2 last year and $0.86 in Q2 of this year. Consistent with last quarter, we were $0.15 favorable due to the timing of 2015 GT&S rate case decision, which was received in August of last year. This year-to-date favorable variance of roughly $0.30 will fully reverse in the fourth quarter. Rate base earnings were $0.07 for the quarter. Since we did not receive the 2017 GRC decision until May of this year, our second quarter results reflect 2 quarters of incremental GRC rate base earnings. You can expect to see about $0.05 in rate base earnings for each of the next few quarters for a total of $0.20 for the full year. A number of small miscellaneous items totaled $0.04 positive for the quarter, most of which is timing related and is expected to reverse by year end. There were 2 additional items from the 2017 GRC decision that contributed to a negative $0.04. As we mentioned last year, our GRC revenues were adjusted in 2017, resulting in a loss of incremental tax repair benefits of roughly $0.25 annually, including $0.07 this quarter. This was partially offset by $0.03 favorable for incremental revenues to recover depreciation and interest costs that we incurred in the first quarter. 
Lastly, we had $0.02 negative related to the issuance of shares. Transitioning now to Slide 6. Today, we are reaffirming our guidance for earnings from operations of $3.55 to $3.75 per share. On Slide 7, we've outlined the underlying assumptions for that guidance. I'll reiterate that it remains our objective to earn the CPUC-authorized return on equity across enterprise in 2017. One adjustment to our plan that I'll note here is we are reducing our 2017 CapEx range from approximately $6 billion to roughly $5.9 billion, which primarily reflects the shift in some of our gas transmission and distribution work into 2018. At the same time, we have increased the CapEx forecast for 2018 to $6.1 billion, on Slide 10, to reflect this adjustment. 
Turning now to Slide 8. There are a few changes in our items impacting comparability in 2017. Butte fire-related insurance recoveries net of legal costs reflect recorded proceeds and costs through the second quarter. The shareholder derivative settlement was approved by the court on July 18, and we expect to record a net benefit of $65 million pretax in the third quarter. 
Lastly, we've included the $47 million for the Diablo Canyon-related charges that I mentioned earlier. Moving now to Slide 9. I'm pleased to share that the high end of our equity range has decreased from $600 million to $500 million. With 2 quarters under our belt, we have better line of sight into our financing plans for the year, coupled with the shift in some capital to 2018. 
On Slides 10 and 11, we've updated our CapEx and rate base to reflect the changes I shared earlier. Additionally, as Geisha mentioned, we filed our TO19 case with FERC yesterday, which includes a roughly $200 million increase to CapEx over our TO17 settlement. This is reflected in the high end of our CapEx and rate base ranges. 
Finally, let's move onto Slide 12. At the end of May, we announced that we were raising our quarterly dividend $0.04, to $0.53 per share. On an annual basis, this increases our dividend by 8%, from $1.96 per share to $2.12 per share. This is another step in our commitment to target a 60% dividend payout ratio by 2019. 
I'll close by echoing Geisha's comments about how pleased we are with the results of this quarter. With favorable regulatory decisions in 2 of our most important cases, the General Rate Case and cost of capital, rate reliability despite a record heatwave and we're continuing to provide shareholder value with another increase to our dividend, we continue to be confident in our ability to deliver on our plans as we evolve with a changing energy landscape. And while we aren't providing guidance beyond 2017, our objective is to earn the recently authorized return on equity across the enterprise for 2018 and 2019. With that, let's open up the line for questions."

Let me just give a quick update on that. As we mentioned, in the original proceeding the power cost indifference adjustment, the PCIA, is really designed to ensure that the state law is fulfilled to maintain indifference as some customers choose to leave bundled service and go to either CCAs or direct access. As we have pointed out, and as I think the joint utilities pointed out, the current mechanism as it stands today does not fully allocate those costs. So for us, about 35% of those costs really remain with bundled customers, which needs to be corrected, as CCAs continue to become a bigger and bigger part of load. With the PCIA OIR that the commission recently launched, we view that as a real positive. The commission's clearly recognized the need for reform in that proceeding and has laid out some guiding principles that highlight the need to really maintain what we call bundled customer indifference which ensures that the state law is followed. So the commission has not yet issued a schedule, but in many different proceedings and areas, they have mentioned the desire to handle this on an expedited basis and move through that quickly. So we're very hopeful that, that comes to pass. And we'll see and follow this proceeding as it goes. I would expect it will hopefully be resolved sometime in 2018."

I'm pleased to report that we had a very strong quarter, one that was marked by continued impressive operational performance, encouraging progress on the regulatory front and solid financial results. I'll start this morning with an update on some important actions we've taken this past quarter to continue strengthening our safety culture and operations. I'll then highlight some key investments we're making to enable us to meet our customers' evolving expectations while also keeping bills affordable. And finally, I'll cover some other recent steps we've taken to help advance California's clean energy economy and position PG&E for continued success. After that, I'll turn things over to our Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, David Thomason, to walk us through the financials, as Jason Wells, unfortunately, has laryngitis, although he will be available for some questions. 
Before we dive in, I'd like to review the final decision we recently received in the cost of capital case. The decision sets our allowed return on equity at 10.25% through the end of 2019, which is critical given the nearly $6 billion in annual investments we'll be making in our gas and electric systems over that same period. Just as importantly, our customers will benefit through lower rates, a savings of roughly $100 million annually. While I recognize it was a challenging process, in the end the cost of capital decision is yet another example of how coalitions can achieve effective solutions. I'm gratified to add this to the list, alongside the Diablo agreement we announced last summer and the 2017 GRC all-party settlement. 
Let's move now to a review of our safety and operational progress for the quarter. As you may recall, in 2014 we were one of the first utilities in the world to be certified under both the ISO-55001 and PAS-55 safety standards. Every 3 years, we have to go through a rigorous recertification process. The critical requirement for recertification is to demonstrate continuous improvement. Well, I'm happy to report that Lloyd's Register, the internationally recognized third-party auditor, recently recertified us in both ISO-55001 and PAS-55. This is independent third-party confirmation of our continually improving safety culture and industry-leading asset management program, and it's something I'm extremely proud of. I want to take this opportunity to congratulate and thank our teams on a truly great accomplishment, one that reflects our laser-like focus on safety, not just in the gas operations but across the company. 
Staying on the theme of continuous improvement, I'd like to talk about the report that was issued in May
[Audio Gap]
numerous improvements we've made as a company to our safety culture. In fact, the first conclusion of the report affirms that, ""PG&E employees at all levels are committed to safety."" That speaks volumes about the culture we're building, and I couldn't agree more. Safety is at the heart of everything we do here at PG&E. 
Looking at the 68 specific recommendations in the report, most are fully consistent with our own safety plans. While there are a few recommendations in the report that we believe warrant further consideration by the CPUC in the upcoming proceedings, we agree with the vast majority of the recommendations and plan to implement them by the middle of next year. 
Moving on to our operational performance. We had a number of highlights this past quarter, and I'd like to focus on one in particular. This past June, most of California was hit by a historic heat wave. Millions of customers experienced temperatures in the triple digits for nearly a week. Demand on our system hit levels that we haven't seen in over a decade, reaching over 20,000 megawatts on June 22, just shy of our all-time system peak in 2006. The good news is that less than 2% of our electric customers experienced a sustained loss of power during the peak outage day. Our strong reliability performance was even more noteworthy, given that one of our Diablo Canyon units was in a planned refueling outage during the same period. And in addition, at certain times during the heatwave, more than half of PG&E's energy supply was met with RPS-eligible resources. 
This experience is a testament to the long-term investments we've made to modernize our system, and it demonstrates what we've been saying for quite some time, and that is, we can deliver the clean energy that our customers want and still provide great safety and reliability. 
With our strong operational performance in mind, I'd like to touch upon a couple of recent regulatory developments that help set the foundation for our future investments and will enable us to continue to deliver on our customers' evolving needs and expectations. The first is the final decision on our 2017 General Rate Case, which approved the all-party settlement between PG&E and our intervenors, including consumer advocates TURN and ORA. While this gives us a clear line of sight into our distribution and generation revenues for the next 3 years, it also enables our plans for making the infrastructure investments necessary to meet our customers' energy needs. For example, the GRC authorizes CapEx increases related to electric reliability improvement, network cable replacement and capacity increases to support distributed generation resources. These are the same types of investments that enabled us to provide safe and reliable service during the recent heat wave. 
We're pleased with the outcome of the GRC decision, which approves 98% of our rate base request and provides us with the resources needed to support continued investment in the grid. At the same time, we went into this rate case very mindful of the need to keep our customer bills affordable, and the outcome represents a fairly modest 1% increase in our authorized revenues for 2017. The second regulatory development I'd like to mention this morning is our electric transmission case, TO19, the application which we filed yesterday at FERC. We're seeking a $74 million increase in revenues starting in 2018 for such key capital investments as system reliability work and substation modernization. It is through these types of investments and these continued investments in our grid that we can help ensure our system is stable and that we can continue providing the high-quality service that our customers have come to expect. 
The last area I'll cover this morning is the work we're doing to position PG&E for success in the future energy markets. In addition to the investments we're making to upgrade and modernize our grid, we are also leveraging our proximity to Silicon Valley to pilot new technologies and systems, in effect beta testing the grid of the future. The rapid growth of both large-scale renewables and distributed energy resources, or DERs, means that we as a grid planner and operator we have to find ways of managing third-party assets that we don't own or don't control, assets such as private rooftop solar or electric vehicles. We have to work on this as a system rather than look at these individual items in isolation. In one of our many pilot projects, we're working with General Electric, Tesla Energy and Green Charge Networks to test a distributed energy resources management system on 3 interconnected feeders this summer. The pilot includes private residential rooftop solar with smart inverters, residential battery storage, commercial industrial battery storage and a utility-scale battery storage facility that PG&E owns and 1 which has the capability to sell into the wholesale market. What's unique about this pilot is that it gets right to the core of our grid modernization work, namely having visibility into all the resources that our customers are connecting to the grid and understanding how they respond when we as a grid operator needs to manage them for the overall safety and reliability of the electric system. 
Now in order to succeed in the future energy market, we not only need to invest in the right technologies and systems, we also need to have the right policies in place to help us achieve the state's clean energy goals. You may recall that during our Q1 earnings call I mentioned the portfolio allocation mechanism or PAM filing that PG&E and the other California investor-owned utilities jointly submitted to the CPUC. In the filing, we proposed to replace the power charge indifference adjustment with an updated approach that more fairly allocates costs and benefits between customers who choose CCAs or direct access and those who stay with their existing energy provider. This is a critical issue where all parties recognize the need for reform. On June 29, the CPUC voted out a new order instituting rulemaking to review, revise and consider alternatives to the power charge indifference adjustment. While the CPUC at the same time dismissed the PAM application, we view the new OIR as a clear recognition of the need for reform to ensure that costs are fairly allocated to all customers in compliance with the state law. The CPUC has recognized the issues with the current mechanism, and we will have the opportunity to advocate with the other IOUs for the types of reform that were included in the PAM application. 
In closing, I want to reiterate that this has been a strong quarter. We continue to make steady progress in our safety culture, and we provided impressive reliability for our customers despite a record-setting heat wave. We also achieved a number of positive regulatory outcomes, including the General Rate Case and the cost of capital decision, which provide a solid foundation for the investments we will be making our system. With that, let me thank you for joining us, and let me turn things over to David to walk us through the financials."
139813,528851004,1258761,"PG&E Corporation, Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2017",2017-07-27,"Earnings Calls","PG&E Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Geisha, and good morning, everyone. I'll start by covering our second quarter results and then provide a couple of updates to our guidance for 2017. Slide 4 shows our results for the second quarter. Earnings from operations came in at $0.86.",937,"Thank you, Geisha, and good morning, everyone. I'll start by covering our second quarter results and then provide a couple of updates to our guidance for 2017. 
Slide 4 shows our results for the second quarter. Earnings from operations came in at $0.86. GAAP earnings, including items impacting comparability, are also shown here. Pipeline-related expenses were $29 million pretax for the quarter. Our legal and regulatory related expenses came in at $3 million pretax. For the Butte fire, we recorded insurance recoveries of $46 million pretax this quarter, including the receipt of $32 million from one of our contractor's insurers. This was partially offset by legal costs of $17 million, for a net favorable impact of $29 million pretax for the quarter. 
Finally, we have a new item this quarter related to charges associated with the planned closure of Diablo Canyon. During the quarter, we reached a settlement with parties in our joint proposal to retire Diablo Canyon, along with several other intervenors, which provides clarity on the recovery of previously incurred license renewal costs and costs incurred for projects that will be canceled as a result of the retirement. As part of that settlement agreement, we have recorded a $47 million pretax charge for the unrecoverable portion of these costs in the second quarter. This settlement agreement was filed with the CPUC in May, and we expect a final decision later this year. 
Moving on. Slide 5 shows the quarter-over-quarter comparison for earnings from operations of $0.66 in Q2 last year and $0.86 in Q2 of this year. Consistent with last quarter, we were $0.15 favorable due to the timing of 2015 GT&S rate case decision, which was received in August of last year. This year-to-date favorable variance of roughly $0.30 will fully reverse in the fourth quarter. Rate base earnings were $0.07 for the quarter. Since we did not receive the 2017 GRC decision until May of this year, our second quarter results reflect 2 quarters of incremental GRC rate base earnings. You can expect to see about $0.05 in rate base earnings for each of the next few quarters for a total of $0.20 for the full year. A number of small miscellaneous items totaled $0.04 positive for the quarter, most of which is timing related and is expected to reverse by year end. There were 2 additional items from the 2017 GRC decision that contributed to a negative $0.04. As we mentioned last year, our GRC revenues were adjusted in 2017, resulting in a loss of incremental tax repair benefits of roughly $0.25 annually, including $0.07 this quarter. This was partially offset by $0.03 favorable for incremental revenues to recover depreciation and interest costs that we incurred in the first quarter. 
Lastly, we had $0.02 negative related to the issuance of shares. Transitioning now to Slide 6. Today, we are reaffirming our guidance for earnings from operations of $3.55 to $3.75 per share. On Slide 7, we've outlined the underlying assumptions for that guidance. I'll reiterate that it remains our objective to earn the CPUC-authorized return on equity across enterprise in 2017. One adjustment to our plan that I'll note here is we are reducing our 2017 CapEx range from approximately $6 billion to roughly $5.9 billion, which primarily reflects the shift in some of our gas transmission and distribution work into 2018. At the same time, we have increased the CapEx forecast for 2018 to $6.1 billion, on Slide 10, to reflect this adjustment. 
Turning now to Slide 8. There are a few changes in our items impacting comparability in 2017. Butte fire-related insurance recoveries net of legal costs reflect recorded proceeds and costs through the second quarter. The shareholder derivative settlement was approved by the court on July 18, and we expect to record a net benefit of $65 million pretax in the third quarter. 
Lastly, we've included the $47 million for the Diablo Canyon-related charges that I mentioned earlier. Moving now to Slide 9. I'm pleased to share that the high end of our equity range has decreased from $600 million to $500 million. With 2 quarters under our belt, we have better line of sight into our financing plans for the year, coupled with the shift in some capital to 2018. 
On Slides 10 and 11, we've updated our CapEx and rate base to reflect the changes I shared earlier. Additionally, as Geisha mentioned, we filed our TO19 case with FERC yesterday, which includes a roughly $200 million increase to CapEx over our TO17 settlement. This is reflected in the high end of our CapEx and rate base ranges. 
Finally, let's move onto Slide 12. At the end of May, we announced that we were raising our quarterly dividend $0.04, to $0.53 per share. On an annual basis, this increases our dividend by 8%, from $1.96 per share to $2.12 per share. This is another step in our commitment to target a 60% dividend payout ratio by 2019. 
I'll close by echoing Geisha's comments about how pleased we are with the results of this quarter. With favorable regulatory decisions in 2 of our most important cases, the General Rate Case and cost of capital, rate reliability despite a record heatwave and we're continuing to provide shareholder value with another increase to our dividend, we continue to be confident in our ability to deliver on our plans as we evolve with a changing energy landscape. And while we aren't providing guidance beyond 2017, our objective is to earn the recently authorized return on equity across the enterprise for 2018 and 2019. With that, let's open up the line for questions."

Let me just give a quick update on that. As we mentioned, in the original proceeding the power cost indifference adjustment, the PCIA, is really designed to ensure that the state law is fulfilled to maintain indifference as some customers choose to leave bundled service and go to either CCAs or direct access. As we have pointed out, and as I think the joint utilities pointed out, the current mechanism as it stands today does not fully allocate those costs. So for us, about 35% of those costs really remain with bundled customers, which needs to be corrected, as CCAs continue to become a bigger and bigger part of load. With the PCIA OIR that the commission recently launched, we view that as a real positive. The commission's clearly recognized the need for reform in that proceeding and has laid out some guiding principles that highlight the need to really maintain what we call bundled customer indifference which ensures that the state law is followed. So the commission has not yet issued a schedule, but in many different proceedings and areas, they have mentioned the desire to handle this on an expedited basis and move through that quickly. So we're very hopeful that, that comes to pass. And we'll see and follow this proceeding as it goes. I would expect it will hopefully be resolved sometime in 2018."

Given their recent wildfires impacting our customers, and communities come our discussion today will be different from our usual earnings call. This morning, I will update you when we currently know about the fire",1510,"Thank you, Chris, good morning, everyone. Given their recent wildfires impacting our customers, and communities come our discussion today will be different from our usual earnings call. This morning, I will update you when we currently know about the fires will describe our restoration activities. I will address the efforts to identify the causes of the fires and provide an overview of the process from here. I'll also talk about how we're working to protect the safety of our customers and communities as we see this trends with more extreme weather events continuing to increase. Jason will walk you through the financials of the quarter, and then I'll provide a few closing remarks and then we'll take your questions. 
I want to start by sharing what we know about the extraordinary nature of the fires that swept across Northern California a few weeks ago. On October 8th and 9th, PG&E service area experienced a one-off event without precedent with some recorded when exceeding 75 miles per hour. Numerous commuter have addressed the extraordinary nature of the weather conditions with one commenting that it produced extreme wind beyond contemporary experience. These destructive wind impacted an area with trees weakened by years of drought and other environmental factors.
Additionally, heavy rain and snow storms last winter brought renewed vegetation growth. But with the heat wave over the summer and fall, this vegetation dried out again, creating an abundant source of fuel. 
Several wildfires struck at night and struck quickly and they burn for days. Before the fires were fully contained, I met with community leaders and our team members in Napa and Santa Rosa, 2 of the hardest hit areas, and I had an opportunity to see the damage. What I can sell you is during my 2 decades in Florida, I worked through many major hurricanes and I've seen firsthand the destruction that hurricane force winds can bring to a community, but this was like nothing I've ever seen. The fast-moving fires brought expansive devastation and left little standing in their path. Many communities and families experienced catastrophic losses. Numerous lives were lost and several thousand people lost homes and businesses. 
The people impacted are our neighbors, our friends and family, our own employees and, of course, our customers. And I want to extend our deepest sympathies to all of them. I will also want to acknowledge the thousands of firefighters involved in the response and recovery efforts. I thank them and other first responders, including our own, for their heroic efforts. From the earliest hours, we maintained the singular focus on the life, safety and well-being of our customers and communities. Our public safety actions included proactively turning off gas in some areas to support the efforts of first responders and keep our communities safe. 
In terms of outages, about 42,000 gas customers and about 360,000 electric customers were impacted by the wildfires. We assembled a restoration team 4,300 strong made up of our own employees, contractors and mutual leg utility workers. They worked around-the-clock for weeks to get our customers safely back online, following, of course, Cal Fire's lead after they established containment boundaries. 
As part of our restoration efforts, we provided back-up fuel and generation support to critical services like hospitals and local water agencies until they can be permanently restored. And our customer service teams, they staffed evacuation shelters and local assistance centers to provide support to our customers in both English and Spanish. This was a largest restoration team we've put together since the earthquake in 1989, and they did an outstanding job. 
Now I know there's a lot of interest in how these fires started and in how PG&E assets might have been involved in or impacted by the wildfires. Our communities deserve answers and we are committed to learning what happened. It's critical that we identify anything that will help us to keep our customers and communities safe in the future. That is our goal as we work with Cal Fire and the CPUC. Both agencies are conducting investigations of the wildfires, and we will continue to cooperate with them as that work moves forward. As has been reported in the press, we have received a number of losses and are, of course, conducting our own extensive fact-finding in this important matter as we prepare to respond. 
As we've previously reported, when we gained access to some affected areas, we found instances of wires down, vegetation near our facilities and some broken poles. In those instances were Cal Fire investigators or PG&E identified a site potentially involving our facilities, we submitted incident reports to the CPUC. These electric incident reports are factual in nature and do not reflect a finding of cause. To date, we've submitted 20 reports. 
As part of our commitment to transparency, we have posted the submitted incident reports on our website following the CPCU's decision to the same. We expect that once Cal Fire completes its investigation on the causes of the fires, it will release its findings through one or more reports. 
And given the complexity and size of the fires, we don't know when Cal Fire may issue its finding. In the meantime, we will continue to cooperate with investigators and regulators, while keeping our team focused on providing safe, reliable energy to our customers and communities. 
Many of you have reached out with questions about the potential impact of the wildfires to the company's financials and also about the doctrine of inverse condemnation in California. At this time, the nonfinancial impact of the wildfires is limited to the cost of the unprecedented response and restoration efforts, cost related to our liability insurance and some legal expenses, and Jason will cover these later this morning. 
As a reminder, California is an outlier when it comes to potential liability. California is one of the only states in the country where the courts have applied inverse condemnation liability to [indiscernible] caused by utility equipment. This means that if a utility's equipment is found to have been a substantial cause of a damage in the event like a wildfire, even if a utility has followed all the rules and, in essence, has not done anything wrong, the utility may be liable for property damages and attorneys fees associated with that event. We don't believe that inverse condemnation is an appropriate doctrine nor do we think it is appropriately applied to regulated utilities. We would challenge this application if that would be the case in these events. However, if it is applied, then the CPUC should take action that is consistent with the purpose of the doctrine. That said, I want to be clear. This was an extraordinary confluence of events and right now, it's simply too early to make an assumption about liability. What we can say with certainty is that PG&E is going to be crucial to the rebuilding and recovery in the communities affected, and we are committed to supporting that process. We've pledged more than $3 million to help support the community's recovery efforts, and we are matching our employees' charitable contributions for wildfire relief. Employees from across the company have stepped up to volunteer their time to support the affected communities, and we'll be doing much more in the weeks and the months ahead. 
I know there's a lot of interest in our pool maintenance and vegetation management programs, so let me address these as well. First, we routinely inspect, maintain and replace our electric poles. This includes annual scheduled patrols, 5-year visual inspections and intrusive tested and treated on our whirlpools on a frequency that significantly exceeds CPUC's requirements. We also have one-off, if not the most, comprehensive vegetation management programs in the country. Our vegetation management program managers about 123 million trees across the service territory and every year, we inspect every segment of the 99,000 miles of overhead line and we clear vegetation as needed. This is well beyond what is typical in our industry where most utilities have a 3-year vegetation management cycle or sometimes longer. Typically, we spend about $200 million every year to line clear or remove 1.3 million trees to mitigate both the risk of wildfires and to prevent electric outages. With the drought and the tree mortality crisis we've experienced in California, we have been expanding our vegetation management work since 2014. 
In 2016, we spent an additional $200 million, essentially doubling our typical vegetation management spending last year. We've removed an incremental 236,000 dead or dying trees, and we enhanced our tree maintenance work with additional patrols in areas of high fire danger, including a combination of boots on the ground, aerial patrols and sophisticated lidar technology. 
Before I transition to Jason, let me say we know that this is a very difficult time for our customers and the communities impacted by these terrible wildfires. We're committed to their safety and well-being, and we're going to stand by them as they rebuild and recover. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Jason to take you through the financials."

We appreciate the concerns many of you have expressed following the wildfires. And I want to reiterate our commitment to transparency as we gather additional information about the financial impact of these events. This morning, I'll cover our third quarter results and then provide a couple of updates for our guidance for 2017. I will also briefly touch on some known items from 2018 and 2019. 
Slide 5 shows our results for the third quarter. Earnings from operations came in at $1.12 per share. GAAP earnings including items impacting comparability, are also shown here. Pipeline-related expenses were $20 million pretax. Our legal and regulatory-related expenses came in at $2 million pretax. Binds and penalties were $11 million, reflects the incremental financial remedies in the proposed decision for the ex parte order instituting investigation and that amount is not tax deductible. 
For the fire, we had a few changes this quarter. We recorded third-party claims and legal costs of $368 million pretax. This was partially offset by a crude insurance of $297 million pretax. This total also includes $21 million recovered through one of our contractor's insurers. We have now recorded insurance recoveries up to the limit of our policy of $922 million. The net impact of these items is $71 million pretax. 
Finally, as we mentioned last quarter, in July, the court approved the shareholder derivative settlement. The pretax $65 million shown here reflects the $90 million in insurance proceeds less $25 million paid in plaintiff's legal fees. 
Moving on to Slide 6, which shows the quarter-over-quarter comparison from earnings from operations of $0.94 in Q3 last year and $1.12 in Q3 this year. We were $0.08 favorable due to the timing of Texas. The full amount of this line item affecting our results year-to-date will reverse in the fourth quarter. We were another $0.06 favorable due to the timing of operational spend during the year. We took the opportunity to bundle some of our work to execute more efficiently, which created some delays. We expect this to fully reverse in the fourth quarter. 
Rate base earnings were $0.05. You can expect to see rate base earnings of about $0.05 next quarter as well for a total of $0.20 for the full year. We were $0.04 favorable due to the timing of the 2015 GT&S decision, which we received in August of last year. The year-to-date favorable variance of roughly $0.33 will fully reverse in the fourth quarter. 
A number of small miscellaneous items totaled $0.07 positive. As we mentioned previously, our GRC revenues were adjusted in 2017, resulting in a loss of incremental tax repair benefits of roughly $0.25 annually including $0.10 this quarter.  Lastly, we had $0.02 negative for the issuance of shares. 
Transitioning now to Slide 7. Today, we are reaffirming our guidance from earnings from operations of $3.55 to $3.75 per share. 
On Slide 8. We've laid out our underlying assumptions for that guidance. Let me be clear that the guidance outlined here and all of my remarks today assume no material financial impact on the wildfires beyond restoration cost, insurance written statement and legal expenses that will impact the 2017 results. Our current forecast estimate for cost related to restoration and repairs following the recent fires ranges from $160 million to $200 million. This includes an estimated $60 million to $80 million in capital. We expect to seek recovery for our restoration activities for this extraordinary event through our existing catastrophic event member and account process of the CPUC. I'll reiterate that it remains our objective to our CPUC operates return on equity across the enterprise this year as well as in 2018 and 2019. 
In terms of additional guidance for 2018 and beyond, we intend to provide an update with our 2017 results on the fourth quarter call. Among other considerations are forward-looking guidance will integrate the 2019 GT&S rate case, which we will file at the end of this year as required by the CPUC. 
The 2015 GT&S rate case include a multi-year plans from improving the safety of our gas system, including programs to replace segments of our pipelines and to redesign other segments to facilitate in-line inspections. The 2019 rate case application will include a continuation of those plans as well as work to comply with new regulation established to help prevent methane leaks from gas storage facilities. 
Turning to Slide 9. There are a few changes to our items impacting comparability in 2017. We've removed the range for pipeline-related expenses for the year. We estimate it will incur about $90 million pretax to remove vegetation structures from our pipeline rights-of-way. As we knew the completion of our pipeline rights-of-way program, we are working through some particular complex segments. The environmental permitting requirements of this geographically projects require additional planning, which will shift more of the cost into 2018. You can expect us to spend between $35 million and $60 million on this item next year. 
We expect the total cost of this multi-year program to come in between $450 million and $475 million, which reflects a narrow range. The line items for both legal and regulatory-related expenses and for fines and penalties reflect cost incurred through the third quarter. fire-related cost net of insurance reflects amounts reported to the third quarter for third party claims and legal cost, net of accrued insurance recoveries. 
We increased our accrual for third-party claims by $350 million, which means we now believe our liability to be at least $1.1 million. This change reflects a number of additional claims that were filed during the quarter before a statue of limitations expired as well as our experience with resolving cases to date. We plan to seek recovery of all insured losses up to the $922 million limit of our liability insurance, and we have now recorded the full amount for probable insurance recoveries as of Q3. 
To the extent our ultimate liability for Butte Fire claims exceeds the amount recoverable through our insurance or through our contractor's insurance, we would expect to seek CPUC's authorization to recover excess amounts from our customers, consistent with the state's policy of inverse condemnation. 
And in additional note on insurance. Following the recent Northern California wildfires, we reinstated our insurance policy for any potential future events. That will result in a fourth quarter charge related to the write-off of the remaining unamortized cost of the original policy. Including both the insurance cost and legal expenses, we expect wildfire-related cost of roughly $100 million in 2017. 
And finally, the shareholder derivative line reflects the net benefit I discussed in the quarterly results. 
Moving now to Slide 10. We are reaffirming our equity guidance for the year at $400 million to $500 million, and we continue to believe that we'll be able to meet our equity needs in 2018 and 2019, while through our internal programs. It does not assumes no material impact from the wildfires. 
On Slide 11, you can see we've reduced our CapEx for 2017 to $5.7 billion from $5.9 billion we previously provided. We've also increased our planned CapEx in 2018 from $6.1 billion to $6.3 billion. This is because we continue to see a shift of some of our capital work into next year, mostly in gas transmission and distribution where we have continued to look for opportunities to bundle some of that work to execute it more efficiently. 
In 2019 and beyond, we'll incorporate the capital spend for our gas transmission's board rate case. So our final numbers will be included in our application, we expect the average CapEx impact to be on the order of roughly $900 million to $1 billion per year. 
On Slide 12, our 2018 rate base is lower as we've removed roughly $400 million associated with capital expenditures we incurred above the authorized amounts in the 2011 through 2014 GT&S rate case period. Those expenditures are subject to audit. We've moved that rate base into 2019 because the CPUC's audit of that spending is still underway. However, we continue to pursue recovery of these expenditures. We are reaffirming our commitment to the dividend and our plan to reach a dividend pay out ratio of approximately 60% by 2019. Again, that assumes no material impact from the wildfires. 
And now I'll turn it over back to Geisha for some final remarks."

I know we've gone through a lot of information this morning and before we go to questions, I want to briefly emphasize a few important points. I want to say again regardless of the cause of fires, we at PG&E are committed to supporting our customers and the communities we serve as they rebuild and recover. We've recognized that it's a privilege to serve them, and we will be here for them for the long haul. 
On the topic of liability, as we've said, it's premature to discuss any potential liability for the recent wildfires, given that there has been no determination of the causes of any of the fires. However, it's clear that liability is a matter of important public policy, and California's inverse condemnation policy makes it an outlier on this issue. That represents a risk for the state and for all Californians as well as for the state energy providers at a time when the state is increasing its investment in a bold, clean energy future. We need constructive solutions, and we're prepared to engage in that discussion with policymakers at the appropriate time. 
Now as we look ahead, we continue to focus on the areas we've discussed on our recent calls. First, operational excellence with safety is our top priority. On that note, I'm very pleased that the Institute of Nuclear Power Operators has validated our progress and praised our safety and operational performance at Diablo Canyon. 
Second, delivering a positive customer experience to ensure that we are the provider of choice for our customers. Despite a record-setting year of emergencies and severe weather, our customer satisfaction results show continued progress. 
And finally, positioning the company for long-term success. We continue to see a future defined by a much more complex grid that enables the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions consistent with the safe energy goals and is more resilient to extreme weather conditions, and PG&E is going to continue to play a vital role. To that end, over the last several years, 5 years, we've invested roughly $15 billion in our grid to develop a more flexible and resilient energy network. And our investments of around $6 billion in our electric grid over the next 2 years will continue to make that future a reality. And you have our commitment that we will remain focused on the fundamentals of our business as we go forward. 
With that, let's go to your questions."

Given the recent wildfires impacting our customers and communities, our discussion today will be different from our usual earnings call. This morning, I will update you what we currently know about the fires",1518,"Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Given the recent wildfires impacting our customers and communities, our discussion today will be different from our usual earnings call. 
This morning, I will update you what we currently know about the fires and I'll describe our restoration activities. I will address the efforts to identify the causes of the fires and provide an overview of the process from here. I'll also talk about how we're working to protect the safety of our customers and communities as we see this trend toward more extreme weather events continuing to increase. Jason will walk you through the financials of the quarter, and then I'll provide a few closing remarks, and then we'll take your questions. 
I want to start by sharing what we know about the extraordinary nature of the fires that swept across Northern California a few weeks ago. On October 8th and 9th, PG&E service area experienced a wind event without precedent with some recorded wind dust exceeding 75 miles per hour. Numerous meteorologists have addressed the extraordinary nature of the weather condition, with one commenting that it produced extreme winds beyond contemporary experience. These destructive winds impacted an area with trees weakened by years of drought and other environmental factors.
Additionally, heavy rain and snow storms last winter brought renewed vegetation growth. But with the heat waves of the summer and fall, this vegetation dried out again, creating an abundant source of fuel. 
Several wildfires struck at night and spread quickly and they burned for days. Before the fires were fully contained, I met with community leaders and our team members in Napa and Santa Rosa, 2 of the hardest hit areas, and I had an opportunity to see the damage. 
What I can sell you is during my 2 decades in Florida, I worked through many major hurricanes, and I've seen firsthand the destruction that hurricane force winds can bring to a community, but this was like nothing I've ever seen. The fast-moving fires brought expansive devastation and left little standing in their path. Many communities and families experienced catastrophic losses. Numerous lives were lost and several thousand people lost homes and businesses. 
The people impacted are our neighbors, our friends and family, our own employees and, of course, our customers. And I want to extend our deepest sympathies to all of them. I also want to acknowledge the thousands of firefighters involved in the response and recovery efforts. I thank them and other first responders, including our own, for their heroic efforts. From the earliest hours, we maintained a singular focus on the life, safety and well-being of our customers and communities. Our public safety actions included proactively turning off gas in some areas to support the efforts of first responders and keep our communities safe. 
In terms of outages, about 42,000 gas customers and about 360,000 electric customers were impacted by the wildfires. We assembled a restoration team 4,300 strong made up of our own employees, contractors and mutual-aid utility workers. They worked around the clock for weeks to get our customers safely back online, following, of course, CAL FIRE's lead after they established containment boundaries. 
As part of our restoration efforts, we provided back-up fuel and generation support to critical services like hospitals and local water agencies until they could be permanently restored. And our customer service team, they staffed evacuation shelters and local assistance centers to provide support to our customers in both English and Spanish. This was a largest restoration team we've put together since the Loma Prieta earthquake in 1989, and they did an outstanding job. 
Now I know there's a lot of interest in how these fires started and in how PG&E assets might have been involved in or impacted by the wildfires. Our communities deserve answers and we are committed to learning what happened. It's critical that we identify anything that will help us to keep our customers and communities safe in the future. That is our goal as we work with CAL FIRE and the CPUC. 
Both agencies are conducting investigations of the wildfires, and we will continue to cooperate with them as that work moves forward. As has been reported in the press, we have received a number of losses and are, of course, conducting our own extensive fact-finding in this important matter as we prepare to respond. 
As we've previously reported, when we gained access to some affected areas, we found instances of wires down, vegetation near our facilities and some broken poles. In those instances where CAL FIRE investigators or PG&E identified a site potentially involving our facilities, we submitted incident reports to the CPUC. These electric incident reports are factual in nature and do not reflect a finding of cause. To date, we've submitted 20 reports. 
As part of our commitment to transparency, we have posted the submitted incident reports on our website following the CPUC's decision to do the same. We expect that once CAL FIRE completes its investigation on the causes of the fires, it will release its findings through one or more reports. 
And given the complexity and size of the fires, we don't know when CAL FIRE may issue its findings. In the meantime, we will continue to cooperate with investigators and regulators, while keeping our team focused on providing safe, reliable energy to our customers and communities. 
Many of you have reached out with questions about the potential impact of the wildfires to the company's financials and also about the doctrine of inverse condemnation in California. At this time, the known financial impact of the wildfires is limited to the cost of the unprecedented response and restoration efforts, costs related to our liability insurance and some legal expenses, and Jason will cover these later this morning. 
As a reminder, California is an outlier when it comes to potential liability. California is one of the only states in the country where the courts have applied inverse condemnation liability to events caused by utility equipment. This means that if a utility's equipment is found to have been a substantial cause of a damage in the event like a wildfire, even if a utility has followed all the rules and, in essence, has not done anything wrong, the utility may be liable for property damages and attorneys fees associated with that event. 
We don't believe that inverse condemnation is an appropriate doctrine nor do we think it is appropriately applied to regulated utilities. We would challenge its application if that would be the case in these events. However, if it is applied, then the CPUC should take action that is consistent with the purpose of the doctrine. 
That said, I want to be clear. This was an extraordinary confluence of events and right now, it's simply too early to make an assumption about liability. What we can say with certainty is that PG&E is going to be crucial to the rebuilding and recovery in the communities affected, and we are committed to supporting that process. We've pledged more than $3 million to help support the community's recovery efforts, and we are matching our employees' charitable contributions for wildfire relief. Employees from across the company have stepped up to volunteer their time to support the affected communities, and we'll be doing much more in the weeks and the months ahead. 
I know there's a lot of interest in our pole maintenance and vegetation management programs, so let me address these as well. First, we routinely inspect, maintain and replace our electric poles. This includes annual scheduled patrols, 5-year visual inspections, an intrusive testing and treating on our wood poles on a frequency that significantly exceeds CPUC requirements. 
We also have one of, if not, the most comprehensive vegetation management programs in the country. Our vegetation management program manages about 123 million trees across the service territory. And every year, we inspect every segment of the 99,000 miles of overhead line and we clear vegetation as needed. This is well beyond what is typical in our industry where most utilities have a 3-year vegetation management cycle or sometimes longer. Typically, we spend about $200 million every year to line clear or remove 1.3 million trees to mitigate both the risk of wildfires and to prevent electric outages. With the drought and the tree mortality crisis we've experienced in California, we have been expanding our vegetation management work since 2014. 
In 2016, we spent an additional $200 million, essentially doubling our typical vegetation management spending last year. We've removed an incremental 236,000 dead or dying trees, and we enhanced our tree maintenance work with additional patrols in areas of high fire danger, including a combination of boots on the ground, aerial patrols and sophisticated LiDAR technology. 
Before I transition to Jason, let me say we know that this is a very difficult time for our customers and the communities impacted by these terrible wildfires. We're committed to their safety and well-being, and we're going to stand by them as they rebuild and recover. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Jason to take you through the financials."

We appreciate the concerns many of you have expressed, following the wildfires.

We appreciate the concerns many of you have expressed, following the wildfires. And I want to reiterate our commitment to transparency as we gather additional information about the financial impact of these events. This morning, I'll cover our third quarter results and then provide a couple of updates to our guidance for 2017. I will also briefly touch on some known items for 2018 and 2019. 
Slide 5 shows our results for the third quarter. Earnings from operations came in at $1.12 per share. GAAP earnings, including the items impacting comparability, are also shown here. Pipeline-related expenses were $20 million pretax. Our legal and regulatory-related expenses came in at $2 million pretax. Fines and penalties were $11 million, reflects the incremental financial remedies in the proposed decision for the ex parte order instituting investigation, and that amount is not tax deductible. 
For the Butte fire, we had a few changes this quarter. We recorded third-party claims and legal costs of $368 million pretax. This was partially offset by accrued insurance recoveries of $297 million pretax. This total also includes $21 million recovered through one of our contractors' insurers. We have now recorded insurance recoveries up to the limit of our policy of $922 million. The net impact of these items is $71 million pretax. 
Finally, as we mentioned last quarter, in July, the court approved the shareholder derivative settlement. The pretax $65 million shown here reflects the $90 million in insurance proceeds less $25 million paid in plaintiff's legal fees. 
Moving on to Slide 6, which shows the quarter-over-quarter comparison from earnings from operations of $0.94 in Q3 last year and $1.12 in Q3 this year. We were $0.08 favorable due to the timing of taxes. The full amount of this line item affecting our results year-to-date will reverse in the fourth quarter. We were another $0.06 favorable due to the timing of operational spend during the year. We took the opportunity to bundle some of our work to execute more efficiently, which created some delays. We expect this to fully reverse in the fourth quarter. 
Rate base earnings were $0.05. You can expect to see rate base earnings of about $0.05 next quarter as well for a total of $0.20 for the full year. We were $0.04 favorable due to the timing of the 2015 GT&S rate case decision, which we received in August of last year. The year-to-date favorable variance of roughly $0.33 will fully reverse in the fourth quarter. 
A number of small miscellaneous items totaled $0.07 positive. As we mentioned previously, our GRC revenues were adjusted in 2017, resulting in a loss of the incremental tax repair benefits of roughly $0.25 annually, including $0.10 this quarter. Lastly, we had $0.02 negative for the issuance of shares. 
Transitioning now to Slide 7. Today, we are reaffirming our guidance from earnings from operations of $3.55 to $3.75 per share. 
On Slide 8. We've laid out our underlying assumptions for that guidance. Let me be clear that the guidance outlined here and all of my remarks today assume no material financial impact on the wildfires beyond the restoration cost, insurance reinstatement and legal expenses that will impact the 2017 results. 
Our current forecast estimate for costs related to restoration and repairs following the recent fires ranges from $160 million to $200 million. This includes an estimated $60 million to $80 million in capital. We expect to seek recovery for our restoration activities for this extraordinary event through our existing Catastrophic Event Memorandum Account process of the CPUC. I'll reiterate that it remains our objective to our CPUC-authorized return on equity across the enterprise this year as well as in 2018 and 2019. 
In terms of additional guidance for 2018 and beyond, we intend to provide an update with our 2017 results on the fourth quarter call. Among other considerations, our forward-looking guidance will integrate the 2019 GT&S rate case, which we will file at the end of this year as required by the CPUC. 
The 2015 GT&S rate case include a multi-year plans for improving the safety of our gas system, including programs to replace segments of our pipelines and to redesign other segments to facilitate in-line inspections. The 2019 rate case application will include a continuation of those plans as well as work to comply with new regulation established to help prevent methane leaks from gas storage facilities. 
Turning to Slide 9. There are a few changes to our items impacting comparability in 2017. We've removed the range for pipeline-related expenses for the year. We estimate it will incur about $90 million pretax to remove vegetation and structures from our pipeline rights-of-way. As we near the completion of our pipeline rights-of-way program, we are working through some particular complex segments. The environmental permitting requirements of these geographically dispersed projects require additional planning, which will shift more of the cost into 2018. You can expect us to spend between $35 million and $60 million on this item next year. 
We expect the total cost of this multi-year program to come in between $450 million and $475 million, which reflects a narrow range. The line items for both legal and regulatory-related expenses and for fines and penalties reflect cost incurred through the third quarter. Butte fire-related costs, net of insurance, reflects amounts recorded through the third quarter for third-party claims and legal cost, net of accrued insurance recoveries. 
We increased our accrual for third-party claims by $350 million, which means we now believe our liability to be at least $1.1 billion. This change reflects a number of additional claims that were filed during the quarter before a statute of limitations expire as well as our experience with resolving cases to date. We plan to seek recovery of all insured losses up to the $922 million limit of our liability insurance, and we have now recorded that full amount for probable insurance recoveries as of Q3. 
To the extent our ultimate liability for Butte fire claims exceeds the amounts recoverable through our insurance or through our contractors' insurance, we would expect to seek CPUC's authorization to recover excess amounts from our customers, consistent with the state's policy of inverse condemnation. 
And an additional note on insurance. Following the recent Northern California wildfires, we reinstated our insurance policy for any potential future events. That will result in a fourth quarter charge related to the write-off of the remaining unamortized cost of the original policy. Including both the insurance cost and legal expenses, we expect wildfire-related cost of roughly $100 million in 2017. 
And finally, the shareholder derivative line reflects the net benefit I discussed in the quarterly results. 
Moving now to Slide 10. We are reaffirming our equity guidance for the year at $400 million to $500 million. And we continue to believe that we'll be able to meet our equity needs in 2018 and 2019, largely through our internal programs. It does not assume no material impact from the wildfires. 
On Slide 11, you can see we've reduced our CapEx for 2017 to $5.7 billion from $5.9 billion we previously provided. We've also increased our planned CapEx in 2018 from $6.1 billion to $6.3 billion. This is because we continue to see a shift of some of our capital work into next year, mostly in gas transmission and distribution where we have continued to look for opportunities to bundle some of that work to execute it more efficiently. 
In 2019 and beyond, we'll incorporate the capital spend for our gas transmission and storage rate case. So our final numbers will be included in our application, we expect the average CapEx impact to be on the order of roughly $900 million to $1 billion per year. 
On Slide 12, our 2018 rate base is lower as we've removed roughly $400 million associated with capital expenditures we incurred above the authorized amounts in the 2011 through 2014 GT&S rate case period. Those expenditures are subject to audit. We've moved that rate base into 2019 because the CPUC's audit of that spending is still underway. However, we continue to pursue recovery of these expenditures. We are reaffirming our commitment to the dividend and our plan to reach a dividend payout ratio of approximately 60% by 2019. Again, that assumes no material impact from the wildfires. 
And now I'll turn it back over to Geisha for some final remarks."

I know we've gone through a lot of information this morning and before we go to questions, I want to briefly emphasize a few important points. I want to say again, regardless of the cause of the fires, we at PG&E are committed to supporting our customers and the communities we serve as they rebuild and recover. We've recognized that it's a privilege to serve them, and we will be here for them for the long haul. 
On the topic of liability, as we've said, it's premature to discuss any potential liability for the recent wildfires, given that there has been no determination of the causes of any of the fires. However, it's clear that liability is a matter of important public policy, and California's inverse condemnation policy makes it an outlier on this issue. That represents a risk for the state and for all Californians as well as for the state's energy providers at a time when the state is increasing its investment in a bold, clean energy future. We need constructive solutions, and we're prepared to engage in that discussion with policymakers at the appropriate time. 
Now as we look ahead, we continue to focus on the areas we've discussed on our recent calls. First, operational excellence with safety is our top priority. On that note, I'm very pleased that the Institute of Nuclear Power Operators has validated our progress and praised our safety and operational performance of Diablo Canyon. 
Second, delivering a positive customer experience to ensure that we are the provider of choice for our customers. Despite a record-setting year of emergencies and severe weather, our customer satisfaction results show continued progress. 
And finally, positioning the company for long-term success. We continue to see a future defined by a much more complex grid that enables the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions consistent with the safe energy goals and is more resilient to extreme weather conditions, and PG&E is going to continue to play a vital role. 
To that end, over the last several years, 5 years, we've invested roughly $15 billion on our grid to develop a more flexible and resilient energy network. And our investments of around $6 billion in our electric grid over the next 2 years will continue to make that future a reality. And you have our commitment that we will remain focused on the fundamentals of our business as we go forward. 
With that, let's go to your questions."

That includes line clearing to remove parts of trees that are adjacent to our facilities as well as removal of dead and dying trees. So the program involves year-round effort to identify these dead and dying trees through inspection processes where we use foot and aerial patrols; we use LiDAR, which is light, detecting and ranging technology, to identify the trees that needs to be worked. We inspect all of our overhead lines every year, and we do second patrols in high fire danger areas at least twice a year. In some areas, we do as often as 4x a year. So it's a very aggressive program. There are specific requirements around line clearing, and it depends upon the voltage of the lines.

Given the recent wildfires impacting our customers and communities, our discussion today will be different from our usual earnings call. 
This morning, I will update you on what we currently know about the fires and I'll describe our restoration activities. I will address the efforts to identify the causes of the fires and provide an overview of the process from here. I'll also talk about how we're working to protect the safety of our customers and communities as we see this trend toward more extreme weather events continuing to increase. Jason will walk you through the financials of the quarter, and then I'll provide a few closing remarks, and then we'll take your questions. 
I want to start by sharing what we know about the extraordinary nature of the fires that swept across Northern California a few weeks ago. 
On October 8th and 9th, PG&E service area experienced a wind event without precedent with some recorded wind gust exceeding 75 miles per hour. Numerous meteorologists have addressed the extraordinary nature of the weather condition, with one commenting that it produced extreme winds beyond contemporary experience. These destructive winds impacted an area with trees weakened by years of drought and other environmental factors.
Additionally, heavy rain and snow storms last winter brought renewed vegetation growth. But with the heat waves of the summer and fall, this vegetation dried out again, creating an abundant source of fuel. 
Several wildfires struck at night and spread quickly and they burned for days. Before the fires were fully contained, I met with community leaders and our team members in Napa and Santa Rosa, 2 of the hardest hit areas, and I had an opportunity to see the damage. 
What I can sell you is during my 2 decades in Florida, I worked through many major hurricanes, and I've seen firsthand the destruction that hurricane force winds can bring to a community, but this was like nothing I've ever seen. The fast-moving fires brought expansive devastation and left little standing in their path. Many communities and families experienced catastrophic losses. Numerous lives were lost and several thousand people lost homes and businesses. 
The people impacted are our neighbors, our friends and family, our own employees and, of course, our customers. And I want to extend our deepest sympathies to all of them. I also want to acknowledge the thousands of firefighters involved in the response and recovery efforts. I thank them and other first responders, including our own, for their heroic efforts. From the earliest hours, we maintained a singular focus on the life, safety, and well-being of our customers and communities. Our public safety actions included proactively turning off gas in some areas to support the efforts of first responders and keep our communities safe. 
In terms of outages, about 42,000 gas customers and about 360,000 electric customers were impacted by the wildfires. We assembled a restoration team 4,300 strong made up of our own employees, contractors, and mutual-aid utility workers. They worked around the clock for weeks to get our customers safely back online, following, of course, CAL FIRE's lead after they established containment boundaries. 
As part of our restoration efforts, we provided backup fuel and generation support to critical services like hospitals and local water agencies until they could be permanently restored. And our customer service team, they staffed evacuation shelters and local assistance centers to provide support to our customers in both English and Spanish. This was the largest restoration team we've put together since the Loma Prieta earthquake in 1989, and they did an outstanding job. 
Now I know there's a lot of interest in how these fires started and in how PG&E assets might have been involved in or impacted by the wildfires. Our communities deserve answers and we are committed to learning what happened. It's critical that we identify anything that will help us to keep our customers and communities safe in the future. That is our goal as we work with CAL FIRE and the CPUC. 
Both agencies are conducting investigations of the wildfires, and we will continue to cooperate with them as that work moves forward. As has been reported in the press, we have received a number of losses and are, of course, conducting our own extensive fact-finding in this important matter as we prepare to respond. 
As we've previously reported, when we gained access to some affected areas, we found instances of wires down, vegetation near our facilities and some broken poles. In those instances where CAL FIRE investigators or PG&E identified a site potentially involving our facilities, we submitted incident reports to the CPUC. These electric incident reports are factual in nature and do not reflect a finding of cause. To date, we've submitted 20 reports. 
As part of our commitment to transparency, we have posted the submitted incident reports on our website following the CPUC's decision to do the same. We expect that once CAL FIRE completes its investigation on the causes of the fires, it will release its findings through one or more reports. 
And given the complexity and size of the fires, we don't know when CAL FIRE may issue its findings. In the meantime, we will continue to cooperate with investigators and regulators, while keeping our team focused on providing safe, reliable energy to our customers and communities. 
Many of you have reached out with questions about the potential impact of the wildfires to the company's financials and also about the doctrine of inverse condemnation in California. At this time, the known financial impact of the wildfires is limited to the cost of the unprecedented response and restoration efforts, costs related to our liability insurance and some legal expenses, and Jason will cover these later this morning. 
As a reminder, California is an outlier when it comes to potential liability. California is one of the only states in the country where the courts have applied inverse condemnation liability to events caused by utility equipment. This means that if a utility's equipment is found to have been a substantial cause of a damage in the event like a wildfire, even if a utility has followed all the rules and, in essence, has not done anything wrong, the utility may be liable for property damages and attorneys fees associated with that event. 
We don't believe that inverse condemnation is an appropriate doctrine nor do we think it is appropriately applied to regulated utilities. We would challenge its application if that would be the case in these events. However, if it is applied, then the CPUC should take action that is consistent with the purpose of the doctrine. 
That said, I want to be clear. This was an extraordinary confluence of events and right now, it's simply too early to make an assumption about liability. What we can say with certainty is that PG&E is going to be crucial to the rebuilding and recovery in the communities affected, and we are committed to supporting that process. We've pledged more than $3 million to help support the community's recovery efforts, and we are matching our employees' charitable contributions for wildfire relief. Employees from across the company have stepped up to volunteer their time to support the affected communities, and we'll be doing much more in the weeks and the months ahead. 
I know there's a lot of interest in our pole maintenance and vegetation management programs, so let me address these as well. First, we routinely inspect, maintain and replace our electric poles. This includes annual scheduled patrols, 5-year visual inspections, an intrusive testing and treating on our wood poles on a frequency that significantly exceeds CPUC requirements. 
We also have one of, if not, the most comprehensive vegetation management programs in the country. Our vegetation management program manages about 123 million trees across the service territory. And every year, we inspect every segment of the 99,000 miles of overhead line and we clear vegetation as needed. This is well beyond what is typical in our industry where most utilities have a 3-year vegetation management cycle or sometimes longer. Typically, we spend about $200 million every year to line clear or remove 1.3 million trees to mitigate both the risk of wildfires and to prevent electric outages. With the drought and the tree mortality crisis we've experienced in California, we have been expanding our vegetation management work since 2014. 
In 2016, we spent an additional $200 million, essentially doubling our typical vegetation management spending last year. We've removed an incremental 236,000 dead or dying trees, and we enhanced our tree maintenance work with additional patrols in areas of high fire danger, including a combination of boots on the ground, aerial patrols, and sophisticated LiDAR technology. 
Before I transition to Jason, let me say we know that this is a very difficult time for our customers and the communities impacted by these terrible wildfires. We're committed to their safety and well-being, and we're going to stand by them as they rebuild and recover. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Jason to take you through the financials."

For the Butte fire, we had a few changes this quarter. We recorded third-party claims and legal costs of $368 million pretax. This was partially offset by accrued insurance recoveries of $297 million pretax. This total also includes $21 million recovered through one of our contractors' insurers. We have now recorded insurance recoveries up to the limit of our policy of $922 million. The net impact of these items is $71 million pretax. 
Finally, as we mentioned last quarter, in July, the court approved the shareholder derivative settlement. The pretax $65 million shown here reflects the $90 million in insurance proceeds less $25 million paid in plaintiff's legal fees. 
Moving on to Slide 6, which shows the quarter-over-quarter comparison from earnings from operations of $0.94 in Q3 last year and $1.12 in Q3 this year. We were $0.08 favorable due to the timing of taxes. The full amount of this line item affecting our results year-to-date will reverse in the fourth quarter. We were another $0.06 favorable due to the timing of operational spend during the year. We took the opportunity to bundle some of our work to execute more efficiently, which created some delays. We expect this to fully reverse in the fourth quarter. 
Rate base earnings were $0.05. You can expect to see rate base earnings of about $0.05 next quarter as well for a total of $0.20 for the full year. We were $0.04 favorable due to the timing of the 2015 GT&S rate case decision, which we received in August of last year. The year-to-date favorable variance of roughly $0.33 will fully reverse in the fourth quarter. 
A number of small miscellaneous items totaled $0.07 positive. As we mentioned previously, our GRC revenues were adjusted in 2017, resulting in a loss of the incremental tax repair benefits of roughly $0.25 annually, including $0.10 this quarter. Lastly, we had $0.02 negative for the issuance of shares. 
Transitioning now to Slide 7. Today, we are reaffirming our guidance from earnings from operations of $3.55 to $3.75 per share. 
On Slide 8. We've laid out our underlying assumptions for that guidance. Let me be clear that the guidance outlined here and all of my remarks today assume no material financial impact on the wildfires beyond the restoration cost, insurance reinstatement and legal expenses that will impact the 2017 results. 
Our current forecast estimate for costs related to restoration and repairs following the recent fires ranges from $160 million to $200 million. This includes an estimated $60 million to $80 million in capital. We expect to seek recovery for our restoration activities for this extraordinary event through our existing Catastrophic Event Memorandum Account process of the CPUC. I'll reiterate that it remains our objective to our CPUC-authorized return on equity across the enterprise this year as well as in 2018 and 2019. 
In terms of additional guidance for 2018 and beyond, we intend to provide an update with our 2017 results on the fourth quarter call. Among other considerations, our forward-looking guidance will integrate the 2019 GT&S rate case, which we will file at the end of this year as required by the CPUC. 
The 2015 GT&S rate case includes multi-year plans for improving the safety of our gas system, including programs to replace segments of our pipelines and to redesign other segments to facilitate in-line inspections. The 2019 rate case application will include a continuation of those plans as well as work to comply with new regulation established to help prevent methane leaks from gas storage facilities. 
Turning to Slide 9. There are a few changes to our items impacting comparability in 2017. We've removed the range for pipeline-related expenses for the year. We estimate it will incur about $90 million pretax to remove vegetation and structures from our pipeline rights-of-way. As we near the completion of our pipeline rights-of-way program, we are working through some particular complex segments. The environmental permitting requirements of these geographically dispersed projects require additional planning, which will shift more of the cost into 2018. You can expect us to spend between $35 million and $60 million on this item next year. 
We expect the total cost of this multi-year program to come in between $450 million and $475 million, which reflects a narrow range. The line items for both legal and regulatory-related expenses and for fines and penalties reflect cost incurred through the third quarter. Butte fire-related costs, net of insurance, reflect amounts recorded through the third quarter for third-party claims and legal cost, net of accrued insurance recoveries. 
We increased our accrual for third-party claims by $350 million, which means we now believe our liability to be at least $1.1 billion. This change reflects a number of additional claims that were filed during the quarter before a statute of limitations expires as well as our experience with resolving cases to date. We plan to seek recovery of all insured losses up to the $922 million limit of our liability insurance, and we have now recorded that full amount for probable insurance recoveries as of Q3. 
To the extent our ultimate liability for Butte fire claims exceeds the amounts recoverable through our insurance or through our contractors' insurance, we would expect to seek CPUC's authorization to recover excess amounts from our customers, consistent with the state's policy of inverse condemnation. 
And an additional note on insurance. Following the recent Northern California wildfires, we reinstated our insurance policy for any potential future events. That will result in a fourth-quarter charge related to the write-off of the remaining unamortized cost of the original policy. Including both the insurance cost and legal expenses, we expect the wildfire-related cost of roughly $100 million in 2017. 
And finally, the shareholder derivative line reflects the net benefit I discussed in the quarterly results. 
Moving now to Slide 10. We are reaffirming our equity guidance for the year at $400 million to $500 million. And we continue to believe that we'll be able to meet our equity needs in 2018 and 2019, largely through our internal programs. It does not assume no material impact from the wildfires. 
On Slide 11, you can see we've reduced our CapEx for 2017 to $5.7 billion from $5.9 billion we previously provided. We've also increased our planned CapEx in 2018 from $6.1 billion to $6.3 billion. This is because we continue to see a shift of some of our capital work into next year, mostly in gas transmission and distribution where we have continued to look for opportunities to bundle some of that work to execute it more efficiently. 
In 2019 and beyond, we'll incorporate the capital spend for our gas transmission and storage rate case. So our final numbers will be included in our application, we expect the average CapEx impact to be on the order of roughly $900 million to $1 billion per year. 
On Slide 12, our 2018 rate base is lower as we've removed roughly $400 million associated with capital expenditures we incurred above the authorized amounts in the 2011 through 2014 GT&S rate case period. Those expenditures are subject to audit. We've moved that rate base into 2019 because the CPUC's audit of that spending is still underway. However, we continue to pursue recovery of these expenditures. We are reaffirming our commitment to the dividend and our plan to reach a dividend payout ratio of approximately 60% by 2019. Again, that assumes no material impact from the wildfires. 
And now I'll turn it back over to Geisha for some final remarks."

I know we've gone through a lot of information this morning and before we go to questions, I want to briefly emphasize a few important points. I want to say again, regardless of the cause of the fires, we at PG&E are committed to supporting our customers and the communities we serve as they rebuild and recover. We've recognized that it's a privilege to serve them, and we will be here for them for the long haul. 
On the topic of liability, as we've said, it's premature to discuss any potential liability for the recent wildfires, given that there has been no determination of the causes of any of the fires. However, it's clear that liability is a matter of important public policy, and California's inverse condemnation policy makes it an outlier on this issue. That represents a risk for the state and for all Californians as well as for the state's energy providers at a time when the state is increasing its investment in a bold, clean energy future. We need constructive solutions, and we're prepared to engage in that discussion with policymakers at the appropriate time. 
Now as we look ahead, we continue to focus on the areas we've discussed on our recent calls. First, operational excellence with safety is our top priority. On that note, I'm very pleased that the Institute of Nuclear Power Operators has validated our progress and praised our safety and operational performance of Diablo Canyon. 
Second, delivering a positive customer experience to ensure that we are the provider of choice for our customers. Despite a record-setting year of emergencies and severe weather, our customer satisfaction results show continued progress. 
And finally, positioning the company for long-term success. We continue to see a future defined by a much more complex grid that enables the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions consistent with the safe energy goals and is more resilient to extreme weather conditions, and PG&E is going to continue to play a vital role. 
To that end, over the last several years, 5 years, we've invested roughly $15 billion on our grid to develop a more flexible and resilient energy network. And our investments of around $6 billion in our electric grid over the next 2 years will continue to make that future a reality. And you have our commitment that we will remain focused on the fundamentals of our business as we go forward. 
With that, let's go to your questions."

In other words, the premise of inverse is that the utility pays the property damages and attorney's fees without any showing that it's at fault. And in turn, the utility spreads the cost across all the customers and recovers those costs through rates. So as I understand the TURN argument is sort of apples and oranges to where we are with inverse. So we see it differently."

That includes line clearing to remove parts of trees that are adjacent to our facilities as well as removal of dead and dying trees. So the program involves year-round effort to identify these dead and dying trees through inspection processes where we use foot and aerial patrols; we use LiDAR, which is light, detecting and ranging technology, to identify the trees that need to be worked. We inspect all of our overhead lines every year, and we do second patrols in high fire danger areas at least twice a year. In some areas, we do as often as 4x a year. So it's a very aggressive program. There are specific requirements around line clearing, and it depends upon the voltage of the lines.

This morning, I will update you on what we currently know about the fi",1519,"Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Given the recent wildfires impacting our customers and communities, our discussion today will be different from our usual earnings call. 
This morning, I will update you on what we currently know about the fires and I'll describe our restoration activities. I will address the efforts to identify the causes of the fires and provide an overview of the process from here. I'll also talk about how we're working to protect the safety of our customers and communities as we see this trend toward more extreme weather events continuing to increase. Jason will walk you through the financials of the quarter, and then I'll provide a few closing remarks, and then we'll take your questions. 
I want to start by sharing what we know about the extraordinary nature of the fires that swept across Northern California a few weeks ago. 
On October 8th and 9th, PG&E service area experienced a wind event without precedent with some recorded wind gust exceeding 75 miles per hour. Numerous meteorologists have addressed the extraordinary nature of the weather condition, with one commenting that it produced extreme winds beyond contemporary experience. These destructive winds impacted an area with trees weakened by years of drought and other environmental factors.
Additionally, heavy rain and snow storms last winter brought renewed vegetation growth. But with the heat waves of the summer and fall, this vegetation dried out again, creating an abundant source of fuel. 
Several wildfires struck at night and spread quickly and they burned for days. Before the fires were fully contained, I met with community leaders and our team members in Napa and Santa Rosa, 2 of the hardest hit areas, and I had an opportunity to see the damage. 
What I can sell you is during my 2 decades in Florida, I worked through many major hurricanes, and I've seen firsthand the destruction that hurricane force winds can bring to a community, but this was like nothing I've ever seen. The fast-moving fires brought expansive devastation and left little standing in their path. Many communities and families experienced catastrophic losses. Numerous lives were lost and several thousand people lost homes and businesses. 
The people impacted are our neighbors, our friends and family, our own employees and, of course, our customers. And I want to extend our deepest sympathies to all of them. I also want to acknowledge the thousands of firefighters involved in the response and recovery efforts. I thank them and other first responders, including our own, for their heroic efforts. From the earliest hours, we maintained a singular focus on the life, safety, and well-being of our customers and communities. Our public safety actions included proactively turning off gas in some areas to support the efforts of first responders and keep our communities safe. 
In terms of outages, about 42,000 gas customers and about 360,000 electric customers were impacted by the wildfires. We assembled a restoration team 4,300 strong made up of our own employees, contractors, and mutual-aid utility workers. They worked around the clock for weeks to get our customers safely back online, following, of course, CAL FIRE's lead after they established containment boundaries. 
As part of our restoration efforts, we provided backup fuel and generation support to critical services like hospitals and local water agencies until they could be permanently restored. And our customer service team, they staffed evacuation shelters and local assistance centers to provide support to our customers in both English and Spanish. This was the largest restoration team we've put together since the Loma Prieta earthquake in 1989, and they did an outstanding job. 
Now I know there's a lot of interest in how these fires started and in how PG&E assets might have been involved in or impacted by the wildfires. Our communities deserve answers and we are committed to learning what happened. It's critical that we identify anything that will help us to keep our customers and communities safe in the future. That is our goal as we work with CAL FIRE and the CPUC. 
Both agencies are conducting investigations of the wildfires, and we will continue to cooperate with them as that work moves forward. As has been reported in the press, we have received a number of losses and are, of course, conducting our own extensive fact-finding in this important matter as we prepare to respond. 
As we've previously reported, when we gained access to some affected areas, we found instances of wires down, vegetation near our facilities and some broken poles. In those instances where CAL FIRE investigators or PG&E identified a site potentially involving our facilities, we submitted incident reports to the CPUC. These electric incident reports are factual in nature and do not reflect a finding of cause. To date, we've submitted 20 reports. 
As part of our commitment to transparency, we have posted the submitted incident reports on our website following the CPUC's decision to do the same. We expect that once CAL FIRE completes its investigation on the causes of the fires, it will release its findings through one or more reports. 
And given the complexity and size of the fires, we don't know when CAL FIRE may issue its findings. In the meantime, we will continue to cooperate with investigators and regulators, while keeping our team focused on providing safe, reliable energy to our customers and communities. 
Many of you have reached out with questions about the potential impact of the wildfires to the company's financials and also about the doctrine of inverse condemnation in California. At this time, the known financial impact of the wildfires is limited to the cost of the unprecedented response and restoration efforts, costs related to our liability insurance and some legal expenses, and Jason will cover these later this morning. 
As a reminder, California is an outlier when it comes to potential liability. California is one of the only states in the country where the courts have applied inverse condemnation liability to events caused by utility equipment. This means that if a utility's equipment is found to have been a substantial cause of a damage in the event like a wildfire, even if a utility has followed all the rules and, in essence, has not done anything wrong, the utility may be liable for property damages and attorneys’ fees associated with that event. 
We don't believe that inverse condemnation is an appropriate doctrine nor do we think it is appropriately applied to regulated utilities. We would challenge its application if that would be the case in these events. However, if it is applied, then the CPUC should take action that is consistent with the purpose of the doctrine. 
That said, I want to be clear. This was an extraordinary confluence of events and right now, it's simply too early to make an assumption about liability. What we can say with certainty is that PG&E is going to be crucial to the rebuilding and recovery in the communities affected, and we are committed to supporting that process. We've pledged more than $3 million to help support the community's recovery efforts, and we are matching our employees' charitable contributions for wildfire relief. Employees from across the company have stepped up to volunteer their time to support the affected communities, and we'll be doing much more in the weeks and the months ahead. 
I know there's a lot of interest in our pole maintenance and vegetation management programs, so let me address these as well. First, we routinely inspect, maintain and replace our electric poles. This includes annual scheduled patrols, 5-year visual inspections, an intrusive testing and treating on our wood poles on a frequency that significantly exceeds CPUC requirements. 
We also have one of, if not, the most comprehensive vegetation management programs in the country. Our vegetation management program manages about 123 million trees across the service territory. And every year, we inspect every segment of the 99,000 miles of overhead line and we clear vegetation as needed. This is well beyond what is typical in our industry where most utilities have a 3-year vegetation management cycle or sometimes longer. Typically, we spend about $200 million every year to line clear or remove 1.3 million trees to mitigate both the risk of wildfires and to prevent electric outages. With the drought and the tree mortality crisis we've experienced in California, we have been expanding our vegetation management work since 2014. 
In 2016, we spent an additional $200 million, essentially doubling our typical vegetation management spending last year. We've removed an incremental 236,000 dead or dying trees, and we enhanced our tree maintenance work with additional patrols in areas of high fire danger, including a combination of boots on the ground, aerial patrols, and sophisticated LiDAR technology. 
Before I transition to Jason, let me say we know that this is a very difficult time for our customers and the communities impacted by these terrible wildfires. We're committed to their safety and well-being, and we're going to stand by them as they rebuild and recover. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Jason to take you through the financials."

We appreciate the concerns many of you have expressed, following the wildfires. And I want to reiterate our commitment to transparency as we gather additional information about the financial impact of these events. This morning, I'll cover our third quarter results and then provide a couple of updates to our guidance for 2017. I will also briefly touch on some known items for 2018 and 2019. 
Slide 5 shows our results for the third quarter. Earnings from operations came in at $1.12 per share. GAAP earnings, including the items impacting comparability, are also shown here. Pipeline-related expenses were $20 million pretax. Our legal and regulatory-related expenses came in at $2 million pretax. Fines and penalties were $11 million, reflects the incremental financial remedies in the proposed decision for the ex parte order instituting an investigation, and that amount is not tax deductible. 
For the Butte fire, we had a few changes this quarter. We recorded third-party claims and legal costs of $368 million pretax. This was partially offset by accrued insurance recoveries of $297 million pretax. This total also includes $21 million recovered through one of our contractors' insurers. We have now recorded insurance recoveries up to the limit of our policy of $922 million. The net impact of these items is $71 million pretax. 
Finally, as we mentioned last quarter, in July, the court approved the shareholder derivative settlement. The pretax $65 million shown here reflects the $90 million in insurance proceeds less $25 million paid in plaintiff's legal fees. 
Moving on to Slide 6, which shows the quarter-over-quarter comparison from earnings from operations of $0.94 in Q3 last year and $1.12 in Q3 this year. We were $0.08 favorable due to the timing of taxes. The full amount of this line item affecting our results year-to-date will reverse in the fourth quarter. We were another $0.06 favorable due to the timing of operational spend during the year. We took the opportunity to bundle some of our work to execute more efficiently, which created some delays. We expect this to fully reverse in the fourth quarter. 
Rate base earnings were $0.05. You can expect to see rate base earnings of about $0.05 next quarter as well for a total of $0.20 for the full year. We were $0.04 favorable due to the timing of the 2015 GT&S rate case decision, which we received in August of last year. The year-to-date favorable variance of roughly $0.33 will fully reverse in the fourth quarter. 
A number of small miscellaneous items totaled $0.07 positive. As we mentioned previously, our GRC revenues were adjusted in 2017, resulting in a loss of the incremental tax repair benefits of roughly $0.25 annually, including $0.10 this quarter. Lastly, we had $0.02 negative for the issuance of shares. 
Transitioning now to Slide 7. Today, we are reaffirming our guidance from earnings from operations of $3.55 to $3.75 per share. 
On Slide 8. We've laid out our underlying assumptions for that guidance. Let me be clear that the guidance outlined here and all of my remarks today assume no material financial impact on the wildfires beyond the restoration cost, insurance reinstatement and legal expenses that will impact the 2017 results. 
Our current forecast estimate for costs related to restoration and repairs following the recent fires ranges from $160 million to $200 million. This includes an estimated $60 million to $80 million in capital. We expect to seek recovery for our restoration activities for this extraordinary event through our existing Catastrophic Event Memorandum Account process of the CPUC. I'll reiterate that it remains our objective to our CPUC-authorized return on equity across the enterprise this year as well as in 2018 and 2019. 
In terms of additional guidance for 2018 and beyond, we intend to provide an update with our 2017 results on the fourth quarter call. Among other considerations, our forward-looking guidance will integrate the 2019 GT&S rate case, which we will file at the end of this year as required by the CPUC. 
The 2015 GT&S rate case includes multi-year plans for improving the safety of our gas system, including programs to replace segments of our pipelines and to redesign other segments to facilitate in-line inspections. The 2019 rate case application will include a continuation of those plans as well as work to comply with new regulation established to help prevent methane leaks from gas storage facilities. 
Turning to Slide 9. There are a few changes to our items impacting comparability in 2017. We've removed the range for pipeline-related expenses for the year. We estimate it will incur about $90 million pretax to remove vegetation and structures from our pipeline rights-of-way. As we near the completion of our pipeline rights-of-way program, we are working through some particular complex segments. The environmental permitting requirements of these geographically dispersed projects require additional planning, which will shift more of the cost into 2018. You can expect us to spend between $35 million and $60 million on this item next year. 
We expect the total cost of this multi-year program to come in between $450 million and $475 million, which reflects a narrow range. The line items for both legal and regulatory-related expenses and for fines and penalties reflect cost incurred through the third quarter. Butte fire-related costs, net of insurance, reflect amounts recorded through the third quarter for third-party claims and legal cost, net of accrued insurance recoveries. 
We increased our accrual for third-party claims by $350 million, which means we now believe our liability to be at least $1.1 billion. This change reflects a number of additional claims that were filed during the quarter before a statute of limitations expires as well as our experience with resolving cases to date. We plan to seek recovery of all insured losses up to the $922 million limit of our liability insurance, and we have now recorded that full amount for probable insurance recoveries as of Q3. 
To the extent our ultimate liability for Butte fire claims exceeds the amounts recoverable through our insurance or through our contractors' insurance, we would expect to seek CPUC's authorization to recover excess amounts from our customers, consistent with the state's policy of inverse condemnation. 
And an additional note on insurance. Following the recent Northern California wildfires, we reinstated our insurance policy for any potential future events. That will result in a fourth quarter charge related to the write-off of the remaining unamortized cost of the original policy. Including both the insurance cost and legal expenses, we expect the wildfire-related cost of roughly $100 million in 2017. 
And finally, the shareholder derivative line reflects the net benefit I discussed in the quarterly results. 
Moving now to Slide 10. We are reaffirming our equity guidance for the year at $400 million to $500 million. And we continue to believe that we'll be able to meet our equity needs in 2018 and 2019, largely through our internal programs. It does not assume no material impact from the wildfires. 
On Slide 11, you can see we've reduced our CapEx for 2017 to $5.7 billion from $5.9 billion we previously provided. We've also increased our planned CapEx in 2018 from $6.1 billion to $6.3 billion. This is because we continue to see a shift of some of our capital work into next year, mostly in gas transmission and distribution where we have continued to look for opportunities to bundle some of that work to execute it more efficiently. 
In 2019 and beyond, we'll incorporate the capital spend for our gas transmission and storage rate case. So our final numbers will be included in our application, we expect the average CapEx impact to be on the order of roughly $900 million to $1 billion per year. 
On Slide 12, our 2018 rate base is lower as we've removed roughly $400 million associated with capital expenditures we incurred above the authorized amounts in the 2011 through 2014 GT&S rate case period. Those expenditures are subject to audit. We've moved that rate base into 2019 because the CPUC's audit of that spending is still underway. However, we continue to pursue recovery of these expenditures. We are reaffirming our commitment to the dividend and our plan to reach a dividend payout ratio of approximately 60% by 2019. Again, that assumes no material impact from the wildfires. 
And now I'll turn it back over to Geisha for some final remarks."

I know we've gone through a lot of information this morning and before we go to questions, I want to briefly emphasize a few important points. I want to say again, regardless of the cause of the fires, we at PG&E are committed to supporting our customers and the communities we serve as they rebuild and recover. We've recognized that it's a privilege to serve them, and we will be here for them for the long haul. 
On the topic of liability, as we've said, it's premature to discuss any potential liability for the recent wildfires, given that there has been no determination of the causes of any of the fires. However, it's clear that liability is a matter of important public policy, and California's inverse condemnation policy makes it an outlier on this issue. That represents a risk for the state and for all Californians as well as for the state's energy providers at a time when the state is increasing its investment in a bold, clean energy future. We need constructive solutions, and we're prepared to engage in that discussion with policymakers at the appropriate time. 
Now as we look ahead, we continue to focus on the areas we've discussed on our recent calls. First, operational excellence with safety is our top priority. On that note, I'm very pleased that the Institute of Nuclear Power Operators has validated our progress and praised our safety and operational performance of Diablo Canyon. 
Second, delivering a positive customer experience to ensure that we are the provider of choice for our customers. Despite a record-setting year of emergencies and severe weather, our customer satisfaction results show continued progress. 
And finally, positioning the company for long-term success. We continue to see a future defined by a much more complex grid that enables the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions consistent with the safe energy goals and is more resilient to extreme weather conditions, and PG&E is going to continue to play a vital role. 
To that end, over the last several years, 5 years, we've invested roughly $15 billion on our grid to develop a more flexible and resilient energy network. And our investments of around $6 billion in our electric grid over the next 2 years will continue to make that future a reality. And you have our commitment that we will remain focused on the fundamentals of our business as we go forward. 
With that, let's go to your questions."

So as Geisha mentioned, we have a very aggressive vegetation management program across our 70,000-mile -- square mile territory. We manage about 123 million trees that are near and adjacent to our facilities. And over the last 2 years, we've doubled the amount that we've invested in veg management. That includes line clearing to remove parts of trees that are adjacent to our facilities as well as removal of dead and dying trees. So the program involves year-round effort to identify these dead and dying trees through inspection processes where we use foot and aerial patrols; we use LiDAR, which is light, detecting and ranging technology, to identify the trees that need to be worked. We inspect all of our overhead lines every year, and we do second patrols in high fire danger areas at least twice a year. In some areas, we do as often as 4x a year. So it's a very aggressive program. There are specific requirements around line clearing, and it depends upon the voltage of the lines. And it can range up to feet to as much a sort of 18 inches away from the facility. So there are all sorts of different requirements, depending upon where the facilities are located and the voltage of the facilities."
