And as an introduction, I'd like to say that I'm very pleased with this first quarterly results and that I am particularly impressed with the progress and the speed of the integration since the creation of TechnipFMC on January 16. The combined businesses were fully operational on day one, thanks to very detailed preparation and planning prior to closing. In addition, there is no doubt that the creation of TechnipFMC occurred at the right time. Our customers are showing great interest in integrated solutions that only companies with a broad portfolio like TechnipFMC can offer. I will let Doug and Maryann talk about the market and about our first quarter results. But before I do that, I have a special message to our shareholders, clients, partners, employees and to the financial community. On January 17, Doug Pferdehirt became the CEO of TechnipFMC and I became Executive Chairman. Therefore, this earnings callable be my last one. Doug and I and our great teams have created a very unique company, TechnipFMC. I have known Doug for more than 20 years, and he has all my confidence and respect. We are now working together, engaging with customers, reviewing projects and visiting sites of important projects around the world and have turned around the clock. We are also building the future, focusing on customers, targeting the right project in a market that remain challenging but in which we know how to differentiate ourselves. 
On a lighter note, sorry, on a lighter note, I don't believe much in coincidence. But today, 27th of April is actually the tenth anniversary of my career at TechnipFMC. In effect, I became Chairman and CEO of TechnipFMC at the Annual Meeting exactly 10 years ago. It has been an incredible journey, and it's not finished. So I wanted to thank all investment community for the confidence but also for challenging me all these years. 
With that, I will hand you over to Doug. Doug?"

I deeply appreciate your support, your friendship and your significant contributions that make TechnipFMC a success.

I deeply appreciate your support, your friendship and your significant contributions that make TechnipFMC a success. On today's call, I will give a brief overview of our operational results and then share my thoughts on the new company, market outlook and a few of our key value drivers. Maryann Mannen will then review our financial performance in more detail and discuss our outlook for 2017 before opening the call for questions.
I am pleased to announce a terrific start for our new company. We generated $3.4 billion in total company revenue. Order intake of $1.6 billion was reflective of lower oil and gas expenditures, and we ended the quarter with $16.1 billion in backlog. Our balance sheet remains strong. We have a net cash of $3.5 billion. And today, we are going to discuss how we intend to deploy a portion of our cash balances. 
Our segment results included $427 million of total EBITDA across Subsea, Onshore/Offshore and Surface Technologies. We delivered 17.3% EBITDA margins in Subsea. Onshore/Offshore EBITDA margins increased to 8.6% on strong project execution. And EBITDA margins increased to 14.5% for Surface Technologies. 
Moving beyond the financials, I want to talk more about what it really means for us to become one company. As TechnipFMC, we are now uniquely able to leverage our industry-leading, front-end engineering capabilities, our culture of innovation that is bringing to market next-generation solutions and our reputation of superior project management, all necessary to drive the change required to deliver real sustainable improvement and project economics. We are well-positioned from upstream through downstream, providing exposure to both short-cycle businesses and long-cycle businesses. And now our Subsea footprint extends throughout the entire water column, creating the opportunity set to drive for a step-change in project economics. We are confident of this unique and flexible offering will create significant additional value both on land and offshore, from concept to project delivery and beyond for both our clients and shareholders alike. The foundation of our success lies within our over 40,000 employees who are driven by a mindset of challenging convention and leveraging our broad expertise and R&D capabilities, which encompasses a comprehensive technology opportunity set within TechnipFMC, allowing us to maintain a competitive advantage. 
Turning to the market. The recovery in oil prices has fueled the resurgence in North American land activity. Our North American surface technology activity has shown the greatest near-term improvement. We believe that a further increase in the recount, coupled with additional hydraulic fracturing fleet reactivations, will drive improved results in our North American business. In addition, we continue to benefit from the increased market acceptance of our integrated pad offering, which creates value for our customers through both technology and process improvement. We are now exploring ways to extend or further integrate our offering by leveraging the project management and EPC capabilities within our new company. 
Activity in our international Surface Technologies business remains generally stable, although pricing headwinds experienced in 2016 are impacting near-term results. Onshore activity continues to provide the most diverse opportunity set, driven by natural gas, refining and petrochemical projects. We are actively engaged in and pursuing several front-end engineering service, which will provide the platform for early engagement, which can significantly derisk project execution. 
We also continue to experience market acceptance of our project management consulting business, a mostly reimbursable activity, driven by our industry-recognized expertise and track record. 
Globally, fleet activity in both LNG and petrochemicals is fueled by the potential for sustained, modest natural gas pricing. These results -- this represents an important opportunity set for TechnipFMC by leveraging our process and technology portfolio and our proven track record. We are tracking several significant onshore projects in the Middle East, Africa and Asia markets both in LNG and refining. We continue to closely monitor [indiscernible] floating LNG in both the MIDOR and BAPCo refinery expansion projects. 
Moving to Subsea. We can see that the industry's efforts are having a significant impact on project economics with a clear downward trend in project breakeven levels. Recent analysis indicates the breakeven levels have fallen more than 30% since 2014. We believe that most operators have projects to move forward to current oil prices, with some notable projects having been publicly identified as viable even below $40 breakeven. This is increasing the competitiveness of deepwater assets versus unconventional plays. We are confident our integrated model and continuous innovation will allow us to further this downward trend, helping unlock additional offshore projects. 
Our end-to-end capability now translates into the complete subsea package from wellhead to topside. Using this broader definition of scope, we have identified 19 Subsea projects over the next 24 months that are in various stages of active discussion, each having a potential value that exceeds $250 million. In addition to the project shown here, our partners focus on shorter cycle, less capital-intensive Subsea tiebacks remains robust. Since the time of our last earnings call, we have remained confident that 2017 will represent the inflection in inbound order activity. 
Last month, we announced the award of the [indiscernible] development in the Gulf of Mexico, our third integrated EPCI award, demonstrating the success of the unique fully integrated model. Working with our long-term partner Shell, we significantly simplified the field architecture and equipment packages while accelerating time to first oil. KT serves as further confirmation of market acceptance of our unique offering. We continue to expect that the current pace of integrated FEED studies will lead to direct project awards in the future, expanding both the customer base and geographical footprint for integrated projects. And as another sign that we have seen the inflection in Subsea order activity, we are excited about a recently announced award for the Subsea production system for the ExxonMobil [indiscernible] project. This award also serves as further endorsement of one of our newest technologies, the compact manifold, which will be deployed on this project, creating significant value. While we remain focused on our client success, we continue to look for additional ways to create value for our shareholders. We are focused on delivering synergies and capital allocation that we believe will generate improved financial returns, delivering further value to our shareholders. Our value drivers are focused on 4 key areas: cost synergies, revenue synergies, tax synergies and capital allocation. We have a series of actions in place around each that we believe will be delivered at least 300 basis points of incremental returns by 2019. Importantly, these internal initiatives are largely within our control and not predicated on a market recovery. The most significant component of this plan is our cost synergies. We expect these savings will represent as much as 1/2 of the targeted improvement. We have already taken actions that will remove $40 million of cost from the combined company. We remain confident that we will realize the full $400 million of targeted synergies in our 2019 results. 
Revenue synergies are also progressing well, and we continue to identify areas where we can achieve tangible synergies. Importantly, these benefits are incremental to any previously announced synergies. We're also realizing benefits from our new domicile. We have identified structural savings that we believe will result in a reduction in our normalized tax rate over the next several years. Given the current strength of the balance sheet, today, we're announcing a plan to return some of this capital to our shareholders. First, our Board of Directors has announced a $500 million share buyback authorization, and we are committed to completing this authorization by the end of 2018. Additionally, we are reaffirming our intent to make dividend distributions. We are planning for a quarterly dividend following our third quarter results, targeting an initial dividend rate that will be sustainable through the business cycle while allowing for growth in the coming years. We are confident that this combination of value drivers can deliver incremental returns of at least 300 basis points by 2019. 
In closing, we are just over 3 months into our merger. Because our teams knew each other well, they have hit the ground running. The progress to date has been remarkable. The employee focus has been striking, both on day-to-day business and on capitalizing on the potential of the merger. We posted solid results in our first quarter earnings report. We have started to deliver some of the cost savings to the bottom line and have increased confidence in reaching the targeted savings. Project execution remains a differentiation for TechnipFMC. And the market's enthusiastic adoption of both integrated FEED work and direct project awards for integrated EPCI is a trend we expect to accelerate. 
Finally, we see a clear path to improved financial returns, driven by a series of identified value drivers, including the shareholder distributions we announced today. We look forward to the future as we continue executing on our new strategy, driving change and unlocking the tremendous potential of TechnipFMC. I am confident in our ability due to the women and men of TechnipFMC who together provide the unparalleled ability and determination to drive the real change required in our industry. 
I will now turn the call over to Maryann."

Overall, our operational performance across our 3 segments was improved over prior-period pro forma result. While of revenue overall on the pro forma basis is below the prior year quarter, on an adjusted EBITDA basis, we saw overall margin improvement of 190 basis points over 2016 from our 3 operating segments. We reported net income of $191 million in the first quarter. Included in these quarterly results are the after-tax costs associated with our merger transaction and integration, our estimated purchase price accounting charges and some minor restructuring and other severance costs, totaling $140 million on an after-tax basis. Our first quarter diluted earnings per share from contact continuing operations was $0.71, when excluding these after tax charges were $0.30 per diluted share. The $194 million pretax impact of these charges in our reported results include purchase price accounting adjustment of $86 million for inventory step-up and other impacts, which will not be included in long-term amortization; and purchase price accounting adjustment of $43 million that are included in amortization expense associated with intangible assets, including the amortization of acquired backlog; merger transaction and integration cost of $55 million; and restructuring and other severance costs and impairment charges of $10 million. We reported $379.7 million of operating profit. When considering these charges of $194 million, our adjusted operating profit was $573.2 million. We have provided a schedule in our release filed last evening, which reconciles the reported result to adjusted operating profit. 
We will have additional charges in 2017 as we complete our restructuring efforts and integration activities. We'll continue to report them accordingly. We reported $154 million of depreciation and amortization expense, which includes $43 million in amortization-related purchase price accounting adjustment. When these somatization-related charges and credits are excluded, the adjusted EBITDA was $684.4 million. Our purchase price adjustment charges recorded in the first quarter are based upon a significant field to fair value analysis completed today. We expect to complete our analysis in the coming months. These preliminary purchase price accounting adjustments related to the merger were noncash charges. Also included in our quarterly result is a foreign exchange gain of $307 million reported in corporate income and expense net. This resulted largely due to the exchange rate of the Russian ruble to the U.S. dollar. We apply a natural hedge approach for the measurement of these gains or losses. It is possible that we will record gains or losses in future periods. 
In the fourth quarter of 2016, we increased our ownership stake in the Yamal joint venture and we now hold the controlling stake. This change does impact comparability of the current financial results to prior periods. All of the joint venture revenues and operating profit are recorded in the Onshore/Offshore segment result. Our partner share of profitability is recorded as a future liability with periodic impact recorded in net interest expense. We have constructed the pro forma 2016 results as if the company had maintained same controlling stake throughout 2016 to make quarter-over-quarter comparisons more meaningful. 
Moving to segment results. Subsea reported $1.4 billion in the period. On a pro forma basis, quarter-over-quarter revenue comparisons were negatively impacted by lower project activity due to reduced inbound in previous years, resulting in a lower project backlog coming into the current year. Adjusted Subsea EBITDA was $239 million in the quarter with a margin of 17.3% when excluding charges of $97 million. Segment backlog exiting this quarter was $6.6 billion, which compares to prior year backlog of $7 billion. 
Moving to our Onshore/Offshore results. Onshore/Offshore revenues for the quarter were $1.8 billion, down 19% on a pro forma basis quarter-over-quarter. Revenues were lower as a result of lower project activity, most notably in the Middle East and Americas. Onshore/Offshore adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was $152 million with margins of 8.6%. The period benefited from strong project execution and the achievement of key project construction milestone. EBITDA margins improved 390 basis points from prior year quarter.  Segment backlog exiting the quarter stands at $9.1 billion, which compares to the prior year backlog of $9.4 billion. 
Moving to our Surface Technologies result. Revenue for the quarter was $248 million, about 29% below prior year on a pro forma basis due to lower activity in North America -- in our North America business and the impact of pricing on the international business. Surface Technologies adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $36 million when excluding restructuring and purchase price accounting charges of $46 million. EBITDA margins, excluding charges, increased from 8.3% to 14.5%, primarily driven by our lower-cost structure and the beginning of the recovery in the pressure pumping business. Our surface international business began recognizing some lower-priced backlog that was booked during 2016. While pricing has began to stabilize, we have yet to see a pricing recovery in these international markets. Pro forma operating results in our North American business have begun to improve from the bottom following late 2016. Daily orders from pressure pumping activity has significantly increased as customer demand has increased due to fleet reactivation. 
Let's turn to the corporate items. Corporate adjusted operating profit in the quarter was $255 million when excluding charges and credit of $51 million. Included in the quarter were net gains of $307 million, mainly due to foreign exchange gain previously discussed. Net interest expense was an expense of $82 million in the quarter, which includes the charge of $58 million due to the remeasurement of a liability payable to joint venture partners. Our first quarter tax rate of 28.44% [ph] when excluding the effects of liability remeasurement within net interest expense, which received no tax benefit. Capital spending this quarter was $51 million. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $154 million. Of the total, $43 million was related to purchase price accounting for the merger and was included in total charges and credit. We will continue to identify D&A related to purchase price accounting as such in future periods. At the end of the first quarter, we had net cash of $3.5 billion. It is comprised of $7 billion of cash and $3.5 billion of debt. 
Looking forward. Full year revenue for Subsea is expected to be at least $6.1 billion. We could see further improvements of this revenue subject to the timing of our project award inbound and backlog project timing. We expect to deliver EBITDA margins, excluding charges, of at least 17% for the full year 2017. 
Looking at the Onshore/Offshore business. Full year revenue is expected to be at least $7.3 billion. we anticipate that with continued strength in project execution, EBITDA margins, excluding charges, should exceed 6.5% for the full year in 2017. 
In Surface Technologies, revenue is expected to be at least $1.4 billion. [ph] The North America recovery is well underway, and we are seeing the greatest impact in our business. Customer acceptance of our integrated surface offering should also deliver incremental sales in the year. However, improved revenues in North America will see some offset from the international segment, driven largely by the effects of more competitive pricing. In Surface Technologies, we currently expect to realize EBITDA margins, excluding charges, of at least 13% for the full year in 2017. As Doug said, we remain on track to deliver at least $400 million of pretax synergies. As a reminder, our objective is to deliver run rate savings of $200 million by the end of the year and a full $400 million run rate by the end of 2018. For the savings postmerger are fully in line with our overall target. We have already taken action on $40 million of quick wins. These include corporate costs, real estate, as we have already combined many system leads where we shared same location footprint and other indirect costs. For the remaining quarters of 2017, we expect that corporate expense will be between $50 million and $55 million. The estimate for corporate expense remains subject to foreign currency fluctuation and the cash flow hedging. This is not included in our estimate. We're estimating that other merger and integration cost and restructuring costs would be approximately $150 million in the remaining 3 quarters of 2017. We will continue to identify these costs as we have this quarter. We estimate interest expense to be approximately $22 million to $25 million per quarter. We now anticipate our 2017 tax rate to be between 26% and 28% for the full year. One element of our return on invested capital objective is the benefit of a lower tax rate from our planned entity restructuring. Our domicile resulting from the completion of our cross-border merger gives us the ability to reduce the worldwide effective tax rate. We estimate that on a comparable set of earnings, we can initially realize at least 300 basis points of tax saving as our restructuring is completed by year-end. We now expect capital spending in 2017 to be approximately $300 million. 
In closing, the first quarter reflects our ability to drive strong financial returns while we continue to execute on our integrated strategy and realize synergies, as we have been communicating. We believe we are well positioned to capitalize on new market opportunities and stabilize our business through increasing margin -- market uncertainty. Our solid execution and our previous cost-reduction initiative as well as the opportunities we see for further product cost reduction and technology development are critical elements of our differentiated business model. We are encouraged by the level of project activity we are seeing, but we recognize the pace of order conversion continue to be challenging. We remain ready to respond in the market and manage our businesses to deliver improving return.

Phil, from a Subsea perspective, in terms of our order guidance, we've got largely about 75% of our revenues secured in backlog. And then you know there's a portion of that revenue that's recurring. They're more like service revenues, et cetera. So there's just a small portion of our 2017 revenue estimate today that is not matured. So we feel very confident in the at least $6.1 billion with respect to Subsea. Most of the margin, obviously, in our backlog is solid. Our execution will continue. So for Subsea, not much that we need to see. On the Onshore/Offshore business, we've got probably 85-plus percent of the revenue included in our backlog to deliver those revenues. And as you can see from the quarter, our performance on the Onshore/Offshore segment from a margin perspective was very strong. So again, we think for those 2 segment, we've got the good portion of that for 2017 in hand. Surface, as you know, is a bit different. We've got a little over $400 million in backlog. That business will respond in North America, and we're pretty confident in the recovery there. But obviously, that's not in backlog, and we'll need to see that backlog continue -- or excuse me, that inbound continue throughout the next couple of quarters."

It is important to note in the first quarter, due to the resurgence of activity of fleet reactivations that we have heard reported for many of the pressure pumping companies, that is our shortest cycle business and we benefited significantly from that resurgence of activity. We may reactivate these frac fleet because of the extended downturn that we just experienced in the North American market, not only does the equipment being maintenanced and repaired, but in many cases, it was cannibalized for spare parts for other ongoing capacity that they had in their active fleet. So this has resulted in what would be similar to new capital orders for us versus just the normal level of maintenance, repairs, inspection and replacement of the high-pressure components of the hydraulic fracturing fleet. So we got that surge. We think that surge will continue into part of Q2 but then we'll go back to more normalized rate of revenue and margins in that particular business."

This Compact Manifold creates significant reduction in scope and allowed us to reduce the time and accelerate and help ExxonMobil to have confidence in the project delivery. For them, the most important driver or one of the most important drivers was schedule and schedule certainty. This is a fast-track project, and by being able to bring new technology and other benefits that we've had due to our long-term collaboration with ExxonMobil, we were able to help them derisk the project.

And, yes, we certainly expect future awards of this nature. It's a very interesting question because it's not just the Compact Manifold. It's the entire subsea production system. In the past, equipment providers didn't think about installability. Installability wasn't their scope. They weren't rewarded for thinking about -- commercially rewarded for thinking about installability, so often the structures that were billed lead to very difficult and costly installation campaigns. As one company and the only company that now has the entire water column and installation under one roof, we think very differently. And we now understand that there are significant changes that we can make to the subsea architecture that will allow the installation to be done in a much more efficient manner and will be able to be done off a few more diverse vessel platform.

And I think you know from our past experience that we have a strong position in that business. Therefore, we would naturally get the very first orders. It's the best product in the market, and we saw that flash order of activity. There's been an enormous amount of hydraulic horsepower reactivations that have been going on. And remember, we're placing -- when we're taking orders, some of them are booking very quickly. Some of them may be up to 90 days out. So when you think about what you're hearing about some of the fleet reactivation's and when they expect to be completed by, which is you're hearing from the third quarter, that's why I'm just saying we'll expect those flash orders to go kind of through our system as we did in the first quarter and through the second quarter. But Rob, we will stabilize at a very high level of activity. It's not that we're not going to have a high level of activity. It's just we won't -- it's just like somebody ordering brand-new frac capacity from our perspective. From their perspective, there's other parts that are not new capital orders. But from our perspective, all of the high-pressure components of the frac system are basically being ordered as if it's a brand-new capital quarter. So logically, that can't continue. That has to stabilize at some point. But the level of activity given the amount of horsepower that will be active in the industry, that business will be at a very high level. So I'm not saying the whole business is going to come down. I'm just saying we'll see the majority of those flash orders come through the system in the first and second quarter."

Some would fit into the classification, as you're saying, world-class. But mania would be, I guess, in the middle tier because we don't have the tiebacks on that project listed 19 because we're talking about $250 million or more. Most of the tiebacks fall below that. I think it's a combination of the 2 things clearly. Our position, Rob, is we can help focus on project economics. And it's not just cost, it's also schedule. So things we can do like I described earlier, we're able to cut costs significantly on a large project or large greenfield project 9 to 15 months. On a small tieback, we can cut it 50% of the time. That's the advantage of having the relationships, of having the install base, of having the service infrastructure to be able to support it and now being able to offer it as one integrated package. The time to first oil is what ultimately drives the project economics on those projects. Clearly, they want to see commodity prices and have confidence in commodity prices. But you saw the breakeven numbers that we included in the presentation earlier today. We now collectively, as TechnipFMC, represent up to 1/3 of the deepwater development cost.

We are the only ones to put together an integrated offering that goes from the wellhead to the topside. So we have that unique capability to be able to look at how we design our equipment for installability, how we focus on serviceability, how we can leverage the industry's largest install base. We have over 2,000 subsea [indiscernible] operating. We have over 11,000 kilometers of flexible pipe out in the industry today. So there's an enormous platform that we can work from together now as one single company. When you're not together as a single entity and you don't have the same commercial incentive, matter of fact, you can argue that in the regular style, there's actually a disincentive to work together because of the commercial model. So it's just a very different offering than the other offerings that are in the market today. Some projects will continue to go forward in the traditional way where work packages will be split up in 2 ways or sometimes in many ways. Just one point I'd like to mention to your question. We actually won part of Leviathan. We won several of the packages. The Leviathan project was split into many packages. So we are one of the subsea providers on Leviathan. We are still bidding a package for BP Mad Dog. So when these projects are split up, because of the breadth of our company, we're likely to be involved in the project in one form or another. It may not be the traditional split between SURF and SPS. It may be split multiple components. And when it is, we'll continue to approach that. We'll remain flexible with our commercial offering. Ultimately, what we want to be able to provide to our customer is the very best solution. And if we can get involved early and work through an integrated FEED and convert that into an integrated EPCI, accelerate the time to first oil at the best project economics, we think we have a winning combination and the unique opportunity to do that. In other cases, we'll bid the package separately and individually if that's what the customers choose to do. And we'll bid the level that we think is in the best interest of our company and our shareholders, and that's what we'll do as well. But at the end of the day, what we bring to the market and what we bring to our customers is the widest range of commercial solutions that anybody has to offer. So we believe with the success and the proven success that we've had both on the FEED side now converting in an integrated EPCI as well as the continued success on the à la carte type approach that we're the best position to market, and we're really excited to have everybody together now working as one company."

So I want to broaden it just for a minute and talk a little bit -- a little broader about the portfolio of TechnipFMC. First of all, we had the leading, agnostic, front-end engineering capability under our Genesis group. On top of that, we have the front end and the FEED studies that we're doing on our On/Off business as well as in Subsea. And the only reason I wanted to back that up a little bit, Byron, is to really understand that the capacity and the competency that is now together in one organization. So we're doing quite a bit of FEED work on Onshore/Offshore. That's important because when we get in early on those projects, we can better understand the project and, quite frankly, what commercial model we want to use on the project to ensure that we derisk the project and ensure success both for our clients and ourselves. In terms of Subsea, yes, it continues to accelerate both integrated and nonintegrated FEED studies, but it's one of the reasons we have confidence. So it's a little bit like following drilling permits in the U.S. land business. When we see this level of FEED activity, not all convert, most certainly not all convert, but many of them do end up being sanctioned. In terms of versus the project list, I'm going to -- I'm not going to answer that directly just because, Byron, that's a significant competitive and unique competitive advantage that we have. But I will tell you that on that list of projects, there is integrated fEED activity going on. I certainly don't want to say how many or point to them. That's a significant competitive advantage of hours."

The combined businesses were fully operational on day one, thanks to very detailed preparation and planning prior to closing. In addition, there is no doubt that the creation of TechnipFMC occurred at the right time. Our customers are showing great interest in integrated solutions that only companies with a broad portfolio like TechnipFMC can offer. I will let Doug and Maryann talk about the market and about our first quarter results. But before I do that, I have a special message to our shareholders, clients, partners, employees and to the financial community. On January 17, Doug Pferdehirt became the CEO of TechnipFMC and I became Executive Chairman. Therefore, this earnings call will be my last one. Doug and I and our great teams have created a very unique company, TechnipFMC. I have known Doug for more than 20 years, and he has all my confidence and respect. We are now working together, engaging with customers, reviewing projects and visiting sites of important projects around the world and have turned around the clock. We are also building the future, focusing on customers, targeting the right project in a market that remain challenging but in which we know how to differentiate ourselves.
On a lighter note, sorry, on a lighter note, I don't believe much in coincidence. But today, 27th of April is actually the tenth anniversary of my career at TechnipFMC. In fact, I became Chairman and CEO of TechnipFMC at the Annual Meeting exactly 10 years ago. It has been an incredible journey, and it's not finished. So I wanted to thank all investment community for the confidence but also for challenging me all these years.
With that, I will hand you over to Doug. Doug?"

I deeply appreciate your support, your friendship and your significant contributions that make TechnipFMC a success. On today's call, I will give a brief overview of our operational result",1530,"Thank you, Thierry, and congratulations on this tenth anniversary. I deeply appreciate your support, your friendship and your significant contributions that make TechnipFMC a success. On today's call, I will give a brief overview of our operational results and then share my thoughts on the new company, market outlook and a few of our key value drivers. Maryann Mannen will then review our financial performance in more detail and discuss our outlook for 2017 before opening the call for questions.
I am pleased to announce a terrific start for our new company. We generated $3.4 billion in total company revenue. Order intake of $1.6 billion was reflective of lower oil and gas expenditures, and we ended the quarter with $16.1 billion in backlog. Our balance sheet remains strong. We have a net cash of $3.5 billion. And today, we are going to discuss how we intend to deploy a portion of our cash balances.
Our segment results included $427 million of total EBITDA across Subsea, Onshore/Offshore and Surface Technologies. We delivered 17.3% EBITDA margins in Subsea. Onshore/Offshore EBITDA margins increased to 8.6% on strong project execution. And EBITDA margins increased to 14.5% for Surface Technologies.
Moving beyond the financials, I want to talk more about what it really means for us to become one company. As TechnipFMC, we are now uniquely able to leverage our industry-leading, front-end engineering capabilities, our culture of innovation that is bringing to market next-generation solutions and our reputation of superior project management, all necessary to drive the change required to deliver real sustainable improvement and project economics. We are well-positioned from upstream through downstream, providing exposure to both short-cycle businesses and long-cycle businesses. And now our Subsea footprint extends throughout the entire water column, creating the opportunity set to drive a step-change in project economics. We are confident this unique and flexible offering will create significant additional value both on land and offshore, from concept to project delivery and beyond for both our clients and shareholders alike. The foundation of our success lies within our over 40,000 employees who are driven by a mindset of challenging convention and leveraging our broad expertise and R&D capabilities, which encompasses a comprehensive technology opportunity set within TechnipFMC, allowing us to maintain a competitive advantage.
Turning to the market. The recovery in oil prices has fueled the resurgence in North American land activity. Our North American surface technology activity has shown the greatest near-term improvement. We believe that a further increase in the rig count, coupled with additional hydraulic fracturing fleet reactivations, will drive improved results in our North American business. In addition, we continue to benefit from the increased market acceptance of our integrated pad offering, which creates value for our customers through both technology and process improvement. We are now exploring ways to extend or further integrate our offering by leveraging the project management and EPC capabilities within our new company.
Activity in our international Surface Technologies business remains generally stable, although pricing headwinds experienced in 2016 are impacting near-term results. Onshore activity continues to provide the most diverse opportunity set, driven by natural gas, refining and petrochemical projects. We are actively engaged in and pursuing several front-end engineering studies, which provide the platform for early engagement, which can significantly derisk project execution.
We also continue to experience market acceptance of our project management consulting business, a mostly reimbursable activity, driven by our industry-recognized expertise and track record.
Globally, fleet activity in both LNG and petrochemicals is fueled by the potential for sustained, modest natural gas pricing. These results -- this represents an important opportunity set for TechnipFMC by leveraging our process and technologies portfolio and our proven track record. We are tracking several significant onshore projects in the Middle East, Africa and Asia markets both in LNG and refining. We continue to closely monitor ENI Coral floating LNG in both the MIDOR and BAPCO refinery expansion projects.
Moving to Subsea. We can see that the industry's efforts are having a significant impact on project economics with a clear downward trend in project breakeven levels. Recent analysis indicates the breakeven levels have fallen more than 30% since 2014. We believe that most operators have projects in move forward to current oil prices, with some notable projects having been publicly identified as viable even below $40 breakeven. This is increasing the competitiveness of deepwater assets versus unconventional plays. We are confident our integrated model and continuous innovation will allow us to further this downward trend, helping unlock additional offshore projects.
Our end-to-end capability now translates into the complete subsea package from wellhead to topside. Using this broader definition of scope, we have identified 19 Subsea projects over the next 24 months that are in various stages of active discussion, each having a potential value that exceeds $250 million. In addition to the project shown here, our partners focus on shorter cycle, less capital-intensive Subsea tiebacks remains robust. Since the time of our last earnings call, we have remained confident that 2017 will represent the inflection in inbound order activity.
Last month, we announced the award of the show [indiscernible] development in the Gulf of Mexico, our third integrated EPCI award, demonstrating the success of this unique fully integrated model. Working with our long-term partner Shell, we significantly simplified the field architecture and equipment packages while accelerating time to first oil. [indiscernible] has serves its further confirmation of market acceptance of our unique offering. We continue to expect that the current pace of integrated FEED studies will lead to direct project awards in the future, expanding both the customer base and geographical footprint for integrated projects. And as another sign that we have seen the inflection in Subsea order activity, we are excited about a recently announced award for the Subsea production system for the ExxonMobil Liza project. This award also serves as further endorsement of one of our newest technologies, the compact manifold, which will be deployed on this project, creating significant value. While we remain focused on our client success, we continue to look for additional ways to create value for our shareholders. We are focused on delivering synergies and capital allocation that we believe will generate improved financial returns, delivering further value to our shareholders. Our value drivers are focused on 4 key areas: cost synergies, revenue synergies, tax synergies and capital allocation. We have a series of actions in place around each that we believe will deliver at least 300 basis points of incremental returns by 2019. Importantly, these internal initiatives are largely within our control and not predicated on a market recovery. The most significant component of this plan is our cost synergies. We expect these savings will represent as much as 1/2 of the targeted improvement. We have already taken actions that will remove $40 million of cost from the combined company. We remain confident that we will realize the full $400 million of targeted synergies in our 2019 results.
Revenue synergies are also progressing well, and we continue to identify areas where we can achieve tangible synergies. Importantly, these benefits are incremental to any previously announced synergies. We're also realizing benefits from our new domicile. We have identified structural savings that we believe will result in a reduction in our normalized tax rate over the next several years. Given the current strength of the balance sheet, today, we're announcing a plan to return some of this capital to our shareholders. First, our Board of Directors has announced a $500 million share buyback authorization, and we are committed to completing this authorization by the end of 2018. Additionally, we are reaffirming our intent to make dividend distributions. We are planning for a quarterly dividend following our third quarter results, targeting an initial dividend rate that will be sustainable through the business cycle while allowing for growth in the coming years. We are confident that this combination of value drivers can deliver incremental returns of at least 300 basis points by 2019.
In closing, we are just over 3 months into our merger. Because our teams knew each other well, they have hit the ground running. The progress to date has been remarkable. The employee focus has been striking, both on day-to-day business and on capitalizing on the potential of the merger. We posted solid results in our first quarter earnings report. We have started to deliver some of the cost savings to the bottom line and have increased confidence in reaching the targeted savings. Project execution remains a differentiation for TechnipFMC. And the market's enthusiastic adoption of both integrated FEED work and direct project awards for integrated EPCI is a trend we expect to accelerate.
Finally, we see a clear path to improved financial returns, driven by a series of identified value drivers, including the shareholder distributions we announced today. We look forward to the future as we continue executing on our new strategy, driving change and unlocking the tremendous potential of TechnipFMC. I am confident in our ability due to the women and men of TechnipFMC who together provide the unparalleled ability and determination to drive the real change required in our industry.
I will now turn the call over to Maryann."

While revenue overall on the pro forma basis is below the p",1631,"Thanks, Doug. I am pleased to report the results of TechnipFMC's first quarter results. Overall, our operational performance across our 3 segments was improved over prior-period pro forma result. While revenue overall on the pro forma basis is below the prior year quarter, on an adjusted EBITDA basis, we saw overall margin improvement of 190 basis points over 2016 from our 3 operating segments. We reported net income of $191 million in the first quarter. Included in these quarterly results are the after-tax costs associated with our merger transaction and integration, our estimated purchase price accounting charges and some minor restructuring and other severance costs, totaling $140 million on an after-tax basis. Our first quarter diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.71, when excluding these after-tax charges were $0.30 per diluted share. The $194 million pretax impact of these charges in our reported results include purchase price accounting adjustment of $86 million for inventory step-up and other impacts, which will not be included in long-term amortization; and purchase price accounting adjustment of $43 million that are included in amortization expense associated with intangible assets, including the amortization of acquired backlog; merger transaction and integration cost of $55 million; and restructuring and other severance costs and impairment charges of $10 million. We reported $379.7 million of operating profit. When considering these charges of $194 million, our adjusted operating profit was $573.2 million. We have provided a schedule in our release filed last evening, which reconciles the reported result to adjusted operating profit.
We will have additional charges in 2017 as we complete our restructuring efforts and integration activities. We'll continue to report them accordingly. We reported $154 million of depreciation and amortization expense, which includes $43 million in amortization-related purchase price accounting adjustment. When these somatization-related charges and credits are excluded, the adjusted EBITDA was $684.4 million. Our purchase price adjustment charges recorded in the first quarter are based upon a significant field to fair value analysis completed today. We expect to complete our analysis in the coming months. These preliminary purchase price accounting adjustments related to the merger were noncash charges. Also included in our quarterly result is a foreign exchange gain of $307 million reported in corporate income and expense net. This resulted largely due to the exchange rate of the Russian ruble to the U.S. dollar. We apply a natural hedge approach for the measurement of these gains or losses. It is possible that we will record gains or losses in future periods.
In the fourth quarter of 2016, we increased our ownership stake in the Yamal joint venture and we now hold the controlling stake. This change does impact comparability of the current financial results to prior periods. All of the joint venture revenues and operating profit are recorded in the Onshore/Offshore segment results. Our partner share of profitability is recorded as a future liability with periodic impact recorded in net interest expense. We have constructed the pro forma 2016 results as if the company had maintained same controlling stake throughout 2016 to make quarter-over-quarter comparisons more meaningful.
Moving to segment results. Subsea reported $1.4 billion in the period. On a pro forma basis, quarter-over-quarter revenue comparisons were negatively impacted by lower project activity due to reduced inbound in previous years, resulting in a lower project backlog coming into the current year. Adjusted Subsea EBITDA was $239 million in the quarter with a margin of 17.3% when excluding charges of $97 million. Segment backlog exiting this quarter was $6.6 billion, which compares to prior year backlog of $7 billion.
Moving to our Onshore/Offshore results. Onshore/Offshore revenues for the quarter were $1.8 billion, down 19% on a pro forma basis quarter-over-quarter. Revenues were lower as a result of lower project activity, most notably in the Middle East and Americas. Onshore/Offshore adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was $152 million with margins of 8.6%. The period benefited from strong project execution and the achievement of key project construction milestone. EBITDA margins improved 390 basis points from prior year quarter. Segment backlog exiting the quarter stands at $9.1 billion, which compares to the prior year backlog of $9.4 billion.
Moving to our Surface Technologies result. Revenue for the quarter was $248 million, about 29% below prior year on a pro forma basis due to lower activity in North America -- in our North America business and the impact of pricing on the international business. Surface Technologies adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $36 million when excluding restructuring and purchase price accounting charges of $46 million. EBITDA margins, excluding charges, increased from 8.3% to 14.5%, primarily driven by our lower-cost structure and the beginning of the recovery in the pressure pumping business. Our surface international business began recognizing some lower-priced backlog that was booked during 2016. While pricing has began to stabilize, we have yet to see a pricing recovery in these international markets. Pro forma operating results in our North American business have begun to improve from the bottom following late 2016. Daily orders from pressure pumping activity has significantly increased as customer demand has increased due to fleet reactivation.
Let's turn to the corporate items. Corporate adjusted operating profit in the quarter was $255 million when excluding charges and credit for $51 million. Included in the quarter were net gains of $307 million, mainly due to foreign exchange gain previously discussed. Net interest expense was an expense of $82 million in the quarter, which includes the charge of $58 million due to the remeasurement of a liability payable to joint venture partners. Our first quarter tax rate of 28.4% when excluding the effects of liability remeasurement within net interest expense, which received no tax benefit. Capital spending this quarter was $51 million. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $154 million. Of the total, $43 million was related to purchase price accounting for the merger and was included in total charges and credit. We will continue to identify D&A related to purchase price accounting as such in future periods. At the end of the first quarter, we had net cash of $3.5 billion. It is comprised of $7 billion of cash and $3.5 billion of debt.
Looking forward. Full year revenue for Subsea is expected to be at least $6.1 billion. We could see further improvements of this revenue subject to the timing of our project award inbound and backlog project timing. We expect to deliver EBITDA margins, excluding charges, of at least to 17% for the full year 2017.
Looking at the Onshore/Offshore business. Full year revenue is expected to be at least $7.3 billion. We anticipate that with continued strength in project execution, EBITDA margins, excluding charges, should exceed 6.5% for the full year in 2017.
In Surface Technologies, revenue is expected to be at least $1.4 billion. The North America recovery is well underway, and we are seeing the greatest impact in our business. Customer acceptance of our integrated surface offering should also deliver incremental sales in the year. However, improved revenues in North America will see some offset from the international segment, driven largely by the effects of more competitive pricing. In Surface Technologies, we currently expect to realize EBITDA margins, excluding charges, of at least 13% for the full year in 2017. As Doug said, we remain on track to deliver at least $400 million of pretax synergies. As a reminder, our objective is to deliver run rate savings of $200 million by the end of the year and a full $400 million run rate by the end of 2018. For all these savings post to merger are fully in line with our overall targets. We have already taken action on $40 million of quick wins. These include corporate costs, real estate, as we have already combined many facilities where we shared same location footprint and other indirect cost. For the remaining quarters of 2017, we expect that corporate expense will be between $50 million and $55 million. The estimate for corporate expense remains subject to foreign currency fluctuation on the cash flow hedging. This is not included in our estimate. We're estimating that other merger and integration cost and restructuring costs will be approximately $150 million in the remaining 3 quarters of 2017. We will continue to identify these costs as we have this quarter. We estimate interest expense to be approximately $22 million to $25 million per quarter. We now anticipate our 2017 tax rate to be between 26% and 28% for the full year. One element of our return on invested capital objective is the benefit of a lower tax rate from our planned entity restructuring. Our domicile resulting from the completion of our cross-border merger gives us the ability to reduce the worldwide effective tax rate. We estimate that on a comparable set of earnings, we can initially realize at least 300 basis points of tax saving as our restructuring is completed by year-end. We now expect capital spending in 2017 to be approximately $300 million.
In closing, the first quarter reflects our ability to drive strong financial returns while we continue to execute on our integration strategy and realize synergies, as we have been communicating. We believe we are well positioned to capitalize on new market opportunities and stabilize our business through increasing margin if market uncertainty. Our solid execution and our previous cost-reduction initiative as well as the opportunities we see for further product cost reduction and technology development are critical elements of our differentiated business models. We are encouraged by the level of project activity we are seeing, but we recognize the pace of order conversion continues to be challenging. We remain ready to respond to the market and manage our businesses to deliver improving return.

Fill from a Subsea perspective, in terms of our order guidance, we've got largely about 75% of our revenues secured in backlog. And then you know there's a portion of that revenue that's recurring. They're more like service revenues, et cetera. So there's just a small portion of our 2017 revenue estimate today that is not secured. So we feel very confident in the at least $6.1 billion with respect to Subsea. Most of the margin, obviously, in our backlog is solid. Our execution will continue. So for Subsea, not much that we need to see. On the Onshore/Offshore business, we've got probably 85-plus percent of the revenue included in our backlog to deliver those revenues. And as you can see from the quarter, our performance on the Onshore/Offshore segment from a margin perspective was very strong. So again, we think for those 2 segment, we've got the good portion of that for 2017 in hand. Surface, as you know, is a bit different. We've got a little over $400 million in backlog. That business will respond in North America, and we're pretty confident in the recovery there. But obviously, that's not in backlog, and we'll need to see that backlog continue -- or excuse me, that inbound continue throughout the next couple of quarters."

It is important to know in the first quarter, due to the resurgence of activity of fleet reactivations that we have heard reported for many of the pressure pumping companies, that is our shortest cycle business and we benefited significantly from that resurgence of activity. We may reactivate these frac fleet because of the extended downturn that we just experienced in the North American market, not only does the equipment being maintenance and repaired, but in many cases, it was cannibalized for spare parts, for other ongoing capacity that they had in their active fleet. So this has resulted in what would be similar to new capital orders for us versus just the normal level of maintenance, repairs, inspection and replacement of the high-pressure components of the hydraulic fracturing fleet. So we got that surge. We think that surge will continue into part of Q2 but then we'll go back to a more normalized rate of revenue and margins in that particular business."

Of those 19 projects, we would expect several of those to move forward in the next 12 months. In addition to those projects, by working closely and having the intimate relationship and the unique position that we have with our partners, we've been able to work with them to help identify short-cycle Subsea tieback opportunities. And then by leveraging the standard products across TechnipFMC and now the fully integrated capability, we can deliver the full Subsea tieback system installed on the seafloor in approximately 1/2 the time of the normal market. So if you put together a few large projects, in addition to the ones we've already announced, a robust Subsea tieback market and a continued resilience in our Subsea services business, net-net we would expect to step up in 2017 versus 2016."

And, yes, we certainly expect future awards of this nature. It's a very interesting question because it's not just the Compact Manifold. It's the entire subsea production system. In the past, equipment providers didn't think about installability. Installability  wasn't in their scope. They weren't rewarded for thinking about -- commercially rewarded for thinking about installability, so often the structures that were build lead to very difficult and costly installation campaigns. As one company and the only company that now has the entire water column and installation under one roof, we think very differently. And we now understand that there were significant changes that we can make to the subsea architecture that will allow the installation to be done in a much more efficient manner and will be able to be done off a more diverse vessel platform.

But Rob, we will stabilize at a very high level of activity. It's not that we're not going to have a high level of activity. It's just we won't -- it's just like somebody ordering brand-new frac capacity from our perspective. From their perspective, there's other parts that are not new capital orders. But from our perspective, all of the high-pressure components of the frac system are basically being ordered as if it's a brand-new capital quarter. So logically, that can't continue. That has to stabilize at some point. But the level of activity given the amount of horsepower that will be active in the industry, that business will be at a very high level.

But many would be, I guess, in the middle tier because we don't have the tiebacks on that project list of 19 because we're talking about $250 million or more. Most of the tiebacks fall below that. I think it's a combination of the 2 things clearly. Our position, Rob, is we can help focus on helping improve project economics. And it's not just cost, it's also schedule. So things we can do like I described earlier, we're able to cut costs significantly on a large project on large greenfield project 9 to 15 months. On a small tieback, we can cut it 50% of the time. That's the advantage of having the relationships, of having the install base, of having the service infrastructure to be able to support it and now being able to offer it as one integrated package. The time to first oil is what ultimately drives the project economics on those projects. Clearly, they want to see commodity prices and have confidence in commodity prices. But you saw the breakeven numbers that we included in the presentation earlier today. We now collectively, as TechnipFMC, represent up to 1/3 of the deepwater development cost. And we have a lot more that we can bring in terms of lowering breakevens even further."

We are the only ones to put together an integrated offering that goes from the wellhead to the topside. So we have that unique capability to be able to look at how we design our equipment for installability, how we focus on serviceability, how we can leverage the industry's largest install base. We have over 2,000 subsea trees operating. We have over 11,000 kilometers of flexible pipe out in the industry today. So there's an enormous platform that we can work from together now as one single company. When you're not together as a single entity and you don't have the same commercial incentive, matter of fact, you can argue that in the regular style, there's actually a disincentive to work together because of the commercial model. So it's just a very different offering than the other offerings that are in the market today. Some projects will continue to go forward in the traditional way where work packages will be split up in 2 ways or sometimes in many ways. Just one point I'd like to mention to your question. We actually won part of Leviathan. We won several of the packages. The Leviathan project was split into many packages. So we are one of the subsea providers on Leviathan. We are still bidding a package for BP Mad Dog. So when these projects are split up, because of the breadth of our company, we're likely to be involved in the project in one form or another. It may not be the traditional split between SURF and SPS. It may be split in multiple components. And when it is, we'll continue to approach that. We'll remain flexible with our commercial offering. Ultimately, what we want to be able to provide to our customer is the very best solution. And if we can get involved early and work through an integrated FEED and convert that into an integrated EPCI, accelerate to time to first oil at the best project economics, we think we have a winning combination and the unique opportunity to do that. In other cases, we'll bid the package separately and individually if that's what the customers chooses to do. And we'll bid at the level that we think is in the best interest of our company and our shareholders, and that's what we'll do as well. But at the end of the day, what we bring to the market and what we bring to our customers is the widest range of commercial solutions that anybody has to offer. So we believe with the success and the proven success that we've had both on the FEED side now converting in an integrated EPCI as well as the continued success on the à la carte type approach that we're the best position to market, and we're really excited to have everybody together now working as one company."

And the only reason I wanted to back that up a little bit, Byron, is to really understand that the capacity and the competency that is now together in one organization. So we're doing quite a bit of FEED work on Onshore/Offshore. That's important because when we get in early on those projects, we can better understand the project and, quite frankly, what commercial model we want to use on the project to ensure that we derisk the project and ensure success both for our clients and ourselves. In terms of Subsea, yes, it continues to accelerate both integrated and nonintegrated FEED studies, but it's one of the reasons we have confidence. So it's a little bit like following drilling permits in the U.S. land business. When we see this level of FEED activity, not all convert, most certainly not all convert, but many of them do end up being sanctioned. In terms of versus the project list, I'm going to -- I'm not going to answer that directly just because, Byron, that's a significant competitive and unique competitive advantage that we have.

In addition, there is no doubt that the creation of TechnipFMC occurred at the right time. Our customers are showing great interest in integrated solutions that only companies with a broad portfolio like TechnipFMC can offer. I will let Doug and Maryann talk about the market and about our first quarter results. But before I do that, I have a special message to our shareholders, clients, partners, employees and to the financial community. On January 17, Doug Pferdehirt became the CEO of TechnipFMC and I became Executive Chairman. Therefore, this earnings call will be my last one. Doug and I and our great teams have created a very unique company, TechnipFMC. I have known Doug for more than 20 years, and he has all my confidence and respect. We are now working together, engaging with customers, reviewing projects and visiting sites of important projects around the world and have turned around the clock. We are also building the future, focusing on customers, targeting the right project in a market that remain challenging but in which we know how to differentiate ourselves.
On a lighter note, sorry, on a lighter note, I don't believe much in coincidence. But today, 27th of April is actually the tenth anniversary of my career at TechnipFMC. In fact, I became Chairman and CEO of TechnipFMC at the Annual Meeting exactly 10 years ago. It has been an incredible journey, and it's not finished. So I wanted to thank all investment community for the confidence but also for challenging me all these years.
With that, I will hand you over to Doug. Doug?"

I deeply appreciate your support, your friendship and your significant contributions that make TechnipFMC a success. On today's call, I will give a brief overview of our operational results and then share my thoughts on the new company, market outlook and a few of our key value drivers. Maryann Mannen will then review our financial performance in more detail and discuss our outlook for 2017 before opening the call for questions.
I am pleased to announce a terrific start for our new company. We generated $3.4 billion in total company revenue. Order intake of $1.6 billion was reflective of lower oil and gas expenditures, and we ended the quarter with $16.1 billion in backlog. Our balance sheet remains strong. We have a net cash of $3.5 billion. And today, we are going to discuss how we intend to deploy a portion of our cash balances.
Our segment results included $427 million of total EBITDA across Subsea, Onshore/Offshore and Surface Technologies. We delivered 17.3% EBITDA margins in Subsea. Onshore/Offshore EBITDA margins increased to 8.6% on strong project execution. And EBITDA margins increased to 14.5% for Surface Technologies.
Moving beyond the financials, I want to talk more about what it really means for us to become one company. As TechnipFMC, we are now uniquely able to leverage our industry-leading, front-end engineering capabilities, our culture of innovation that is bringing to market next-generation solutions and our reputation of superior project management, all necessary to drive the change required to deliver real sustainable improvement and project economics. We are well-positioned from upstream through downstream, providing exposure to both short-cycle businesses and long-cycle businesses. And now our Subsea footprint extends throughout the entire water column, creating the opportunity set to drive a step-change in project economics. We are confident this unique and flexible offering will create significant additional value both on land and offshore, from concept to project delivery and beyond for both our clients and shareholders alike. The foundation of our success lies within our over 40,000 employees who are driven by a mindset of challenging convention and leveraging our broad expertise and R&D capabilities, which encompasses a comprehensive technology opportunity set within TechnipFMC, allowing us to maintain a competitive advantage.
Turning to the market. The recovery in oil prices has fueled the resurgence in North American land activity. Our North American surface technology activity has shown the greatest near-term improvement. We believe that a further increase in the rig count, coupled with additional hydraulic fracturing fleet reactivations, will drive improved results in our North American business. In addition, we continue to benefit from the increased market acceptance of our integrated pad offering, which creates value for our customers through both technology and process improvement. We are now exploring ways to extend or further integrate our offering by leveraging the project management and EPC capabilities within our new company.
Activity in our international Surface Technologies business remains generally stable, although pricing headwinds experienced in 2016 are impacting near-term results. Onshore activity continues to provide the most diverse opportunity set, driven by natural gas, refining and petrochemical projects. We are actively engaged in and pursuing several front-end engineering studies, which provide the platform for early engagement, which can significantly derisk project execution.
We also continue to experience market acceptance of our project management consulting business, a mostly reimbursable activity, driven by our industry-recognized expertise and track record.
Globally, fleet activity in both LNG and petrochemicals is fueled by the potential for sustained, modest natural gas pricing. These results -- this represents an important opportunity set for TechnipFMC by leveraging our process and technologies portfolio and our proven track record. We are tracking several significant onshore projects in the Middle East, Africa and Asia markets both in LNG and refining. We continue to closely monitor ENI Coral floating LNG in both the MIDOR and BAPCO refinery expansion projects.
Moving to Subsea. We can see that the industry's efforts are having a significant impact on project economics with a clear downward trend in project breakeven levels. Recent analysis indicates the breakeven levels have fallen more than 30% since 2014. We believe that most operators have projects that can move forward to current oil prices, with some notable projects having been publicly identified as viable even below $40 breakeven. This is increasing the competitiveness of deepwater assets versus unconventional plays. We are confident our integrated model and continuous innovation will allow us to further this downward trend, helping unlock additional offshore projects.
Our end-to-end capability now translates into the complete Subsea package from wellhead to topside. Using this broader definition of scope, we have identified 19 Subsea projects over the next 24 months that are in various stages of active discussion, each having a potential value that exceeds $250 million. In addition to the project shown here, our partners focus on shorter cycle, less capital-intensive Subsea tiebacks remains robust. Since the time of our last earnings call, we have remained confident that 2017 will represent the inflection in inbound order activity.
Last month, we announced the award of the Shell Kaikias development in the Gulf of Mexico, our third integrated EPCI award, demonstrating the success of this unique fully integrated model. Working with our long-term partner Shell, we significantly simplified the field architecture and equipment packages while accelerating time to first oil. Kaikias has serves its further confirmation of market acceptance of our unique offering. We continue to expect that the current pace of integrated FEED studies will lead to direct project awards in the future, expanding both the customer base and geographical footprint for integrated projects. And as another sign that we have seen the inflection in Subsea order activity, we are excited about a recently announced award for the Subsea production system for the ExxonMobil Liza project. This award also serves as further endorsement of one of our newest technologies, the compact manifold, which will be deployed on this project, creating significant value. While we remain focused on our client success, we continue to look for additional ways to create value for our shareholders. We are focused on delivering synergies and capital allocation that we believe will generate improved financial returns, delivering further value to our shareholders. Our value drivers are focused on 4 key areas: cost synergies, revenue synergies, tax synergies and capital allocation. We have a series of actions in place around each that we believe will deliver at least 300 basis points of incremental returns by 2019. Importantly, these internal initiatives are largely within our control and not predicated on a market recovery. The most significant component of this plan is our cost synergies. We expect these savings will represent as much as 1/2 of the targeted improvement. We have already taken actions that will remove $40 million of cost from the combined company. We remain confident that we will realize the full $400 million of targeted synergies in our 2019 results.
Revenue synergies are also progressing well, and we continue to identify areas where we can achieve tangible synergies. Importantly, these benefits are incremental to any previously announced synergies. We're also realizing benefits from our new domicile. We have identified structural savings that we believe will result in a reduction in our normalized tax rate over the next several years. Given the current strength of the balance sheet, today, we're announcing a plan to return some of this capital to our shareholders. First, our Board of Directors has announced a $500 million share buyback authorization, and we are committed to completing this authorization by the end of 2018. Additionally, we are reaffirming our intent to make dividend distributions. We are planning for a quarterly dividend following our third quarter results, targeting an initial dividend rate that will be sustainable through the business cycle while allowing for growth in the coming years. We are confident that this combination of value drivers can deliver incremental returns of at least 300 basis points by 2019.
In closing, we are just over 3 months into our merger. Because our teams knew each other well, they have hit the ground running. The progress to date has been remarkable. The employee focus has been striking, both on day-to-day business and on capitalizing on the potential of the merger. We posted solid results in our first quarter earnings report. We have started to deliver some of the cost savings to the bottom line and have increased confidence in reaching the targeted savings. Project execution remains a differentiation for TechnipFMC. And the market's enthusiastic adoption of both integrated FEED work and direct project awards for integrated EPCI is a trend we expect to accelerate.
Finally, we see a clear path to improved financial returns, driven by a series of identified value drivers, including the shareholder distributions we announced today. We look forward to the future as we continue executing on our new strategy, driving change and unlocking the tremendous potential of TechnipFMC. I am confident in our ability due to the women and men of TechnipFMC who together provide the unparalleled ability and determination to drive the real change required in our industry.
I will now turn the call over to Maryann."

I am pleased to report the results of TechnipFMC's first quarter results. Overall, our operational performance across our 3 segments was improved over prior-period pro forma result. While revenue overall on the pro forma basis is below the p",1632,"Thanks, Doug. I am pleased to report the results of TechnipFMC's first quarter results. Overall, our operational performance across our 3 segments was improved over prior-period pro forma result. While revenue overall on the pro forma basis is below the prior year quarter, on an adjusted EBITDA basis, we saw overall margin improvement of 190 basis points over 2016 from our 3 operating segments. We reported net income of $191 million in the first quarter. Included in these quarterly results are the after-tax costs associated with our merger transaction and integration, our estimated purchase price accounting charges and some minor restructuring and other severance costs, totaling $140 million on an after-tax basis. Our first quarter diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.71, when excluding these after-tax charges were $0.30 per diluted share. The $194 million pretax impact of these charges in our reported results include purchase price accounting adjustment of $86 million for inventory step-up and other impacts, which will not be included in long-term amortization; and purchase price accounting adjustment of $43 million that are included in amortization expense associated with intangible assets, including the amortization of acquired backlog; merger transaction and integration cost of $55 million; and restructuring and other severance costs and impairment charges of $10 million. We reported $379.7 million of operating profit. When considering these charges of $194 million, our adjusted operating profit was $573.2 million. We have provided a schedule in our release filed last evening, which reconciles the reported result to adjusted operating profit.
We will have additional charges in 2017 as we complete our restructuring efforts and integration activities. We'll continue to report them accordingly. We reported $154 million of depreciation and amortization expense, which includes $43 million in amortization-related purchase price accounting adjustment. When these amortization-related charges and credits are excluded, adjusted EBITDA was $684.4 million. Our purchase price adjustment charges recorded in the first quarter are based upon a significant field to fair value analysis completed to date. We expect to complete our analysis in the coming months. These preliminary purchase price accounting adjustments related to the merger were noncash charges. Also included in our quarterly result is a foreign exchange gain of $307 million reported in corporate income and expense net. This result is largely due to the exchange rate of the Russian ruble to the U.S. dollar. We apply a natural hedge approach for the measurement of these gains or losses. It is possible that we will record gains or losses in future periods.
In the fourth quarter of 2016, we increased our ownership stake in the Yamal joint venture and we now hold the controlling stake. This change does impact comparability of the current financial results to prior periods. All of the joint venture revenues and operating profit are recorded in the Onshore/Offshore segment results. Our partner share of profitability is recorded as a future liability with periodic impact recorded in net interest expense. We have constructed the pro forma 2016 results as if the company had maintained same controlling stake throughout 2016 to make quarter-over-quarter comparisons more meaningful.
Moving to segment results. Subsea reported $1.4 billion in the period. On a pro forma basis, quarter-over-quarter revenue comparisons were negatively impacted by lower project activity due to reduced inbound in previous years, resulting in a lower project backlog coming into the current year. Adjusted Subsea EBITDA was $239 million in the quarter with a margin of 17.3% when excluding charges of $97 million. Segment backlog exiting this quarter was $6.6 billion, which compares to prior year backlog of $7 billion.
Moving to our Onshore/Offshore results. Onshore/Offshore revenues for the quarter were $1.8 billion, down 19% on a pro forma basis quarter-over-quarter. Revenues were lower as a result of lower project activity, most notably in the Middle East and Americas. Onshore/Offshore adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was $152 million with margins of 8.6%. The period benefited from strong project execution and the achievement of key project construction milestone. EBITDA margins improved 390 basis points from prior year quarter. Segment backlog exiting the quarter stands at $9.1 billion, which compares to the prior year backlog of $9.4 billion.
Moving to our Surface Technologies result. Revenue for the quarter was $248 million, about 29% below prior year on a pro forma basis due to lower activity in North America -- in our North America business and the impact of pricing on the international business. Surface Technologies adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $36 million when excluding restructuring and purchase price accounting charges of $46 million. EBITDA margins, excluding charges, increased from 8.3% to 14.5%, primarily driven by our lower-cost structure and the beginning of the recovery in the pressure pumping business. Our surface international business began recognizing some lower-priced backlog that was booked during 2016. While pricing has began to stabilize, we have yet to see a pricing recovery in these international markets. Pro forma operating results in our North American business have begun to improve from the bottom following late 2016. Daily orders from pressure pumping activity has significantly increased as customer demand has increased due to fleet reactivation.
Let's turn to the corporate items. Corporate adjusted operating profit in the quarter was $255 million when excluding charges and credit for $51 million. Included in the quarter were net gains of $307 million, mainly due to foreign exchange gain previously discussed. Net interest expense was an expense of $82 million in the quarter, which includes the charge of $68 million due to the remeasurement of a liability payable to joint venture partners. Our first quarter tax rate of 28.4% when excluding the effects of liability remeasurement within net interest expense, which received no tax benefit. Capital spending this quarter was $51 million. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $154 million. Of the total, $43 million was related to purchase price accounting for the merger and was included in total charges and credit. We will continue to identify D&A related to purchase price accounting as such in future periods. At the end of the first quarter, we had net cash of $3.5 billion. It is comprised of $7 billion of cash and $3.5 billion of debt.
Looking forward. Full year revenue for Subsea is expected to be at least $6.1 billion. We could see further improvements of this revenue subject to the timing of our project award inbound and backlog project timing. We expect to deliver EBITDA margins, excluding charges, of at least to 17% for the full year 2017.
Looking at the Onshore/Offshore business. Full year revenue is expected to be at least $7.3 billion. We anticipate that with continued strength in project execution, EBITDA margins, excluding charges, should exceed 6.5% for the full year in 2017.
In Surface Technologies, revenue is expected to be at least $1.4 billion. The North America recovery is well underway, and we are seeing the greatest impact in our business. Customer acceptance of our integrated surface offering should also deliver incremental sales in the year. However, improved revenues in North America will see some offset from the international segment, driven largely by the effects of more competitive pricing. In Surface Technologies, we currently expect to realize EBITDA margins, excluding charges, of at least 13% for the full year in 2017. As Doug said, we remain on track to deliver at least $400 million of pretax synergies. As a reminder, our objective is to deliver run rate savings of $200 million by the end of the year and a full $400 million run rate by the end of 2018. For all these savings post to merger are fully in line with our overall targets. We have already taken action on $40 million of quick wins. These include corporate costs, real estate, as we have already combined many facilities where we shared same location footprint and other indirect cost. For the remaining quarters of 2017, we expect that corporate expense will be between $50 million and $55 million. The estimate for corporate expense remains subject to foreign currency fluctuation on the cash flow hedging. This is not included in our estimate. We're estimating that other merger and integration cost and restructuring costs will be approximately $150 million in the remaining 3 quarters of 2017. We will continue to identify these costs as we have this quarter. We estimate interest expense to be approximately $22 million to $25 million per quarter. We now anticipate our 2017 tax rate to be between 26% and 28% for the full year. One element of our return on invested capital objective is the benefit of a lower tax rate from our planned entity restructuring. Our domicile resulting from the completion of our cross-border merger gives us the ability to reduce the worldwide effective tax rate. We estimate that on a comparable set of earnings, we can initially realize at least 300 basis points of tax saving as our restructuring is completed by year-end. We now expect capital spending in 2017 to be approximately $300 million.
In closing, the first quarter reflects our ability to drive strong financial returns while we continue to execute on our integration strategy and realize synergies, as we have been communicating. We believe we are well positioned to capitalize on new market opportunities and stabilize our business through increasing margin -- market uncertainty. Our solid execution and our previous cost-reduction initiative as well as the opportunities we see for further product cost reduction and technology development are critical elements of our differentiated business models. We are encouraged by the level of project activity we are seeing, but we recognize the pace of order conversion continues to be challenging. We remain ready to respond to the market and manage our businesses to deliver improving return.

So from a Subsea perspective, in terms of our order guidance, we've got largely about 75% of our revenues secured in backlog. And then you know there's a portion of that revenue that's recurring. They're more like service revenues, et cetera. So there's just a small portion of our 2017 revenue estimate today that is not secured. So we feel very confident in the at least $6.1 billion with respect to Subsea. Most of the margin, obviously, in our backlog is solid. Our execution will continue. So for Subsea, not much that we need to see. On the Onshore/Offshore business, we've got probably 85-plus percent of the revenue included in our backlog to deliver those revenues. And as you can see from the quarter, our performance on the Onshore/Offshore segment from a margin perspective was very strong. So again, we think for those 2 segment, we've got the good portion of that for 2017 in hand. Surface, as you know, is a bit different. We've got a little over $400 million in backlog. That business will respond in North America, and we're pretty confident in the recovery there. But obviously, that's not in backlog, and we'll need to see that backlog continue -- or excuse me, that inbound continue throughout the next couple of quarters."

It is important to note, in the first quarter, due to the resurgence of activity of fleet reactivations that we have heard reported for many of the pressure pumping companies, that is our shortest cycle business and we benefited significantly from that resurgence of activity. When they reactivate these frac fleet because of the extended downturn that we just experienced in the North American market, not only does the equipment being maintenance and repaired, but in many cases, it was cannibalized for spare parts, for other ongoing capacity that they had in their active fleet. So this has resulted in what would be similar to new capital orders for us versus just the normal level of maintenance, repairs, inspection and replacement of the high-pressure components of the hydraulic fracturing fleet. So we got that surge. We think that surge will continue into part of Q2 but then we'll go back to a more normalized rate of revenue and margins in that particular business."

In addition to those projects, by working closely and having the intimate relationship and the unique position that we have with our partners, we've been able to work with them to help identify short-cycle Subsea tieback opportunities. And then by leveraging the standard products across TechnipFMC and now the fully integrated capability, we can deliver the full Subsea tieback system installed on the seafloor in approximately 1/2 the time of the normal market. So if you put together a few large projects, in addition to the ones we've already announced, a robust Subsea tieback market and a continued resilience in our Subsea services business, net-net we would expect to step up in 2017 versus 2016."

And, yes, we certainly expect future awards of this nature. It's a very interesting question because it's not just the Compact Manifold. It's the entire Subsea production system. In the past, equipment providers didn't think about installability. Installability  wasn't in their scope. They weren't rewarded for thinking about -- commercially rewarded for thinking about installability, so often the structures that were built lead to very difficult and costly installation campaigns. As one company and the only company that now has the entire water column and installation under one roof, we think very differently. And we now understand that there were significant changes that we can make to the Subsea architecture that will allow the installation to be done in a much more efficient manner and will be able to be done off a more diverse vessel platform.

And I think you know from our past experience that we have a strong position in that business. Therefore, we would naturally get the very first orders. It's the best product in the market, and we saw that flush order of activity. There's been an enormous amount of hydraulic horsepower reactivations that have been going on. And remember, we're placing -- when we're taking orders, some of them are booking and turning very quickly. Some of them may be up to 90 days out. So when you think about what you're hearing about some of the fleet reactivation's and when they expect to be completed by, which is you're hearing the third quarter, that's why I'm just saying we'll expect those flush orders to go kind of through our system as we did in the first quarter and through the second quarter. But Rob, we will stabilize at a very high level of activity. It's not that we're not going to have a high level of activity. It's just we won't -- it's just like somebody ordering brand-new frac capacity from our perspective. From their perspective, there's other parts that are not new capital orders. But from our perspective, all of the high-pressure components of the frac system are basically being ordered as if it's a brand-new capital quarter. So logically, that can't continue. That has to stabilize at some point. But the level of activity given the amount of horsepower that will be active in the industry, that business will be at a very high level. So I'm not saying the whole business is going to come down. I'm just saying we'll see the majority of those flush orders come through the system in the first and second quarter."

It seems like today in the Subsea business the only projects being approved or sanctioned are world-class projects like Liza or tiebacks, smaller tieback opportunities.

Some would fit into the classification, as you're saying, world-class. But many would be, I guess, in the middle tier because we don't have the tiebacks on that project list of 19 because we're talking about $250 million or more. Most of the tiebacks fall below that. I think it's a combination of the 2 things clearly. Our position, Rob, is we can help focus on helping improve project economics. And it's not just cost, it's also schedule. So things we can do like I described earlier, we're able to cut costs significantly on a large project on large greenfield project 9 to 15 months. On a small tieback, we can cut it 50% of the time. That's the advantage of having the relationships, of having the install base, of having the service infrastructure to be able to support it and now being able to offer it as one integrated package. The time to first oil is what ultimately drives the project economics on those projects. Clearly, they want to see commodity prices and have confidence in commodity prices. But you saw the breakeven numbers that we included in the presentation earlier today. We now collectively, as TechnipFMC, represent up to 1/3 of the deepwater development cost. And we have a lot more that we can bring in terms of lowering breakevens even further."

We are the only ones to put together an integrated offering that goes from the wellhead to the topside. So we have that unique capability to be able to look at how we design our equipment for installability, how we focus on serviceability, how we can leverage the industry's largest install base. We have over 2,000 Subsea trees operating. We have over 11,000 kilometers of flexible pipe out in the industry today. So there's an enormous platform that we can work from together now as one single company. When you're not together as a single entity and you don't have the same commercial incentive, matter of fact, you can argue that in the regular style, there's actually a disincentive to work together because of the commercial model. So it's just a very different offering than the other offerings that are in the market today. Some projects will continue to go forward in the traditional way where work packages will be split up in 2 ways or sometimes in many ways. Just one point I'd like to mention to your question. We actually won part of Leviathan. We won several of the packages. The Leviathan project was split into many packages. So we are one of the Subsea providers on Leviathan. We are still bidding a package for BP Mad Dog. So when these projects are split up, because of the breadth of our company, we're likely to be involved in the project in one form or another. It may not be the traditional split between SURF and SPS. It may be split in multiple components. And when it is, we'll continue to approach that. We'll remain flexible with our commercial offering. Ultimately, what we want to be able to provide to our customer is the very best solution. And if we can get involved early and work through an integrated FEED and convert that into an integrated EPCI, accelerate to time to first oil at the best project economics, we think we have a winning combination and a unique opportunity to do that. In other cases, we'll bid the package separately and individually if that's what the customers chooses to do. And we'll bid at the level that we think is in the best interest of our company and our shareholders, and that's what we'll do as well. But at the end of the day, what we bring to the market and what we bring to our customers is the widest range of commercial solutions that anybody has to offer. So we believe with the success and the proven success that we've had both on the FEED side now converting in an integrated EPCI as well as the continued success on the à la carte type approach that we're the best position to market, and we're really excited to have everybody together now working as one company."

I will let Doug and Maryann talk about the market and about our first quarter results. But before I do that, I have a special message to our shareholders, clients, partners, employees and to the financial community. On January 17, Doug Pferdehirt became the CEO of TechnipFMC and I became Executive Chairman. Therefore, this earnings call will be my last one. Doug and I and our great teams have created a very unique company, TechnipFMC. I have known Doug for more than 20 years, and he has all my confidence and respect. We are now working together, engaging with customers, reviewing projects and visiting sites of important projects around the world and have turned around the clock. We are also building the future, focusing on customers, targeting the right project in a market that remain challenging but in which we know how to differentiate ourselves.
On a lighter note, sorry, on a lighter note, I don't believe much in coincidence. But today, 27th of April is actually the tenth anniversary of my career at TechnipFMC. In fact, I became Chairman and CEO of TechnipFMC at the Annual Meeting exactly 10 years ago. It has been an incredible journey, and it's not finished. So I wanted to thank all investment community for the confidence but also for challenging me all these years.

I deeply appreciate your support, your friendship and your significant contributions that make TechnipFMC a success. On today's call, I will give a brief overview of our operational results and then share my thoughts on the new company, market outlook and a few of our key value drivers. Maryann Mannen will then review our financial performance in more detail and discuss our outlook for 2017 before opening the call for questions.
I am pleased to announce a terrific start for our new company. We generated $3.4 billion in total company revenue. Order intake of $1.6 billion was reflective of lower oil and gas expenditures, and we ended the quarter with $16.1 billion in backlog. Our balance sheet remains strong. We have a net cash of $3.5 billion. And today, we are going to discuss how we intend to deploy a portion of our cash balances.
Our segment results included $427 million of total EBITDA across Subsea, Onshore/Offshore and Surface Technologies. We delivered 17.3% EBITDA margins in Subsea. Onshore/Offshore EBITDA margins increased to 8.6% on strong project execution. And EBITDA margins increased to 14.5% for Surface Technologies.
Moving beyond the financials, I want to talk more about what it really means for us to become one company. As TechnipFMC, we are now uniquely able to leverage our industry-leading, front-end engineering capabilities, our culture of innovation that is bringing to market next-generation solutions and our reputation of superior project management, all necessary to drive the change required to deliver real sustainable improvement and project economics. We are well-positioned from upstream through downstream, providing exposure to both short-cycle businesses and long-cycle businesses. And now our Subsea footprint extends throughout the entire water column, creating the opportunity set to drive a step-change in project economics. We are confident this unique and flexible offering will create significant additional value both on land and offshore, from concept to project delivery and beyond for both our clients and shareholders alike. The foundation of our success lies within our over 40,000 employees who are driven by a mindset of challenging convention and leveraging our broad expertise and R&D capabilities, which encompasses a comprehensive technology opportunity set within TechnipFMC, allowing us to maintain a competitive advantage.
Turning to the market. The recovery in oil prices has fueled the resurgence in North American land activity. Our North American surface technology activity has shown the greatest near-term improvement. We believe that a further increase in the rig count, coupled with additional hydraulic fracturing fleet reactivations, will drive improved results in our North American business. In addition, we continue to benefit from the increased market acceptance of our integrated pad offering, which creates value for our customers through both technology and process improvement. We are now exploring ways to extend or further integrate our offering by leveraging the project management and EPC capabilities within our new company.
Activity in our international Surface Technologies business remains generally stable, although pricing headwinds experienced in 2016 are impacting near-term results. Onshore activity continues to provide the most diverse opportunity set, driven by natural gas, refining and petrochemical projects. We are actively engaged in and pursuing several front-end engineering studies, which provide the platform for early engagement, which can significantly derisk project execution.
We also continue to experience market acceptance of our project management consulting business, a mostly reimbursable activity, driven by our industry-recognized expertise and track record.
Globally, fleet activity in both LNG and petrochemicals is fueled by the potential for sustained, modest natural gas pricing. These results -- this represents an important opportunity set for TechnipFMC by leveraging our process and technologies portfolio and our proven track record. We are tracking several significant onshore projects in the Middle East, Africa and Asia markets both in LNG and refining. We continue to closely monitor ENI Coral floating LNG in both the MIDOR and BAPCO refinery expansion projects.
Moving to Subsea. We can see that the industry's efforts are having a significant impact on project economics with a clear downward trend in project breakeven levels. Recent analysis indicates the breakeven levels have fallen more than 30% since 2014. We believe that most operators have projects that can move forward to current oil prices, with some notable projects having been publicly identified as viable even below $40 breakeven. This is increasing the competitiveness of deepwater assets versus unconventional plays. We are confident our integrated model and continuous innovation will allow us to further this downward trend, helping unlock additional offshore projects.
Our end-to-end capability now translates into the complete Subsea package from wellhead to topside. Using this broader definition of scope, we have identified 19 Subsea projects over the next 24 months that are in various stages of active discussion, each having a potential value that exceeds $250 million. In addition to the project shown here, our partners focus on shorter cycle, less capital-intensive Subsea tiebacks remains robust. Since the time of our last earnings call, we have remained confident that 2017 will represent the inflection in inbound order activity.
Last month, we announced the award of the Shell Kaikias development in the Gulf of Mexico, our third integrated EPCI award, demonstrating the success of this unique fully integrated model. Working with our long-term partner Shell, we significantly simplified the field architecture and equipment packages while accelerating time to first oil. Kaikias has serves its further confirmation of market acceptance of our unique offering. We continue to expect that the current pace of integrated FEED studies will lead to direct project awards in the future, expanding both the customer base and geographical footprint for integrated projects. And as another sign that we have seen the inflection in Subsea order activity, we are excited about a recently announced award for the Subsea production system for the ExxonMobil Liza project. This award also serves as further endorsement of one of our newest technologies, the compact manifold, which will be deployed on this project, creating significant value. While we remain focused on our client success, we continue to look for additional ways to create value for our shareholders. We are focused on delivering synergies and capital allocation that we believe will generate improved financial returns, delivering further value to our shareholders. Our value drivers are focused on 4 key areas: cost synergies, revenue synergies, tax synergies and capital allocation. We have a series of actions in place around each that we believe will deliver at least 300 basis points of incremental returns by 2019. Importantly, these internal initiatives are largely within our control and not predicated on a market recovery. The most significant component of this plan is our cost synergies. We expect these savings will represent as much as 1/2 of the targeted improvement. We have already taken actions that will remove $40 million of cost from the combined company. We remain confident that we will realize the full $400 million of targeted synergies in our 2019 results.
Revenue synergies are also progressing well, and we continue to identify areas where we can achieve tangible synergies. Importantly, these benefits are incremental to any previously announced synergies. We're also realizing benefits from our new domicile. We have identified structural savings that we believe will result in a reduction in our normalized tax rate over the next several years. Given the current strength of the balance sheet, today, we're announcing a plan to return some of this capital to our shareholders. First, our Board of Directors has announced a $500 million share buyback authorization, and we are committed to completing this authorization by the end of 2018. Additionally, we are reaffirming our intent to make dividend distributions. We are planning for a quarterly dividend following our third quarter results, targeting an initial dividend rate that will be sustainable through the business cycle while allowing for growth in the coming years. We are confident that this combination of value drivers can deliver incremental returns of at least 300 basis points by 2019.
In closing, we are just over 3 months into our merger. Because our teams knew each other well, they have hit the ground running. The progress to date has been remarkable. The employee focus has been striking, both on day-to-day business and on capitalizing on the potential of the merger. We posted solid results in our first quarter earnings report. We have started to deliver some of the cost savings to the bottom line and have increased confidence in reaching the targeted savings. Project execution remains a differentiation for TechnipFMC. And the market's enthusiastic adoption of both integrated FEED work and direct project awards for integrated EPCI is a trend we expect to accelerate.
Finally, we see a clear path to improved financial returns, driven by a series of identified value drivers, including the shareholder distributions we announced today. We look forward to the future as we continue executing on our new strategy, driving change and unlocking the tremendous potential of TechnipFMC. I am confident in our ability due to the women and men of TechnipFMC who together provide the unparalleled ability and determination to drive the real change required in our industry.
I will now turn the call over to Maryann."

The $194 million pretax impact of these charges in our reported results include purchase price accounting adjustment of $86 million for inventory step-up and other impacts, which will not be included in long-term amortization; and purchase price accounting adjustment of $43 million that are included in amortization expense associated with intangible assets, including the amortization of acquired backlog; merger transaction and integration cost of $55 million; and restructuring and other severance costs and impairment charges of $10 million. We reported $379.7 million of operating profit. When considering these charges of $194 million, our adjusted operating profit was $573.2 million. We have provided a schedule in our release filed last evening, which reconciles the reported result to adjusted operating profit.
We will have additional charges in 2017 as we complete our restructuring efforts and integration activities. We'll continue to report them accordingly. We reported $154 million of depreciation and amortization expense, which includes $43 million in amortization-related purchase price accounting adjustment. When these amortization-related charges and credits are excluded, adjusted EBITDA was $684.4 million. Our purchase price adjustment charges recorded in the first quarter are based upon a significant field to fair value analysis completed to date. We expect to complete our analysis in the coming months. These preliminary purchase price accounting adjustments related to the merger were noncash charges. Also included in our quarterly result is a foreign exchange gain of $307 million reported in corporate income and expense net. This result is largely due to the exchange rate of the Russian ruble to the U.S. dollar. We apply a natural hedge approach for the measurement of these gains or losses. It is possible that we will record gains or losses in future periods.
In the fourth quarter of 2016, we increased our ownership stake in the Yamal joint venture and we now hold the controlling stake. This change does impact comparability of the current financial results to prior periods. All of the joint venture revenues and operating profit are recorded in the Onshore/Offshore segment results. Our partner share of profitability is recorded as a future liability with periodic impact recorded in net interest expense. We have constructed the pro forma 2016 results as if the company had maintained same controlling stake throughout 2016 to make quarter-over-quarter comparisons more meaningful.
Moving to segment results. Subsea reported $1.4 billion in the period. On a pro forma basis, quarter-over-quarter revenue comparisons were negatively impacted by lower project activity due to reduced inbound in previous years, resulting in a lower project backlog coming into the current year. Adjusted Subsea EBITDA was $239 million in the quarter with a margin of 17.3% when excluding charges of $97 million. Segment backlog exiting this quarter was $6.6 billion, which compares to prior year backlog of $7 billion.
Moving to our Onshore/Offshore results. Onshore/Offshore revenues for the quarter were $1.8 billion, down 19% on a pro forma basis quarter-over-quarter. Revenues were lower as a result of lower project activity, most notably in the Middle East and Americas. Onshore/Offshore adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was $152 million with margins of 8.6%. The period benefited from strong project execution and the achievement of key project construction milestone. EBITDA margins improved 390 basis points from prior year quarter. Segment backlog exiting the quarter stands at $9.1 billion, which compares to the prior year backlog of $9.4 billion.
Moving to our Surface Technologies result. Revenue for the quarter was $248 million, about 29% below prior year on a pro forma basis due to lower activity in North America -- in our North America business and the impact of pricing on the international business. Surface Technologies adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $36 million when excluding restructuring and purchase price accounting charges of $46 million. EBITDA margins, excluding charges, increased from 8.3% to 14.5%, primarily driven by our lower-cost structure and the beginning of the recovery in the pressure pumping business. Our surface international business began recognizing some lower-priced backlog that was booked during 2016. While pricing has began to stabilize, we have yet to see a pricing recovery in these international markets. Pro forma operating results in our North American business have begun to improve from the bottom following late 2016. Daily orders from pressure pumping activity has significantly increased as customer demand has increased due to fleet reactivation.
Let's turn to the corporate items. Corporate adjusted operating profit in the quarter was $255 million when excluding charges and credit for $51 million. Included in the quarter were net gains of $307 million, mainly due to foreign exchange gain previously discussed. Net interest expense was an expense of $82 million in the quarter, which includes the charge of $68 million due to the remeasurement of a liability payable to joint venture partners. Our first quarter tax rate of 28.4% when excluding the effects of liability remeasurement within net interest expense, which received no tax benefit. Capital spending this quarter was $51 million. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $154 million. Of the total, $43 million was related to purchase price accounting for the merger and was included in total charges and credit. We will continue to identify D&A related to purchase price accounting as such in future periods. At the end of the first quarter, we had net cash of $3.5 billion. It is comprised of $7 billion of cash and $3.5 billion of debt.
Looking forward. Full year revenue for Subsea is expected to be at least $6.1 billion. We could see further improvements of this revenue subject to the timing of our project award inbound and backlog project timing. We expect to deliver EBITDA margins, excluding charges, of at least to 17% for the full year 2017.
Looking at the Onshore/Offshore business. Full year revenue is expected to be at least $7.3 billion. We anticipate that with continued strength in project execution, EBITDA margins, excluding charges, should exceed 6.5% for the full year in 2017.
In Surface Technologies, revenue is expected to be at least $1.4 billion. The North America recovery is well underway, and we are seeing the greatest impact in our business. Customer acceptance of our integrated surface offering should also deliver incremental sales in the year. However, improved revenues in North America will see some offset from the international segment, driven largely by the effects of more competitive pricing. In Surface Technologies, we currently expect to realize EBITDA margins, excluding charges, of at least 13% for the full year in 2017. As Doug said, we remain on track to deliver at least $400 million of pretax synergies. As a reminder, our objective is to deliver run rate savings of $200 million by the end of the year and a full $400 million run rate by the end of 2018. For all these savings post to merger are fully in line with our overall targets. We have already taken action on $40 million of quick wins. These include corporate costs, real estate, as we have already combined many facilities where we shared same location footprint and other indirect cost. For the remaining quarters of 2017, we expect that corporate expense will be between $50 million and $55 million. The estimate for corporate expense remains subject to foreign currency fluctuation on the cash flow hedging. This is not included in our estimate. We're estimating that other merger and integration cost and restructuring costs will be approximately $150 million in the remaining 3 quarters of 2017. We will continue to identify these costs as we have this quarter. We estimate interest expense to be approximately $22 million to $25 million per quarter. We now anticipate our 2017 tax rate to be between 26% and 28% for the full year. One element of our return on invested capital objective is the benefit of a lower tax rate from our planned entity restructuring. Our domicile resulting from the completion of our cross-border merger gives us the ability to reduce the worldwide effective tax rate. We estimate that on a comparable set of earnings, we can initially realize at least 300 basis points of tax saving as our restructuring is completed by year-end. We now expect capital spending in 2017 to be approximately $300 million.
In closing, the first quarter reflects our ability to drive strong financial returns while we continue to execute on our integration strategy and realize synergies, as we have been communicating. We believe we are well positioned to capitalize on new market opportunities and stabilize our business through increasing margin -- market uncertainty. Our solid execution and our previous cost-reduction initiative as well as the opportunities we see for further product cost reduction and technology development are critical elements of our differentiated business models. We are encouraged by the level of project activity we are seeing, but we recognize the pace of order conversion continues to be challenging. We remain ready to respond to the market and manage our businesses to deliver improving return.

So from a Subsea perspective, in terms of our order guidance, we've got largely about 75% of our revenues secured in backlog. And then you know there's a portion of that revenue that's recurring. They're more like service revenues, et cetera. So there's just a small portion of our 2017 revenue estimate today that is not secured. So we feel very confident in the at least $6.1 billion with respect to Subsea. Most of the margin, obviously, in our backlog is solid. Our execution will continue. So for Subsea, not much that we need to see. On the Onshore/Offshore business, we've got probably 85-plus percent of the revenue included in our backlog to deliver those revenues. And as you can see from the quarter, our performance on the Onshore/Offshore segment from a margin perspective was very strong. So again, we think for those 2 segment, we've got the good portion of that for 2017 in hand. Surface, as you know, is a bit different. We've got a little over $400 million in backlog. That business will respond in North America, and we're pretty confident in the recovery there. But obviously, that's not in backlog, and we'll need to see that backlog continue -- or excuse me, that inbound continue throughout the next couple of quarters."

It is important to note, in the first quarter, due to the resurgence of activity of fleet reactivations that we have heard reported for many of the pressure pumping companies, that is our shortest cycle business and we benefited significantly from that resurgence of activity. When they reactivate these frac fleet because of the extended downturn that we just experienced in the North American market, not only does the equipment being maintenance and repaired, but in many cases, it was cannibalized for spare parts, for other ongoing capacity that they had in their active fleet. So this has resulted in what would be similar to new capital orders for us versus just the normal level of maintenance, repairs, inspection and replacement of the high-pressure components of the hydraulic fracturing fleet. So we got that surge. We think that surge will continue into part of Q2 but then we'll go back to a more normalized rate of revenue and margins in that particular business."

In addition to those projects, by working closely and having the intimate relationship and the unique position that we have with our partners, we've been able to work with them to help identify short-cycle Subsea tieback opportunities. And then by leveraging the standard products across TechnipFMC and now the fully integrated capability, we can deliver the full Subsea tieback system installed on the seafloor in approximately 1/2 the time of the normal market. So if you put together a few large projects, in addition to the ones we've already announced, a robust Subsea tieback market and a continued resilience in our Subsea services business, net-net we would expect to step up in 2017 versus 2016."

It's also being deployed on the Shell Kaikias project, and our initial award was for several for Petrobras in Brazil. So the market acceptance continues to accelerate. And, yes, we certainly expect future awards of this nature. It's a very interesting question because it's not just the Compact Manifold. It's the entire Subsea production system. In the past, equipment providers didn't think about installability. Installability  wasn't in their scope. They weren't rewarded for thinking about -- commercially rewarded for thinking about installability, so often the structures that were built lead to very difficult and costly installation campaigns. As one company and the only company that now has the entire water column and installation under one roof, we think very differently. And we now understand that there were significant changes that we can make to the Subsea architecture that will allow the installation to be done in a much more efficient manner and will be able to be done off a more diverse vessel platform. So in other words, we will -- it would naturally work to our benefit if we were able to design equipment that partner very well with our vessel capabilities going forward."

As we complete projects and reduce those balances, we'll see that volatility minimize. But for the next couple of quarters, it is likely that we could see a bit more.

And I think you know from our past experience that we have a strong position in that business. Therefore, we would naturally get the very first orders. It's the best product in the market, and we saw that flush order of activity. There's been an enormous amount of hydraulic horsepower reactivations that have been going on. And remember, we're placing -- when we're taking orders, some of them are booking and turning very quickly. Some of them may be up to 90 days out. So when you think about what you're hearing about some of the fleet reactivation's and when they expect to be completed by, which is you're hearing the third quarter, that's why I'm just saying we'll expect those flush orders to go kind of through our system as we did in the first quarter and through the second quarter. But Rob, we will stabilize at a very high level of activity. It's not that we're not going to have a high level of activity. It's just we won't -- it's just like somebody ordering brand-new frac capacity from our perspective. From their perspective, there's other parts that are not new capital orders. But from our perspective, all of the high-pressure components of the frac system are basically being ordered as if it's a brand-new capital quarter. So logically, that can't continue. That has to stabilize at some point. But the level of activity given the amount of horsepower that will be active in the industry, that business will be at a very high level. So I'm not saying the whole business is going to come down. I'm just saying we'll see the majority of those flush orders come through the system in the first and second quarter."

Some would fit into the classification, as you're saying, world-class. But many would be, I guess, in the middle tier because we don't have the tiebacks on that project list of 19 because we're talking about $250 million or more. Most of the tiebacks fall below that. I think it's a combination of the 2 things clearly. Our position, Rob, is we can help focus on helping improve project economics. And it's not just cost, it's also schedule. So things we can do like I described earlier, we're able to cut costs significantly on a large project on large greenfield project 9 to 15 months. On a small tieback, we can cut it 50% of the time. That's the advantage of having the relationships, of having the install base, of having the service infrastructure to be able to support it and now being able to offer it as one integrated package. The time to first oil is what ultimately drives the project economics on those projects. Clearly, they want to see commodity prices and have confidence in commodity prices. But you saw the breakeven numbers that we included in the presentation earlier today. We now collectively, as TechnipFMC, represent up to 1/3 of the deepwater development cost. And we have a lot more that we can bring in terms of lowering breakevens even further."

We are the only ones to put together an integrated offering that goes from the wellhead to the topside. So we have that unique capability to be able to look at how we design our equipment for installability, how we focus on serviceability, how we can leverage the industry's largest install base. We have over 2,000 Subsea trees operating. We have over 11,000 kilometers of flexible pipe out in the industry today. So there's an enormous platform that we can work from together now as one single company. When you're not together as a single entity and you don't have the same commercial incentive, matter of fact, you can argue that in the regular style, there's actually a disincentive to work together because of the commercial model. So it's just a very different offering than the other offerings that are in the market today. Some projects will continue to go forward in the traditional way where work packages will be split up in 2 ways or sometimes in many ways. Just one point I'd like to mention to your question. We actually won part of Leviathan. We won several of the packages. The Leviathan project was split into many packages. So we are one of the Subsea providers on Leviathan. We are still bidding a package for BP Mad Dog. So when these projects are split up, because of the breadth of our company, we're likely to be involved in the project in one form or another. It may not be the traditional split between SURF and SPS. It may be split in multiple components. And when it is, we'll continue to approach that. We'll remain flexible with our commercial offering. Ultimately, what we want to be able to provide to our customer is the very best solution. And if we can get involved early and work through an integrated FEED and convert that into an integrated EPCI, accelerate to time to first oil at the best project economics, we think we have a winning combination and a unique opportunity to do that. In other cases, we'll bid the package separately and individually if that's what the customers chooses to do. And we'll bid at the level that we think is in the best interest of our company and our shareholders, and that's what we'll do as well. But at the end of the day, what we bring to the market and what we bring to our customers is the widest range of commercial solutions that anybody has to offer. So we believe with the success and the proven success that we've had both on the FEED side now converting in an integrated EPCI as well as the continued success on the à la carte type approach that we're the best position to market, and we're really excited to have everybody together now working as one company."

And the only reason I wanted to back that up a little bit, Byron, is to really understand the capacity and the competency that is now together in one organization. So we're doing quite a bit of FEED work on Onshore/Offshore.

In terms of Subsea, yes, it continues to accelerate both integrated and nonintegrated FEED studies, but it's one of the reasons we have confidence. So it's a little bit like following drilling permits in the U.S. land business.

I will let Doug and Maryann talk about the market and about our first quarter results. But before I do that, I have a special message to our shareholders, clients, partners, employees and to the financial community. On January 17, Doug Pferdehirt became the CEO of TechnipFMC and I became Executive Chairman. Therefore, this earnings call will be my last one. Doug and I and our great teams have created a very unique company, TechnipFMC. I have known Doug for more than 20 years, and he has all my confidence and respect. We are now working together, engaging with customers, reviewing projects and visiting sites of important projects around the world and have turned around the clock. We are also building the future, focusing on customers, targeting the right project in a market that remain challenging but in which we know how to differentiate ourselves.
On a lighter note, sorry, on a lighter note, I don't believe much in coincidence. But today, 27th of April is actually the tenth anniversary of my career at TechnipFMC. In fact, I became Chairman and CEO of TechnipFMC at the Annual Meeting exactly 10 years ago. It has been an incredible journey, and it's not finished. So I wanted to thank all investment community for the confidence but also for challenging me all these years.
With that, I will hand you over to Doug. Doug?"

I deeply appreciate your support, your friendship and your significant contributions that make TechnipFMC a success. On today's call, I will give a brief overview of our operational results and then share my thoughts on the new company, market outlook and a few of our key value drivers. Maryann Mannen will then review our financial performance in more detail and discuss our outlook for 2017 before opening the call for questions.
I am pleased to announce a terrific start for our new company. We generated $3.4 billion in total company revenue. Order intake of $1.6 billion was reflective of lower oil and gas expenditures, and we ended the quarter with $16.1 billion in backlog. Our balance sheet remains strong. We have a net cash of $3.5 billion. And today, we are going to discuss how we intend to deploy a portion of our cash balances.
Our segment results included $427 million of total EBITDA across Subsea, Onshore/Offshore and Surface Technologies. We delivered 17.3% EBITDA margins in Subsea. Onshore/Offshore EBITDA margins increased to 8.6% on strong project execution. And EBITDA margins increased to 14.5% for Surface Technologies.
Moving beyond the financials, I want to talk more about what it really means for us to become one company. As TechnipFMC, we are now uniquely able to leverage our industry-leading, front-end engineering capabilities, our culture of innovation that is bringing to market next-generation solutions and our reputation of superior project management, all necessary to drive the change required to deliver real sustainable improvement and project economics. We are well-positioned from upstream through downstream, providing exposure to both short-cycle businesses and long-cycle businesses. And now our Subsea footprint extends throughout the entire water column, creating the opportunity set to drive a step-change in project economics. We are confident this unique and flexible offering will create significant additional value both on land and offshore, from concept to project delivery and beyond for both our clients and shareholders alike. The foundation of our success lies within our over 40,000 employees who are driven by a mindset of challenging convention and leveraging our broad expertise and R&D capabilities, which encompasses a comprehensive technology opportunity set within TechnipFMC, allowing us to maintain a competitive advantage.
Turning to the market. The recovery in oil prices has fueled the resurgence in North American land activity. Our North American surface technology activity has shown the greatest near-term improvement. We believe that a further increase in the rig count, coupled with additional hydraulic fracturing fleet reactivations, will drive improved results in our North American business. In addition, we continue to benefit from the increased market acceptance of our integrated pad offering, which creates value for our customers through both technology and process improvement. We are now exploring ways to extend or further integrate our offering by leveraging the project management and EPC capabilities within our new company.
Activity in our international Surface Technologies business remains generally stable, although pricing headwinds experienced in 2016 are impacting near-term results. Onshore activity continues to provide the most diverse opportunity set, driven by natural gas, refining and petrochemical projects. We are actively engaged in and pursuing several front-end engineering studies, which provide the platform for early engagement, which can significantly derisk project execution.
We also continue to experience market acceptance of our project management consulting business, a mostly reimbursable activity, driven by our industry-recognized expertise and track record.
Globally, fleet activity in both LNG and petrochemicals is fueled by the potential for sustained, modest natural gas pricing. These results -- this represents an important opportunity set for TechnipFMC by leveraging our process and technologies portfolio and our proven track record. We are tracking several significant onshore projects in the Middle East, Africa and Asia markets both in LNG and refining. We continue to closely monitor ENI Coral floating LNG in both the MIDOR and BAPCO refinery expansion projects.
Moving to Subsea. We can see that the industry's efforts are having a significant impact on project economics with a clear downward trend in project breakeven levels. Recent analysis indicates the breakeven levels have fallen more than 30% since 2014. We believe that most operators have projects that can move forward to current oil prices, with some notable projects having been publicly identified as viable even below $40 breakeven. This is increasing the competitiveness of deepwater assets versus unconventional plays. We are confident our integrated model and continuous innovation will allow us to further this downward trend, helping unlock additional offshore projects.
Our end-to-end capability now translates into the complete Subsea package from wellhead to topside. Using this broader definition of scope, we have identified 19 Subsea projects over the next 24 months that are in various stages of active discussion, each having a potential value that exceeds $250 million. In addition to the project shown here, our partners focus on shorter cycle, less capital-intensive Subsea tiebacks remains robust. Since the time of our last earnings call, we have remained confident that 2017 will represent the inflection in inbound order activity.
Last month, we announced the award of the Shell Kaikias development in the Gulf of Mexico, our third integrated EPCI award, demonstrating the success of this unique fully integrated model. Working with our long-term partner Shell, we significantly simplified the field architecture and equipment packages while accelerating time to first oil. Kaikias has serves its further confirmation of market acceptance of our unique offering. We continue to expect that the current pace of integrated FEED studies will lead to direct project awards in the future, expanding both the customer base and geographical footprint for integrated projects. And as another sign that we have seen the inflection in Subsea order activity, we are excited about a recently announced award for the Subsea production system for the ExxonMobil Liza project. This award also serves as further endorsement of one of our newest technologies, the compact manifold, which will be deployed on this project, creating significant value. While we remain focused on our client success, we continue to look for additional ways to create value for our shareholders. We are focused on delivering synergies and capital allocation that we believe will generate improved financial returns, delivering further value to our shareholders. Our value drivers are focused on 4 key areas: cost synergies, revenue synergies, tax synergies and capital allocation. We have a series of actions in place around each that we believe will deliver at least 300 basis points of incremental returns by 2019. Importantly, these internal initiatives are largely within our control and not predicated on a market recovery. The most significant component of this plan is our cost synergies. We expect these savings will represent as much as 1/2 of the targeted improvement. We have already taken actions that will remove $40 million of cost from the combined company. We remain confident that we will realize the full $400 million of targeted synergies in our 2019 results.
Revenue synergies are also progressing well, and we continue to identify areas where we can achieve tangible synergies. Importantly, these benefits are incremental to any previously announced synergies. We're also realizing benefits from our new domicile. We have identified structural savings that we believe will result in a reduction in our normalized tax rate over the next several years. Given the current strength of the balance sheet, today, we're announcing a plan to return some of this capital to our shareholders. First, our Board of Directors has announced a $500 million share buyback authorization, and we are committed to completing this authorization by the end of 2018. Additionally, we are reaffirming our intent to make dividend distributions. We are planning for a quarterly dividend following our third quarter results, targeting an initial dividend rate that will be sustainable through the business cycle while allowing for growth in the coming years. We are confident that this combination of value drivers can deliver incremental returns of at least 300 basis points by 2019.
In closing, we are just over 3 months into our merger. Because our teams knew each other well, they have hit the ground running. The progress to date has been remarkable. The employee focus has been striking, both on day-to-day business and on capitalizing on the potential of the merger. We posted solid results in our first quarter earnings report. We have started to deliver some of the cost savings to the bottom line and have increased confidence in reaching the targeted savings. Project execution remains a differentiation for TechnipFMC. And the market's enthusiastic adoption of both integrated FEED work and direct project awards for integrated EPCI is a trend we expect to accelerate.
Finally, we see a clear path to improved financial returns, driven by a series of identified value drivers, including the shareholder distributions we announced today. We look forward to the future as we continue executing on our new strategy, driving change and unlocking the tremendous potential of TechnipFMC. I am confident in our ability due to the women and men of TechnipFMC who together provide the unparalleled ability and determination to drive the real change required in our industry.
I will now turn the call over to Maryann."
1342651,424504883,1183192,"TechnipFMC plc, Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2017",2017-04-27,"Earnings Calls","TechnipFMC plc","Executives","Thanks, Doug. I am pleased to report the results of TechnipFMC's first quarter results. Overall, our operational performance across our 3 segments was improved over prior period pro forma result. While revenue overall on the pro forma basis is below the p",1633,"Thanks, Doug. I am pleased to report the results of TechnipFMC's first quarter results. Overall, our operational performance across our 3 segments was improved over prior period pro forma result. While revenue overall on the pro forma basis is below the prior year quarter, on an adjusted EBITDA basis, we saw overall margin improvement of 190 basis points over 2016 from our 3 operating segments. We reported net income of $191 million in the first quarter. Included in these quarterly results are the after-tax costs associated with our merger transaction and integration, our estimated purchase price accounting charges and some minor restructuring and other severance costs, totaling $140 million on an after-tax basis. Our first quarter diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.71, when excluding these after-tax charges were $0.30 per diluted share. The $194 million pretax impact of these charges in our reported results include purchase price accounting adjustment of $86 million for inventory step-up and other impacts, which will not be included in long-term amortization; and purchase price accounting adjustment of $43 million that are included in amortization expense associated with intangible assets, including the amortization of acquired backlog; merger transaction and integration cost of $55 million; and restructuring and other severance costs and impairment charges of $10 million. We reported $379.7 million of operating profit. When considering these charges of $194 million, our adjusted operating profit was $573.2 million. We have provided a schedule in our release filed last evening, which reconciles the reported result to adjusted operating profit.
We will have additional charges in 2017 as we complete our restructuring efforts and integration activities. We'll continue to report them accordingly. We reported $154 million of depreciation and amortization expense, which includes $43 million in amortization-related purchase price accounting adjustment. When these amortization-related charges and credits are excluded, adjusted EBITDA was $684.4 million. Our purchase price adjustment charges recorded in the first quarter are based upon a significant field to fair value analysis completed to date. We expect to complete our analysis in the coming months. These preliminary purchase price accounting adjustments related to the merger were noncash charges. Also included in our quarterly result is a foreign exchange gain of $307 million reported in corporate income and expense net. This result is largely due to the exchange rate of the Russian ruble to the U.S. dollar. We apply a natural hedge approach for the measurement of these gains or losses. It is possible that we will record gains or losses in future periods.
In the fourth quarter of 2016, we increased our ownership stake in the Yamal joint venture and we now hold the controlling stake. This change does impact comparability of the current financial results to prior periods. All of the joint venture revenues and operating profit are recorded in the Onshore/Offshore segment results. Our partner share of profitability is recorded as a future liability with periodic impact recorded in net interest expense. We have constructed the pro forma 2016 results as if the company had maintained same controlling stake throughout 2016 to make quarter-over-quarter comparisons more meaningful.
Moving to segment results. Subsea reported $1.4 billion in the period. On a pro forma basis, quarter-over-quarter revenue comparisons were negatively impacted by lower project activity due to reduced inbound in previous years, resulting in a lower project backlog coming into the current year. Adjusted Subsea EBITDA was $239 million in the quarter with a margin of 17.3% when excluding charges of $97 million. Segment backlog exiting this quarter was $6.6 billion, which compares to prior year backlog of $7 billion.
Moving to our Onshore/Offshore results. Onshore/Offshore revenues for the quarter were $1.8 billion, down 19% on a pro forma basis quarter-over-quarter. Revenues were lower as a result of lower project activity, most notably in the Middle East and Americas. Onshore/Offshore adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was $152 million with margins of 8.6%. The period benefited from strong project execution and the achievement of key project construction milestone. EBITDA margins improved 390 basis points from prior year quarter. Segment backlog exiting the quarter stands at $9.1 billion, which compares to the prior year backlog of $9.4 billion.
Moving to our Surface Technologies result. Revenue for the quarter was $248 million, about 29% below prior year on a pro forma basis due to lower activity in North America -- in our North America business and the impact of pricing on the international business. Surface Technologies adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $36 million when excluding restructuring and purchase price accounting charges of $46 million. EBITDA margins, excluding charges, increased from 8.3% to 14.5%, primarily driven by our lower-cost structure and the beginning of the recovery in the pressure pumping business. Our surface international business began recognizing some lower-priced backlog that was booked during 2016. While pricing has began to stabilize, we have yet to see a pricing recovery in these international markets. Pro forma operating results in our North American business have begun to improve from the bottom following late 2016. Daily orders from pressure pumping activity has significantly increased as customer demand has increased due to fleet reactivation.
Let's turn to the corporate items. Corporate adjusted operating profit in the quarter was $255 million when excluding charges and credit for $51 million. Included in the quarter were net gains of $307 million, mainly due to foreign exchange gain previously discussed. Net interest expense was an expense of $82 million in the quarter, which includes the charge of $68 million due to the remeasurement of a liability payable to joint venture partners. Our first quarter tax rate of 28.4% when excluding the effects of liability remeasurement within net interest expense, which received no tax benefit. Capital spending this quarter was $51 million. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $154 million. Of the total, $43 million was related to purchase price accounting for the merger and was included in total charges and credit. We will continue to identify D&A related to purchase price accounting as such in future periods. At the end of the first quarter, we had net cash of $3.5 billion. It is comprised of $7 billion of cash and $3.5 billion of debt.
Looking forward, full year revenue for Subsea is expected to be at least $6.1 billion. We could see further improvements of this revenue subject to the timing of our project award inbound and backlog project timing. We expect to deliver EBITDA margins, excluding charges, of at least to 17% for the full year 2017.
Looking at the Onshore/Offshore business. Full year revenue is expected to be at least $7.3 billion. We anticipate that with continued strength in project execution, EBITDA margins, excluding charges, should exceed 6.5% for the full year in 2017.
In Surface Technologies, revenue is expected to be at least $1.4 billion. The North America recovery is well underway, and we are seeing the greatest impact in our business. Customer acceptance of our integrated surface offering should also deliver incremental sales in the year. However, improved revenues in North America will see some offset from the international segment, driven largely by the effects of more competitive pricing. In Surface Technologies, we currently expect to realize EBITDA margins, excluding charges, of at least 13% for the full year in 2017. As Doug said, we remain on track to deliver at least $400 million of pretax synergies. As a reminder, our objective is to deliver run rate savings of $200 million by the end of the year and a full $400 million run rate by the end of 2018. For all these savings post to merger are fully in line with our overall targets. We have already taken action on $40 million of quick wins. These include corporate costs, real estate, as we have already combined many facilities where we shared same location footprint and other indirect cost. For the remaining quarters of 2017, we expect that corporate expense will be between $50 million and $55 million. The estimate for corporate expense remains subject to foreign currency fluctuation on the cash flow hedging. This is not included in our estimate. We're estimating that other merger and integration cost and restructuring costs will be approximately $150 million in the remaining 3 quarters of 2017. We will continue to identify these costs as we have this quarter. We estimate interest expense to be approximately $22 million to $25 million per quarter. We now anticipate our 2017 tax rate to be between 26% and 28% for the full year. One element of our return on invested capital objective is the benefit of a lower tax rate from our planned entity restructuring. Our domicile resulting from the completion of our cross-border merger gives us the ability to reduce the worldwide effective tax rate. We estimate that on a comparable set of earnings, we can initially realize at least 300 basis points of tax saving as our restructuring is completed by year-end. We now expect capital spending in 2017 to be approximately $300 million.
In closing, the first quarter reflects our ability to drive strong financial returns while we continue to execute on our integration strategy and realize synergies, as we have been communicating. We believe we are well positioned to capitalize on new market opportunities and stabilize our business through increasing margin -- market uncertainty. Our solid execution and our previous cost-reduction initiative as well as the opportunities we see for further product cost reduction and technology development are critical elements of our differentiated business models. We are encouraged by the level of project activity we are seeing, but we recognize the pace of order conversion continues to be challenging. We remain ready to respond to the market and manage our businesses to deliver improving return.

So from a Subsea perspective, in terms of our order guidance, we've got largely about 75% of our revenues secured in backlog. And then you know there's a portion of that revenue that's recurring. They're more like service revenues, et cetera. So there's just a small portion of our 2017 revenue estimate today that is not secured. So we feel very confident in the at least $6.1 billion with respect to Subsea. Most of the margin, obviously, in our backlog is solid. Our execution will continue. So for Subsea, not much that we need to see. On the Onshore/Offshore business, we've got probably 85-plus percent of the revenue included in our backlog to deliver those revenues. And as you can see from the quarter, our performance on the Onshore/Offshore segment from a margin perspective was very strong. So again, we think for those 2 segment, we've got the good portion of that for 2017 in hand. Surface, as you know, is a bit different. We've got a little over $400 million in backlog. That business will respond in North America, and we're pretty confident in the recovery there. But obviously, that's not in backlog, and we'll need to see that backlog continue -- or excuse me, that inbound continue throughout the next couple of quarters."

It is important to note, in the first quarter, due to the resurgence of activity of fleet reactivations that we have heard reported for many of the pressure pumping companies, that is our shortest cycle business and we benefited significantly from that resurgence of activity. When they reactivate these frac fleet because of the extended downturn that we just experienced in the North American market, not only does the equipment being maintenance and repaired, but in many cases, it was cannibalized for spare parts, for other ongoing capacity that they had in their active fleet. So this has resulted in what would be similar to new capital orders for us versus just the normal level of maintenance, repairs, inspection and replacement of the high-pressure components of the hydraulic fracturing fleet. So we got that surge. We think that surge will continue into part of Q2 but then we'll go back to a more normalized rate of revenue and margins in that particular business."

Of those 19 projects, we would expect several of those to move forward in the next 12 months. In addition to those projects, by working closely and having the intimate relationship and the unique position that we have with our partners, we've been able to work with them to help identify short-cycle Subsea tieback opportunities. And then by leveraging the standard products across TechnipFMC and now the fully integrated capability, we can deliver the full Subsea tieback system installed on the seafloor in approximately 1/2 the time of the normal market. So if you put together a few large projects, in addition to the ones we've already announced, a robust Subsea tieback market and a continued resilience in our Subsea services business, net-net we would expect to step up in 2017 versus 2016."

It's also being deployed on the Shell Kaikias project, and our initial award was for several for Petrobras in Brazil. So the market acceptance continues to accelerate. And yes, we certainly expect future awards of this nature. It's a very interesting question because it's not just the Compact Manifold. It's the entire Subsea production system. In the past, equipment providers didn't think about installability. Installability wasn't in their scope. They weren't rewarded for thinking about -- commercially rewarded for thinking about installability, so often the structures that were built lead to very difficult and costly installation campaigns. As one company and the only company that now has the entire water column and installation under one roof, we think very differently. And we now understand that there were significant changes that we can make to the Subsea architecture that will allow the installation to be done in a much more efficient manner and will be able to be done off a more diverse vessel platform. So in other words, we will -- it would naturally work to our benefit if we were able to design equipment that partner very well with our vessel capabilities going forward."

And I think you know from our past experience that we have a strong position in that business. Therefore, we would naturally get the very first orders. It's the best product in the market, and we saw that flush order of activity. There's been an enormous amount of hydraulic horsepower reactivations that have been going on. And remember, we're placing -- when we're taking orders, some of them are booking and turning very quickly. Some of them may be up to 90 days out. So when you think about what you're hearing about some of the fleet reactivation's and when they expect to be completed by, which is you're hearing the third quarter, that's why I'm just saying we'll expect those flush orders to go kind of through our system as we did in the first quarter and through the second quarter. But Rob, we will stabilize at a very high level of activity. It's not that we're not going to have a high level of activity. It's just we won't -- it's just like somebody ordering brand-new frac capacity from our perspective. From their perspective, there's other parts that are not new capital orders. But from our perspective, all of the high-pressure components of the frac system are basically being ordered as if it's a brand-new capital quarter. So logically, that can't continue. That has to stabilize at some point. But the level of activity given the amount of horsepower that will be active in the industry, that business will be at a very high level. So I'm not saying the whole business is going to come down. I'm just saying we'll see the majority of those flush orders come through the system in the first and second quarter."

Some would fit into the classification, as you're saying, world-class. But many would be, I guess, in the middle tier because we don't have the tiebacks on that project list of 19 because we're talking about $250 million or more. Most of the tiebacks fall below that. I think it's a combination of the 2 things clearly. Our position, Rob, is we can help focus on helping improve project economics. And it's not just cost, it's also schedule. So things we can do like I described earlier, we're able to cut costs significantly on a large project on large greenfield project 9 to 15 months. On a small tieback, we can cut it 50% of the time. That's the advantage of having the relationships, of having the install base, of having the service infrastructure to be able to support it and now being able to offer it as one integrated package. The time to first oil is what ultimately drives the project economics on those projects. Clearly, they want to see commodity prices and have confidence in commodity prices. But you saw the breakeven numbers that we included in the presentation earlier today. We now collectively, as TechnipFMC, represent up to 1/3 of the deepwater development cost. And we have a lot more that we can bring in terms of lowering breakevens even further."

We are the only ones to put together an integrated offering that goes from the wellhead to the topside. So we have that unique capability to be able to look at how we design our equipment for installability, how we focus on serviceability, how we can leverage the industry's largest install base. We have over 2,000 Subsea trees operating. We have over 11,000 kilometers of flexible pipe out in the industry today. So there's an enormous platform that we can work from together now as one single company. When you're not together as a single entity and you don't have the same commercial incentive, matter of fact, you can argue that in the regular style, there's actually a disincentive to work together because of the commercial model. So it's just a very different offering than the other offerings that are in the market today. Some projects will continue to go forward in the traditional way where work packages will be split up in 2 ways or sometimes in many ways. Just one point I'd like to mention to your question. We actually won part of Leviathan. We won several of the packages. The Leviathan project was split into many packages. So we are one of the Subsea providers on Leviathan. We are still bidding a package for BP Mad Dog. So when these projects are split up, because of the breadth of our company, we're likely to be involved in the project in one form or another. It may not be the traditional split between SURF and SPS. It may be split in multiple components. And when it is, we'll continue to approach that. We'll remain flexible with our commercial offering. Ultimately, what we want to be able to provide to our customer is the very best solution. And if we can get involved early and work through an integrated FEED and convert that into an integrated EPCI, accelerate to time to first oil at the best project economics, we think we have a winning combination and a unique opportunity to do that. In other cases, we'll bid the package separately and individually if that's what the customers chooses to do. And we'll bid at the level that we think is in the best interest of our company and our shareholders, and that's what we'll do as well. But at the end of the day, what we bring to the market and what we bring to our customers is the widest range of commercial solutions that anybody has to offer. So we believe with the success and the proven success that we've had both on the FEED side now converting in an integrated EPCI as well as the continued success on the à la carte type approach that we're the best position to market, and we're really excited to have everybody together now working as one company."

In terms of Subsea, yes, it continues to accelerate both integrated and nonintegrated FEED studies, but it's one of the reasons we have confidence. So it's a little bit like following drilling permits in the U.S. land business.

Before I address the second quarter performance, I want to acknowledge that the company filed an 8-K on Monday, advising that we would be restating our earnings for the first quarter. We identified areas related to the rates used in the calculation of foreign currency effects on some of our engineering and construction projects. I am confident that we have corrected these errors and have made the appropriate changes to our internal controls to prevent this issue from reoccurring. Maryann Mannen, our CFO, will provide additional details in her remarks.
Moving to the second quarter. I will give a brief overview of our operational results, discuss our market outlook and provide an update on our key value drivers. Maryann Mannen will then review our financial performance in more detail and update our guidance for 2017 before opening the call for questions.
Second quarter results built upon the strong performance we delivered last quarter. Total revenues for the quarter were $3.8 billion. Total company EBITDA of $501 million grew versus prior-year quarter despite a revenue decline of 22%. This solid performance reflects our strong execution and the impact of the significant actions taken to permanently reduce both infrastructure and product costs. Total company EBITDA margins were 13%, with all segments posting significant increases from prior-year results.  
Subsea EBITDA margins were 21.8%, up 490 basis points. Onshore/Offshore EBITDA margins were 10.4%, up 590 basis points. Given the ongoing strength in this segment, we have increased our Onshore/Offshore margin guidance for full year 2017. And EBITDA margins for surface technologies were 12%, up 910 basis points.
Total company orders for the quarter were $3.2 billion, and we ended the quarter with $15.2 billion of backlog. Our balance sheet remains strong, with net cash of $3.4 billion.
We remain focused on returning capital to our shareholders. We are committed to completing the $500 million share repurchase authorization by the end of 2018. And the TechnipFMC Board of Directors has recently reaffirmed their intention to declare a quarterly dividend following the third quarter results.
We achieved several project milestones this quarter as a result of the solid project execution I was just mentioning.
Prelude FLNG left the South Korean shipyard before the close of the quarter and has arrived in Australia. The for Statoil's project arrived on site in Norway and was successfully guided on location. First production milestones were achieved on both Total, in Congo, as well E&I Creek in Indonesia. We continue to make good progress on Yamal LNG, with commissioning of the first train on schedule. Construction is almost complete on the 142 modules, and we have delivered 109 modules to the site in. Lastly, the Statoil EPCI project in Norway is progressing well. And we remain confident that this fully integrated Subsea development, the first of its kind, will deliver both an accelerated schedule and cost savings to the customer.
Moving to the market outlook. 
TechnipFMC is uniquely positioned across the globe in both short cycle and long cycle businesses. 
In North America, unconventional resource development continues to lead short cycle activity. We have experienced stronger demand for our pressure pump -- for our pressure control equipment in 2017, driven by increased activity and greater completion intensity. Fleet reactivations continued sequentially, but did moderate somewhat in the quarter, as we had suggested it might on the first quarter call. However, the growth in the installed base generates a higher level of consumable demand that requires our inspection, maintenance services, and eventually, product replacement.
Activity levels in our surface technology segment outside of North America remains resilient, although pricing continues to impact near-term profitability. Pricing has stabilized in most international markets, with only limited improvement in a few select markets.
The Middle East and North Africa continue to offer the best near-term outlook for our surface business, with a strong position both on land and in shallow water, as well as opportunities in the North Sea.
Moving to longer cycle businesses. 
Natural gas continues to take increasing share of growing energy demand. Despite near-term supply concerns, projects with low-cost solutions are moving forward.
In the quarter, we were awarded work on 2 important gas projects. TechnipFMC was awarded an important integrated project, including both the Subsea and FLNG packages on the E&I corral project, with a revenue stream that extends through at least 2022.
Following Shell Prelude FLNG and Petronas [indiscernible] FLNG, this award further demonstrated our leadership in the FLNG market.
Additionally, Nova Tech announced the frame agreement with TechnipFMC to design and develop future LNG plans for Arctic LNG 2 and subsequent projects. As a reminder, Nova Tech is the majority owner and operator of the Yamal LNG project. Our partner is looking to develop solutions that significantly improve the economics of LNG development in the Arctic region, transforming these world-class reservoirs into low-cost feedstock that can compete on a global basis. This project is a tremendous opportunity for us to demonstrate the value we bring through early engagement of our extensive front-end engineering capabilities. We are honored that Nova Tech has again chosen TechnipFMC as a key partner for this new endeavor.
Given the outlook for demand, as well as our own conversations with customers, we remain confident that the industry will make further LNG investments in the near to intermediate term. These large projects, whether they be Onshore/Offshore, can take 5 to 7 years to move from sanctioning the first gas. TechnipFMC can now address this next wave of investment as a fully integrated provider of front-end engineering capabilities, world-class project management, and EPC IC capabilities and gas processing technologies onshore, while providing an even higher level of integration offshore with the complete Subsea production architecture included.
Tender activity also continues for non-LNG downstream projects in both refining and petrochemicals, focused primarily in the Middle East, Asia and Russia. The most likely awards in the near-term are driven by expansions to existing facilities. An example being the MIDOR refinery expansion in Egypt. For these opportunities, we can leverage our experience as the initial contractor to significantly improve project execution and provide greater certainty to project scheduling.
We are also pursuing new opportunities where we can compete on our technical strengths. Our project management consultancy practice leverages our world-class project management skills to provide alternative solutions to the full scale EPC contracting model. Our process technologies business continues to serve as a key market differentiator with a strong portfolio of unique technologies that serve a broad range of end markets.
Turning to Subsea inbound. 
Orders improved sequentially to $1.8 billion, driven by a diversified mix of order activity. For the first half of 2017, we had strong Subsea inbound of $2.4 billion, which keeps us on track to deliver a step up in inbound compared to the $3.9 billion in orders reported for the full year 2016.
In Guyana, we were awarded the Subsea production system and umbilical for Exxon Mobil's Lisa project. For I coral project in Mozambique, our integrated offering included the surf installation package, as well as the previously mentioned FLNG package. These projects are particularly significant since both Liza and Korell represent pioneer projects in front tier basins with significant potential for future development.
Also, in the quarter, we were awarded expanded scope on the Statoil Visa North project in the North Sea. This is our fifth fully integrated I EPCI award and our second for Statoil, who is realizing the benefits of our IEPCI model on our trade project. 
Subsea services expanded its light well intervention business in Asia-Pacific, announcing a frame agreement with Woodside Petroleum, building on the agreement announced earlier this year with Impacts. We continue to view Subsea Services as an important growth opportunity.
And in Brazil, we received new orders for flexible risers from Petrobras, an important award that demonstrates continued demand for this technology.
Strength in smaller awards were driven by Subsea tiebacks, product sales and our unique position with alliance partners resulting in direct awards.
As a reminder, last fall, we called for an inflection in Subsea order activity in 2017. Over the first 7 months of the year, 5 major projects have been sanctioned: AP's Mad Dog 2, Shell's Nova's Leviathan, Exxon Mobil's Lisa, and Korell, with the related award of Subsea equipment packages and surf contracts. This market activity already exceeds the amount of major Subsea project awards in all of 2016.
Looking ahead, we are tracking 18 large projects on our Subsea opportunity list, which could be sanctioned over the next 24 months. This project list represents approximately $15 billion of combined Subsea scope. Given the breadth of our product and service offering, we are well-positioned to compete in some capacity on this entire set of projects.
On the strength of our first half Subsea inbound, we are well-positioned for a step-up in full year inbound versus 2016. In the second half of the year, we are anticipating 2 or 3 of these named projects to be awarded, with the remaining inbound to be met with incremental Subsea service, product and small project awards. We are tracking the progress of our integrated feed portfolio and anticipate further IEPCI project conversions in the coming quarters.
Despite our internal conviction in the order outlook, we continue to closely monitor customer activity in the context of oil price uncertainty. We recognize that the risk of further projects sanctioning delays has increased in the current environment. However, project economics have improved considerably since the market peak. Many projects make economic sense below $50 oil, some, far below that level. With our unique business model, we are confident that we can continue to further reduce project breakeven levels, allowing for development of an even greater number of deepwater assets.
Independent of the timing of the market recovery, as a result of our merger, we are focused on delivering at least 300 basis points of incremental improvement to our financial returns through 2019. The key drivers of this plan are largely within our control; $400 million of cost synergies to be realized in full by 2019; tax savings of at least 300 basis points before considering any potential changes in revenue mix; and a continued focus on how we manage our capital.
With respect to the balance sheet, we have received approval by the U.K. courts to create the distributable reserves needed to manage our capital allocation strategy. This milestone allows us to begin a disciplined share repurchase program, with the goal to buy back $500 million in total by the end of 2018.
Additionally, the TechnipFMC Board of Directors has reaffirmed its commitment to declare a quarterly dividend following the release of our third quarter results.
In closing. We have delivered another strong quarter of operating results. Our first half performance gives us confidence in our ability to successfully deliver our updated 2017 guidance. We had a solid improvement in inbound orders across all segments, nearly doubling the inbound from the prior quarter. We remain confident in a step-up for full year Subsea inbound, although the recent commodity uncertainty could result in a slowing in the pace of recovery.
Despite the external environment, I have the utmost confidence that we will continue to deliver on the commitments we have made, both to our customers, as well as the investment community. Meeting these commitments is dependent upon the successful integration of TechnipFMC, and I am encouraged by the collaborative efforts I have witnessed as I have traveled the globe. I am most proud of the over 40,000 women and men of TechnipFMC and acknowledge their relentless efforts to transform our company and our industry. The team remains focused on operational excellence on our current projects, demonstrated by the achievement of key project milestones I described earlier, accelerated development of unique integrated technologies, creating real structural improvement in project economics, further differentiating TechnipFMC, and the collaborative approach to identifying additional integrated offerings across our portfolio. All while delivering solid operational results.
I will now turn the call over to Maryann."

I am pleased to report our solid results for the second quarter.
On a pro forma basis, adjusted EBITDA increased to $501 million, up 44% from the prior quarter. Margins improved 600 basis points. We think very good performance when considering revenue declined 22% year-over-year. 
Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.45, when excluding after-tax charges and credits of $0.10 per diluted share. Included in these quarterly results are the after-tax charges and credits associated with our merger transaction and integration, our estimated purchase price accounting charges, and restructuring and other severance costs totaling $65 million.
The balance sheet remains strong with a net cash position of $3.4 billion. And we will be returning some of this capital to shareholders in the current quarter as we begin our share repurchase activity.
Backlog stands at $15.2 billion, reflecting the strong order intake we experienced in this period.
Moving to our segment results. 
Subsea reported $1.7 billion of revenue in the period. On a pro forma basis, quarter-over-quarter revenue comparisons were negatively impacted by lower project activity in Europe and Africa due to reduced inbound in previous years, resulting in lower project backlog coming into the current year. 
Adjusted EBITDA for the segment was $377 million, with a margin of 21.8% when excluding identified charges of $46 million. These margins reflect strong project execution, as we recognized significant project milestones within the business, such as , Kaombo and John Creek. Also contributing to our operating margin performance was our ongoing cost reductions and restructuring activities. 
Other highlights from this segment that I'd like to point out would be the strength of inbound orders in the quarter, as they more than doubled sequentially, resulting in a book-to-bill of 1. Segment backlog exiting the quarter was $6.2 billion. Please keep in mind that we do not backlog the majority of our Subsea services revenue.
Moving on to our Onshore/Offshore segment results. 
Onshore/Offshore reported $1.8 billion of revenue in the period. On a pro forma basis, quarter-over-quarter revenue comparisons were negatively impacted due to the completion of several projects since the prior-year period, most notably in the Middle East and Americas. 
Adjusted Offshore onshore EBITDA was $188 million in the quarter, with a margin of 10.4% when excluding benefits of $28 million, which resulted from successful evolution of pending project disputes, including the Algiers in platform. Our profitability improved year-over-year despite the 20% revenue decline, as we recognized the achievement of several key construction milestones. Inbound orders in the quarter were $1.1 billion.
An item of note that pertains the inbound orders in the quarter is that the FLNG scope of the coral project is not fully consolidated because of the joint venture structure. As a reminder, we are partners in the FLNG scope and do not have majority ownership. This portion of our work on the project we've reported in net income of noncontrolling interest. The order intake recorded in the non-op segment reflects only the work awarded directly to TechnipFMC by the joint venture, which was just under $300 million in the quarter. As for the surf for the projects, this will not be included in the joint venture and will be reported in the Subsea segment.
Moving to our Surface Technologies segment. 
Surface Technologies reported $300 million of revenue in the period. On a pro forma basis, revenues were unchanged from the prior-year quarter.
[ Strengths ] in North America land was partially offset by the decline in the international land market. Adjusted EBITDA of $36 million in the quarter, with a margin of 12% when excluding charges of $23 million. Our second quarter in this segment has typically been our weakest margin quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margins increased 910 basis points despite the flat revenue year-over-year. Operating performance improved significantly year-over-year, primarily due to the benefit of product mix related to fluid control sale and the more favorable cost structure. We delivered another solid quarter on our flow control business. That would serve the pressure pumping market as we saw hydraulic fleet reactivations continuing throughout the quarter. Segment backlog continues to be primarily tied to our international business as it tends to be more longer cycle in nature.
Let's turn to the corporate items in the quarter.
First, we issued an 8-K yesterday to report changes to our Q1 2017 reported financials. We recognize the concern this may present. The necessary changes were the result of errors in the computation of certain FX results due to the use of incorrect rates. The management identified the issue while reviewing the balance sheet position and future anticipated gains and losses. We have conducted a thorough review. We have improved the internal control, and are confident that we have taken the necessary actions to assure this will not recur.
Let me also note the following summary points. 
There is no impact to the operational performance of the company. With respect to guidance, foreign exchange gains or losses were not included, so no update was needed as a result of the restatement. This issue applies only to natural cash flow hedges. There was no impact to derivative based hedges. This has no impact on cash balances and had no impact on the backlog figures presented in our original Q1 filings.
Now let's turn to corporate items in the quarter. 
Reported corporate expense was $122.3 million. When excluding charges, corporate expense was $99 million. Included in the quarter results is $62 million of losses associated with foreign currency. Corporate costs excluding these items were slightly below our estimates. 
Next, net interest expense was $72 million, and includes $62 million of additional liability to the joint venture partners.
Moving on to the tax provision for the quarter. We reported a tax provision of $86 million, resulting in a tax rate of 35.2%. When excluding the impact of a charge associated with a project cancellation in Venezuela, the effective tax rate was 25.9%.
Now let me provide an update on our merger-related synergies. 
We remain on track to deliver at least $400 million of pretax synergies. As we have previously discussed, we have allocated saving targets across 3 major categories. First, corporate and other have been the primary source of early quick wins. Savings here have come from real estate, centralized business functions and professional services. We are also making good progress in securing near-term savings from our supply chain. And operations remain the greatest source of savings, and actions continue to ramp with the acceleration of our integration activities. In total, we have taken specific actions through the first half of the year that will generate more than $100 million in run rate savings by the end of this year. We will continue to give you quarterly updates on our progress using the same format and methodology. As you can see, we are making good progress in securing these savings needed to meet our cost savings goal. We remain confident that we will deliver the targeted run rate savings of $200 million by year-end and a full $400 million in run rate savings by the end of 2018.
Looking forward, we have made updates to the full year guidance we provided in the first quarter. The full table of guidance, including updates, can be found in both the second quarter press release, as well as the presentations slides that accompany this earnings call. 
Changes to previous guidance are as follows. For Onshore/Offshore, due the the strong performance in the first half of the year, we now expect segments EBITDA guidance to be at least 8%, excluding charges for the full year, which is an increase of 150 basis points versus prior guidance. Going forward, net interest expense should be $20 million to $22 million per quarter in 2017, and does not assume any future increases to partner liability. For the full year, we now expect our tax rate to be in a range of 28% to 32%. We expect to spend approximately $125 million for merger and integration costs in the back half of the year.
Beyond these updates, we are reiterating our business segment expectations. Subsea revenue of at least $6.1 billion, with adjusted EBITDA margins of at least 17%; Onshore/Offshore revenue of at least $7.3 billion, with revised EBITDA margin guidance of at least 8%. And for Surface Technologies, we continue to expect revenue of at least $1.4 billion for the full year, with adjusted EBITDA margin of at least 13%. Capital expenditures were $56 million in the period. These expenditures totaled $108 million for the first half of 2017. We continue to expect capital expenditure to be approximately $300 million for the full year.
In conclusion, we had solid performance in the second quarter, given our execution, project milestone achievements and the benefits of our restructuring initiatives over the last year. Subsea Inbound of $1.8 billion supports our belief that the inflection for award activity and order inbound for Subsea. We are cautiously optimistic about the second half inbound for 2017. Our Onshore/Offshore business benefited from solid project execution and delivery against key milestones. We expect Surface Technologies to benefit from the improving market activity in North America in the back half of 2017, given the strength in the consumable business and as international pricing pressure further stabilizes. We believe this performance will support achievement of our 2017 targets.

And we'll continue to do everything we can to ensure that our cost structure remains competitive as the market dynamics evolve. That being said, as we indicated in our prepared remarks, we did achieve the completion of several major projects in the quarter, which had some benefit to that order, but also, therefore, creates some additional capacity or a potential underutilization in the coming quarters. So I think it's the balance of understanding how our projects or how we've completed some of our projects, the challenges that we'll have in the market as we go forward as a result of the timing of the inbound. An important quarter for us, as we pointed out, $1.8 billion in Subsea inbound, tripling what we had in the first quarter and setting us at a very strong position for the first half of the year. But we have to look at that, and we have to look at that mix of inbound, when it's actually going to be converted into revenue. We're a big -- we're a broader company now. Some inbound, we can convert quicker, for instance, equipment manufacturing, then the installation, which obviously comes at a later phase. So we have to look at all these things and take those into consideration. And when we did, we felt that we made the prudent decision by maintaining the Subsea margin guidance where it was, realizing that there are some additional challenges that lie ahead. Finally, we have seen the inbound inflection or the inflection in the inbound, excuse me, and we are committed to delivering world-class projects to our customers. And as a result of that, we're going to have to make some strategic decisions on bridging some investment in people, and capabilities and competencies through this period of time to ensure that we'll be able to deliver these projects world-class to our customers."

It's on those projects that we can deliver significant value for our customers, while ensuring an adequate return for ourselves and our shareholders. So it's a mix. The open market, if you will, is quite competitive, but we're uniquely positioned because we have the complete integrated offering now as TechnipFMC. And we also have new technologies, as we talked about, that we were able to deploy on a project like Exxon Mobil Lisa, where it was competitively tendered, but we were able to demonstrate that we had the right solution for our customer to meet a fast-track delivery schedule. The coral FLNG project, which we were able to deliver as an integrated project, delivering both the FLNG vessel, as well as the Subsea package as a direct award, not as a competitive tender on the Subsea portion of that award. So we have these unique positions that allow us to, if you will, have certain activity that is not exposed to the competitive market, including, by the way, and a very important piece of our business, is the direct awards that we received from our partners, and then there is the portion that's open to the competitive market. We do everything we can in that situation to demonstrate to our customers where we can bring value in other way, but in some cases, it is just an open competitive tender.

In an important quarter for inbound, absolutely seeing a book-to-bill with the one in front of it, it's been some time in our industry, so we're very proud of that. That doesn't mean that we won't have lumpy quarters going forward, but we are very pleased with the inbound level this quarter. Talking a little bit about that inbound. We had several major projects as part of that inbound, as we discussed in the prepared remarks, which is important. But really, all of the Subsea projects that have been awarded year-to-date, because of the breadth off TechnipFMC, we've been involved in one way or another. Maybe it was a product sales or umbilicals or maybe it was the installation or the Subsea equipment or the freight and engineering. But we're involved in almost all of these projects. You're right to point out that there was a healthy level of 2 things. 1, Subsea services inbound, which is often underappreciated. It's resilient. It's -- we have the largest installed base of Subsea equipment in the world. In many basins, well over 50% of the install base. Globally, we have over 2,000 trees, 2,200 automation and control system Subsea, 11,000 kilometers of flexible pipe and 5,000 kilometers of umbilicals. This is a solid platform for us to build our Subsea services offering and ensure our customers the ultimate uptime performance. In addition to that, there was quite a few smaller awards as we would refer to and all the awards below the threshold that we would issue a press release for a materiality point of view. And yes, a lot of those come as direct awards from our partner accounts. We work with them proactively. They have standardized suites of equipment, which allows them to order equipment in advance of a project to ensure a short cycle time and accelerated first oil. I'll pass it over to Maryann who will add additional comments on your question on the backlog."

So let's start with -- we'll go backwards kind of in the order that you presented the segments. So let's start with Surface Technologies. No, no change, and probably the most resilient in this environment. What we have talked about the last several quarters is just wanting to temper the North America -- the robustness of the North America market with the reality of the international market and in the pricing pressure in the international market. This was simply a result, when the North America market slows down, assets and capabilities move in to the international market, that has an effect on capacity, lowering price. When the North America market returns, those companies and assets tend to go back to the North America market. Our international market or the market outside of North America remains very robust in terms of activity level, but does have headwinds in terms of pricing. So Surface Technologies, absolutely no change, and the outlook remains strong. In terms of Onshore/Offshore, as you know, this is a business that's really triggered around very large project awards. We have a nice stable foundation from our process and technologies business, which is a real differentiator for our company. And we obviously are executing some very large projects and executing those projects well, which include levels of reimbursable activity. But regarding the inbound in the second half of the year, yes, we are tracking 3 to 4 large projects. And again, depending upon the timing of those projects being awarded, will create a certain level of an unevenness throughout the quarters, throughout the coming quarters in Onshore/Offshore. But we are tracking very closely a several large projects. And in terms of Subsea, as I've discussed before, I think we've given up a strong visibility into the view again. Remember, that there's a strong foundation from the Subsea services, if you will, kind of reoccurring activity that we have as a result of the large installed base. And as we said, we expect 2 to 3 large projects be awarded in the second half of the year. We continue, and I think this is important, to have the unique opportunity, to have the integrated feed studies. And we have a large portfolio of integrated feed studies. So we now can watch those integrated feed studies as they mature to the point of conversion. And the ability to be able to move those and convert those projects, in more cases, as a direct award, can be quite significant. And just to give you an example, when you look at that portfolio, we have over $1 billion of projects that could be direct award and converted in the integrated EPCI projects in the coming quarters. Finally, in terms of restructuring and costs, of course, we'll stay on top of it. We continued to look at it. We continued to stay focus on delivering to our synergy targets in regards of the merger as well."

But they'll be on the water and headed to by the end of the summer. So the team has done a good job and continues to stay focused on, first and foremost, safety and well being of a very large workforce and meeting the deliverables for our customer. So Yamal continues to go quite well. When we complete activity at a yard, there is often -- it doesn't just end when the module ships. There's always additional closures that need to be done, additional considerations that need to be taken care of. And then only at that point can we close out that particular yard and move on. And so, Sean, I guess to the point I wanted to maybe make was, you talk about some holdback releases. This is really a project where we're just executing very, very strongly. So in terms of holdback releases, there is a lot of project left ahead of us. I mean there's a lot of work to be done. There is an important delivery milestone commissioning later this year, and we remain very much focused and getting all the modules still delivered on-site and moving forward with all the construction. And again, although we're delivering a large portion of the project, there is many other contractors involved, delivering different portions of the overall project.

So to your question, as profitability may improve in the project, it increases the ultimate liability that we will pay to our partner. So we established a liability at the end of 12 31. And as we reach key milestones and improve that, we record that incremental, if you will, liability, which will eventually be paid to the partner.

We do participate in that market, and we will continue to, but only at a level of -- only at a level that we're willing to accept, be that in terms of returns or be that in terms of risks associated with terms and conditions. More importantly, when we're talking about partners, when we're talking about integrated feed converting into converted EPCI direct awards, these things are -- this is a different discussion. This is a discussion about unlocking the potential of a Subsea asset. In some cases, it's unlocking the potential of a customer's asset that otherwise would not have been unlocked. So it's a completely different discussion. And we are uniquely positioned to have quite a bit of our exposure in that area not being entirely exposed to that open market. And again, where it does come down to relationships, where does come down to the discipline within the organization, and the rigor and the tendering process to be able that we ensure that we can identify those risks and mitigate those risks before accepting or before tendering on such a project."

Look, there is always a focus -- our customers are always focused on ensuring that they're delivering their best returns for their shareholders and ensuring that they're getting the best value out of the project. So there's always that economic discussion. You raised a very good point. Just 6 to 9 months ago, that was the only discussion. And quite frankly, we spent a period of over 5, 6 quarters where you would simply go back, you would present. And the answer was always thank you very much. Can you go and reengineer? Or can you go and try to drive some more costs out of the project? And that was really the extent of the discussion. It is true that over the last several quarters or a couple of quarters, to be more specific, the tone of the conversation has been more balanced around, first oil, around accelerated schedules, around project certainty. So project certainty and schedule certainty has become as important as costs. That's where TechnipFMC is uniquely positioned because we are now the only company who install Subsea who delivers Subsea installed on the sea floor. So that whole schedule certainty, that schedule risk, that interface between the equipment manufacturer and the installation company, which often resulted in variation orders, delays and the marriage incurred on the vessels, we now can manage that. And we have the full visibility in our manufacturing capacity, as well as the vessel fleet, so we can manage that to ensure that we have no downtime and we can drive accelerated and improved accelerated schedule, accelerated first oil and improved schedule certainty for our customers. So that's clearly been a change in the tone. But there has been another change, and I think this is really important to understand. Our industry has always been -- there's always been quite a bit of latency in terms of technology adoption. You hear about these wonderful technologies with some great technology companies within the oilfield services space. But they never really seemed to really make that impact, to really start to generate 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30% of their revenue from those technologies. That's always been an issue of those industry. And I have to say though, just within the last quarter, the amount envisaged that we've had to our technology center were high-level customers are bringing their management teams to see what we are doing to transform the face of Subsea architecture simpler, lighter, more easily installable, more serviceable has really, really ramped up. I mean it's been tremendous amount of my personal time and the time of our leadership team to host these visits, which really just gives me a clear indication that they're serious about doing things differently. So when you put that together, we're really quite excited about where we are. Again, we have to be realistic. We have to understand that there's certain uncertainties in the market. And we'll remain balance then in our view. But certainly, our customers behavior has been very positive."

We are focused on delivering those synergies, and realizing those synergies and accelerating the realization of those synergies as opposed to necessarily raising synergy targets. There maybe a time and a place, but I think what's most important right now given the industry backdrop and the challenging market that we're in is realizing and make real the synergies that our teams have already identified.

Before I address the second quarter performance, I want to acknowledge that the company filed an 8-K on Monday, advising that we would be restating our earnings for the first quarter. We identified areas related to the rates used in the calculation of foreign currency effects on some of our engineering and construction projects. I am confident that we have corrected these errors and have made the appropriate changes to our internal controls to prevent this issue from reoccurring. Maryann Mannen, our CFO, will provide additional details in her remarks.
Moving to the second quarter. I will give a brief overview of our operational results, discuss our market outlook and provide an update on our key value drivers. Maryann Mannen will then review our financial performance in more detail and update our guidance for 2017 before opening the call for questions.
Second quarter results built upon the strong performance we delivered last quarter. Total revenues for the quarter were $3.8 billion. Total company EBITDA of $501 million grew versus prior-year quarter despite a revenue decline of 22%. This solid performance reflects our strong execution and the impact of the significant actions taken to permanently reduce both infrastructure and product costs. Total company EBITDA margins were 13%, with all segments posting significant increases from prior-year results.  
Subsea EBITDA margins were 21.8%, up 490 basis points. Onshore/Offshore EBITDA margins were 10.4%, up 590 basis points. Given the ongoing strength in this segment, we have increased our Onshore/Offshore margin guidance for full year 2017. And EBITDA margins for surface technologies were 12%, up 910 basis points.
Total company orders for the quarter were $3.2 billion, and we ended the quarter with $15.2 billion of backlog. Our balance sheet remains strong, with net cash of $3.4 billion.
We remain focused on returning capital to our shareholders. We are committed to completing the $500 million share repurchase authorization by the end of 2018. And the TechnipFMC Board of Directors has recently reaffirmed their intention to declare a quarterly dividend following the third quarter results.
We achieved several project milestones this quarter as a result of the solid project execution I was just mentioning. Prelude FLNG left the South Korean shipyard just before the close of the quarter and has arrived in Australia. The spar for Statoil's Aasta Hansteen project arrived on site in Norway and was successfully righted on location. First production milestones were achieved on both Total Moho Nord in Congo as well ENI Jangkrik in Indonesia. 
We continue to make good progress on Yamal LNG, with commissioning of the first train on schedule. Construction is almost complete on the 142 modules, and we have delivered 109 modules to the site in Sabetta. Lastly, the Statoil Trestakk iEPCI project in Norway is progressing well. And we remain confident that this fully integrated Subsea development, the first of its kind, will deliver both an accelerated schedule and cost savings to the customer.
Moving to the market outlook. TechnipFMC is uniquely positioned across the globe in both short cycle and long cycle businesses. In North America, unconventional resource development continues to lead short cycle activity. We have experienced stronger demand for our pressure pump -- for our pressure control equipment in 2017, driven by increased activity and greater completion intensity. 
Fleet reactivations continued sequentially, but did moderate somewhat in the quarter, as we had suggested it might on the first quarter call. However, the growth in the installed base generates a higher level of consumable demand that requires our inspection, maintenance services, and eventually, product replacement.
Activity levels in our surface technology segment outside of North America remains resilient, although pricing continues to impact near-term profitability. Pricing has stabilized in most international markets, with only limited improvement in a few select markets.
The Middle East and North Africa continue to offer the best near-term outlook for our surface business with a strong position, both on land and in shallow water, as well as opportunities in the North Sea.
Moving to longer cycle businesses. Natural gas continues to take increasing share of growing energy demand. Despite near-term supply concerns, projects with low-cost solutions are moving forward.
In the quarter, we were awarded work on 2 important gas projects. TechnipFMC was awarded an important integrated project, including both the Subsea and FLNG packages on the ENI Coral project, with a revenue stream that extends through at least 2022. Following Shell Prelude FLNG and Petronas Satu FLNG, this award further demonstrates our leadership in the FLNG market.
Additionally, Nova Tech announced the frame agreement with TechnipFMC to design and develop future LNG plans for Arctic LNG 2 and subsequent projects. As a reminder, Nova Tech is the majority owner and operator of the Yamal LNG project. Our partner is looking to develop solutions that significantly improve the economics of LNG development in the Arctic region, transforming these world-class reservoirs into low-cost feedstock that can compete on a global basis. This project is a tremendous opportunity for us to demonstrate the value we bring through early engagement of our extensive front-end engineering capabilities. We are honored that Nova Tech has again chosen TechnipFMC as a key partner for this new endeavor.
Given the outlook for demand, as well as our own conversations with customers, we remain confident that the industry will make further LNG investments in the near to intermediate term. These large projects, whether they be onshore or offshore, can take 5 to 7 years to move from sanctioning the first gas. TechnipFMC can now address this next wave of investment as a fully integrated provider of front-end engineering capabilities, world-class project management, and EPCIC capabilities and gas processing technologies onshore, while providing an even higher level of integration offshore with a complete Subsea production architecture included.
Tender activity also continues for non-LNG downstream projects in both refining and petrochemicals, focused primarily in the Middle East, Asia and Russia. The most likely awards in the near-term are driven by expansions to existing facilities. An example being the MIDOR refinery expansion in Egypt. For these opportunities, we can leverage our experience as the initial contractor to significantly improve project execution and provide greater certainty to project scheduling.
We are also pursuing new opportunities where we can compete on our technical strengths. Our project management consultancy practice leverages our world-class project management skills to provide alternative solutions to the full scale EPC contracting model. Our process technologies business continues to serve as a key market differentiator with a strong portfolio of unique technologies that serve a broad range of end markets.
Turning to Subsea inbound. Orders improved sequentially to $1.8 billion, driven by a diversified mix of order activity. For the first half of 2017, we had strong Subsea inbound of $2.4 billion, which keeps us on track to deliver a step up in inbound compared to the $3.9 billion in orders reported for the full year 2016.
In Guyana, we were awarded the subsea production system and umbilical for ExxonMobil's Liza project. For ENI's Coral project in Mozambique, our integrated offering included the surf installation package, as well as the previously mentioned FLNG package. These projects are particularly significant since both Liza and Coral represent pioneer projects in front-tier basins with significant potential for future development.
Also, in the quarter, we were awarded expanded scope on the Statoil Visund Nord project in the North Sea. This is our fifth fully integrated iEPCI award and our second for Statoil, who is realizing the benefits of our iEPCI model on their Trestakk project. 
Subsea services expanded its Riserless Light Well Intervention business in Asia-Pacific, announcing a frame agreement with Woodside Petroleum, building on the agreement announced earlier this year with INPEX. We continue to view Subsea Services as an important growth opportunity.
And in Brazil, we received new orders for flexible risers from Petrobras, an important award that demonstrates continued demand for this technology.
Strength in smaller awards were driven by Subsea tiebacks, product sales and our unique position with alliance partners resulting in direct awards --
As a reminder, last fall, we called for an inflection in Subsea order activity in 2017. Over the first 7 months of the year, 5 major projects have been sanctioned: BP's Mad Dog 2, Shell's Kaikias, Noble's Leviathan, ExxonMobil's Liza, and ENI's Coral, with the related award of Subsea equipment packages and surf contracts. This market activity already exceeds the amount of major Subsea project awards in all of 2016.
Looking ahead, we are tracking 18 large projects on our Subsea opportunity list, which could be sanctioned over the next 24 months. This project list represents approximately $15 billion of combined Subsea scope. Given the breadth of our product and service offering, we are well positioned to compete in some capacity on this entire set of projects.
On the strength of our first half Subsea inbound, we are well positioned for a step-up in full year inbound versus 2016. In the second half of the year, we are anticipating 2 or 3 of these named projects to be awarded, with the remaining inbound to be met with incremental Subsea service, product and small project awards. We are tracking the progress of our integrated feed portfolio and anticipate further iEPCI project conversions in the coming quarters.
Despite our internal conviction in the order outlook, we continue to closely monitor customer activity in the context of oil price uncertainty. We recognize that the risk of further project sanctioning delays has increased in the current environment. However, project economics have improved considerably since the market peak. Many projects make economic sense below $50 oil, some, far below that level. With our unique business model, we are confident that we can continue to further reduce project breakeven levels, allowing for development of an even greater number of deepwater assets.
Independent of the timing of the market recovery, as a result of our merger, we are focused on delivering at least 300 basis points of incremental improvement to our financial returns through 2019. The key drivers of this plan are largely within our control: $400 million of cost synergies to be realized in full by 2019; tax savings of at least 300 basis points before considering any potential changes in revenue mix; and a continued focus on how we manage our capital.
With respect to the balance sheet, we have received approval by the U.K. courts to create the distributable reserves needed to manage our capital allocation strategy. This milestone allows us to begin a disciplined share repurchase program, with the goal to buy back $500 million in total by the end of 2018.
Additionally, the TechnipFMC Board of Directors has reaffirmed its commitment to declare a quarterly dividend following the release of our third quarter results.
In closing, we have delivered another strong quarter of operating results. Our first half performance gives us confidence in our ability to successfully deliver our updated 2017 guidance. We had a solid improvement in inbound orders across all segments, nearly doubling the inbound from the prior quarter. We remain confident in a step-up for full year Subsea inbound, although the recent commodity uncertainty could result in a slowing in the pace of recovery.
Despite the external environment, I have the utmost confidence that we will continue to deliver on the commitments we have made, both to our customers as well as the investment community. Meeting these commitments is dependent upon the successful integration of TechnipFMC, and I am encouraged by the collaborative efforts I have witnessed as I have traveled the globe. I am most proud of the over 40,000 women and men of TechnipFMC and acknowledge their relentless efforts to transform our company and our industry. The team remains focused on operational excellence on our current projects, demonstrated by the achievement of key project milestones I described earlier, accelerated development of unique integrated technologies, creating real structural improvement in project economics, further differentiating TechnipFMC, and the collaborative approach to identifying additional integrated offerings across our portfolio. All while delivering solid operational results.
I will now turn the call over to Maryann."

On a pro forma basis, adjusted EBITDA increased to $501 million, up 44% from the prior quarter. Margins improved 600 basis points. We think very good performance when considering revenue has declined 22% year-over-year. 
Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.45, when excluding after-tax charges and credit of $0.10 per diluted share. Included in these quarterly results are the after-tax charges and credit associated with our merger transaction and integration, our estimated purchase price accounting charges, and the restructuring and other severance costs totaling $65 million.
The balance sheet remains strong with a net cash position of $3.4 billion. And we will be returning some of this capital to shareholders in the current quarter as we begin our share repurchase activity.
Backlog stands at $15.2 billion, reflecting the strong order intake we experienced in this period.
Moving to our segment results. Subsea reported $1.7 billion of revenue in the period. On a pro forma basis, quarter-over-quarter revenue comparisons were negatively impacted by lower project activity in Europe and Africa due to reduced inbound in previous years, resulting in lower project backlog coming into the current year. 
Adjusted EBITDA for the segment was $377 million, with a margin of 21.8% when excluding identified charges of $46 million. These margins reflect strong project execution, as we recognized significant project milestones within the business, such as: Moho Nord, Kaombo and Jangkrik. Also, contributing to our operating margin performance was our ongoing cost reductions and restructuring activities. 
Other highlights from this segment that I'd like to point out would be the strength of inbound orders in the quarter, as they more than doubled sequentially, resulting in a book-to-bill of 1. Segment backlog exiting the quarter was $6.2 billion. Please keep in mind that we do not backlog the majority of our Subsea services revenue.
Moving on to our Onshore/Offshore segment results. Onshore/Offshore reported $1.8 billion of revenue in the period. On a pro forma basis, quarter-over-quarter revenue comparisons were negatively impacted due to the completion of several projects since the prior-year period, most notably in the Middle East and Americas. 
Adjusted Offshore/Onshore EBITDA was $188 million in the quarter, with a margin of 10.4% when excluding benefits of $28 million, which resulted from successful evolution of pending project disputes, including the Algiers Refinery and Dong Hejre platform. Our profitability improved year-over-year despite the 20% revenue decline, as we recognized the achievement of several key construction milestones. Inbound orders in the quarter were $1.1 billion.
An item of note that pertains to inbound orders in the quarter is that the FLNG scope of the ENI Coral project is not fully consolidated because of the joint venture structure. As a reminder, we are partners in the FLNG scope and do not have majority ownership to this portion of our work on the project with we've reported in net income of noncontrolling interest. The order intake recorded in the On/Off segment reflects only the work awarded directly to TechnipFMC by the joint venture, which was just under $300 million in the quarter. As for the [indiscernible] scope for the project, this will not be included in the joint venture and will be reported in the Subsea segment.
Moving to our Surface Technologies segment. Surface Technologies reported $300 million of revenue in the period. On a pro forma basis, revenues were unchanged from the prior-year quarter. Strengths in North America land was partially offset by the decline in the international land market. 
Adjusted EBITDA of $36 million in the quarter, with a margin of 12% when excluding charges of $23 million. Our second quarter in this segment has typically been our weakest margin quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margins increased to 910 basis points despite the flat revenue year-over-year. Operating performance improved significantly year-over-year, primarily due to the benefit of product mix related to fluid control sale and a more favorable cost structure. 
We delivered another solid quarter on our fluid control business that would serve the pressure pumping market as we saw hydraulic fleet reactivations continuing throughout the quarter. Segment backlog continues to be primarily tied to our international business as it tends to be more longer cycle in nature.
Let's turn to the corporate items in the quarter. First, we issued an 8-K yesterday to report changes to our Q1 2017 reported financials. We recognize the concern this may present. The necessary changes were the result of errors in the computation of certain FX results due to the use of incorrect rates. The management identified the issue while reviewing the balance sheet position and future anticipated gains and losses. We have conducted a thorough review. We have improved the internal controls and are confident that we have taken the necessary actions to assure this will not recur.
Let me also note the following summary points. There is no impact to the operational performance of the company. With respect to guidance, foreign exchange gains or losses were not included, so no update was needed as a result of the restatement. This issue applies only to national cash -- natural cash flow hedges. There was no impact to derivative-based hedges. This has no impact on cash balances and had no impact on the backlog figures presented in our original Q1 filings.
Now let's turn to corporate items in the quarter. Reported corporate expense was $122.3 million. When excluding charges, corporate expense was $99 million. Included in the quarter results is $62 million of losses associated with foreign currency. Corporate costs excluding these items were slightly below our estimates. 
Next, net interest expense was $72 million and includes $62 million of additional liability to the joint venture partners.
Moving on to the tax provision for the quarter. We reported a tax provision of $86 million, resulting in a tax rate of 35.2%. When excluding the impact of a charge associated with a project cancellation in Venezuela, the effective tax rate was 25.9%.
Now let me provide an update on our merger-related synergies. We remain on track to deliver at least $400 million of pretax synergies. As we have previously discussed, we have allocated saving targets across 3 major categories. First, corporate and other has been the primary source of early quick wins. Savings here have come from real estate, centralized business functions and professional services. We are also making good progress in securing near-term savings from our supply chain. And operations remain the greatest source of savings, and actions continue to ramp with the acceleration of our integration activities. 
In total, we have taken specific actions through the first half of the year that will generate more than $100 million in run rate savings by the end of this year. We will continue to give you quarterly updates on our progress using the same format and methodology. As you can see, we are making good progress in securing these savings needed to meet our cost savings goal. We remain confident that we will deliver the targeted run rate savings of $200 million by year-end and a full $400 million in run rate savings by the end of 2018.
Looking forward, we have made updates to the full year guidance we provided in the first quarter. The full table of guidance, including updates, can be found in both the second quarter press release, as well as the presentations slides that accompany this earnings call. 
Changes to previous guidance are as follows. For Onshore/Offshore, due to the strong performance in the first half of the year, we now expect segments EBITDA guidance to be at least 8%, excluding charges for the full year, which is an increase of 150 basis points versus prior guidance. Going forward, net interest expense should be $20 million to $22 million per quarter in 2017, and does not assume any future increases to partner liability. For the full year, we now expect our tax rate to be in the range of 28% to 32%. We expect to spend approximately $125 million for merger and integration costs in the back half of the year.
Beyond these updates, we are reiterating our business segment expectations. Subsea revenue of at least $6.1 billion, with adjusted EBITDA margins of at least 17%; Onshore/Offshore revenue of at least $7.3 billion, with revised EBITDA margin guidance of at least 8%. And for Surface Technologies, we continue to expect revenue of at least $1.4 billion for the full year, with adjusted EBITDA margin of at least 13%. Capital expenditures were $56 million in the period. These expenditures totaled $108 million for the first half of 2017. We continue to expect capital expenditures to be approximately $300 million for the full year.
In conclusion, we had solid performance in the second quarter, given our execution, project milestone achievements and the benefits of our restructuring initiatives over the last year. Subsea inbound of $1.8 billion supports our belief in the inflection for award activity and order inbound for Subsea. We are cautiously optimistic about the second half inbound for 2017. Our Onshore/Offshore business benefited from solid project execution and delivery against key milestones. We expect Surface Technologies to benefit from the improving market activity in North America in the back half of 2017, given the strength in the consumable business and as international pricing pressure further stabilizes. We believe this performance will support achievement of our 2017 targets.

An important quarter for us, as we pointed out, $1.8 billion in Subsea inbound, tripling what we had in the first quarter and setting us at a very strong position for the first half of the year. But we have to look at that, and we have to look at that mix of inbound, when it's actually going to be converted into revenue. We're a big -- we're a broader company now. Some inbound, we can convert quicker. For instance, equipment manufacturing and the installation, which obviously comes at a later phase. So we have to look at all these things and take those into consideration. And when we did, we felt that we made the prudent decision by maintaining the Subsea margin guidance where it was, realizing that there's some additional challenges that lie ahead. Finally, we have seen the inbound in their inflection -- or, the inflection in the inbound, excuse me, and we're committed to delivering world-class projects to our customers. And as a result of that, we're going to have to make some strategic decisions on bridging some investment in people and capabilities and competencies through this period of time that will ensure that we'll be able to deliver these projects world-class to our customers."

And there are quite a few, there are a few of those on the list. We're really focused on and where we can create value for our customers is by early engagement, in other words, being involved in the pre-concept, concept, pre-feed and feed stages, where we can introduce technology, as you'd mentioned, and where we can bring forward our fully integrated offering. It's on those projects that we can deliver significant value for our customers, while ensuring an adequate return for ourselves and our shareholders. So it's a mix. The open market, if you will, is quite competitive, but we're uniquely positioned because we have the complete integrated offering now as TechnipFMC. And we also have new technologies, as we talked about, that we were able to deploy on a project like ExxonMobil Liza, where it was competitively tendered, but we were able to demonstrate that we had the right solution for our customer to meet a fast-track delivery schedule. The Coral FLNG project, which we were able to deliver as an integrated project, delivering both the FLNG vessel as well as the Subsea package as a direct award, not as a competitive tender on the Subsea portion of that award. So we have these unique positions that allow us to, if you will, have certain activity that is not exposed to the competitive market, including, by the way, and a very important piece of our business, is the direct awards that we received from our partners, and then there's the portion that's open to the competitive market. We do everything we can in that situation to demonstrate to our customers where we can bring value in other ways. But in some cases, it is just an open competitive tender. And again, there's a mix of those on the opportunity list that I've provided."

In an important quarter for inbound, absolutely seeing a book-to-bill with a 1 in front of it, it's been some time in our industry, so we're very proud of that. That doesn't mean that we won't have lumpy quarters going forward, but we are very pleased with the inbound level this quarter. Talking a little bit about that inbound, we had several major projects as part of that inbound, as we discussed in the prepared remarks, which is important. But really, all of the Subsea projects that have been awarded year-to-date, because of the breadth off TechnipFMC, we've been involved in one way or another. Maybe it was a product sale of umbilicals or maybe it was the installation or the Subsea equipment or the freight and engineering. But we're involved in almost all of these projects. You're right to point out that there was a healthy level of 2 things. One, Subsea services inbound, which is often underappreciated. It's resilient. It's -- we have the largest installed base of Subsea equipment in the world. In many basins, well over 50% of the install base. Globally, we have over 2,000 trees, 2,200 automation and control system Subsea, 11,000 kilometers of flexible pipe and 5,000 kilometers of umbilicals. This is a solid platform for us to build our Subsea services offering and ensure our customers the ultimate uptime performance. In addition to that, there was quite a few smaller awards as we would refer to, I mean, in other words, below the threshold that we would issue a press release for a materiality point of view. And yes, a lot of those come as direct awards from our partner accounts. We work with them proactively. They have standardized suites of equipment, which allows them to order equipment in advance of a project to ensure a short cycle time and accelerated first oil. I'll pass it over to Maryann, who will add additional comments on your question on the backlog."

So let's start with -- we'll go backwards kind of in the order that you presented the segments. So let's start with Surface Technologies. No, no change and probably the most resilient in this environment. What we have talked about the last several quarters is just wanting to temper the North America -- the robustness of the North America market with the reality of the international market and in the pricing pressure in the international market. This was simply a result, when the North America market slows down, assets and capabilities move into the international market, that has an effect on capacity, lowering price. When the North America market returns, those companies and assets tend to go back to the North America market. Our international market or the market outside of North America remains very robust in terms of activity level, but does have headwinds in terms of pricing. So Surface Technologies, absolutely no change, and the outlook remains strong. In terms of Onshore/Offshore, as you know, this is a business that it's really triggered around very large project awards. We have a nice stable foundation from our process and technologies business, which is a real differentiator for our company. And we, obviously, are executing some very large projects and executing those projects well, which include levels of reimbursable activity. But regarding the inbound in the second half of the year, yes, we're tracking 3 to 4 large projects. And again, depending upon the timing of those projects being awarded, it will create a certain level of an unevenness throughout the quarters, throughout the coming quarters in Onshore/Offshore. But we are tracking very closely several large projects. And in terms of Subsea, as I've discussed before, I think we've given up a strong visibility into the view again. Remember, that there's a strong foundation from the Subsea services, if you will, kind of reoccurring activity that we have as a result of a large installed base. And as we said, we expect 2 to 3 large projects to be awarded in the second half of the year. We continue, and I think this is important, to have the unique opportunity, to have the integrated feed studies. And we have a large portfolio of integrated feed studies. So we now can watch those integrated feed studies as they mature to the point of conversion. And the ability to be able to move those and convert those projects, in most cases, as a direct award can be quite significant. And just to give you an example, when I look at that portfolio, we have over $1 billion of projects that could be direct award and converted into integrated EPCI projects in the coming quarters. Finally, in terms of restructuring and costs, of course, we'll stay on top of it. We continue to look at it. We continue to stay focused on delivering to our synergy targets in regards of the merger as well."

This is a massive project. Reached several additional milestones this quarter. We talked about delivering the final modules out of Indonesia.

But they'll be on the water and headed to Sabetta by the end of the summer. So the team has done a phenomenal job and continues to stay focused on, first and foremost, safety and well being of a very large workforce and meeting the deliverables for our customer. So Yamal continues to go quite well. When we complete activity at a yard, there is often -- it doesn't just end when the module ships. There's always additional closures that need to be done, additional considerations that need to be taken cared of. And then only at that point can we close out that particular yard and move on. And so, [ Sean ], I guess the point that I wanted to maybe make was, you talked about some holdback releases. This is really a project where we're just executing very, very strongly. So in terms of holdback releases, there's a lot of the project left ahead of us. I mean, there's a lot of work left to be done. There's an important delivery milestone, which is the commissioning, later this year, and we remain very much focused in getting all the modules still delivered on-site and moving forward with all the construction. And again, although we're delivering a large portion of the project, there's many other contractors involved, delivering different portions of the overall project.

And as we reach key milestones and improve that, we record that incremental, if you will, liability, which will eventually be paid to the partner.

More importantly, when we're talking about partners, when we're talking about integrated feed converting into integrated EPCI direct awards, these things are -- this is a different discussion. This is a discussion about unlocking the potential of a Subsea asset. In some cases, it's unlocking the potential of a customer's asset that otherwise would not have been unlocked. So it's a completely different discussion. And we're uniquely positioned to have quite a bit of our exposure in that area not being entirely exposed to that open market.

Look, there's always a focus -- our customers are always focused on ensuring that they're delivering their best returns for their shareholders and ensuring that they're getting the best value out of the project. So there's always that economic discussion. You raised a very good point. Just 6 to 9 months ago, that was the only discussion. And quite frankly, we spent a period of over 5, 6 quarters where you would simply go back, you would present. And the answer was always, ""Thank you very much. Can you go and reengineer?"" Or, ""Can you go and try to drive some more costs out of the project?"" And that was really the extent of the discussion. It is true that over the last several quarters or a couple of quarters, to be more specific, the tone of the conversation has been more balanced around, first oil, around accelerated schedules, around project certainty. So project certainty and schedule certainty has become as important as costs. That's where TechnipFMC is uniquely positioned because we are now the only company, who install Subsea -- who delivers Subsea installed on the sea floor. So that whole schedule certainty, that schedule risk, that interface between the equipment manufacturer and the installation company, which often resulted in variation orders, delays and demurrage incurred on the vessels, we now can manage that. And we have the full visibility into our manufacturing capacity, as well as the vessel fleet, so we can manage that to ensure that we have no downtime and we can drive accelerated and improved accelerated schedule -- accelerated first oil and improved schedule certainty for our customers. So that's clearly been the change in the tone. But there has been another change, and I think this is really important to understand. Our industry has always been -- there's always been quite a bit of latency in terms of technology adoption. You hear about these wonderful technologies from some great technology companies within the oilfield services space. But they never really seemed to really make that impact, to really start to generate 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30% of their revenue from those technologies. That's always been an issue in our industry. And I have to say, Bill, just within the last quarter, the amount of visits that we've had to our technology center where high-level customers are bringing their management teams to see what we are doing to transform the face of Subsea architecture simpler, lighter, more easily installable, more serviceable has really, really ramped up. I mean it's been a tremendous amount of my personal time and the time of our leadership team to host these visits, which really gives me a clear indication that they're serious about doing things differently. So when you put that together, we're really quite excited about where we are. Again, we have to be realistic. We have to understand that there's certain uncertainties in the market. And we'll remain balanced in our view. But certainly, our customers behavior has been very positive."

There may be a time and a place, but I think what's most important right now given the industry backdrop and the challenging market that we're in is realizing and making real the synergies that our teams have already identified. But rest assured, they're working hard and have identified many synergies for us to work on. And I think we have time for one more question."

It's a known problem, by the way, it's a known metallurgical problem that occurs. But it occurs in a very unique set of circumstances. What we've been able to do now, by working closely with Petrobras, our partner, and being the leading provider of the technology, is to be able to isolate in which environment that the stress corrosion cracking actually occurs. In addition, we've been able to work with Petrobras to identify both near term and more permanent solutions for the longer-term to ensure that the industry still has access even in that isolated application to this very important technology. The benefit from an efficiency point of view, the benefit from an installation point of view is significant for these developments. So we remain focused on solving the problem for the industry by working very closely with Petrobras. And I will point out, as I said in my prepared remarks, we did receive a significant order from Petrobras in the quarter for additional flexible risers."

Before I address the second quarter performance, I want to acknowledge that the company filed an 8-K on Monday advising that we would be restating our earnings for the first quarter. We identified errors related to the rates used in the calculation of foreign currency effects on some of our engineering and construction projects. I am confident that we have corrected these errors and have made the appropriate changes to our internal controls to prevent this issue from reoccurring. Maryann Mannen, our CFO, will provide additional details in her remarks.
Moving to the second quarter. I will give a brief overview of our operational results, discuss our market outlook and provide an update on our key value drivers. Maryann Mannen will then review our financial performance in more detail and update our guidance for 2017 before opening the call for questions.
Second quarter results built upon the strong performance we delivered last quarter. Total revenues for the quarter were $3.8 billion. Total company EBITDA of $501 million grew versus prior-year quarter despite a revenue decline of 22%. This solid performance reflects our strong execution and the impact of the significant actions taken to permanently reduce both infrastructure and product costs. Total company EBITDA margins were 13%, with all segments posting significant increases from prior-year results.  
Subsea EBITDA margins were 21.8%, up 490 basis points. Onshore/Offshore EBITDA margins were 10.4%, up 590 basis points. Given the ongoing strength in this segment, we have increased our Onshore/Offshore margin guidance for full year 2017. And EBITDA margins for surface technologies were 12%, up 910 basis points.
Total company orders for the quarter were $3.2 billion, and we ended the quarter with $15.2 billion of backlog. Our balance sheet remains strong, with net cash of $3.4 billion.
We remain focused on returning capital to our shareholders. We are committed to completing the $500 million share repurchase authorization by the end of 2018. And the TechnipFMC Board of Directors has recently reaffirmed their intention to declare a quarterly dividend following the third quarter results.
We achieved several project milestones this quarter as a result of the solid project execution I was just mentioning. Prelude FLNG left the South Korean shipyard just before the close of the quarter and has arrived in Australia. The spar for Statoil's Aasta Hansteen project arrived on site in Norway and was successfully righted on location. First production milestones were achieved on both Total Moho Nord in Congo as well ENI Jangkrik in Indonesia. 
We continue to make good progress on Yamal LNG, with commissioning of the first train on schedule. Construction is almost complete on the 142 modules, and we have delivered 109 modules to the site in Sabetta. Lastly, the Statoil Trestakk iEPCI project in Norway is progressing well. And we remain confident that this fully integrated Subsea development, the first of its kind, will deliver both an accelerated schedule and cost savings to the customer.
Moving to the market outlook. TechnipFMC is uniquely positioned across the globe in both short cycle and long cycle businesses. In North America, unconventional resource development continues to lead short cycle activity. We have experienced stronger demand for our pressure pump -- for our pressure control equipment in 2017, driven by increased activity and greater completion intensity. 
Fleet reactivations continued sequentially, but did moderate somewhat in the quarter, as we had suggested it might on the first quarter call. However, the growth in the installed base generates a higher level of consumable demand that requires our inspection, maintenance services and, eventually, product replacement.
Activity levels in our surface technology segment outside of North America remains resilient, although pricing continues to impact near-term profitability. Pricing has stabilized in most international markets, with only limited improvement in a few select markets.
The Middle East and North Africa continue to offer the best near-term outlook for our surface business with a strong position both on land and in shallow water as well as opportunities in the North Sea.
Moving to longer-cycle businesses. Natural gas continues to take increasing share of growing energy demand. Despite near-term supply concerns, projects with low-cost solutions are moving forward.
In the quarter, we were awarded work on 2 important gas projects. TechnipFMC was awarded an important integrated project, including both the Subsea and FLNG packages on the ENI Coral project, with a revenue stream that extends through at least 2022. Following Shell Prelude FLNG and Petronas Satu FLNG, this award further demonstrates our leadership in the FLNG market.
Additionally, Nova Tech announced the frame agreement with TechnipFMC to design and develop future LNG plans for Arctic LNG 2 and subsequent projects. As a reminder, Nova Tech is the majority owner and operator of the Yamal LNG project. Our partner is looking to develop solutions that significantly improve the economics of LNG development in the Arctic region, transforming these world-class reservoirs into low-cost feedstock that can compete on a global basis. This project is a tremendous opportunity for us to demonstrate the value we bring through early engagement of our extensive front-end engineering capabilities. We are honored that Nova Tech has again chosen TechnipFMC as a key partner for this new endeavor.
Given the outlook for demand, as well as our own conversations with customers, we remain confident that the industry will make further LNG investments in the near to intermediate term. These large projects, whether they be onshore or offshore, can take 5 to 7 years to move from sanctioning to first gas. TechnipFMC can now address this next wave of investment as a fully integrated provider of front-end engineering capabilities, world-class project management, and EPCIC capabilities and gas processing technologies onshore while providing an even higher level of integration offshore with a complete Subsea production architecture included.
Tender activity also continues for non-LNG downstream projects in both refining and petrochemicals, focused primarily in the Middle East, Asia and Russia. The most likely awards in the near term are driven by expansions to existing facilities, an example being the MIDOR refinery expansion in Egypt. For these opportunities, we can leverage our experience as the initial contractor to significantly improve project execution and provide greater certainty to project scheduling.
We are also pursuing new opportunities where we can compete on our technical strengths. Our project management consultancy practice leverages our world-class project management skills to provide alternative solutions to the full-scale EPC contracting model. Our process technologies business continues to serve as a key market differentiator with a strong portfolio of unique technologies that serve a broad range of end markets.
Turning to Subsea inbound. Orders improved sequentially to $1.8 billion, driven by a diversified mix of order activity. For the first half of 2017, we had strong Subsea inbound of $2.4 billion, which keeps us on track to deliver a step up in inbound compared to the $3.9 billion in orders reported for the full year 2016.
In Guyana, we were awarded the subsea production system and umbilical for ExxonMobil's Liza project. For ENI's Coral project in Mozambique, our integrated offering included the SURF installation package, as well as the previously mentioned FLNG package. These projects are particularly significant since both Liza and Coral represent pioneer projects in frontier basins with significant potential for future development.
Also, in the quarter, we were awarded expanded scope on the Statoil Visund Nord project in the North Sea. This is our fifth fully integrated iEPCI award and our second for Statoil, who is realizing the benefits of our iEPCI model on their Trestakk project. 
Subsea services expanded its Riserless Light Well Intervention business in Asia-Pacific, announcing a frame agreement with Woodside Petroleum, building on the agreement announced earlier this year with INPEX. We continue to view Subsea Services as an important growth opportunity.
And in Brazil, we received new orders for flexible risers from Petrobras, an important award that demonstrates continued demand for this technology.
Strength in smaller awards were driven by Subsea tiebacks, product sales and our unique position with alliance partners resulting in direct awards.
As a reminder, last fall, we called for an inflection in Subsea order activity in 2017. Over the first 7 months of the year, 5 major projects have been sanctioned: BP's Mad Dog 2, Shell's Kaikias, Noble's Leviathan, ExxonMobil's Liza and ENI's Coral, with the related award of Subsea equipment packages and SURF contracts. This market activity already exceeds the amount of major Subsea project awards in all of 2016.
Looking ahead, we are tracking 18 large projects on our Subsea opportunity list, which could be sanctioned over the next 24 months. This project list represents approximately $15 billion of combined Subsea scope. Given the breadth of our product and service offering, we are well positioned to compete in some capacity on this entire set of projects.
On the strength of our first half Subsea inbound, we are well positioned for a step-up in full year inbound versus 2016. In the second half of the year, we are anticipating 2 or 3 of these named projects to be awarded, with the remaining inbound to be met with incremental Subsea service, product and small project awards. We are tracking the progress of our integrated feed portfolio and anticipate further iEPCI project conversions in the coming quarters.
Despite our internal conviction in the order outlook, we continue to closely monitor customer activity in the context of oil price uncertainty. We recognize that the risk of further project sanctioning delays has increased in the current environment. However, project economics have improved considerably since the market peak. Many projects make economic sense below $50 oil, some far below that level. With our unique business model, we are confident that we can continue to further reduce project breakeven levels, allowing for development of an even greater number of deepwater assets.
Independent of the timing of the market recovery, as a result of our merger, we are focused on delivering at least 300 basis points of incremental improvement to our financial returns through 2019. The key drivers of this plan are largely within our control: $400 million of cost synergies to be realized in full by 2019; tax savings of at least 300 basis points before considering any potential changes in revenue mix; and a continued focus on how we manage our capital.
With respect to the balance sheet, we have received approval by the U.K. courts to create the distributable reserves needed to manage our capital allocation strategy. This milestone allows us to begin a disciplined share repurchase program, with the goal to buy back $500 million in total by the end of 2018.
Additionally, the TechnipFMC Board of Directors has reaffirmed its commitment to declare a quarterly dividend following the release of our third quarter results.
In closing, we have delivered another strong quarter of operating results. Our first half performance gives us confidence in our ability to successfully deliver our updated 2017 guidance. We had a solid improvement in inbound orders across all segments, nearly doubling the inbound from the prior quarter. We remain confident in a step-up for full year Subsea inbound, although the recent commodity uncertainty could result in a slowing in the pace of recovery.
Despite the external environment, I have the utmost confidence that we will continue to deliver on the commitments we have made both to our customers as well as the investment community. Meeting these commitments is dependent upon the successful integration of TechnipFMC, and I am encouraged by the collaborative efforts I have witnessed as I have traveled the globe. I am most proud of the over 40,000 women and men of TechnipFMC and acknowledge their relentless efforts to transform our company and our industry. The team remains focused on operational excellence on our current projects, demonstrated by the achievement of key project milestones I described earlier, accelerated development of unique integrated technologies, creating real structural improvement in project economics, further differentiating TechnipFMC, and the collaborative approach to identifying additional integrated offerings across our portfolio, all while delivering solid operational results.
I will now turn the call over to Maryann."

On a pro forma basis, adjusted EBITDA increased to $501 million, up 44% from the prior quarter. Margins improved 600 basis points, we think very good performance when considering revenue has declined 22% year-over-year. 
Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.45 when excluding after-tax charges and credits of $0.10 per diluted share. Included in these quarterly results are the after-tax charges and credits associated with our merger transaction and integration, our estimated purchase price accounting charges and restructuring and other severance costs totaling $65 million.
The balance sheet remains strong with a net cash position of $3.4 billion. And we will be returning some of this capital to shareholders in the current quarter as we begin our share repurchase activity.
Backlog stands at $15.2 billion, reflecting the strong order intake we experienced in this period.
Moving to our segment results. Subsea reported $1.7 billion of revenue in the period. On a pro forma basis, quarter-over-quarter revenue comparisons were negatively impacted by lower project activity in Europe and Africa due to reduced inbound in previous years, resulting in lower project backlog coming into the current year. 
Adjusted EBITDA for the segment was $377 million, with a margin of 21.8% when excluding identified charges of $46 million. These margins reflect strong project execution as we recognized significant project milestones within the business, such as Moho Nord, Kaombo and Jangkrik. Also, contributing to our operating margin performance was our ongoing cost reductions and restructuring activities. 
Other highlights from this segment that I'd like to point out would be the strength of inbound orders in the quarter, as they more than doubled sequentially, resulting in a book-to-bill of 1. Segment backlog exiting the quarter was $6.2 billion. Please keep in mind that we do not backlog the majority of our Subsea services revenue.
Moving on to our Onshore/Offshore segment results. Onshore/Offshore reported $1.8 billion of revenue in the period. On a pro forma basis, quarter-over-quarter revenue comparisons were negatively impacted due to the completion of several projects since the prior-year period, most notably in the Middle East and Americas. 
Adjusted Offshore/Onshore EBITDA was $188 million in the quarter, with a margin of 10.4% when excluding benefits of $28 million, which resulted from successful resolution of pending project disputes, including the Algiers Refinery and Dong Hejre platform. Our profitability improved year-over-year despite the 20% revenue decline as we recognized the achievement of several key construction milestones. Inbound orders in the quarter were $1.1 billion.
An item of note that pertains to inbound orders in the quarter is that the FLNG scope of the ENI Coral project is not fully consolidated because of the joint venture structure. As a reminder, we are partners in the FLNG scope and do not have majority ownership. This portion of our work on the project with we've reported in net income of noncontrolling interest. The order intake recorded in the On/Off segment reflects only the work awarded directly to TechnipFMC by the joint venture, which was just under $300 million in the quarter. As for the SURF scope of the project, this will not be included in the joint venture and will be reported in the Subsea segment.
Moving to our Surface Technologies segment. Surface Technologies reported $300 million of revenue in the period. On a pro forma basis, revenues were unchanged from the prior-year quarter. Strengths in North America land was partially offset by the decline in the international land market. 
Adjusted EBITDA of $36 million in the quarter, with a margin of 12% when excluding charges of $23 million. Our second quarter in this segment has typically been our weakest margin quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margins increased 910 basis points despite the flat revenue year-over-year. Operating performance improved significantly year-over-year, primarily due to the benefit of product mix related to fluid control sales and a more favorable cost structure. 
We delivered another solid quarter on our fluid control business that would serve the pressure pumping market as we saw hydraulic fleet reactivations continuing throughout the quarter. Segment backlog continues to be primarily tied to our international business as it tends to be more longer cycle in nature.
Let's turn to the corporate items in the quarter. First, we issued an 8-K yesterday to report changes to our Q1 2017 reported financials. We recognize the concern this may present. The necessary changes were the result of errors in the computation of certain FX results due to the use of incorrect rates. Management identified the issue while reviewing the balance sheet position and future anticipated gains and losses. We have conducted a thorough review. We have improved the internal controls and are confident that we have taken the necessary actions to assure this will not recur.
Let me also note the following summary points. There is no impact to the operational performance of the company. With respect to guidance, foreign exchange gains or losses were not included, so no update was needed as a result of the restatement. This issue applies only to national cash -- natural cash flow hedges. There was no impact to derivative-based hedges. This has no impact on cash balances and had no impact on the backlog figures presented in our original Q1 filings.
Now let's turn to corporate items in the quarter. Reported corporate expense was $122.3 million. When excluding charges, corporate expense was $99 million. Included in the quarter results is $62 million of losses associated with foreign currency. Corporate costs excluding these items were slightly below our estimates. 
Next, net interest expense was $72 million and includes $62 million of additional liability to the joint venture partners.
Moving on to the tax provision for the quarter. We reported a tax provision of $86 million, resulting in a tax rate of 35.2%. When excluding the impact of a charge associated with a project cancellation in Venezuela, the effective tax rate was 25.9%.
Now let me provide an update on our merger-related synergies. We remain on track to deliver at least $400 million of pretax synergies. As we have previously discussed, we have allocated saving targets across 3 major categories. First, corporate and other has been the primary source of early quick wins. Savings here have come from real estate, centralized business functions and professional services. We are also making good progress in securing near-term savings from our supply chain. And operations remain the greatest source of savings, and actions continue to ramp with the acceleration of our integration activities. 
In total, we have taken specific actions through the first half of the year that will generate more than $100 million in run rate savings by the end of this year. We will continue to give you quarterly updates on our progress using the same format and methodology. As you can see, we are making good progress in securing these savings needed to meet our cost savings goal. We remain confident that we will deliver the targeted run rate savings of $200 million by year-end and a full $400 million in run rate savings by the end of 2018.
Looking forward, we have made updates to the full year guidance we provided in the first quarter. The full table of guidance, including updates, can be found in both the second quarter press release, as well as the presentations slides that accompany this earnings call. 
Changes to previous guidance are as follows. For Onshore/Offshore, due to the strong performance in the first half of the year, we now expect segments EBITDA guidance to be at least 8%, excluding charges for the full year, which is an increase of 150 basis points versus prior guidance. Going forward, net interest expense should be $20 million to $22 million per quarter in 2017, and does not assume any future increases to partner liability. For the full year, we now expect our tax rate to be in the range of 28% to 32%. We expect to spend approximately $125 million for merger and integration costs in the back half of the year.
Beyond these updates, we are reiterating our business segment expectations. Subsea revenue of at least $6.1 billion, with adjusted EBITDA margins of at least 17%; Onshore/Offshore revenue of at least $7.3 billion, with revised EBITDA margin guidance of at least 8%. And for Surface Technologies, we continue to expect revenue of at least $1.4 billion for the full year, with adjusted EBITDA margin of at least 13%. Capital expenditures were $56 million in the period. These expenditures totaled $108 million for the first half of 2017. We continue to expect capital expenditures to be approximately $300 million for the full year.
In conclusion, we had solid performance in the second quarter, given our execution, project milestone achievements and the benefits of our restructuring initiatives over the last year. Subsea inbound of $1.8 billion supports our belief in the inflection for award activity and order inbound for Subsea. We are cautiously optimistic about the second half inbound for 2017. Our Onshore/Offshore business benefited from solid project execution and delivery against key milestones. We expect Surface Technologies to benefit from the improving market activity in North America in the back half of 2017 given the strength in the consumable business and as international pricing pressure further stabilizes. We believe this performance will support achievement of our 2017 targets.

Kurt, as I've indicated in past quarters, I mean, it's a challenging market, and it's a challenging environment. And we'll continue to do everything we can to ensure that our cost structure remains competitive as the market dynamics evolve. That being said, as we indicated in our prepared remarks, we did achieve the completion of several major projects in the quarter, which had some benefit to the quarter, but also, therefore, creates some additional capacity or a potential underutilization in the coming quarters. So I think it's the balance of understanding how our projects or how we've completed some of our projects, the challenges that we'll have in the market as we go forward as a result of the timing of the inbound. An important quarter for us, as we pointed out, $1.8 billion in Subsea inbound, tripling what we had in the first quarter and setting us at a very strong position for the first half of the year. But we have to look at that, and we have to look at that mix of inbound, when it's actually going to be converted into revenue. We're a big -- we're a broader company now. Some inbound, we can convert quicker. For instance, equipment manufacturing and the installation, which obviously comes at a later phase. So we have to look at all these things and take those into consideration. And when we did, we felt that we made the prudent decision by maintaining the Subsea margin guidance where it was, realizing that there's some additional challenges that lie ahead. Finally, we have seen the inbound in the inflection -- or, the inflection in the inbound, excuse me, and we're committed to delivering world-class projects to our customers. And as a result of that, we're going to have to make some strategic decisions on bridging some investment in people and capabilities and competencies through this period of time that will ensure that we'll be able to deliver these projects world-class to our customers."

It's on those projects that we can deliver significant value for our customers while ensuring an adequate return for ourselves and our shareholders. So it's a mix. The open market, if you will, is quite competitive, but we're uniquely positioned because we have the complete integrated offering now as TechnipFMC. And we also have new technologies, as we talked about, that we were able to deploy on a project like ExxonMobil Liza, where it was competitively tendered, but we were able to demonstrate that we had the right solution for our customer to meet a fast-track delivery schedule, the Coral FLNG project, which we were able to deliver as an integrated project, delivering both the FLNG vessel as well as the Subsea package as a direct award, not as a competitive tender on the Subsea portion of that award. So we have these unique positions that allow us to, if you will, have certain activity that is not exposed to the competitive market, including, by the way, and a very important piece of our business, is the direct awards that we received from our partners, and then there's the portion that's open to the competitive market. We do everything we can in that situation to demonstrate to our customers where we can bring value in other ways. But in some cases, it is just an open competitive tender. And again, there's a mix of those on the opportunity list that I've provided."

And an important quarter for inbound, absolutely seeing a book-to-bill with a 1 in front of it, it's been some time in our industry, so we're very proud of that. That doesn't mean that we won't have lumpy quarters going forward, but we are very pleased with the inbound level this quarter. Talking a little bit about that inbound, we had several major projects as part of that inbound, as we discussed in the prepared remarks, which is important. But really, all of the Subsea projects that have been awarded year-to-date, because of the breadth of TechnipFMC, we've been involved in one way or another. Maybe it was a product sale of umbilicals or maybe it was the installation or the Subsea equipment or the front-end engineering. But we're involved in almost all of these projects. You're right to point out that there was a healthy level of 2 things. One, Subsea services inbound, which is often underappreciated. It's resilient. It's -- we have the largest installed base of Subsea equipment in the world. In many basins, well over 50% of the install base. Globally, we have over 2,000 trees, 2,200 automation and control system Subsea, 11,000 kilometers of flexible pipe and 5,000 kilometers of umbilicals. This is a solid platform for us to build our Subsea services offering and ensure our customers the ultimate uptime performance. In addition to that, there was quite a few smaller awards as we would refer to, I mean, in other words, below the threshold that we would issue a press release for a materiality point of view. And yes, a lot of those come as direct awards from our partner accounts. We work with them proactively. They have standardized suites of equipment, which allows them to order equipment in advance of a project to ensure a short cycle time and accelerated first oil. I'll pass it over to Maryann, who will add additional comments on your question on the backlog."

So let's start with -- we'll go backwards kind of in the order that you presented the segments. So let's start with Surface Technologies. No, no change and probably the most resilient in this environment. What we have talked about the last several quarters is just wanting to temper the North America -- the robustness of the North America market with the reality of the international market and in the pricing pressure in the international market. This was simply a result, when the North America market slows down, assets and capabilities move into the international market, that has an effect on capacity, lowering price. When the North America market returns, those companies and assets tend to go back to the North America market. Our international market or the market outside of North America remains very robust in terms of activity level, but does have headwinds in terms of pricing. So Surface Technologies, absolutely no change, and the outlook remains strong. In terms of Onshore/Offshore, as you know, this is a business that it's really triggered around very large project awards. We have a nice stable foundation from our process and technologies business, which is a real differentiator for our company. And we, obviously, are executing some very large projects and executing those projects well, which include levels of reimbursable activity. But regarding the inbound in the second half of the year, yes, we're tracking 3 to 4 large projects. And again, depending upon the timing of those projects being awarded, it will create a certain level of unevenness throughout the quarters, throughout the coming quarters in Onshore/Offshore. But we are tracking very closely several large projects. And in terms of Subsea, as I've discussed before, I think we've given a strong visibility into the view again. Remember, that there's a strong foundation from the Subsea services, if you will, kind of reoccurring activity that we have as a result of a large installed base. And as we said, we expect 2 to 3 large projects to be awarded in the second half of the year. We continue, and I think this is important, to have the unique opportunity to have the integrated feed studies. And we have a large portfolio of integrated feed studies. So we now can watch those integrated feed studies as they mature to the point of conversion. And the ability to be able to move those and convert those projects, in most cases as a direct award, can be quite significant. And just to give you an example, when I look at that portfolio, we have over $1 billion of projects that could be direct award and converted into integrated EPCI projects in the coming quarters. Finally, in terms of restructuring and costs, of course, we'll stay on top of it. We continue to look at it. We continue to stay focused on delivering to our synergy targets in regards of the merger as well."

But they'll be on the water and headed to Sabetta by the end of the summer. So the team has done a phenomenal job and continues to stay focused on, first and foremost, safety and well-being of a very large workforce and meeting the deliverables for our customer. So Yamal continues to go quite well. When we complete activity at a yard, there is often -- it doesn't just end when the module ships. There's always additional closures that need to be done, additional considerations that need to be taken care of. And then only at that point can we close out that particular yard and move on. And so, Sean, I guess the point that I wanted to maybe make was, you talked about some holdback releases. This is really a project where we're just executing very, very strongly. So in terms of holdback releases, there's a lot of the project left ahead of us. I mean, there's a lot of work left to be done. There's an important delivery milestone, which is the commissioning, later this year, and we remain very much focused in getting all the modules still delivered on-site and moving forward with all the construction. And again, although we're delivering a large portion of the project, there's many other contractors involved, delivering different portions of the overall project.

So to your question, as profitability may improve in the project, it increases the ultimate liability that we will pay to our partner. So we established a liability at the end of 12/31. And as we reach key milestones and improve that, we record that incremental, if you will, liability, which will eventually be paid to the partner.

More importantly, when we're talking about partners, when we're talking about integrated feed converting into integrated EPCI direct awards, these things are -- this is a different discussion. This is a discussion about unlocking the potential of a Subsea asset. In some cases, it's unlocking the potential of a customer's asset that otherwise would not have been unlocked. So it's a completely different discussion. And we're uniquely positioned to have quite a bit of our exposure in that area not being entirely exposed to that open market.

1342651,431735275,1254927,"TechnipFMC plc, Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2017",2017-07-27,"Earnings Calls","TechnipFMC plc","Executives","Bill, thank you very much for the question. Look, there's always a focus -- our customers are always focused on ensuring that they're delivering their best returns for their shareholders and ensuring that they're getting the best value out of the project.",515,"Bill, thank you very much for the question. Look, there's always a focus -- our customers are always focused on ensuring that they're delivering their best returns for their shareholders and ensuring that they're getting the best value out of the project. So there's always that economic discussion. You raise a very good point. Just 6 to 9 months ago, that was the only discussion. And quite frankly, we spent a period of over 5, 6 quarters where you would simply go back, you would present. And the answer was always, ""Thank you very much. Can you go and reengineer?"" Or, ""Can you go and try to drive some more costs out of the project?"" And that was really the extent of the discussion. It is true that over the last several quarters or a couple of quarters, to be more specific, the tone of the conversation has been more balanced around first oil, around accelerated schedules, around project certainty. So project certainty and schedule certainty has become as important as costs. That's where TechnipFMC is uniquely positioned because we are now the only company who installs Subsea -- who delivers Subsea installed on the sea floor. So that whole schedule certainty, that schedule risk, that interface between the equipment manufacturer and the installation company, which often resulted in variation orders, delays and demurrage incurred on the vessels, we now can manage that. And we have the full visibility into our manufacturing capacity as well as the vessel fleet so we can manage that to ensure that we have no downtime and we can drive accelerated and improved accelerated schedule -- accelerated first oil and improved schedule certainty for our customers. So that's clearly been the change in the tone. But there has been another change, and I think this is really important to understand. Our industry hasn't always -- has always been -- there's always been quite a bit of latency in terms of technology adoption. You hear about these wonderful technologies from some great technology companies within the oilfield services space. But they never really seemed to really make that impact, to really start to generate 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30% of their revenue from those technologies. That's always been an issue in our industry. And I have to say, Bill, just within the last quarter, the amount of visits that we've had to our technology center where high-level customers are bringing their management teams to see what we are doing to transform the face of Subsea architecture simpler, lighter, more easily installable, more serviceable has really, really ramped up. I mean it's been a tremendous amount of my personal time and the time of our leadership team to host these visits, which really gives me a clear indication that they're serious about doing things differently. So when you put that together, we're really quite excited about where we are. Again, we have to be realistic. We have to understand that there's certain uncertainties in the market. And we'll remain balanced in our view. But certainly, our customers' behavior has been very positive."

But there was a lot of newbuild activity in the fourth quarter and the first quarter. And for us, it actually peaked early in the second quarter. Still, we're still at a very high level, again, and we have a higher installed base now. So that's very good from a service revenue and a consumables replacement, product replacement. But we'll see how that plays out, Bill. We're not necessarily seeing that same scenario when we talk to our customers in that part of our business. And before we go to our last question, I want to apologize to Fiona. I failed to address the question on the synergies. It's an important question. What -- we are absolutely committed to our targets of $400 million exit rate to 2018 to be realized in 2019, 50% of that by the end of 2017. Indeed, indeed, our teams, by working together and collaborating together, continue to identify synergies and additional synergies above our original expectation. We are focused on delivering those synergies and realizing those synergies and accelerating the realization of those synergies as opposed to necessarily raising synergy targets. There may be a time and a place, but I think what's most important right now given the industry backdrop and the challenging market that we're in is realizing and making real the synergies that our teams have already identified. But rest assured, they're working hard and have identified many synergies for us to work on. And I think we have time for one more question."

What we've been able to do now, by working closely with Petrobras, our partner, and being the leading provider of the technology, is to be able to isolate in which environment that the stress corrosion cracking actually occurs. In addition, we've been able to work with Petrobras to identify both near term and more permanent solutions for the longer term to ensure that the industry still has access even in that isolated application to this very important technology. The benefit from an efficiency point of view, the benefit from an installation point of view is significant for these developments. So we remain focused on solving the problem for the industry by working very closely with Petrobras. And I will point out, as I said in my prepared remarks, we did receive a significant order from Petrobras in the quarter for additional flexible risers."

Before I address the second quarter performance, I want to acknowledge that the company filed an 8-K on Monday advising that we would be restating our earnings for the first quarter. We identified errors related to the rates used in the calculation of foreign currency effects on some of our engineering and construction projects. I am confident that we have corrected these errors and have made the appropriate changes to our internal controls to prevent this issue from reoccurring. Maryann Mannen, our CFO, will provide additional details in her remarks.
Moving to the second quarter. I will give a brief overview of our operational results, discuss our market outlook and provide an update on our key value drivers. Maryann Mannen will then review our financial performance in more detail and update our guidance for 2017 before opening the call for questions.
Second quarter results built upon the strong performance we delivered last quarter. Total revenues for the quarter were $3.8 billion. Total company EBITDA of $501 million grew versus prior-year quarter despite a revenue decline of 22%. This solid performance reflects our strong execution and the impact of the significant actions taken to permanently reduce both infrastructure and product costs. Total company EBITDA margins were 13%, with all segments posting significant increases from prior-year results.  
Subsea EBITDA margins were 21.8%, up 490 basis points. Onshore/Offshore EBITDA margins were 10.4%, up 590 basis points. Given the ongoing strength in this segment, we have increased our Onshore/Offshore margin guidance for full year 2017. And EBITDA margins for surface technologies were 12%, up 910 basis points.
Total company orders for the quarter were $3.2 billion, and we ended the quarter with $15.2 billion of backlog. Our balance sheet remains strong, with net cash of $3.4 billion.
We remain focused on returning capital to our shareholders. We are committed to completing the $500 million share repurchase authorization by the end of 2018. And the TechnipFMC Board of Directors has recently reaffirmed their intention to declare a quarterly dividend following the third quarter results.
We achieved several project milestones this quarter as a result of the solid project execution I was just mentioning. Prelude FLNG left the South Korean shipyard just before the close of the quarter and has arrived in Australia. The spar for Statoil's Aasta Hansteen project arrived on site in Norway and was successfully righted on location. First production milestones were achieved on both Total Moho Nord in Congo as well ENI Jangkrik in Indonesia. 
We continue to make good progress on Yamal LNG, with commissioning of the first train on schedule. Construction is almost complete on the 142 modules, and we have delivered 109 modules to the site in Sabetta. Lastly, the Statoil Trestakk iEPCI project in Norway is progressing well. And we remain confident that this fully integrated Subsea development, the first of its kind, will deliver both an accelerated schedule and cost savings to the customer.
Moving to the market outlook. TechnipFMC is uniquely positioned across the globe in both short cycle and long cycle businesses. In North America, unconventional resource development continues to lead short cycle activity. We have experienced stronger demand for our pressure pump -- for our pressure control equipment in 2017, driven by increased activity and greater completion intensity. 
Fleet reactivations continued sequentially, but did moderate somewhat in the quarter, as we had suggested it might on the first quarter call. However, the growth in the installed base generates a higher level of consumable demand that requires our inspection, maintenance services and, eventually, product replacement.
Activity levels in our surface technology segment outside of North America remains resilient, although pricing continues to impact near-term profitability. Pricing has stabilized in most international markets, with only limited improvement in a few select markets.
The Middle East and North Africa continue to offer the best near-term outlook for our surface business with a strong position both on land and in shallow water as well as opportunities in the North Sea.
Moving to longer-cycle businesses. Natural gas continues to take increasing share of growing energy demand. Despite near-term supply concerns, projects with low-cost solutions are moving forward.
In the quarter, we were awarded work on 2 important gas projects. TechnipFMC was awarded an important integrated project, including both the Subsea and FLNG packages on the ENI Coral project, with a revenue stream that extends through at least 2022. Following Shell Prelude FLNG and Petronas Satu FLNG, this award further demonstrates our leadership in the FLNG market.
Additionally, Nova Tech announced the frame agreement with TechnipFMC to design and develop future LNG plans for Arctic LNG 2 and subsequent projects. As a reminder, Nova Tech is the majority owner and operator of the Yamal LNG project. Our partner is looking to develop solutions that significantly improve the economics of LNG development in the Arctic region, transforming these world-class reservoirs into low-cost feedstock that can compete on a global basis. This project is a tremendous opportunity for us to demonstrate the value we bring through early engagement of our extensive front-end engineering capabilities. We are honored that Nova Tech has again chosen TechnipFMC as a key partner for this new endeavor.
Given the outlook for demand, as well as our own conversations with customers, we remain confident that the industry will make further LNG investments in the near to intermediate term. These large projects, whether they be onshore or offshore, can take 5 to 7 years to move from sanctioning to first gas. TechnipFMC can now address this next wave of investment as a fully integrated provider of front-end engineering capabilities, world-class project management, and EPCIC capabilities and gas processing technologies onshore while providing an even higher level of integration offshore with a complete Subsea production architecture included.
Tender activity also continues for non-LNG downstream projects in both refining and petrochemicals, focused primarily in the Middle East, Asia and Russia. The most likely awards in the near term are driven by expansions to existing facilities, an example being the MIDOR refinery expansion in Egypt. For these opportunities, we can leverage our experience as the initial contractor to significantly improve project execution and provide greater certainty to project scheduling.
We are also pursuing new opportunities where we can compete on our technical strengths. Our project management consultancy practice leverages our world-class project management skills to provide alternative solutions to the full-scale EPC contracting model. Our process technologies business continues to serve as a key market differentiator with a strong portfolio of unique technologies that serve a broad range of end markets.
Turning to Subsea inbound. Orders improved sequentially to $1.8 billion, driven by a diversified mix of order activity. For the first half of 2017, we had strong Subsea inbound of $2.4 billion, which keeps us on track to deliver a step up in inbound compared to the $3.9 billion in orders reported for the full year 2016.
In Guyana, we were awarded the subsea production system and umbilical for ExxonMobil's Liza project. For ENI's Coral project in Mozambique, our integrated offering included the SURF installation package, as well as the previously mentioned FLNG package. These projects are particularly significant since both Liza and Coral represent pioneer projects in frontier basins with significant potential for future development.
Also, in the quarter, we were awarded expanded scope on the Statoil Visund Nord project in the North Sea. This is our fifth fully integrated iEPCI award and our second for Statoil, who is realizing the benefits of our iEPCI model on their Trestakk project. 
Subsea services expanded its Riserless Light Well Intervention business in Asia-Pacific, announcing a frame agreement with Woodside Petroleum, building on the agreement announced earlier this year with INPEX. We continue to view Subsea Services as an important growth opportunity.
And in Brazil, we received new orders for flexible risers from Petrobras, an important award that demonstrates continued demand for this technology.
Strength in smaller awards were driven by Subsea tiebacks, product sales and our unique position with alliance partners resulting in direct awards.
As a reminder, last fall, we called for an inflection in Subsea order activity in 2017. Over the first 7 months of the year, 5 major projects have been sanctioned: BP's Mad Dog 2, Shell's Kaikias, Noble's Leviathan, ExxonMobil's Liza and ENI's Coral, with the related award of Subsea equipment packages and SURF contracts. This market activity already exceeds the amount of major Subsea project awards in all of 2016.
Looking ahead, we are tracking 18 large projects on our Subsea opportunity list, which could be sanctioned over the next 24 months. This project list represents approximately $15 billion of combined Subsea scope. Given the breadth of our product and service offering, we are well positioned to compete in some capacity on this entire set of projects.
On the strength of our first half Subsea inbound, we are well positioned for a step-up in full year inbound versus 2016. In the second half of the year, we are anticipating 2 or 3 of these named projects to be awarded, with the remaining inbound to be met with incremental Subsea service, product and small project awards. We are tracking the progress of our integrated feed portfolio and anticipate further iEPCI project conversions in the coming quarters.
Despite our internal conviction in the order outlook, we continue to closely monitor customer activity in the context of oil price uncertainty. We recognize that the risk of further project sanctioning delays has increased in the current environment. However, project economics have improved considerably since the market peak. Many projects make economic sense below $50 oil, some far below that level. With our unique business model, we are confident that we can continue to further reduce project breakeven levels, allowing for development of an even greater number of deepwater assets.
Independent of the timing of the market recovery, as a result of our merger, we are focused on delivering at least 300 basis points of incremental improvement to our financial returns through 2019. The key drivers of this plan are largely within our control: $400 million of cost synergies to be realized in full by 2019; tax savings of at least 300 basis points before considering any potential changes in revenue mix; and a continued focus on how we manage our capital.
With respect to the balance sheet, we have received approval by the U.K. courts to create the distributable reserves needed to manage our capital allocation strategy. This milestone allows us to begin a disciplined share repurchase program, with the goal to buy back $500 million in total by the end of 2018.
Additionally, the TechnipFMC Board of Directors has reaffirmed its commitment to declare a quarterly dividend following the release of our third quarter results.
In closing, we have delivered another strong quarter of operating results. Our first half performance gives us confidence in our ability to successfully deliver our updated 2017 guidance. We had a solid improvement in inbound orders across all segments, nearly doubling the inbound from the prior quarter. We remain confident in a step-up for full year Subsea inbound, although the recent commodity uncertainty could result in a slowing in the pace of recovery.
Despite the external environment, I have the utmost confidence that we will continue to deliver on the commitments we have made both to our customers as well as the investment community. Meeting these commitments is dependent upon the successful integration of TechnipFMC, and I am encouraged by the collaborative efforts I have witnessed as I have traveled the globe. I am most proud of the over 40,000 women and men of TechnipFMC and acknowledge their relentless efforts to transform our company and our industry. The team remains focused on operational excellence on our current projects, demonstrated by the achievement of key project milestones I described earlier, accelerated development of unique integrated technologies, creating real structural improvement in project economics, further differentiating TechnipFMC, and the collaborative approach to identifying additional integrated offerings across our portfolio, all while delivering solid operational results.
I will now turn the call over to Maryann."

On a pro forma basis, adjusted EBITDA increased to $501 million, up 44% from the prior quarter. Margins improved 600 basis points, we think very good performance when considering revenue has declined 22% year-over-year. 
Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.45 when excluding after-tax charges and credits of $0.10 per diluted share. Included in these quarterly results are the after-tax charges and credits associated with our merger transaction and integration, our estimated purchase price accounting charges and restructuring and other severance costs totaling $65 million.
The balance sheet remains strong with a net cash position of $3.4 billion. And we will be returning some of this capital to shareholders in the current quarter as we begin our share repurchase activity.
Backlog stands at $15.2 billion, reflecting the strong order intake we experienced in this period.
Moving to our segment results. Subsea reported $1.7 billion of revenue in the period. On a pro forma basis, quarter-over-quarter revenue comparisons were negatively impacted by lower project activity in Europe and Africa due to reduced inbound in previous years, resulting in lower project backlog coming into the current year. 
Adjusted EBITDA for the segment was $377 million, with a margin of 21.8% when excluding identified charges of $46 million. These margins reflect strong project execution as we recognized significant project milestones within the business, such as Moho Nord, Kaombo and Jangkrik. Also, contributing to our operating margin performance was our ongoing cost reductions and restructuring activities. 
Other highlights from this segment that I'd like to point out would be the strength of inbound orders in the quarter, as they more than doubled sequentially, resulting in a book-to-bill of 1. Segment backlog exiting the quarter was $6.2 billion. Please keep in mind that we do not backlog the majority of our Subsea services revenue.
Moving on to our Onshore/Offshore segment results. Onshore/Offshore reported $1.8 billion of revenue in the period. On a pro forma basis, quarter-over-quarter revenue comparisons were negatively impacted due to the completion of several projects since the prior-year period, most notably in the Middle East and Americas. 
Adjusted Offshore/Onshore EBITDA was $188 million in the quarter, with a margin of 10.4% when excluding benefits of $28 million, which resulted from successful resolution of pending project disputes, including the Algiers Refinery and Dong Hejre platform. Our profitability improved year-over-year despite the 20% revenue decline as we recognized the achievement of several key construction milestones. Inbound orders in the quarter were $1.1 billion.
An item of note that pertains to inbound orders in the quarter is that the FLNG scope of the ENI Coral project is not fully consolidated because of the joint venture structure. As a reminder, we are partners in the FLNG scope and do not have majority ownership. This portion of our work on the project with we've reported in net income of noncontrolling interest. The order intake recorded in the On/Off segment reflects only the work awarded directly to TechnipFMC by the joint venture, which was just under $300 million in the quarter. As for the SURF scope of the project, this will not be included in the joint venture and will be reported in the Subsea segment.
Moving to our Surface Technologies segment. Surface Technologies reported $300 million of revenue in the period. On a pro forma basis, revenues were unchanged from the prior-year quarter. Strengths in North America land was partially offset by the decline in the international land market. 
Adjusted EBITDA of $36 million in the quarter, with a margin of 12% when excluding charges of $23 million. Our second quarter in this segment has typically been our weakest margin quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margins increased 910 basis points despite the flat revenue year-over-year. Operating performance improved significantly year-over-year, primarily due to the benefit of product mix related to fluid control sales and a more favorable cost structure. 
We delivered another solid quarter on our fluid control business that would serve the pressure pumping market as we saw hydraulic fleet reactivations continuing throughout the quarter. Segment backlog continues to be primarily tied to our international business as it tends to be more longer cycle in nature.
Let's turn to the corporate items in the quarter. First, we issued an 8-K yesterday to report changes to our Q1 2017 reported financials. We recognize the concern this may present. The necessary changes were the result of errors in the computation of certain FX results due to the use of incorrect rates. Management identified the issue while reviewing the balance sheet position and future anticipated gains and losses. We have conducted a thorough review. We have improved the internal controls and are confident that we have taken the necessary actions to assure this will not recur.
Let me also note the following summary points. There is no impact to the operational performance of the company. With respect to guidance, foreign exchange gains or losses were not included, so no update was needed as a result of the restatement. This issue applies only to national cash -- natural cash flow hedges. There was no impact to derivative-based hedges. This has no impact on cash balances and had no impact on the backlog figures presented in our original Q1 filings.
Now let's turn to corporate items in the quarter. Reported corporate expense was $122.3 million. When excluding charges, corporate expense was $99 million. Included in the quarter results is $62 million of losses associated with foreign currency. Corporate costs excluding these items were slightly below our estimates. 
Next, net interest expense was $72 million and includes $62 million of additional liability to the joint venture partners.
Moving on to the tax provision for the quarter. We reported a tax provision of $86 million, resulting in a tax rate of 35.2%. When excluding the impact of a charge associated with a project cancellation in Venezuela, the effective tax rate was 25.9%.
Now let me provide an update on our merger-related synergies. We remain on track to deliver at least $400 million of pretax synergies. As we have previously discussed, we have allocated saving targets across 3 major categories. First, corporate and other has been the primary source of early quick wins. Savings here have come from real estate, centralized business functions and professional services. We are also making good progress in securing near-term savings from our supply chain. And operations remain the greatest source of savings, and actions continue to ramp with the acceleration of our integration activities. 
In total, we have taken specific actions through the first half of the year that will generate more than $100 million in run rate savings by the end of this year. We will continue to give you quarterly updates on our progress using the same format and methodology. As you can see, we are making good progress in securing these savings needed to meet our cost savings goal. We remain confident that we will deliver the targeted run rate savings of $200 million by year-end and a full $400 million in run rate savings by the end of 2018.
Looking forward, we have made updates to the full year guidance we provided in the first quarter. The full table of guidance, including updates, can be found in both the second quarter press release, as well as the presentations slides that accompany this earnings call. 
Changes to previous guidance are as follows. For Onshore/Offshore, due to the strong performance in the first half of the year, we now expect segments EBITDA guidance to be at least 8%, excluding charges for the full year, which is an increase of 150 basis points versus prior guidance. Going forward, net interest expense should be $20 million to $22 million per quarter in 2017, and does not assume any future increases to partner liability. For the full year, we now expect our tax rate to be in the range of 28% to 32%. We expect to spend approximately $125 million for merger and integration costs in the back half of the year.
Beyond these updates, we are reiterating our business segment expectations. Subsea revenue of at least $6.1 billion, with adjusted EBITDA margins of at least 17%; Onshore/Offshore revenue of at least $7.3 billion, with revised EBITDA margin guidance of at least 8%. And for Surface Technologies, we continue to expect revenue of at least $1.4 billion for the full year, with adjusted EBITDA margin of at least 13%. Capital expenditures were $56 million in the period. These expenditures totaled $108 million for the first half of 2017. We continue to expect capital expenditures to be approximately $300 million for the full year.
In conclusion, we had solid performance in the second quarter, given our execution, project milestone achievements and the benefits of our restructuring initiatives over the last year. Subsea inbound of $1.8 billion supports our belief in the inflection for award activity and order inbound for Subsea. We are cautiously optimistic about the second half inbound for 2017. Our Onshore/Offshore business benefited from solid project execution and delivery against key milestones. We expect Surface Technologies to benefit from the improving market activity in North America in the back half of 2017 given the strength in the consumable business and as international pricing pressure further stabilizes. We believe this performance will support achievement of our 2017 targets.

Kurt, as I've indicated in past quarters, I mean, it's a challenging market, and it's a challenging environment. And we'll continue to do everything we can to ensure that our cost structure remains competitive as the market dynamics evolve. That being said, as we indicated in our prepared remarks, we did achieve the completion of several major projects in the quarter, which had some benefit to the quarter, but also, therefore, creates some additional capacity or a potential underutilization in the coming quarters. So I think it's the balance of understanding how our projects or how we've completed some of our projects, the challenges that we'll have in the market as we go forward as a result of the timing of the inbound. An important quarter for us, as we pointed out, $1.8 billion in Subsea inbound, tripling what we had in the first quarter and setting us at a very strong position for the first half of the year. But we have to look at that, and we have to look at that mix of inbound, when it's actually going to be converted into revenue. We're a big -- we're a broader company now. Some inbound, we can convert quicker. For instance, equipment manufacturing and the installation, which obviously comes at a later phase. So we have to look at all these things and take those into consideration. And when we did, we felt that we made the prudent decision by maintaining the Subsea margin guidance where it was, realizing that there's some additional challenges that lie ahead. Finally, we have seen the inbound in the inflection -- or, the inflection in the inbound, excuse me, and we're committed to delivering world-class projects to our customers. And as a result of that, we're going to have to make some strategic decisions on bridging some investment in people and capabilities and competencies through this period of time that will ensure that we'll be able to deliver these projects world-class to our customers."

It's on those projects that we can deliver significant value for our customers while ensuring an adequate return for ourselves and our shareholders. So it's a mix. The open market, if you will, is quite competitive, but we're uniquely positioned because we have the complete integrated offering now as TechnipFMC. And we also have new technologies, as we talked about, that we were able to deploy on a project like ExxonMobil Liza, where it was competitively tendered, but we were able to demonstrate that we had the right solution for our customer to meet a fast-track delivery schedule, the Coral FLNG project, which we were able to deliver as an integrated project, delivering both the FLNG vessel as well as the Subsea package as a direct award, not as a competitive tender on the Subsea portion of that award. So we have these unique positions that allow us to, if you will, have certain activity that is not exposed to the competitive market, including, by the way, and a very important piece of our business, is the direct awards that we received from our partners, and then there's the portion that's open to the competitive market. We do everything we can in that situation to demonstrate to our customers where we can bring value in other ways. But in some cases, it is just an open competitive tender. And again, there's a mix of those on the opportunity list that I've provided."

And an important quarter for inbound, absolutely seeing a book-to-bill with a 1 in front of it, it's been some time in our industry, so we're very proud of that. That doesn't mean that we won't have lumpy quarters going forward, but we are very pleased with the inbound level this quarter. Talking a little bit about that inbound, we had several major projects as part of that inbound, as we discussed in the prepared remarks, which is important. But really, all of the Subsea projects that have been awarded year-to-date, because of the breadth of TechnipFMC, we've been involved in one way or another. Maybe it was a product sale of umbilicals or maybe it was the installation or the Subsea equipment or the front-end engineering. But we're involved in almost all of these projects. You're right to point out that there was a healthy level of 2 things. One, Subsea services inbound, which is often underappreciated. It's resilient. It's -- we have the largest installed base of Subsea equipment in the world. In many basins, well over 50% of the install base. Globally, we have over 2,000 trees, 2,200 automation and control system Subsea, 11,000 kilometers of flexible pipe and 5,000 kilometers of umbilicals. This is a solid platform for us to build our Subsea services offering and ensure our customers the ultimate uptime performance. In addition to that, there was quite a few smaller awards as we would refer to, I mean, in other words, below the threshold that we would issue a press release for a materiality point of view. And yes, a lot of those come as direct awards from our partner accounts. We work with them proactively. They have standardized suites of equipment, which allows them to order equipment in advance of a project to ensure a short cycle time and accelerated first oil. I'll pass it over to Maryann, who will add additional comments on your question on the backlog."

So let's start with -- we'll go backwards kind of in the order that you presented the segments. So let's start with Surface Technologies. No, no change and probably the most resilient in this environment. What we have talked about the last several quarters is just wanting to temper the North America -- the robustness of the North America market with the reality of the international market and in the pricing pressure in the international market. This was simply a result, when the North America market slows down, assets and capabilities move into the international market, that has an effect on capacity, lowering price. When the North America market returns, those companies and assets tend to go back to the North America market. Our international market or the market outside of North America remains very robust in terms of activity level, but does have headwinds in terms of pricing. So Surface Technologies, absolutely no change, and the outlook remains strong. In terms of Onshore/Offshore, as you know, this is a business that it's really triggered around very large project awards. We have a nice stable foundation from our process and technologies business, which is a real differentiator for our company. And we, obviously, are executing some very large projects and executing those projects well, which include levels of reimbursable activity. But regarding the inbound in the second half of the year, yes, we're tracking 3 to 4 large projects. And again, depending upon the timing of those projects being awarded, it will create a certain level of unevenness throughout the quarters, throughout the coming quarters in Onshore/Offshore. But we are tracking very closely several large projects. And in terms of Subsea, as I've discussed before, I think we've given a strong visibility into the view again. Remember, that there's a strong foundation from the Subsea services, if you will, kind of reoccurring activity that we have as a result of a large installed base. And as we said, we expect 2 to 3 large projects to be awarded in the second half of the year. We continue, and I think this is important, to have the unique opportunity to have the integrated feed studies. And we have a large portfolio of integrated feed studies. So we now can watch those integrated feed studies as they mature to the point of conversion. And the ability to be able to move those and convert those projects, in most cases as a direct award, can be quite significant. And just to give you an example, when I look at that portfolio, we have over $1 billion of projects that could be direct award and converted into integrated EPCI projects in the coming quarters. Finally, in terms of restructuring and costs, of course, we'll stay on top of it. We continue to look at it. We continue to stay focused on delivering to our synergy targets in regards of the merger as well."

But they'll be on the water and headed to Sabetta by the end of the summer. So the team has done a phenomenal job and continues to stay focused on, first and foremost, safety and well-being of a very large workforce and meeting the deliverables for our customer. So Yamal continues to go quite well. When we complete activity at a yard, there is often -- it doesn't just end when the module ships. There's always additional closures that need to be done, additional considerations that need to be taken care of. And then only at that point can we close out that particular yard and move on. And so, Sean, I guess the point that I wanted to maybe make was, you talked about some holdback releases. This is really a project where we're just executing very, very strongly. So in terms of holdback releases, there's a lot of the project left ahead of us. I mean, there's a lot of work left to be done. There's an important delivery milestone, which is the commissioning, later this year, and we remain very much focused in getting all the modules still delivered on-site and moving forward with all the construction. And again, although we're delivering a large portion of the project, there's many other contractors involved, delivering different portions of the overall project.

So you see a bit of a change in the way that we now report our controlling interest with respect to that. So to your question, as profitability may improve in the project, it increases the ultimate liability that we will pay to our partner. So we established a liability at the end of 12/31. And as we reach key milestones and improve that, we record that incremental, if you will, liability, which will eventually be paid to the partner. And that's recorded through the interest expense line, as I called out. We had a similar result in the first quarter of 2017 as well."

When you are in that, what I'm calling, the competitive or the open market, in an environment as we are in today, it is not only a pricing discussion. It's also a discussion around terms and conditions. So I think you correctly point that out. Again, our company is uniquely positioned because we are not solely exposed to that market. We do participate in that market, and we will continue to, but only at a level of -- only at a level that we're willing to accept, be that in terms of returns or be that in terms of risks associated with terms and conditions. More importantly, when we're talking about partners, when we're talking about integrated feed converting into integrated EPCI direct awards, these things are -- this is a different discussion. This is a discussion about unlocking the potential of a Subsea asset. In some cases, it's unlocking the potential of a customer's asset that otherwise would not have been unlocked. So it's a completely different discussion. And we're uniquely positioned to have quite a bit of our exposure in that area not being entirely exposed to that open market. And again, there it does come down to relationships, where it does come down to the discipline within the organization and the rigor and the tendering process to be able to be ensured that we can identify those risks and mitigate those risks before accepting or before tendering on such a project."

So I wondered if you could enlighten us as to whether we should expect to see any upside to that $400 million number? And then, secondly, I just would like to get some clarification around the dividend. You say that we all get some type of confirmation of the dividend or the dividend policy following Q3 results.

Look, there's always a focus -- our customers are always focused on ensuring that they're delivering their best returns for their shareholders and ensuring that they're getting the best value out of the project.",515,"Bill, thank you very much for the question. Look, there's always a focus -- our customers are always focused on ensuring that they're delivering their best returns for their shareholders and ensuring that they're getting the best value out of the project. So there's always that economic discussion. You raise a very good point. Just 6 to 9 months ago, that was the only discussion. And quite frankly, we spent a period of over 5, 6 quarters where you would simply go back, you would present. And the answer was always, ""Thank you very much. Can you go and reengineer?"" Or, ""Can you go and try to drive some more costs out of the project?"" And that was really the extent of the discussion. It is true that over the last several quarters or a couple of quarters, to be more specific, the tone of the conversation has been more balanced around first oil, around accelerated schedules, around project certainty. So project certainty and schedule certainty has become as important as costs. That's where TechnipFMC is uniquely positioned because we are now the only company who installs Subsea -- who delivers Subsea installed on the sea floor. So that whole schedule certainty, that schedule risk, that interface between the equipment manufacturer and the installation company, which often resulted in variation orders, delays and demurrage incurred on the vessels, we now can manage that. And we have the full visibility into our manufacturing capacity as well as the vessel fleet so we can manage that to ensure that we have no downtime and we can drive accelerated and improved accelerated schedule -- accelerated first oil and improved schedule certainty for our customers. So that's clearly been the change in the tone. But there has been another change, and I think this is really important to understand. Our industry hasn't always -- has always been -- there's always been quite a bit of latency in terms of technology adoption. You hear about these wonderful technologies from some great technology companies within the oilfield services space. But they never really seemed to really make that impact, to really start to generate 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30% of their revenue from those technologies. That's always been an issue in our industry. And I have to say, Bill, just within the last quarter, the amount of visits that we've had to our technology center where high-level customers are bringing their management teams to see what we are doing to transform the face of Subsea architecture simpler, lighter, more easily installable, more serviceable has really, really ramped up. I mean it's been a tremendous amount of my personal time and the time of our leadership team to host these visits, which really gives me a clear indication that they're serious about doing things differently. So when you put that together, we're really quite excited about where we are. Again, we have to be realistic. We have to understand that there's certain uncertainties in the market. And we'll remain balanced in our view. But certainly, our customers' behavior has been very positive."

But we'll see how that plays out, Bill. We're not necessarily seeing that same scenario when we talk to our customers in that part of our business. And before we go to our last question, I want to apologize to Fiona. I failed to address the question on the synergies. It's an important question. What -- we are absolutely committed to our targets of $400 million exit rate to 2018 to be realized in 2019, 50% of that by the end of 2017. Indeed, indeed, our teams, by working together and collaborating together, continue to identify synergies and additional synergies above our original expectation. We are focused on delivering those synergies and realizing those synergies and accelerating the realization of those synergies as opposed to necessarily raising synergy targets. There may be a time and a place, but I think what's most important right now given the industry backdrop and the challenging market that we're in is realizing and making real the synergies that our teams have already identified. But rest assured, they're working hard and have identified many synergies for us to work on. And I think we have time for one more question."

What we've been able to do now, by working closely with Petrobras, our partner, and being the leading provider of the technology, is to be able to isolate in which environment that the stress corrosion cracking actually occurs. In addition, we've been able to work with Petrobras to identify both near term and more permanent solutions for the longer term to ensure that the industry still has access even in that isolated application to this very important technology. The benefit from an efficiency point of view, the benefit from an installation point of view is significant for these developments.

Thank you for participating in our third quarter earnings call. 
I will give a brief overview of our operational results, provide an update on our capital allocation strategy and discuss market outlook. Maryann will then review our third quarter financial performance in more detail and provide an update to 2017 guidance. She will also introduce preliminary segment guidance for 2018 before opening the call for questions. 
Third quarter results demonstrated another solid operational performance across all segments. We continue to execute well on the backlog of our long-cycle businesses while capitalizing on market opportunities in our short-cycle businesses, particularly in North America. Total revenues for the quarter exceeded $4.1 billion, with an adjusted EBITDA of $536 million. Total company adjusted EBITDA margin was 12.9%. 
Looking at the individual segments. Subsea adjusted EBITDA margin was 17.6%, Onshore/Offshore was 10.6% and Surface Technologies was 20.1%. These results demonstrate strong margin performance across-the-board with continued operational momentum in several of our largest projects. 
With Jamaal LNG, we delivered all 142 modules to the project site and continued to progress well on the commissioning of Train 1. And with Prelude FLNG, the floating unit was successfully moored on August 24, with the Subsea hookup underway utilizing a complete TechnipFMC Subsea offering. Total company orders for the quarter were $2.5 billion, and we ended the quarter with $13.9 billion of backlog. As a reminder,  our backlog does not capture the reimbursable activity within our Onshore/Offshore business or the reoccurring revenue from Subsea services. Our balance sheet remains strong with net cash of $3.3 billion. 
We've previously outlined the drivers of our capital allocation strategy, with investment for growth as the priority, followed by shareholder distributions, both cash dividends and share repurchases. With respect to capital growth, we recently announced an agreement to acquire Lexuses exploration drilling products and services business, extending our Surface Technologies' offering. We've also increased our investment in the development of next-generation subsea systems and integrated technologies. We are pleased to announce that our Board of Directors has authorized a quarterly dividend of $0.13 per share. And we recently implemented our share repurchase program, putting in motion our plan to repurchase up to $500 million of ordinary shares no later than the end of 2018. This combination of disciplined investment and an ongoing commitment to return cash to shareholders keeps proper focus on our capital base. It also ensures that we can offer competitive distribution while maintaining flexibility to manage the business for the long term. 
Moving to the market outlook. In North America, unconventional resource development continues to lead short-cycle activity. The pace of improvement is likely to slow with our expectation of a more moderate rig count growth. We also anticipate reduced levels of hydraulic fracturing fleet reactivations, partially offset by higher levels of inspection, maintenance and repair work that is needed to support the larger install base. 
Our surface activity outside of North America has been resilient, and the pricing environment has stabilized. The Middle East, North Africa and the North Sea offer the best near-term activity outlook for our international surface business, and we are encouraged to see several longer-term projects moving forward in these regions. 
Moving to longer-cycle businesses. There is little debate over the long-term need for incremental natural gas supply. Natural gas continues to take an increasing share of the global energy demand, and the industry is finding ways to further reduce the total cost of delivery. LNG will continue to provide sizable project opportunities over the long term. In the near term, we see project activity coming from the downstream sector, where we are pursuing several refining and petrochemical projects with an aggregate inbound value of over $5 billion. We know these projects well. We are actively working as the FEED provider or served as the original contractor, which is a very important distinction. This upfront involvement gives us a much better understanding of the project and puts us in a stronger competitive position.  We're also pursuing new opportunities where we can compete on our technical strengths in both our Project Management Consultancy and Process Technology businesses. 
Turning to Subsea. FEED and tendering activity demonstrates that the Subsea recovery is underway. We continue to believe that most major projects can move forward at current oil prices, although we recognize the pace of recovery has been tempered more by near-term price uncertainty than project returns. We've updated our Subsea opportunity list and now show 18 large projects that could be sanctioned over the next 24 months. This project list represents approximately $14 billion of Subsea scope, a significant market opportunity set for us given the breadth of our product and service offering. For the remainder of 2017, we believe that it's still possible for 1 or 2 major projects to move forward. There's also the potential for 1 to be a direct integrated award. Regardless of timing at major project awards, though, we remain confident in a step-up in inbound order activity in 2017 versus the prior year. We also believe the continued momentum in project bid activity will lead to another year of order growth in 2018. 
While the Subsea project list does provide insight into the market's most visible projects, it does not reflect the entire set of opportunities that we are pursuing. We have the list of integrated opportunities that continues to expand, as evidenced by strong growth in integrated FEED activity. Last fall, we disclose to the award of 16 integrated FEED studies, or IFEED, since we first offered an integrated approach. This was compelling evidence that the market was embracing this new approach to fuel development. Over the last 12 months, we have more than doubled the number of IFEED awards, increasing the set of near- and intermediate-term opportunities for integrated project awards. In the third quarter, we announced the conversion of Hurricane Lancaster into an integrated EPCI project, our fifth such award. This is a great example of how early customer engagement through an integrated FEED uniquely positions TechnipFMC to address challenged project economics leading to direct, integrated EPCI project awards. But more importantly, the integrated projects we have today were not sitting on the Subsea project list. These projects were not being actively pursued by the market. They came from this unique portfolio of integrated FEED studies, and they give us a growth platform that is proprietary to TechnipFMC.
Looking to 2018. We think the pace of integrated awards will accelerate. We believe these future integrated projects will be larger than those awarded thus far. They represent a diversified mix of operators, some of which will be repeat customers at the integrated model. And they expand the regional diversity of the integrated approach. In total, we see a greater proportion of our inbound orders coming from direct awards, driven by our alliance partners, our Subsea services business and integrated projects. 
In closing, we continue to execute well across the portfolio, with third quarter results particularly strong in our Onshore/Offshore and Surface Technologies segments. We benefited from continued operational momentum with several of our largest projects. Our North American Surface business benefited from the continued resurgence in land activity, supporting growth in the industry's install base and providing near-term investment opportunities for our integrated surface offering. And in Subsea, we remain confident in a step-up for full year inbound in 2017. With our quarterly results, we have also provided new guidance, both in terms of updates to 2017 as well as a preliminary look into 2018. For 2017, our updates capture the strength of the third quarter as well as the operational momentum we carry into year-end, particularly in the Onshore/Offshore segment. In total, the changes imply an increase in our full year estimate of total segment adjusted EBITDA. As we look into 2018, we are managing revenue declines against the strategic investments needed to maintain the core competencies of our organization, ensuring that we can sustain our operational performance through the recovery. We see significant opportunities ahead, and these will be driven by internal initiatives as well as market fundamentals. We will generate further integration savings and operational efficiencies. And we will continue to deliver real, differentiated and sustainable change through integrated business models that will generate benefits for our customers and for our company. I remain optimistic about the recovery of Subsea, and I am even more confident in the future of TechnipFMC than ever before. We are executing well as one global entity, and we are winning in areas where we can provide true differentiation. 
I will now turn the call over to Maryann."

Let's take a look at the corporate items in the quarter. Reported corporate expense was $42 million. Included in the quarterly results is $19 million of net gains associated with foreign currency. When excluding charges and credits, the adjusted expense was $41 million. Net interest expense was $86 million. This includes $73 million of additional liability to joint venture partners. Our reported tax provision for the quarter was $112 million, resulting in a reported tax rate of 48.6%. However, our effective tax rate in the quarter was 30.3% when excluding the impact of certain discrete items. In the final week of the quarter, we began our share repurchase program. Since that time, we have repurchased approximately [ 730,000 ] shares at a total cost of $19.6 million as of yesterday's close of business. 
Looking ahead, we have made updates to our full year guidance for 2017. For Subsea, our 2017 guidance remains the same, with revenues of at least $6.1 billion and EBITDA margins of at least 17%, excluding charges and credits. For Onshore/Offshore, we are raising full year guidance for both revenue and adjusted EBITDA margin. Due to the improved performance expected in the second half of the year, we now anticipate revenue to be at least $7.7 billion and EBITDA margins to be at least 9.5%, excluding charges and credits. For Surface Technologies, we now expect full year revenue to be at least $1.3 billion. We are increasing adjusted EBITDA margin guidance by 350 basis points to be at least 16.5%, excluding charges and credit. These changes reflect our strong performance and higher expectations for North America. 
Outside of our operating segment, we have updated guidance for the following that items. Net interest items is expected to be approximately $15 million in the fourth quarter and does not assume any future liability increases to the joint venture partners. Tax rate is expected to be between 30% and 32% for the full year, excluding discrete item. Capital expenditures are now expected to be $250 million for the full year. And we now expect to spend approximately $75 million for merger and integration cost in the fourth quarter. 
Let me provide you an update on our merger and integration synergies. We remain confident that we will achieve $200 million in run rate savings by the end of this year and the total of $400 million in run rate savings by the end of 2018. These actions will generate savings across the portfolio as shown in recent disclosures we have made highlighting the allocation and savings by reporting segment. The greatest impacts will be realized in our Subsea and Onshore/Offshore segment. The anticipated savings to be realized for 2018 are included in the preliminary segment guidance we provided in our earnings release. 
We believe it is important to provide a preliminary view to the market with the intention of furthering the understanding of inbound synergies, pricing and cost structure impact on our 2018 expected performance. While early to provide a total company view for 2018, we're still completing our planning and actions for next year. We have a good understanding of many of the key operational drivers of our business, and this is reflected in the current outlook for next year. For Subsea, we expect revenues to be in the range of $5 billion to $5.3 billion with an EBITDA margin of at least 14%. For Onshore/Offshore, we expect revenues to be in the range of $5.3 billion to $5.7 billion with an EBIT margin of at least 9.5%. For Surface Technologies, we expect revenues to be in the range of $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion with an EBIT margin of at least 17.5%. Please note the margin guidance excludes all charges and credits. We will provide updated and complete guidance for 2018 with the release of our fourth quarter earning. 
Turning to Subsea first. As Doug commented earlier, we remain confident that the Subsea recovery is underway and that 2018 should be another year of order growth. However, the inflection point for revenues will lag the order recovery. For 2018, we're guiding to Subsea revenue in a range of $5 billion to $5.3 billion. This forecast includes $2.6 billion of secured backlog. Also included is an estimated $1 billion of Subsea services revenue, the majority of which is not yet booked in our backlog. We have confidence in realizing these combined revenue streams, and together, they comprise approximately 70% of guidance at the midpoint of our range. We expect Subsea EBITDA margins next year to be at least 14%. This will be down from our 2017 guidance of at least 17%. 
Let me walk you through the primary drivers. Based on 2017 guidance, revenues are anticipated to decline approximately 16% if we assume the midpoint of our 2018 guidance. Lower revenue will negatively impact margins due to the effects of reduced activity across our fixed asset base. One example of this will be our fleet. We cited fleet utilization in the third quarter of 70%. This will be lower in 2018, although secured backlog for 2019 and beyond should benefit utilization looking further out. Beyond the revenue impact, near-term investment will be a headwind on margins. Our investment in new technologies should yield strategic, long-term benefits, and these cost will impact in 2018. These investments are critically important and enable us to deliver the differentiation in our business model. Additionally, we are investing in our people. These costs related to the retention of core competencies both in engineering and project management that are critical to successful project delivery beyond the cycle trough. This is supported by our confidence in the inbound recovery of Subsea. 2018 will also be impacted by the more competitive market conditions of the current cycle trough. It is evident that the market has encountered more competitive pricing for large project tenders where open bidding takes place. These effects will have a greater impact on 2018 results at some of our older projects advance to completion and contribute less towards 2018 profitability. While we continue to participate in open tenders, we're also focused on bidding where we have a competitive advantage. These opportunities would include projects proprietary technology or an integrated approach can provide a differentiated offering that can deliver significant savings in both time and cost. Providing some offset to the expected margin headwinds will be the merger-related savings. We may also look to undertake for the restructuring actions based on market conditions. While 2018 for Subsea will be down both in revenues and EBITDA, we remain confident that the order inflection should ultimately translate into higher revenues in margins in our Subsea segment in the coming years. 
Moving to Onshore/Offshore. We expect full year revenues to being the range of $5.3 billion to $5.7 billion. While revenues are declining, our EBITDA margin guidance of at least 9.5% remains at higher levels, consistent with 2017. Our revenue expectation incorporates a lower contribution from Yamal LNG as the project move towards completion in 2019. EBITDA margin reflects continued strong project execution. 
For our Surface Technologies segment, we expect full year revenues to be in the range of $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion with an EBITDA margin of at least 17.5%. Revenue guidance is based on the following expectations. First, we are using current North America rig count to support these assumptions, and volatility in this rig count may require changes to our full year assumptions. Next, that increased hydraulic fracturing intensity will lead to higher demand for pressure control equipment. Last, initiatives are in place to expand our integrated offering in North America. 
So in summary, we expect for the combined company that our strong operational performance, cost-reduction initiative and actions we have taken with regard to cash distribution should demonstrate our focus on creating shareholder value.

So these, if you will, are not projects that are being pursued by our competition. The advantage of having worked together now for almost 3 years initially in the alliance and joint venture and more importantly now as a single entity, TechnipFMC, allows us to take that work that we've been doing as it matures through the FEED stage, which typically takes 12 to 15 months and then into the FID states, which typically takes 6 months. We now have this backlog of integrated FEED activity that has the opportunity to convert into integrated EPCI projects. So we're looking at both the visible open tenders and participating where we think we can create value for ourselves and for our customers, where the economical limit -- by setting economical limits. But on these integrated projects, we have that unique opportunity because of the early engagement to introduce new proprietary technologies, to deliver Subsea architecture that is unique and differentiated and at the end a situation where we can help our customers meet their economic hurdle rate while benefiting ourselves as well. So it's simply the majority of that FEED, the maturation of that FEED backlog that now gives us the unique ability to be able to convert an increasing number in 2018 to integrated EPCI projects. In that list of maturing projects, we see some projects that are larger in size than some of the awards we have received thus far, and hence, the comment in the prepared remarks."

I did mention in my prepared remarks that we're tracking a few projects to have an aggregate inbound value of over $5 billion. We feel we are very well positioned on these projects. It's not so much a question of if we would be awarded the projects, if we would be the winning entity on the projects. It's more a question of when the projects will actually be sanctioned. These are big, massive petrochemical and refinery developments that some have been on our list for a period of time and are held up for one reason or another beyond that of the contribution that we're making to the project. So we feel very strongly about the projects. It's just a question of the timing of the projects and when they're actually sanctioned. If they come in 2018 as we are anticipating, that will certainly benefit 2019."

And this, right now, about 50% greenfield, 50% brownfield. And we also showed you on by relative size, and that information is available and we could provide that to you. So you'll see it's quite applicable and can be appropriately distributed across the broad range. Clearly, in 2017, there was more brownfield tieback activity than greenfield project sanctioning. That being said, we were very excited to be part of many of the greenfield projects that were sanctioned in 2017. Looking forward to 2018, we're signaling that there's a possibility for additional large projects to be sanctioned, both from the opportunity list as well as iEPCI projects, some of which lie on that Subsea opportunity list that we shared."

So I wonder whether you could, in summary, give us your view on how competitive the offshore market have become as a result of the cost reductions that are happening because of the drilling activities, but also that you are driving and particularly sort of with respect to what you mentioned on technology and architecture that you can now facilitate in terms of both cost reductions and, of course, time to first oil?

So we have been working diligently for the past 3 years to look at ways to put together a unique value proposition that could sustainably improve project economics. And as you point out, the acceleration of first oil is actually more important than the actual cost of the development. So the ability to be able to do both is what's really driving the improvement of project economics for our customers. So we've given examples of the past. We are taking a subsea architecture that typically took 36 months to deliver at the peak of the activity, and I'd say about 28 to 36 months on average. And we can now deliver in 15 months. Further to that, we're now working with customers where they're working towards our industry specifications and using our standards and using our new integrated delivery model that we can deliver on the seabed installed and commissioned in less than 12 months, almost becoming a short-cycle business. That is a major, major distinctions from the way that Subsea has been viewed in the past. On top of that, some of the reservoirs offshore remains of some of the most prolific reservoirs that we have. So you couple the prolific reservoirs with a much reduced delivery time and lower total cost of by removing unnecessary capital investment in terms of interfaces, et cetera, that's used today by going to an integrated approach with early involvement, with new technology and with a single company that can deliver an integrated model installed on the seabed, it's really driving change. We've seen that. We've seen the success that we had in 2017, and we anticipate greater success in 2018. As you point out, the overall breakeven on these projects have come down significantly. You heard our customers talk about breakevens on these projects below $40 a barrel. We certainly believe that at $50 a barrel, we can remain competitive with other alternative investment choices. One last area that's really -- that's unique and that's really developing, we're seeing an emerging trend of independent operators backed by private equity money, moving into the development of these assets. So there's always -- the reservoirs will always be developed. They may be developed by different customers at different times in the cycle, but we're seeing very interesting trends develop. And we're at the forefront of that because of the unique offering of TechnipFMC."

Thank you for participating in our third quarter earnings call. 
I will give a brief overview of our operational results, provide an update on our capital allocation strategy and discuss market outlook. Maryann will then review our third quarter financial performance in more detail and provide an update to 2017 guidance. She will also introduce preliminary segment guidance for 2018 before opening the call for questions. 
Third quarter results demonstrated another solid operational performance across all segments. We continue to execute well on the backlog of our long-cycle businesses while capitalizing on market opportunities in our short-cycle businesses, particularly in North America. Total revenues for the quarter exceeded $4.1 billion, with an adjusted EBITDA of $536 million. Total company adjusted EBITDA margin was 12.9%. 
Looking at the individual segments. Subsea adjusted EBITDA margin was 17.6%, Onshore/Offshore was 10.6% and Surface Technologies was 20.1%. These results demonstrate strong margin performance across-the-board with continued operational momentum in several of our largest projects. 
With the Yamal LNG, we delivered all 142 modules to the project site and continued to progress well on the commissioning of Train 1. And with Prelude FLNG, the floating unit was successfully moored on August 24, with the Subsea hookup underway utilizing a complete TechnipFMC Subsea offering. Total company orders for the quarter were $2.5 billion, and we ended the quarter with $13.9 billion of backlog. As a reminder,  our backlog does not capture the reimbursable activity within our Onshore/Offshore business or the reoccurring revenue from Subsea services. Our balance sheet remains strong with net cash of $3.3 billion. 
We previously outlined the drivers of our capital allocation strategy, with investment for growth as the priority, followed by shareholder distributions, both cash dividends and share repurchases. 
With respect to capital growth, we recently announced an agreement to acquire Plexus' exploration-drilling products and services business, extending our Surface Technologies offering. We've also increased our investment in the development of next-generation subsea systems and integrated technologies. We are pleased to announce that our Board of Directors has authorized a quarterly dividend of $0.13 per share. And we recently implemented our share repurchase program, putting in motion our plan to repurchase up to $500 million of ordinary shares no later than the end of 2018. This combination of disciplined investment and an ongoing commitment to return cash to shareholders keeps proper focus on our capital base. It also ensures that we can offer competitive distribution while maintaining flexibility to manage the business for the long term.
Moving to the market outlook. In North America, unconventional resource development continues to lead short-cycle activity. The pace of improvement is likely to slow with our expectation of a more moderate rig count growth. We also anticipate reduced levels of hydraulic fracturing fleet reactivations, partially offset by higher levels of inspection, maintenance and repair work that is needed to support the larger install base. 
Our surface activity outside of North America has been resilient, and the pricing environment has stabilized. The Middle East, North Africa and the North Sea offer the best near-term activity outlook for our international surface business. And we are encouraged to see several longer-term projects moving forward in these regions. 
Moving to longer-cycle businesses. There is little debate over the long-term need for incremental natural gas supply. Natural gas continues to take an increasing share of the global energy demand, and the industry is finding ways to further reduce the total cost of delivery. LNG will continue to provide sizable project opportunities over the long term. In the near term, we see project activity coming from the downstream sector, where we are pursuing several refining and petrochemical projects with an aggregate inbound value of over $5 billion. We know these projects well. We are actively working as the FEED provider or served as the original contractor, which is a very important distinction. This upfront involvement gives us a much better understanding of the project and puts us in a stronger competitive position.  We're also pursuing new opportunities where we can compete on our technical strengths in both our Project Management Consultancy and Process Technology businesses. 
Turning to Subsea. FEED and tendering activity demonstrates that the Subsea recovery is underway. We continue to believe that most major projects can move forward at current oil prices, although we recognize the pace of recovery has been tempered more by near-term price uncertainty than project returns. We've updated our Subsea opportunity list and now show 18 large projects that could be sanctioned over the next 24 months. This project list represents approximately $14 billion of Subsea scope, a significant market opportunity set for us given the breadth of our product and service offering. 
For the remainder of 2017, we believe that it's still possible for 1 or 2 major projects to move forward. There's also the potential for one to be a direct integrated award. Regardless of timing at major project awards, though, we remain confident in a step-up in inbound order activity in 2017 versus the prior year. We also believe the continued momentum in project bid activity will lead to another year of order growth in 2018. 
While the Subsea project list does provide insight into the market's most visible projects, it does not reflect the entire set of opportunities that we are pursuing. We have a list of integrated opportunities that continues to expand, as evidenced by strong growth in integrated FEED activity. Last fall, we disclosed the award of 16 integrated FEED studies, or iFEED, since we first offered an integrated approach. This is compelling -- this was compelling evidence that the market was embracing this new approach to fuel development. Over the last 12 months, we have more than doubled the number of iFEED awards, increasing the set of near- and intermediate-term opportunities for integrated project awards. 
In the third quarter, we announced the conversion of Hurricane Lancaster into an integrated EPCI project, our fifth such award. This is a great example of how early customer engagement through an integrated FEED uniquely positions TechnipFMC to address challenged project economics leading to direct, integrated EPCI project awards. But more importantly, the integrated projects we have today were not sitting on the Subsea project list. These projects were not being actively pursued by the market. They came from this unique portfolio of integrated FEED studies, and they give us a growth platform that is proprietary to TechnipFMC.
Looking to 2018. We think the pace of integrated awards will accelerate. We believe these future integrated projects will be larger than those awarded thus far. They represent a diversified mix of operators, some of which will be repeat customers at the integrated model. And they expand the regional diversity of the integrated approach. In total, we see a greater proportion of our inbound orders coming from direct awards, driven by our alliance partners, our Subsea services business and integrated projects. 
In closing, we continue to execute well across the portfolio, with third quarter results particularly strong in our Onshore/Offshore and Surface Technologies segments. We benefited from continued operational momentum with several of our largest projects. Our North American Surface business benefited from the continued resurgence in land activity, supporting growth in the industry's install base and providing near-term investment opportunities for our integrated surface offering. 
And in Subsea, we remain confident in a step-up for full year inbound in 2017. With our quarterly results, we have also provided new guidance, both in terms of updates to 2017 as well as a preliminary look into 2018. For 2017, our updates capture the strength of the third quarter as well as the operational momentum we carry into year-end, particularly in the Onshore/Offshore segment. In total, the changes imply an increase in our full year estimate of total segment adjusted EBITDA. 
As we look into 2018, we are managing revenue declines against the strategic investments needed to maintain the core competencies of our organization, ensuring that we can sustain our operational performance through the recovery. We see significant opportunities ahead, and these will be driven by internal initiatives as well as market fundamentals. We will generate further integration savings and operational efficiencies. And we will continue to deliver real, differentiated and sustainable change through integrated business models that will generate benefits for our customers and for our company. I remain optimistic about the recovery of Subsea, and I am even more confident in the future of TechnipFMC than ever before. We are executing well as one global entity, and we are winning in areas where we can provide true differentiation. 
I will now turn the call over to Maryann."

We delivered solid operating results in the quarter. These were in line or above our expectations. Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.39 when excluding after-tax charges and credits of $0.13 per diluted share. Charges and credits in the quarter totaled $101 million on a pretax basis. Included were pretax charges of $10.9 million related to the impact of Hurricane Harvey. We have provided more detail for these items in the accompanying schedules to our release, but the majority relate to cost associated with our merger as well as restructuring cost and severance cost.
Total company adjusted EBITDA was $536 million in the quarter. Year-over-year adjusted EBITDA margins decreased 100 basis points to 12.9% despite revenue declines. This is the result of good project execution in our Onshore/Offshore and Subsea projects and the improving activity levels in Surface Americas. Doug has shared with you segment operational highlights. 
Let's take a look at the corporate items in the quarter. Reported corporate expense was $42 million. Included in the quarterly results is $19 million of net gains associated with foreign currency. When excluding charges and credits, the adjusted expense was $41 million. Net interest expense was $86 million. This includes $73 million of additional liability to joint venture partners. Our reported tax provision for the quarter was $112 million, resulting in a reported tax rate of 48.6%. However, our effective tax rate in the quarter was 30.3% when excluding the impact of certain discrete items. In the final week of the quarter, we began our share repurchase program. Since that time, we have repurchased approximately 730,000 shares at a total cost of $19.6 million as of yesterday's close of business. 
Looking ahead, we have made updates to our full year guidance for 2017. For Subsea, our 2017 guidance remains the same, with revenues of at least $6.1 billion and EBITDA margins of at least 17%, excluding charges and credits. For Onshore/Offshore, we are raising full year guidance for both revenue and adjusted EBITDA margin. Due to the improved performance expected in the second half of the year, we now anticipate revenue to be at least $7.7 billion and EBITDA margins to be at least 9.5%, excluding charges and credits. For Surface Technologies, we now expect full year revenue to be at least $1.3 billion. We are increasing adjusted EBITDA margin guidance by 350 basis points to be at least 16.5%, excluding charges and credit. These changes reflect our strong performance and higher expectations for North America. 
Outside of our operating segments, we have updated guidance for the following items. Net interest expense is expected to be approximately $15 million in the fourth quarter and does not assume any future liability increases to the joint venture partners. Tax rate is expected to be between 30% and 32% for the full year, excluding discrete item. Capital expenditures are now expected to be $250 million for the full year. And we now expect to spend approximately $75 million for merger and integration costs in the fourth quarter. 
Let me provide you an update on our merger integration synergies. We remain confident that we will achieve $200 million in run rate savings by the end of this year and the total of $400 million in run rate savings by the end of 2018. These actions will generate savings across the portfolio, as shown in recent disclosures we have made, highlighting the allocation of savings by reporting segment. The greatest impacts will be realized in our Subsea and Onshore/Offshore segments. The anticipated savings to be realized for 2018 are included in the preliminary segment guidance we provided in our earnings release. 
We believe it is important to provide a preliminary view to the market with the intention of furthering the understanding of inbound synergies, pricing and cost structure impact on our 2018 expected performance. 
While early to provide a total company view for 2018, we are still completing our planning and actions for next year. We have a good understanding of many of the key operational drivers of our business, and this is reflected in the current outlook for next year. 
For Subsea, we expect revenues to be in a range of $5 billion to $5.3 billion, with an EBITDA margin of at least 14%. For Onshore/Offshore, we expect revenues to be in a range of $5.3 billion to $5.7 billion, with an EBIT margin of at least 9.5%. For Surface Technologies, we expect revenues to be in a range of $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion, with an EBIT margin of at least 17.5%. Please note, the margin guidance excludes all charges and credits. We will provide updated and complete guidance for 2018 with the release of our fourth quarter earning. 
Turning to Subsea first. As Doug commented earlier, we remain confident that the Subsea recovery is underway and that 2018 should be another year of order growth. However, the inflection point for revenues will lag the order recovery. For 2018, we're guiding to Subsea revenue in a range of $5 billion to $5.3 billion. This forecast includes $2.6 billion of secured backlog. Also included is an estimated $1 billion of Subsea services revenue, the majority of which does not get booked in our backlog. We have confidence in realizing these combined revenue streams, and together, they comprise approximately 70% of guidance at the midpoint of our range. We expect Subsea EBITDA margins next year to be at least 14%. This will be down from our 2017 guidance of at least 17%. 
Let me walk you through the primary drivers. Based on 2017 guidance, revenues are anticipated to decline approximately 16% if we assume the midpoint of our 2018 guidance. Lower revenue will negatively impact margins due to the effects of reduced activity across our fixed asset base. One example of this will be our fleet. We cited fleet utilization in the third quarter of 70%. This will be lower in 2018, although secured backlog for 2019 and beyond should benefit utilization looking further out. Beyond the revenue impact, near-term investment will be a headwind on margins. Our investment in new technologies should yield strategic, long-term benefits, and these costs will impact 2018. These investments are critically important and enable us to deliver the differentiation in our business model. Additionally, we are investing in our people. These costs relate to the retention of core competencies, both in engineering and project management that are critical to successful project delivery beyond the cycle trough. This is supported by our confidence in the inbound recovery of Subsea. 2018 will also be impacted by the more competitive market conditions of the current cycle trough. It is evident that the market has encountered more competitive pricing for large project tenders where open bidding takes place. These effects will have a greater impact on 2018 results at some of our older projects advance to completion and contribute less towards 2018 profitability. 
While we continue to participate in open tenders, we are also focused on bidding where we have a competitive advantage. These opportunities would include projects for either proprietary technology or an integrated approach can provide a differentiated offering that can deliver significant savings in both time and cost. Providing some offset to the expected margin headwinds will be the merger-related savings. We may also look to undertake further restructuring actions based on market conditions. While 2018 for Subsea will be down both in revenues and EBITDA, we remain confident that the order inflection should ultimately translate into higher revenues and margins in our Subsea segment in the coming years. 
Moving to Onshore/Offshore. We expect full year revenues to be in the range of $5.3 billion to $5.7 billion. While revenues are declining, our EBITDA margin guidance of at least 9.5% remains at higher levels, consistent with 2017. Our revenue expectation incorporates a lower contribution from Yamal LNG as the project moves towards completion in 2019. EBITDA margin reflects continued strong project execution. 
For our Surface Technologies segment, we expect full year revenues to be in the range of $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion with an EBITDA margin of at least 17.5%. Revenue guidance is based on the following expectations. First, we are using current North America rig count to support these assumptions, and volatility in this rig count may require changes to our full year assumptions. Next, that increased hydraulic fracturing intensity will lead to higher demand for pressure control equipment. Last, initiatives are in place to expand our integrated offering in North America. 
So in summary, we expect for the combined company that our strong operational performance, cost-reduction initiatives and actions we have taken with regard to cash distribution should demonstrate our focus on creating shareholder value.

And as I pointed out, it gives us a unique view into the marketplace. And in many cases, we're working on projects on an exclusive basis with our customers. So these, if you will, are not projects that are being pursued by our competition. The advantage of having worked together now for almost 3 years, initially in the alliance and joint venture and more importantly now as a single entity, TechnipFMC, allows us to take that work that we've been doing as it matures through the FEED stage, which typically takes 12 to 15 months and then into the FID stage, which typically takes 6 months. We now have this backlog of integrated FEED activity that has the opportunity to convert into integrated EPCI projects. So we're looking at both the visible open tenders and participating where we think we can create value for ourselves and for our customers, where the economical limit -- by setting economical limits. But on these integrated projects, we have that unique opportunity because of the early engagement to introduce new proprietary technologies, to deliver Subsea architecture that is unique and differentiated and to be in a situation where we can help our customers meet their economic hurdle rate while benefiting ourselves as well. So it's simply the majority of that FEED, the maturation of that FEED backlog that now gives us the unique ability to be able to convert an increasing number in 2018 to integrated EPCI projects. In that list of maturing projects, we see some projects that are larger in size than some of the awards we have received thus far, and hence, the comment in the prepared remarks."

And a lot of pressure on big oil companies as Chevron, Oxy, Apache, Anadarko to mention a few to kind of dispose some Offshore assets and reinvest in Shale oil. Since that the tide is turning a little bit. So I wonder whether you could -- just in summary, give us your view on how competitive the offshore markets have become as a result of the cost reductions that are happening because of drilling efficiencies, but also those that you are driving, and particularly sort of with respect to what you mentioned on technology and architecture that you can now facilitate in terms of both cost reductions and, of course, time to first oil. So could you just give us a high level of the extent that breakevens now have been lowered resetting the whole bunch of studies that you're doing? But how competitive have this become relative to other investment alternatives?"

And I'll try to be brief, but it is a very important question. So we have been working diligently for the past 3 years to look at ways to put together a unique value proposition that could sustainably improve project economics. And as you point out, the acceleration of first oil is actually more important than the actual cost of the development. So the ability to be able to do both is what's really driving the improvement of project economics for our customers. So we've given examples of the past. We are taking a subsea architecture that typically took 36 months to deliver at the peak of the activity, and I'd say about 28 to 36 months on average. And we can now deliver in 15 months. Further to that, we're now working with customers where they're working towards our industry specifications and using our standards and using our new integrated delivery model that we can deliver on the seabed installed and commissioned in less than 12 months, almost becoming a short-cycle business. That is a major, major distinction from the way that Subsea has been viewed in the past. On top of that, some of the reservoirs offshore remains some of the most prolific reservoirs that we have. So you couple the prolific reservoirs with a much reduced delivery time and lower total cost by removing unnecessary capital investment in terms of interfaces, et cetera, that's used today by going to an integrated approach with early involvement, with new technology and with a single company that can deliver an integrated model installed on the seabed, it's really driving change. We've seen that. We've seen the success that we had in 2017, and we anticipate greater success in 2018. As you point out, the overall breakeven on these projects have come down significantly. You heard our customers talk about breakevens on these projects below $40 a barrel. We certainly believe that at $50 a barrel, we can remain competitive with other alternative investment choices. One last area that's really -- that's unique and that's really developing, we're seeing an emerging trend of independent operators backed by private equity money, moving into the development of these assets. So there's always -- the reservoirs will always be developed. They may be developed by different customers at different times in the cycle, but we're seeing very interesting trends develop. And we're at the forefront of that because of the unique offering of TechnipFMC."

Thank you for participating in our third quarter earnings call. 
I will give a brief overview of our operational results, provide an update on our capital allocation strategy and discuss market outlook. Maryann will then review our third quarter financial performance in more detail and provide an update to 2017 guidance. She will also introduce preliminary segment guidance for 2018 before opening the call for questions. 
Third quarter results demonstrated another solid operational performance across all segments. We continue to execute well on the backlog of our long-cycle businesses while capitalizing on market opportunities in our short-cycle businesses, particularly in North America. Total revenues for the quarter exceeded $4.1 billion, with an adjusted EBITDA of $536 million. Total company adjusted EBITDA margin was 12.9%. 
Looking at the individual segments. Subsea adjusted EBITDA margin was 17.6%, Onshore/Offshore was 10.6% and Surface Technologies was 20.1%. These results demonstrate strong margin performance across-the-board with continued operational momentum in several of our largest projects. 
With the Yamal LNG, we delivered all 142 modules to the project site and continued to progress well on the commissioning of Train 1. And with Prelude FLNG, the floating unit was successfully moored on August 24, with the Subsea hookup underway utilizing a complete TechnipFMC Subsea offering. Total company orders for the quarter were $2.5 billion, and we ended the quarter with $13.9 billion of backlog. As a reminder,  our backlog does not capture the reimbursable activity within our Onshore/Offshore business or the reoccurring revenue from Subsea services. Our balance sheet remains strong with net cash of $3.3 billion. 
We previously outlined the drivers of our capital allocation strategy, with investment for growth as the priority, followed by shareholder distributions, both cash dividends and share repurchases. 
With respect to capital growth, we recently announced an agreement to acquire Plexus' exploration-drilling products and services business, extending our Surface Technologies offering. We've also increased our investment in the development of next-generation subsea systems and integrated technologies. We are pleased to announce that our Board of Directors has authorized a quarterly dividend of $0.13 per share. And we recently implemented our share repurchase program, putting in motion our plan to repurchase up to $500 million of ordinary shares no later than the end of 2018. This combination of disciplined investment and an ongoing commitment to return cash to shareholders keeps proper focus on our capital base. It also ensures that we can offer competitive distribution while maintaining flexibility to manage the business for the long term.
Moving to the market outlook. In North America, unconventional resource development continues to lead short-cycle activity. The pace of improvement is likely to slow with our expectation of a more moderate rig count growth. We also anticipate reduced levels of hydraulic fracturing fleet reactivations, partially offset by higher levels of inspection, maintenance and repair work that is needed to support the larger install base. 
Our surface activity outside of North America has been resilient, and the pricing environment has stabilized. The Middle East, North Africa and the North Sea offer the best near-term activity outlook for our international surface business. And we are encouraged to see several longer-term projects moving forward in these regions. 
Moving to longer-cycle businesses. There is little debate over the long-term need for incremental natural gas supply. Natural gas continues to take an increasing share of the global energy demand, and the industry is finding ways to further reduce the total cost of delivery. LNG will continue to provide sizable project opportunities over the long term. In the near term, we see project activity coming from the downstream sector, where we are pursuing several refining and petrochemical projects with an aggregate inbound value of over $5 billion. We know these projects well. We are actively working as the FEED provider or served as the original contractor, which is a very important distinction. This upfront involvement gives us a much better understanding of the project and puts us in a stronger competitive position.  We're also pursuing new opportunities where we can compete on our technical strengths in both our Project Management Consultancy and Process Technology businesses. 
Turning to Subsea. FEED and tendering activity demonstrates that the Subsea recovery is underway. We continue to believe that most major projects can move forward at current oil prices, although we recognize the pace of recovery has been tempered more by near-term price uncertainty than project returns. We've updated our Subsea opportunity list and now show 18 large projects that could be sanctioned over the next 24 months. This project list represents approximately $14 billion of Subsea scope, a significant market opportunity set for us given the breadth of our product and service offering. 
For the remainder of 2017, we believe that it's still possible for 1 or 2 major projects to move forward. There's also the potential for one to be a direct integrated award. Regardless of timing at major project awards, though, we remain confident in a step-up in inbound order activity in 2017 versus the prior year. We also believe the continued momentum in project bid activity will lead to another year of order growth in 2018. 
While the Subsea project list does provide insight into the market's most visible projects, it does not reflect the entire set of opportunities that we are pursuing. We have a list of integrated opportunities that continues to expand, as evidenced by strong growth in integrated FEED activity. Last fall, we disclosed the award of 16 integrated FEED studies, or iFEED, since we first offered an integrated approach. This is compelling -- this was compelling evidence that the market was embracing this new approach to fuel development. Over the last 12 months, we have more than doubled the number of iFEED awards, increasing the set of near- and intermediate-term opportunities for integrated project awards. 
In the third quarter, we announced the conversion of Hurricane Lancaster into an integrated EPCI project, our fifth such award. This is a great example of how early customer engagement through an integrated FEED uniquely positions TechnipFMC to address challenged project economics leading to direct, integrated EPCI project awards. But more importantly, the integrated projects we have today were not sitting on the Subsea project list. These projects were not being actively pursued by the market. They came from this unique portfolio of integrated FEED studies, and they give us a growth platform that is proprietary to TechnipFMC.
Looking to 2018. We think the pace of integrated awards will accelerate. We believe these future integrated projects will be larger than those awarded thus far. They represent a diversified mix of operators, some of which will be repeat customers at the integrated model. And they expand the regional diversity of the integrated approach. In total, we see a greater proportion of our inbound orders coming from direct awards, driven by our alliance partners, our Subsea services business and integrated projects. 
In closing, we continue to execute well across the portfolio, with third quarter results particularly strong in our Onshore/Offshore and Surface Technologies segments. We benefited from continued operational momentum with several of our largest projects. Our North American Surface business benefited from the continued resurgence in land activity, supporting growth in the industry's install base and providing near-term investment opportunities for our integrated surface offering. 
And in Subsea, we remain confident in a step-up for full year inbound in 2017. With our quarterly results, we have also provided new guidance, both in terms of updates to 2017 as well as a preliminary look into 2018. For 2017, our updates capture the strength of the third quarter as well as the operational momentum we carry into year-end, particularly in the Onshore/Offshore segment. In total, the changes imply an increase in our full year estimate of total segment adjusted EBITDA. 
As we look into 2018, we are managing revenue declines against the strategic investments needed to maintain the core competencies of our organization, ensuring that we can sustain our operational performance through the recovery. We see significant opportunities ahead, and these will be driven by internal initiatives as well as market fundamentals. We will generate further integration savings and operational efficiencies. And we will continue to deliver real, differentiated and sustainable change through integrated business models that will generate benefits for our customers and for our company. I remain optimistic about the recovery of Subsea, and I am even more confident in the future of TechnipFMC than ever before. We are executing well as one global entity, and we are winning in areas where we can provide true differentiation. 
I will now turn the call over to Maryann."

We delivered solid operating results in the quarter. These were in line or above our expectations. Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.39 when excluding after-tax charges and credits of $0.13 per diluted share. Charges and credits in the quarter totaled $101 million on a pretax basis. Included were pretax charges of $10.9 million related to the impact of Hurricane Harvey. We have provided more detail for these items in the accompanying schedules to our release, but the majority relate to cost associated with our merger as well as restructuring cost and severance cost.
Total company adjusted EBITDA was $536 million in the quarter. Year-over-year adjusted EBITDA margins decreased 100 basis points to 12.9% despite revenue declines. This is the result of good project execution in our Onshore/Offshore and Subsea projects and the improving activity levels in Surface Americas. Doug has shared with you segment operational highlights. 
Let's take a look at the corporate items in the quarter. Reported corporate expense was $42 million. Included in the quarterly results is $19 million of net gains associated with foreign currency. When excluding charges and credits, the adjusted expense was $41 million. Net interest expense was $86 million. This includes $73 million of additional liability to joint venture partners. Our reported tax provision for the quarter was $112 million, resulting in a reported tax rate of 48.6%. However, our effective tax rate in the quarter was 30.3% when excluding the impact of certain discrete items. In the final week of the quarter, we began our share repurchase program. Since that time, we have repurchased approximately 730,000 shares at a total cost of $19.6 million as of yesterday's close of business. 
Looking ahead, we have made updates to our full year guidance for 2017. For Subsea, our 2017 guidance remains the same, with revenues of at least $6.1 billion and EBITDA margins of at least 17%, excluding charges and credits. For Onshore/Offshore, we are raising full year guidance for both revenue and adjusted EBITDA margin. Due to the improved performance expected in the second half of the year, we now anticipate revenue to be at least $7.7 billion and EBITDA margins to be at least 9.5%, excluding charges and credits. For Surface Technologies, we now expect full year revenue to be at least $1.3 billion. We are increasing adjusted EBITDA margin guidance by 350 basis points to be at least 16.5%, excluding charges and credit. These changes reflect our strong performance and higher expectations for North America. 
Outside of our operating segments, we have updated guidance for the following items. Net interest expense is expected to be approximately $15 million in the fourth quarter and does not assume any future liability increases to the joint venture partners. Tax rate is expected to be between 30% and 32% for the full year, excluding discrete items. Capital expenditures are now expected to be $250 million for the full year. And we now expect to spend approximately $75 million for merger and integration costs in the fourth quarter. 
Let me provide you an update on our merger integration synergies. We remain confident that we will achieve $200 million in run rate savings by the end of this year and a total of $400 million in run rate savings by the end of 2018. These actions will generate savings across the portfolio, as shown in recent disclosures we have made, highlighting the allocation of savings by reporting segment. The greatest impacts will be realized in our Subsea and Onshore/Offshore segments. The anticipated savings to be realized for 2018 are included in the preliminary segment guidance we provided in our earnings release. 
We believe it is important to provide a preliminary view to the market with the intention of furthering the understanding of inbound synergies, pricing and cost structure impact on our 2018 expected performance. 
While early to provide a total company view for 2018, we are still completing our planning and actions for next year. We have a good understanding of many of the key operational drivers of our business, and this is reflected in the current outlook for next year. 
For Subsea, we expect revenues to be in a range of $5 billion to $5.3 billion, with an EBITDA margin of at least 14%. For Onshore/Offshore, we expect revenues to be in a range of $5.3 billion to $5.7 billion, with an EBIT margin of at least 9.5%. For Surface Technologies, we expect revenues to be in a range of $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion, with an EBIT margin of at least 17.5%. Please note, the margin guidance excludes all charges and credits. We will provide updated and complete guidance for 2018 with the release of our fourth quarter earning. 
Turning to Subsea first. As Doug commented earlier, we remain confident that the Subsea recovery is underway and that 2018 should be another year of order growth. However, the inflection point for revenues will lag the order recovery. For 2018, we're guiding to Subsea revenue in a range of $5 billion to $5.3 billion. This forecast includes $2.6 billion of secured backlog. Also included is an estimated $1 billion of Subsea services revenue, the majority of which does not get booked in our backlog. We have confidence in realizing these combined revenue streams, and together, they comprise approximately 70% of guidance at the midpoint of our range. We expect Subsea EBITDA margins next year to be at least 14%. This will be down from our 2017 guidance of at least 17%. 
Let me walk you through the primary drivers. Based on 2017 guidance, revenues are anticipated to decline approximately 16% if we assume the midpoint of our 2018 guidance. Lower revenue will negatively impact margins due to the effects of reduced activity across our fixed asset base. One example of this will be our fleet. We cited fleet utilization in the third quarter of 70%. This will be lower in 2018, although secured backlog for 2019 and beyond should benefit utilization looking further out. Beyond the revenue impact, near-term investment will be a headwind on margins. Our investment in new technologies should yield strategic, long-term benefits, and these costs will impact 2018. These investments are critically important and enable us to deliver the differentiation in our business model. Additionally, we are investing in our people. These costs relate to the retention of core competencies, both in engineering and project management that are critical to successful project delivery beyond the cycle trough. This is supported by our confidence in the inbound recovery of Subsea. 2018 will also be impacted by the more competitive market conditions of the current cycle trough. It is evident that the market has encountered more competitive pricing for large project tenders where open bidding takes place. These effects will have a greater impact on 2018 results as some of our older projects advance to completion and contribute less towards 2018 profitability. 
While we continue to participate in open tenders, we are also focused on bidding where we have a competitive advantage. These opportunities would include projects for either proprietary technology or an integrated approach can provide a differentiated offering that can deliver significant savings in both time and cost. Providing some offset to the expected margin headwinds will be the merger-related savings. We may also look to undertake further restructuring actions based on market conditions. While 2018 for Subsea will be down both in revenues and EBITDA, we remain confident that the order inflection should ultimately translate into higher revenues and margins in our Subsea segment in the coming years. 
Moving to Onshore/Offshore. We expect full year revenues to be in the range of $5.3 billion to $5.7 billion. While revenues are declining, our EBITDA margin guidance of at least 9.5% remains at higher levels, consistent with 2017. Our revenue expectation incorporates a lower contribution from Yamal LNG as the project moves towards completion in 2019. EBITDA margin reflects continued strong project execution. 
For our Surface Technologies segment, we expect full year revenues to be in the range of $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion with an EBITDA margin of at least 17.5%. Revenue guidance is based on the following expectations. First, we are using current North America rig count to support these assumptions, and volatility in this rig count may require changes to our full year assumptions. Next, that increased hydraulic fracturing intensity will lead to higher demand for pressure control equipment. Last, initiatives are in place to expand our integrated offering in North America. 
So in summary, we expect for the combined company that our strong operational performance, cost-reduction initiatives and actions we have taken with regard to cash distribution should demonstrate our focus on creating shareholder value.

And as I pointed out, it gives us a unique view into the marketplace. And in many cases, we're working on projects on an exclusive basis with our customers. So these, if you will, are not projects that are being pursued by our competition. The advantage of having worked together now for almost 3 years, initially in the alliance and joint venture and more importantly now as a single entity, TechnipFMC, allows us to take that work that we've been doing as it matures through the FEED stage, which typically takes 12 to 15 months and then into the FID stage, which typically takes 6 months. We now have this backlog of integrated FEED activity that has the opportunity to convert into integrated EPCI projects. So we're looking at both the visible open tenders and participating where we think we can create value for ourselves and for our customers, where the economical limit -- by setting economical limits. But on these integrated projects, we have that unique opportunity because of the early engagement to introduce new proprietary technologies, to deliver Subsea architecture that is unique and differentiated and to be in a situation where we can help our customers meet their economic hurdle rate while benefiting ourselves as well. So it's simply the majority of that FEED, the maturation of that FEED backlog that now gives us the unique ability to be able to convert an increasing number in 2018 to integrated EPCI projects. In that list of maturing projects, we see some projects that are larger in size than some of the awards we have received thus far, and hence, the comment in the prepared remarks."

We've talked about the expansion of the compact manifold family, and there's much more. And we're going to be highlighting that and showing that. This is real tangible evidence of the change that we're driving in the subsea industry. And we have a lot more to go, and we're going to share that vision with you and let you actually see the equipment and see the next generation of Offshore developments that we're going to be able to deliver now as an integrated company, TechnipFMC."

And a lot of pressure on big oil companies as Chevron, Oxy, Apache, Anadarko to mention a few to kind of dispose some Offshore assets and reinvest in Shale. Although I sense that the tide is turning a little bit. So I wonder whether you could -- just in summary, give us your view on how competitive the offshore markets have become as a result of the cost reductions that are happening because of drilling efficiencies, but also those that you are driving, and particularly sort of with respect to what you mentioned on technology and architecture that you can now facilitate in terms of both cost reductions and, of course, time to first oil. So could you just give us a high level of the extent that breakevens now have been lowered. You're sitting there with a whole bunch of studies that you're doing? But how competitive have this become relative to other investment alternatives?"

And I'll try to be brief, but it is a very important question. So we have been working diligently for the past 3 years to look at ways to put together a unique value proposition that could sustainably improve project economics. And as you point out, the acceleration of first oil is actually more important than the actual cost of the development. So the ability to be able to do both is what's really driving the improvement of project economics for our customers. So we've given examples of the past. We are taking a subsea architecture that typically took 36 months to deliver at the peak of the activity, and I'd say about 28 to 36 months on average. And we can now deliver in 15 months. Further to that, we're now working with customers where they're working towards our industry specifications and using our standards and using our new integrated delivery model that we can deliver on the seabed installed and commissioned in less than 12 months, almost becoming a short-cycle business. That is a major, major distinction from the way that Subsea has been viewed in the past. On top of that, some of the reservoirs offshore remains some of the most prolific reservoirs that we have. So you couple the prolific reservoirs with a much reduced delivery time and lower total cost by removing unnecessary capital investment in terms of interfaces, et cetera, that's used today by going to an integrated approach with early involvement, with new technology and with a single company that can deliver an integrated model installed on the seabed, it's really driving change. We've seen that. We've seen the success that we had in 2017, and we anticipate greater success in 2018. As you point out, the overall breakeven on these projects have come down significantly. You heard our customers talk about breakevens on these projects below $40 a barrel. We certainly believe that at $50 a barrel, we can remain competitive with other alternative investment choices. One last area that's really -- that's unique and that's really developing, we're seeing an emerging trend of independent operators backed by private equity money, moving into the development of these assets. So there's always -- the reservoirs will always be developed. They may be developed by different customers at different times in the cycle, but we're seeing very interesting trends develop. And we're at the forefront of that because of the unique offering of TechnipFMC."

Thank you for participating in our third quarter earnings call. 
I will give a brief overview of our operational results, provide an update on our capital allocation strategy and discuss market outlook. Maryann will then review our third quarter financial performance in more detail and provide an update to 2017 guidance. She will also introduce preliminary segment guidance for 2018 before opening the call for questions. 
Third quarter results demonstrated another solid operational performance across all segments. We continue to execute well on the backlog of our long-cycle businesses while capitalizing on market opportunities in our short-cycle businesses, particularly in North America. Total revenues for the quarter exceeded $4.1 billion, with an adjusted EBITDA of $536 million. Total company adjusted EBITDA margin was 12.9%. 
Looking at the individual segments. Subsea adjusted EBITDA margin was 17.6%, Onshore/Offshore was 10.6% and Surface Technologies was 20.1%. These results demonstrate strong margin performance across-the-board with continued operational momentum in several of our largest projects. 
With the Yamal LNG, we delivered all 142 modules to the project site and continued to progress well on the commissioning of Train 1. And with Prelude FLNG, the floating unit was successfully moored on August 24, with the Subsea hookup underway utilizing a complete TechnipFMC Subsea offering. Total company orders for the quarter were $2.5 billion, and we ended the quarter with $13.9 billion of backlog. As a reminder,  our backlog does not capture the reimbursable activity within our Onshore/Offshore business or the reoccurring revenue from Subsea services. Our balance sheet remains strong with net cash of $3.3 billion. 
We previously outlined the drivers of our capital allocation strategy, with investment for growth as the priority, followed by shareholder distributions, both cash dividends and share repurchases. 
With respect to capital growth, we recently announced an agreement to acquire Plexus' exploration-drilling products and services business, extending our Surface Technologies offering. We've also increased our investment in the development of next-generation subsea systems and integrated technologies. We are pleased to announce that our Board of Directors has authorized a quarterly dividend of $0.13 per share. And we recently implemented our share repurchase program, putting in motion our plan to repurchase up to $500 million of ordinary shares no later than the end of 2018. This combination of disciplined investment and an ongoing commitment to return cash to shareholders keeps proper focus on our capital base. It also ensures that we can offer competitive distribution while maintaining flexibility to manage the business for the long term.
Moving to the market outlook. In North America, unconventional resource development continues to lead short-cycle activity. The pace of improvement is likely to slow with our expectation of a more moderate rig count growth. We also anticipate reduced levels of hydraulic fracturing fleet reactivations, partially offset by higher levels of inspection, maintenance and repair work that is needed to support the larger install base. 
Our surface activity outside of North America has been resilient, and the pricing environment has stabilized. The Middle East, North Africa and the North Sea offer the best near-term activity outlook for our international surface business. And we are encouraged to see several longer-term projects moving forward in these regions. 
Moving to longer-cycle businesses. There is little debate over the long-term need for incremental natural gas supply. Natural gas continues to take an increasing share of the global energy demand, and the industry is finding ways to further reduce the total cost of delivery. LNG will continue to provide sizable project opportunities over the long term. In the near term, we see project activity coming from the downstream sector, where we are pursuing several refining and petrochemical projects with an aggregate inbound value of over $5 billion. We know these projects well. We are actively working as the FEED provider or served as the original contractor, which is a very important distinction. This upfront involvement gives us a much better understanding of the project and puts us in a stronger competitive position.  We're also pursuing new opportunities where we can compete on our technical strengths in both our Project Management Consultancy and Process Technology businesses. 
Turning to Subsea. FEED and tendering activity demonstrates that the Subsea recovery is underway. We continue to believe that most major projects can move forward at current oil prices, although we recognize the pace of recovery has been tempered more by near-term price uncertainty than project returns. We've updated our Subsea opportunity list and now show 18 large projects that could be sanctioned over the next 24 months. This project list represents approximately $14 billion of Subsea scope, a significant market opportunity set for us given the breadth of our product and service offering. 
For the remainder of 2017, we believe that it's still possible for 1 or 2 major projects to move forward. There's also the potential for one to be a direct integrated award. Regardless of timing at major project awards, though, we remain confident in a step-up in inbound order activity in 2017 versus the prior year. We also believe the continued momentum in project bid activity will lead to another year of order growth in 2018. 
While the Subsea project list does provide insight into the market's most visible projects, it does not reflect the entire set of opportunities that we are pursuing. We have a list of integrated opportunities that continues to expand, as evidenced by strong growth in integrated FEED activity. Last fall, we disclosed the award of 16 integrated FEED studies, or iFEED, since we first offered an integrated approach. This is compelling -- this was compelling evidence that the market was embracing this new approach to fuel development. Over the last 12 months, we have more than doubled the number of iFEED awards, increasing the set of near- and intermediate-term opportunities for integrated project awards. 
In the third quarter, we announced the conversion of Hurricane Lancaster into an integrated EPCI project, our fifth such award. This is a great example of how early customer engagement through an integrated FEED uniquely positions TechnipFMC to address challenged project economics leading to direct, integrated EPCI project awards. But more importantly, the integrated projects we have today were not sitting on the Subsea project list. These projects were not being actively pursued by the market. They came from this unique portfolio of integrated FEED studies, and they give us a growth platform that is proprietary to TechnipFMC.
Looking to 2018. We think the pace of integrated awards will accelerate. We believe these future integrated projects will be larger than those awarded thus far. They represent a diversified mix of operators, some of which will be repeat customers at the integrated model. And they expand the regional diversity of the integrated approach. In total, we see a greater proportion of our inbound orders coming from direct awards, driven by our alliance partners, our Subsea services business and integrated projects. 
In closing, we continue to execute well across the portfolio, with third quarter results particularly strong in our Onshore/Offshore and Surface Technologies segments. We benefited from continued operational momentum with several of our largest projects. Our North American Surface business benefited from the continued resurgence in land activity, supporting growth in the industry's install base and providing near-term investment opportunities for our integrated surface offering. 
And in Subsea, we remain confident in a step-up for full year inbound in 2017. With our quarterly results, we have also provided new guidance, both in terms of updates to 2017 as well as a preliminary look into 2018. For 2017, our updates capture the strength of the third quarter as well as the operational momentum we carry into year-end, particularly in the Onshore/Offshore segment. In total, the changes imply an increase in our full year estimate of total segment adjusted EBITDA. 
As we look into 2018, we are managing revenue declines against the strategic investments needed to maintain the core competencies of our organization, ensuring that we can sustain our operational performance through the recovery. We see significant opportunities ahead, and these will be driven by internal initiatives as well as market fundamentals. We will generate further integration savings and operational efficiencies. And we will continue to deliver real, differentiated and sustainable change through integrated business models that will generate benefits for our customers and for our company. I remain optimistic about the recovery of Subsea, and I am even more confident in the future of TechnipFMC than ever before. We are executing well as one global entity, and we are winning in areas where we can provide true differentiation. 
I will now turn the call over to Maryann."

We delivered solid operating results in the quarter. These were in line or above our expectations. Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.39 when excluding after-tax charges and credits of $0.13 per diluted share. Charges and credits in the quarter totaled $101 million on a pretax basis. Included were pretax charges of $10.9 million related to the impact of Hurricane Harvey. We have provided more detail for these items in the accompanying schedules to our release, but the majority relate to cost associated with our merger as well as restructuring cost and severance cost.
Total company adjusted EBITDA was $536 million in the quarter. Year-over-year adjusted EBITDA margins decreased 100 basis points to 12.9% despite revenue declines. This is the result of good project execution in our Onshore/Offshore and Subsea projects and the improving activity levels in Surface Americas. Doug has shared with you segment operational highlights. 
Let's take a look at the corporate items in the quarter. Reported corporate expense was $42 million. Included in the quarterly results is $19 million of net gains associated with foreign currency. When excluding charges and credits, the adjusted expense was $41 million. Net interest expense was $86 million. This includes $73 million of additional liability to joint venture partners. Our reported tax provision for the quarter was $112 million, resulting in a reported tax rate of 48.6%. However, our effective tax rate in the quarter was 30.3% when excluding the impact of certain discrete items. In the final week of the quarter, we began our share repurchase program. Since that time, we have repurchased approximately 730,000 shares at a total cost of $19.6 million as of yesterday's close of business. 
Looking ahead, we have made updates to our full year guidance for 2017. For Subsea, our 2017 guidance remains the same, with revenues of at least $6.1 billion and EBITDA margins of at least 17%, excluding charges and credits. For Onshore/Offshore, we are raising full year guidance for both revenue and adjusted EBITDA margin. Due to the improved performance expected in the second half of the year, we now anticipate revenue to be at least $7.7 billion and EBITDA margins to be at least 9.5%, excluding charges and credits. For Surface Technologies, we now expect full year revenue to be at least $1.3 billion. We are increasing adjusted EBITDA margin guidance by 350 basis points to be at least 16.5%, excluding charges and credit. These changes reflect our strong performance and higher expectations for North America. 
Outside of our operating segments, we have updated guidance for the following items. Net interest expense is expected to be approximately $15 million in the fourth quarter and does not assume any future liability increases to the joint venture partners. Tax rate is expected to be between 30% and 32% for the full year, excluding discrete items. Capital expenditures are now expected to be $250 million for the full year. And we now expect to spend approximately $75 million for merger and integration costs in the fourth quarter. 
Let me provide you an update on our merger integration synergies. We remain confident that we will achieve $200 million in run rate savings by the end of this year and a total of $400 million in run rate savings by the end of 2018. These actions will generate savings across the portfolio, as shown in recent disclosures we have made, highlighting the allocation of savings by reporting segment. The greatest impacts will be realized in our Subsea and Onshore/Offshore segments. The anticipated savings to be realized for 2018 are included in the preliminary segment guidance we provided in our earnings release. 
We believe it is important to provide a preliminary view to the market with the intention of furthering the understanding of inbound synergies, pricing and cost structure impact on our 2018 expected performance. 
While early to provide a total company view for 2018, we are still completing our planning and actions for next year. We have a good understanding of many of the key operational drivers of our business, and this is reflected in the current outlook for next year. 
For Subsea, we expect revenues to be in a range of $5 billion to $5.3 billion, with an EBITDA margin of at least 14%. For Onshore/Offshore, we expect revenues to be in a range of $5.3 billion to $5.7 billion, with an EBIT margin of at least 9.5%. For Surface Technologies, we expect revenues to be in a range of $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion, with an EBIT margin of at least 17.5%. Please note, the margin guidance excludes all charges and credits. We will provide updated and complete guidance for 2018 with the release of our fourth quarter earning. 
Turning to Subsea first. As Doug commented earlier, we remain confident that the Subsea recovery is underway and that 2018 should be another year of order growth. However, the inflection point for revenues will lag the order recovery. For 2018, we're guiding to Subsea revenue in a range of $5 billion to $5.3 billion. This forecast includes $2.6 billion of secured backlog. Also included is an estimated $1 billion of Subsea services revenue, the majority of which does not get booked in our backlog. We have confidence in realizing these combined revenue streams, and together, they comprise approximately 70% of guidance at the midpoint of our range. We expect Subsea EBITDA margins next year to be at least 14%. This will be down from our 2017 guidance of at least 17%. 
Let me walk you through the primary drivers. Based on 2017 guidance, revenues are anticipated to decline approximately 16% if we assume the midpoint of our 2018 guidance. Lower revenue will negatively impact margins due to the effects of reduced activity across our fixed asset base. One example of this will be our fleet. We cited fleet utilization in the third quarter of 70%. This will be lower in 2018, although secured backlog for 2019 and beyond should benefit utilization looking further out. Beyond the revenue impact, near-term investment will be a headwind on margins. Our investment in new technologies should yield strategic, long-term benefits, and these costs will impact 2018. These investments are critically important and enable us to deliver the differentiation in our business model. Additionally, we are investing in our people. These costs relate to the retention of core competencies, both in engineering and project management that are critical to successful project delivery beyond the cycle trough. This is supported by our confidence in the inbound recovery of Subsea. 2018 will also be impacted by the more competitive market conditions of the current cycle trough. It is evident that the market has encountered more competitive pricing for large project tenders where open bidding takes place. These effects will have a greater impact on 2018 results as some of our older projects advance to completion and contribute less towards 2018 profitability. 
While we continue to participate in open tenders, we are also focused on bidding where we have a competitive advantage. These opportunities would include projects for either proprietary technology or an integrated approach can provide a differentiated offering that can deliver significant savings in both time and cost. Providing some offset to the expected margin headwinds will be the merger-related savings. We may also look to undertake further restructuring actions based on market conditions. While 2018 for Subsea will be down both in revenues and EBITDA, we remain confident that the order inflection should ultimately translate into higher revenues and margins in our Subsea segment in the coming years. 
Moving to Onshore/Offshore. We expect full year revenues to be in the range of $5.3 billion to $5.7 billion. While revenues are declining, our EBITDA margin guidance of at least 9.5% remains at higher levels, consistent with 2017. Our revenue expectation incorporates a lower contribution from Yamal LNG as the project moves towards completion in 2019. EBITDA margin reflects continued strong project execution. 
For our Surface Technologies segment, we expect full year revenues to be in the range of $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion with an EBITDA margin of at least 17.5%. Revenue guidance is based on the following expectations. First, we are using current North America rig count to support these assumptions, and volatility in this rig count may require changes to our full year assumptions. Next, that increased hydraulic fracturing intensity will lead to higher demand for pressure control equipment. Last, initiatives are in place to expand our integrated offering in North America. 
So in summary, we expect for the combined company that our strong operational performance, cost-reduction initiatives and actions we have taken with regard to cash distribution should demonstrate our focus on creating shareholder value.

So these, if you will, are not projects that are being pursued by our competition. The advantage of having worked together now for almost 3 years, initially in the alliance and joint venture and more importantly now as a single entity, TechnipFMC, allows us to take that work that we've been doing as it matures through the FEED stage, which typically takes 12 to 15 months and then into the FID stage, which typically takes 6 months. We now have this backlog of integrated FEED activity that has the opportunity to convert into integrated EPCI projects. So we're looking at both the visible open tenders and participating where we think we can create value for ourselves and for our customers, where the economical limit -- by setting economical limits. But on these integrated projects, we have that unique opportunity because of the early engagement to introduce new proprietary technologies, to deliver Subsea architecture that is unique and differentiated and to be in a situation where we can help our customers meet their economic hurdle rate while benefiting ourselves as well. So it's simply the majority of that FEED, the maturation of that FEED backlog that now gives us the unique ability to be able to convert an increasing number in 2018 to integrated EPCI projects. In that list of maturing projects, we see some projects that are larger in size than some of the awards we have received thus far, and hence, the comment in the prepared remarks."

And a lot of pressure on big oil companies as Chevron, Oxy, Apache, Anadarko to mention a few to kind of dispose some Offshore assets and reinvest in Shale. Although I sense that the tide is turning a little bit. So I wonder whether you could -- just in summary, give us your view on how competitive the offshore markets have become as a result of the cost reductions that are happening because of drilling efficiencies, but also those that you are driving, and particularly sort of with respect to what you mentioned on technology and architecture that you can now facilitate in terms of both cost reductions and, of course, time to first oil. So could you just give us a high level of the extent that breakevens now have been lowered. You're sitting there with a whole bunch of studies that you're doing? But how competitive have this become relative to other investment alternatives?"

And I'll try to be brief, but it is a very important question. So we have been working diligently for the past 3 years to look at ways to put together a unique value proposition that could sustainably improve project economics. And as you point out, the acceleration of first oil is actually more important than the actual cost of the development. So the ability to be able to do both is what's really driving the improvement of project economics for our customers. So we've given examples of the past. We are taking a subsea architecture that typically took 36 months to deliver at the peak of the activity, and I'd say about 28 to 36 months on average. And we can now deliver in 15 months. Further to that, we're now working with customers where they're working towards our industry specifications and using our standards and using our new integrated delivery model that we can deliver on the seabed installed and commissioned in less than 12 months, almost becoming a short-cycle business. That is a major, major distinction from the way that Subsea has been viewed in the past. On top of that, some of the reservoirs offshore remains some of the most prolific reservoirs that we have. So you couple the prolific reservoirs with a much reduced delivery time and lower total cost by removing unnecessary capital investment in terms of interfaces, et cetera, that's used today by going to an integrated approach with early involvement, with new technology and with a single company that can deliver an integrated model installed on the seabed, it's really driving change. We've seen that. We've seen the success that we had in 2017, and we anticipate greater success in 2018. As you point out, the overall breakeven on these projects have come down significantly. You heard our customers talk about breakevens on these projects below $40 a barrel. We certainly believe that at $50 a barrel, we can remain competitive with other alternative investment choices. One last area that's really -- that's unique and that's really developing, we're seeing an emerging trend of independent operators backed by private equity money, moving into the development of these assets. So there's always -- the reservoirs will always be developed. They may be developed by different customers at different times in the cycle, but we're seeing very interesting trends develop. And we're at the forefront of that because of the unique offering of TechnipFMC."

Thank you for participating in our third quarter earnings call. 
I will give a brief overview of our operational results, provide an update on our capital allocation strategy and discuss market outlook. Maryann will then review our third quarter financial performance in more detail and provide an update to 2017 guidance. She will also introduce preliminary segment guidance for 2018 before opening the call for questions. 
Third quarter results demonstrated another solid operational performance across all segments. We continue to execute well on the backlog of our long-cycle businesses while capitalizing on market opportunities in our short-cycle businesses, particularly in North America. Total revenues for the quarter exceeded $4.1 billion, with an adjusted EBITDA of $536 million. Total company adjusted EBITDA margin was 12.9%. 
Looking at the individual segments. Subsea adjusted EBITDA margin was 17.6%, Onshore/Offshore was 10.6% and Surface Technologies was 20.1%. These results demonstrate strong margin performance across-the-board with continued operational momentum in several of our largest projects. 
With the Yamal LNG, we delivered all 142 modules to the project site and continued to progress well on the commissioning of Train 1. And with Prelude FLNG, the floating unit was successfully moored on August 24, with the Subsea hookup underway utilizing a complete TechnipFMC Subsea offering. Total company orders for the quarter were $2.5 billion, and we ended the quarter with $13.9 billion of backlog. As a reminder,  our backlog does not capture the reimbursable activity within our Onshore/Offshore business or the reoccurring revenue from Subsea services. Our balance sheet remains strong with net cash of $3.3 billion. 
We previously outlined the drivers of our capital allocation strategy, with investment for growth as the priority, followed by shareholder distributions, both cash dividends and share repurchases. 
With respect to capital growth, we recently announced an agreement to acquire Plexus' exploration-drilling products and services business, extending our Surface Technologies offering. We've also increased our investment in the development of next-generation subsea systems and integrated technologies. We are pleased to announce that our Board of Directors has authorized a quarterly dividend of $0.13 per share. And we recently implemented our share repurchase program, putting in motion our plan to repurchase up to $500 million of ordinary shares no later than the end of 2018. This combination of disciplined investment and an ongoing commitment to return cash to shareholders keeps proper focus on our capital base. It also ensures that we can offer competitive distribution while maintaining flexibility to manage the business for the long term.
Moving to the market outlook. In North America, unconventional resource development continues to lead short-cycle activity. The pace of improvement is likely to slow with our expectation of a more moderate rig count growth. We also anticipate reduced levels of hydraulic fracturing fleet reactivations, partially offset by higher levels of inspection, maintenance and repair work that is needed to support the larger install base. 
Our surface activity outside of North America has been resilient, and the pricing environment has stabilized. The Middle East, North Africa and the North Sea offer the best near-term activity outlook for our international surface business. And we are encouraged to see several longer-term projects moving forward in these regions. 
Moving to longer-cycle businesses. There is little debate over the long-term need for incremental natural gas supply. Natural gas continues to take an increasing share of the global energy demand, and the industry is finding ways to further reduce the total cost of delivery. LNG will continue to provide sizable project opportunities over the long term. In the near term, we see project activity coming from the downstream sector, where we are pursuing several refining and petrochemical projects with an aggregate inbound value of over $5 billion. We know these projects well. We are actively working as the FEED provider or served as the original contractor, which is a very important distinction. This upfront involvement gives us a much better understanding of the project and puts us in a stronger competitive position.  We're also pursuing new opportunities where we can compete on our technical strengths in both our Project Management Consultancy and Process Technology businesses. 
Turning to Subsea. FEED and tendering activity demonstrates that the Subsea recovery is underway. We continue to believe that most major projects can move forward at current oil prices, although we recognize the pace of recovery has been tempered more by near-term price uncertainty than project returns. We've updated our Subsea opportunity list and now show 18 large projects that could be sanctioned over the next 24 months. This project list represents approximately $14 billion of Subsea scope, a significant market opportunity set for us given the breadth of our product and service offering. 
For the remainder of 2017, we believe that it's still possible for 1 or 2 major projects to move forward. There's also the potential for one to be a direct integrated award. Regardless of timing at major project awards, though, we remain confident in a step-up in inbound order activity in 2017 versus the prior year. We also believe the continued momentum in project bid activity will lead to another year of order growth in 2018. 
While the Subsea project list does provide insight into the market's most visible projects, it does not reflect the entire set of opportunities that we are pursuing. We have a list of integrated opportunities that continues to expand, as evidenced by strong growth in integrated FEED activity. Last fall, we disclosed the award of 16 integrated FEED studies, or iFEED, since we first offered an integrated approach. This is compelling -- this was compelling evidence that the market was embracing this new approach to fuel development. Over the last 12 months, we have more than doubled the number of iFEED awards, increasing the set of near- and intermediate-term opportunities for integrated project awards. 
In the third quarter, we announced the conversion of Hurricane Lancaster into an integrated EPCI project, our fifth such award. This is a great example of how early customer engagement through an integrated FEED uniquely positions TechnipFMC to address challenged project economics leading to direct, integrated EPCI project awards. But more importantly, the integrated projects we have today were not sitting on the Subsea project list. These projects were not being actively pursued by the market. They came from this unique portfolio of integrated FEED studies, and they give us a growth platform that is proprietary to TechnipFMC.
Looking to 2018. We think the pace of integrated awards will accelerate. We believe these future integrated projects will be larger than those awarded thus far. They represent a diversified mix of operators, some of which will be repeat customers at the integrated model. And they expand the regional diversity of the integrated approach. In total, we see a greater proportion of our inbound orders coming from direct awards, driven by our alliance partners, our Subsea services business and integrated projects. 
In closing, we continue to execute well across the portfolio, with third quarter results particularly strong in our Onshore/Offshore and Surface Technologies segments. We benefited from continued operational momentum with several of our largest projects. Our North American Surface business benefited from the continued resurgence in land activity, supporting growth in the industry's install base and providing near-term investment opportunities for our integrated surface offering. 
And in Subsea, we remain confident in a step-up for full year inbound in 2017. With our quarterly results, we have also provided new guidance, both in terms of updates to 2017 as well as a preliminary look into 2018. For 2017, our updates capture the strength of the third quarter as well as the operational momentum we carry into year-end, particularly in the Onshore/Offshore segment. In total, the changes imply an increase in our full year estimate of total segment adjusted EBITDA. 
As we look into 2018, we are managing revenue declines against the strategic investments needed to maintain the core competencies of our organization, ensuring that we can sustain our operational performance through the recovery. We see significant opportunities ahead, and these will be driven by internal initiatives as well as market fundamentals. We will generate further integration savings and operational efficiencies. And we will continue to deliver real, differentiated and sustainable change through integrated business models that will generate benefits for our customers and for our company. I remain optimistic about the recovery of Subsea, and I am even more confident in the future of TechnipFMC than ever before. We are executing well as one global entity, and we are winning in areas where we can provide true differentiation. 
I will now turn the call over to Maryann."

We delivered solid operating results in the quarter. These were in line or above our expectations. Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.39 when excluding after-tax charges and credits of $0.13 per diluted share. Charges and credits in the quarter totaled $101 million on a pretax basis. Included were pretax charges of $10.9 million related to the impact of Hurricane Harvey. We have provided more detail for these items in the accompanying schedules to our release, but the majority relate to cost associated with our merger as well as restructuring cost and severance cost.
Total company adjusted EBITDA was $536 million in the quarter. Year-over-year adjusted EBITDA margins decreased 100 basis points to 12.9% despite revenue declines. This is the result of good project execution in our Onshore/Offshore and Subsea projects and the improving activity levels in Surface Americas. Doug has shared with you segment operational highlights. 
Let's take a look at the corporate items in the quarter. Reported corporate expense was $42 million. Included in the quarterly results is $19 million of net gains associated with foreign currency. When excluding charges and credits, the adjusted expense was $41 million. Net interest expense was $86 million. This includes $73 million of additional liability to joint venture partners. Our reported tax provision for the quarter was $112 million, resulting in a reported tax rate of 48.6%. However, our effective tax rate in the quarter was 30.3% when excluding the impact of certain discrete items. In the final week of the quarter, we began our share repurchase program. Since that time, we have repurchased approximately 730,000 shares at a total cost of $19.6 million as of yesterday's close of business. 
Looking ahead, we have made updates to our full year guidance for 2017. For Subsea, our 2017 guidance remains the same, with revenues of at least $6.1 billion and EBITDA margins of at least 17%, excluding charges and credits. For Onshore/Offshore, we are raising full year guidance for both revenue and adjusted EBITDA margin. Due to the improved performance expected in the second half of the year, we now anticipate revenue to be at least $7.7 billion and EBITDA margins to be at least 9.5%, excluding charges and credits. For Surface Technologies, we now expect full year revenue to be at least $1.3 billion. We are increasing adjusted EBITDA margin guidance by 350 basis points to be at least 16.5%, excluding charges and credit. These changes reflect our strong performance and higher expectations for North America. 
Outside of our operating segments, we have updated guidance for the following items. Net interest expense is expected to be approximately $15 million in the fourth quarter and does not assume any future liability increases to the joint venture partners. Tax rate is expected to be between 30% and 32% for the full year, excluding discrete items. Capital expenditures are now expected to be $250 million for the full year. And we now expect to spend approximately $75 million for merger and integration costs in the fourth quarter. 
Let me provide you an update on our merger integration synergies. We remain confident that we will achieve $200 million in run rate savings by the end of this year and a total of $400 million in run rate savings by the end of 2018. These actions will generate savings across the portfolio, as shown in recent disclosures we have made, highlighting the allocation of savings by reporting segment. The greatest impacts will be realized in our Subsea and Onshore/Offshore segments. The anticipated savings to be realized for 2018 are included in the preliminary segment guidance we provided in our earnings release. 
We believe it is important to provide a preliminary view to the market with the intention of furthering the understanding of inbound synergies, pricing and cost structure impact on our 2018 expected performance. 
While early to provide a total company view for 2018, we are still completing our planning and actions for next year. We have a good understanding of many of the key operational drivers of our business, and this is reflected in the current outlook for next year. 
For Subsea, we expect revenues to be in a range of $5 billion to $5.3 billion, with an EBITDA margin of at least 14%. For Onshore/Offshore, we expect revenues to be in a range of $5.3 billion to $5.7 billion, with an EBIT margin of at least 9.5%. For Surface Technologies, we expect revenues to be in a range of $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion, with an EBIT margin of at least 17.5%. Please note, the margin guidance excludes all charges and credits. We will provide updated and complete guidance for 2018 with the release of our fourth quarter earning. 
Turning to Subsea first. As Doug commented earlier, we remain confident that the Subsea recovery is underway and that 2018 should be another year of order growth. However, the inflection point for revenues will lag the order recovery. For 2018, we're guiding to Subsea revenue in a range of $5 billion to $5.3 billion. This forecast includes $2.6 billion of secured backlog. Also included is an estimated $1 billion of Subsea services revenue, the majority of which does not get booked in our backlog. We have confidence in realizing these combined revenue streams, and together, they comprise approximately 70% of guidance at the midpoint of our range. We expect Subsea EBITDA margins next year to be at least 14%. This will be down from our 2017 guidance of at least 17%. 
Let me walk you through the primary drivers. Based on 2017 guidance, revenues are anticipated to decline approximately 16% if we assume the midpoint of our 2018 guidance. Lower revenue will negatively impact margins due to the effects of reduced activity across our fixed asset base. One example of this will be our fleet. We cited fleet utilization in the third quarter of 70%. This will be lower in 2018, although secured backlog for 2019 and beyond should benefit utilization looking further out. Beyond the revenue impact, near-term investment will be a headwind on margins. Our investment in new technologies should yield strategic, long-term benefits, and these costs will impact 2018. These investments are critically important and enable us to deliver the differentiation in our business model. Additionally, we are investing in our people. These costs relate to the retention of core competencies, both in engineering and project management that are critical to successful project delivery beyond the cycle trough. This is supported by our confidence in the inbound recovery of Subsea. 2018 will also be impacted by the more competitive market conditions of the current cycle trough. It is evident that the market has encountered more competitive pricing for large project tenders where open bidding takes place. These effects will have a greater impact on 2018 results as some of our older projects advance to completion and contribute less towards 2018 profitability. 
While we continue to participate in open tenders, we are also focused on bidding where we have a competitive advantage. These opportunities would include projects for either proprietary technology or an integrated approach can provide a differentiated offering that can deliver significant savings in both time and cost. Providing some offset to the expected margin headwinds will be the merger-related savings. We may also look to undertake further restructuring actions based on market conditions. While 2018 for Subsea will be down both in revenues and EBITDA, we remain confident that the order inflection should ultimately translate into higher revenues and margins in our Subsea segment in the coming years. 
Moving to Onshore/Offshore. We expect full year revenues to be in the range of $5.3 billion to $5.7 billion. While revenues are declining, our EBITDA margin guidance of at least 9.5% remains at higher levels, consistent with 2017. Our revenue expectation incorporates a lower contribution from Yamal LNG as the project moves towards completion in 2019. EBITDA margin reflects continued strong project execution. 
For our Surface Technologies segment, we expect full year revenues to be in the range of $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion with an EBITDA margin of at least 17.5%. Revenue guidance is based on the following expectations. First, we are using current North America rig count to support these assumptions, and volatility in this rig count may require changes to our full year assumptions. Next, that increased hydraulic fracturing intensity will lead to higher demand for pressure control equipment. Last, initiatives are in place to expand our integrated offering in North America. 
So in summary, we expect for the combined company that our strong operational performance, cost-reduction initiatives and actions we have taken with regard to cash distribution should demonstrate our focus on creating shareholder value.

And as I pointed out, it gives us a unique view into the marketplace. And in many cases, we're working on projects on an exclusive basis with our customers. So these, if you will, are not projects that are being pursued by our competition. The advantage of having worked together now for almost 3 years, initially in the alliance and joint venture and more importantly now as a single entity, TechnipFMC, allows us to take that work that we've been doing as it matures through the FEED stage, which typically takes 12 to 15 months and then into the FID stage, which typically takes 6 months. We now have this backlog of integrated FEED activity that has the opportunity to convert into integrated EPCI projects. So we're looking at both the visible open tenders and participating where we think we can create value for ourselves and for our customers, where the economical limit -- by setting economical limits. But on these integrated projects, we have that unique opportunity because of the early engagement to introduce new proprietary technologies, to deliver Subsea architecture that is unique and differentiated and to be in a situation where we can help our customers meet their economic hurdle rate while benefiting ourselves as well. So it's simply the majority of that FEED, the maturation of that FEED backlog that now gives us the unique ability to be able to convert an increasing number in 2018 to integrated EPCI projects. In that list of maturing projects, we see some projects that are larger in size than some of the awards we have received thus far, and hence, the comment in the prepared remarks."

So I'm quite pleased with the fact that in a very challenging market, so the backdrop or the environment being extremely challenging, coupled by the fact that we're going through a merger and bringing together 2 industry leaders into a new, unique company that is truly differentiated within the industry, that can create distractions.

And if I didn't, you can feel free to correct me. And in that context, I guess I would be under the impression then that you wouldn't be subject to the same elements of open bid competitive pricing power, which then I think could set you up for potentially even better margins than that 14% dynamic that you provided for '18.

And a lot of pressure on big oil companies as Chevron, Oxy, Apache, Anadarko to mention a few to kind of dispose some Offshore assets and reinvest in Shale. Although I sense that the tide is turning a little bit. So I wonder whether you could -- just in summary, give us your view on how competitive the offshore markets have become as a result of the cost reductions that are happening because of drilling efficiencies, but also those that you are driving, and particularly sort of with respect to what you mentioned on technology and architecture that you can now facilitate in terms of both cost reductions and, of course, time to first oil. So could you just give us a high level of the extent that breakevens now have been lowered. You're sitting there with a whole bunch of studies that you're doing? But how competitive have this become relative to other investment alternatives?"

And I'll try to be brief, but it is a very important question. So we have been working diligently for the past 3 years to look at ways to put together a unique value proposition that could sustainably improve project economics. And as you point out, the acceleration of first oil is actually more important than the actual cost of the development. So the ability to be able to do both is what's really driving the improvement of project economics for our customers. So we've given examples of the past. We are taking a subsea architecture that typically took 36 months to deliver at the peak of the activity, and I'd say about 28 to 36 months on average. And we can now deliver in 15 months. Further to that, we're now working with customers where they're working towards our industry specifications and using our standards and using our new integrated delivery model that we can deliver on the seabed installed and commissioned in less than 12 months, almost becoming a short-cycle business. That is a major, major distinction from the way that Subsea has been viewed in the past. On top of that, some of the reservoirs offshore remains some of the most prolific reservoirs that we have. So you couple the prolific reservoirs with a much reduced delivery time and lower total cost by removing unnecessary capital investment in terms of interfaces, et cetera, that's used today by going to an integrated approach with early involvement, with new technology and with a single company that can deliver an integrated model installed on the seabed, it's really driving change. We've seen that. We've seen the success that we had in 2017, and we anticipate greater success in 2018. As you point out, the overall breakeven on these projects have come down significantly. You heard our customers talk about breakevens on these projects below $40 a barrel. We certainly believe that at $50 a barrel, we can remain competitive with other alternative investment choices. One last area that's really -- that's unique and that's really developing, we're seeing an emerging trend of independent operators backed by private equity money, moving into the development of these assets. So there's always -- the reservoirs will always be developed. They may be developed by different customers at different times in the cycle, but we're seeing very interesting trends develop. And we're at the forefront of that because of the unique offering of TechnipFMC."

Because again -- has Chevron, Oxy, Apache, Anadarko, we talked to all of them, and these have been -- we're going to de-emphasize so offshore. Saw what happened with Hess, right? I mean, they sold Norwegian assets to Aker BP has fell. Aker BP rose 10%, so this is clearly a diversion here in views. And I think your last point was very interesting because strikes me as we need a new set of hands or new set of ownership for a lot of this -- a lot of these assets that the incumbents seemed very reluctant to do anything within in this kind of chase for this holy grail called shale. But so could you elaborate a little bit on that very last point you made because I think that's quite important in terms of who are the new customers that you're talking to?"

So I want to be careful. I mean, as we've announced major awards this year from the likes of  Eni, with the likes of ExxonMobil and others and Shell, there's going to continue to be the development. It is meaningful part of their portfolio, the project economics and the project and schedule certainty is what was driving the overruns and driving the returns on those projects down. We are now showing in our integrated model that we can really improve not only the schedule but the certainty in the economics behind the project. But there is a transition happening. And it's happened in other parts of our industry, including onshore in the past. And we talked today about the finalization of the Hurricane Lancaster project as an example of that. We will have several more examples like that, that we anticipate inbounding and being able to announce in 2018, as we expand our customer base with the evolution of the Deepwater and the Subsea market."
