On October 14, 2016, we announced the 3-for-1 stock split of the company's common stock to be effective in the form of a 200% stock dividend. The common stock dividend was issued on November 9, 2016, and the company's common stock began trading as the split -- at a split-adjusted price on November 10, 2016. Accordingly, all per share amounts, common stock outstanding and common stock repurchase presented on this call have been adjusted retroactively where applicable to reflect the stock split.
Sales in the beverage industry in the fourth quarter continued to be soft globally. In the fourth quarter, net sales were $753.8 million, up 16.8% from $645.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. The company achieved record gross sales of $848.8 million, up 14.2% from $743.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2015.
The comparative net and gross sales of $645.4 million and $743.2 million, respectively, for the 2015 fourth quarter were impacted by advance purchases made by the company's customers due to a preannounced price increase effective August 31, 2015, on certain of the company's Monster Energy brand energy drinks. The company estimates that both net and gross sales for the 2015 fourth quarter were reduced by approximately $11 million and $12 million, respectively, as a result of such advance purchases.
Net and gross sales for the 2016 fourth quarter, after adjusting the 2015 fourth quarter comparatives for advance purchases, increased by 14.8% and 12.4%, respectively. Unfavorable currency exchange rates reduced net sales by approximately $3.3 million and gross sales by approximately $5.9 million in the 2016 fourth quarter.
Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the fourth quarter was 66.1% as compared to 62.5% for the comparable 2015 fourth quarter. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to cost of goods savings as the result of AFF transaction and product mix as well as reduced promotional allowances as a percentage of sales in the fourth quarter.
We estimate the lower promotional allowances as a percentage of sales as compared to prior periods, together with the reduction of Java Monster sales, had the effect of increasing gross profit percentage by approximately 2% in the fourth quarter. Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 3.2% compared to 2016 and 2015 fourth quarters. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 12% compared to 12.9% in the same quarter a year ago, thus the [ph] increase in absolute dollars.  The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to increased sponsorship and endorsement costs and premium.
General and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were 17.5% as compared to 11% in the same quarter last year. General and administrative costs, excluding distributed termination expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 11.4% in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to 10.5% for the 2015 fourth quarter.
Payroll expenses were up $12.3 million, primarily to support the strategic brand that we have acquired from Coca-Cola. And stock-based compensation, which is a noncash item, was $3.1 million higher. Distributor termination expenses were $46.3 million in the fourth quarter as compared to $3.3 million in the 2015 fourth quarter. Regulatory matters and litigation concerning the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, use, safety and sale of the company's products were $5.1 million in the 2016 fourth quarter as compared to $6 million in the 2015 fourth quarter.
Our effective tax rate in the quarter decreased from 39.5% in the 2015 fourth quarter to 29.9% in the 2016 fourth quarter, primarily due to an increase in the domestic production deduction as well as an increase in the stock compensation deduction as a result of the adoption of new accounting guidance effective January 1, 2016, under which excess tax benefits are recorded in net income. Net income was $172.9 million in the 2016 fourth quarter compared to net income of $138.7 million in the 2015 fourth quarter, an increase of 24.7%.
The weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding decreased from 617.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2015 to 580.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2016 as a result of share buybacks, including the modified Dutch tender auction, which was completed in June 2016. Net income was impacted by the substantial increased in distributor termination expenses previously mentioned above.
Earlier diluted -- sorry, diluted earnings per share for the 2016 fourth quarter increased 32.6% to $0.30 from $0.22 in the fourth quarter of 2015. We estimate that distributor termination expenses in the 2016 fourth quarter of $46.3 million negatively affected diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.05 per share after tax. Distributor termination expenses for the 2015 fourth quarter had no effect on diluted earnings per share after tax. We refer you to the press release for the specific factors affecting profitability for the 2016 and 2015 fourth quarters, respectively.
Turning to the full year results. The company achieved record gross sales of $3.5 billion for the full year, up 12.2% from $3.1 billion in 2015. Net sales were up 12% from $2.7 billion to $3 billion. Gross and net sales for the year were adversely affected by unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates totaling $31 million and $22.3 million, respectively, for the year.
Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to 63.7% for the year ended December 31, 2016, from 60% for the year ended December 31, 2015. Operating income was up 21.4% to $1.1 billion from $893.7 million in 2015. Our effective tax rate decreased to 34% in 2016 from 38.7% in 2015.
Net income was $712.7 million, up 30.4% over net income of $546.7 million in 2015, and diluted earnings per share increased 25.6% to $1.19 from $0.95 in 2015. We refer you to the press release for the specific factors impacting profitability for the 2016 and 2015 financial years, respectively.
We have made good progress in the implementation of our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola bottlers globally. Domestically, we transitioned distribution of Monster Energy drinks in Wisconsin to Coca-Cola bottlers early in January 2017 and are making good progress in the United States in non-traditional channels, including food service accounts.
In EMEA, in the fourth quarter of 2016, we commenced distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in Bahrain, Mauritius, Qatar and United Arab Emirates.

In China, in the fourth quarter of 2016, we commenced distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in selected markets that include Shanghai, Hunan Province, Shenzhen, Guangzhou, Zhanjiang and Hainan. We also commenced distribution in the Maldives [ph] in the fourth quarter of 2016. We have received approval for our products in India and are planning to relaunch Monster in India later this year.
As previously reported, we successfully completed our acquisition of the concentrated flavor business operated by American Fruits & Flavors on April 1, 2016. As a result of the AFF Transaction, we achieved raw material cost savings of $22 million in the 2016 fourth quarter, which were broadly in line with the expectations.

Sales of Red Bull increased by 0.7 of a percent [ph] . Rockstar was down 4.5%. 5-Hour was down 8.5%, and AMP was down 25.5%.
We point out that the energy shot category has been declining for some time, and if we exclude the energy shot category, energy plus coffee and protein drinks, where we have experienced production capacity shortages, for the 4 weeks ended February 18, 2017, sales in the convenience and gas channels in dollars, in fact, increased 1.4% over the same period last year. And on this basis, sales of Monster increased by 1.6%.

Red Bull sales decreased 8.9%, and its market share decreased about 4.1 points to 11.4%. Market share increased 9.6 points to 37.8% while Juice market share decreased 4.8 points to 13.6%. The transition to the Coca-Cola Bottlers system in August 2016, while initially slow, has since improved and we are now seeing wider availability of Monster in the traditional trade channel in Mexico. According to Nielsen, Monster's numerical distribution in the traditional trade channel grew from 10% in January 2016 to 24% in January 2017. The Nielsen statistics for Mexico covers which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the convenience chain dominant market. Sales in the convenience chain may in turn to be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by 1 or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico.

Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $377.6 million compared to $2.18 billion at December 31, 2015. Short-term investments were $320.6 million compared to $744.6 million at December 31, 2015. Long-term investments decreased to $2.4 million from $15.3 million at December 31, 2015.
Accounts receivable increased to $448.1 million at December 31, 2016, from $353 million at December 31, 2015.
Days outstanding for accounts receivables were 48.2 days compared 43.2 days at December 31, 2015.
Inventories increased to $162 million from $156.1 million at December 31, 2015.
Average days of inventory was 57 days at December 31, 2016, compared to 58 days at December 31, 2015.
In September 2016, we launched [indiscernible] an convenience stores in certain U.S. market. With encouraging sales to the point of distribution. For the 13 weeks ended January 31, 2017, for Nielsen total U.S. convenience, usage has the highest dollars share than in any single-serve sparkling softdrink brand. The single-serve packages sold in convenience stores [indiscernible] the same dollars, Mutant outsold a number of well-established single-serve brands such as 7UP. We remain confident about the potential of this band. We are planning the launch of our new Hydro line which is a noncarbonated energy drink. This package in a unique 16.9-ounce PET can, the size of which is exclusive to us in the U.S. at this time.
We are planning to launch to the retail space towards the end of March, early April.
Monster Energy Ultra Violet was launched exclusively with [indiscernible] club and will be expanded to all channels at the end of March 2017. We are also planning to launch Full Throttle Orange at the end of March. We have now robust innovation pipeline and further launches of plan for the remainder of 2017.
We estimate January 2017 gross sales to be approximately 10.4% higher than in January 2016. On a foreign exchange adjusted basis, we estimate January 2017 gross sales to be approximately 11.6% higher than in January 2016. In this regard, we caution again that sales over the short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor centers as well as shifts in the timing of production, in some some instances where a bottler is responsible for production and use to determine if production schedules which affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers. We reiterate that sales average for the period such as a single month would not necessarily be due [indiscernible] 2 or more indicative results for the full quarter or in any future periods. With regard to the litigation within the company for San Francisco City Attorney, we're advised that the action was settled in January 2017 on terms acceptable to the company. The settlement does not include any penalty under California's unfair competition law. Any finding or admission of liability or wrongdoing or any change in the formula -- to the formulation of Monster Energy drinks or to whom the drinks may be sold. In consideration of the release of claims and dismissal of the action with prejudice, the company agreed to maintain various current marketing and labor practices towards energy drink products through December 31, 2018. On February 28, 2017, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a new repurchase program for the repurchase of up to $500 million of the company's outstanding common stock. No availability remained under the previously authorized share repurchase program.
In conclusion, I'd like to summarize the recent positive points. One, as previously reported, our acquisition of AFF represents an important milestone for the company and gives us ownership about the formulas for our transport products. We recognized the reduction in operating cost of $22 million in the fourth quarter as the result of the acquisition.
Two, North American and international gross margins remain healthy. Three, while the U.S. Nielsen market statistics show that the energy category slowed in the U.S. towards the end of the fourth quarter, equivalent given first quarter equivalent market statistics for many countries around the world show that the energy category is continuing to grow and that Monster is generally growing ahead of the category. Currency exchange rates continue to affect our results. The new additions to the Monster family continue to gain momentum and add to the company sales.
We're excited about the prospects for our new product launches. We are pleased with our performance in our international markets and reiterate the growth potential for us in China, one of the largest energy end markets globally. We have successfully transitioned additional transition companies to Coca-Cola bottlers in the fourth quarter and we will be transitioning a number of our own markets to Coca-Cola bottlers in 2017.
I'd like to open the floor for the question for the quarter and the year."

We positioned Mutant in selected channels at full pricing. We've not been aggressive in our promotion. If you look at average pricing in Nielsen, Mutant's average pricing in all the different periods, depending which period you look at, is still about 1 96. If you compare that to, that's quite substantial premium to the other some drinks and main competitive that we're looking at competing which is Mountain Dew. And so we had strategically not promoted Mutant during the winter period. We are taking steps to deal with the expanded distribution. We will obviously increase our promotional and other activities around the brand as we continue to go into spring and summer. So when we look at the numbers and we look at this sales at this point, we think the sales per point our pretty good in relation to a lot of the other well-established brands in the area. If you look at the last 4 weeks that has dropped off a little bit, again, because we believe the lack of promotional spend and behind the brand, but that was intentional in this period of time. It is soda and we are looking at to expand distribution, expand the channels and also become substantially more active in the promotion as we start going into spring now. So we are still positive about the brand and the prospects and sellthrough particularly where we haven't seen at the substantial cross premium, we have seen substantial sales per point that are higher than a lot of very well-established brands that had been around for a long time."

We also have a group of 10 bottlers, Aruba is different to Chile. Chile, there were 2 main bottlers that really we started  -- we really have pretty good momentum for the brand, it was well-established, it didn't have the addition but where it was, it was really selling into the high teens and pretty nicely. So when 2 Coke bottlers in Chile they really did embrace the band and obviously, we were able to sort of more structured market, we're able to expand the market and roll it out probably more quickly and more, I think, efficiently than is the case in Brazil. And so the results have been very good and we've been very encouraged by the result. In the case of the Brazilian market, it is a much more nontraditional market. You have literally well over 1 million of these little traditional stores all over the place and they are harder to get to, harder to service, to go, variably, there is very, very large input of wholesaler system that helps get to these stores. And it just you're just not comparing apples and apples. So we got to manage the proof of bottlers in a very different environment, country and also that is going through tough financial conditions at the moment. But that being said, we think that it will take some time, as it has in many of the quote markets where we do deal with these many big bottlers are basically clips of bottlers, it takes time for them to get coordinated and that their system going. But when it doesn't start going, it does really work, it does improve. And so we are very encouraged by what we've seen. We're at a point now where we are selling at our rate which is higher than we ever sold even with our previous distributive at the peak before we announced the Coke transaction, they tended to lose interests in the brand and stop putting the effort guide because they also had the good distributor. And so we're encouraged by we're we are going. It will take time to hold up. The good news is is there is a big energy market. We do quite nicely in Germany and really the larger player here in Red Bull, that is really our main competitor and we are at a sort of similar price point which for us means gives us a lot of opportunity to grow into that market against the Red Bull shape which is at a premium price and it's not that's how they do have low and brand but at least we know they have good business going after this. But it is going to take time to develop."

On October 14, 2016, we announced the 3-for-1 stock split of the company's common stock to be effective in the form of a 200% stock dividend. The common stock dividend was issued on November 9, 2016, and the company's common stock began trading as the split -- at a split-adjusted price on November 10, 2016. Accordingly, all per share amounts, common stock outstanding and common stock repurchase presented on this call have been adjusted retroactively where applicable to reflect the stock split.
Sales in the beverage industry in the fourth quarter continued to be soft globally. In the fourth quarter, net sales were $753.8 million, up 16.8% from $645.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. The company achieved record gross sales of $848.8 million, up 14.2% from $743.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2015.
The comparative net and gross sales of $645.4 million and $743.2 million, respectively, for the 2015 fourth quarter were impacted by advance purchases made by the company's customers due to a preannounced price increase effective August 31, 2015, on certain of the company's Monster Energy brand energy drinks. The company estimates that both net and gross sales for the 2015 fourth quarter were reduced by approximately $11 million and $12 million, respectively, as a result of such advance purchases.
Net and gross sales for the 2016 fourth quarter, after adjusting the 2015 fourth quarter comparatives for advance purchases, increased by 14.8% and 12.4%, respectively. Unfavorable currency exchange rates reduced net sales by approximately $3.3 million and gross sales by approximately $5.9 million in the 2016 fourth quarter.
Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the fourth quarter was 66.1% as compared to 62.5% for the comparable 2015 fourth quarter. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to cost of goods savings as the result of AFF Transaction and product mix as well as reduced promotional allowances as a percentage of sales in the fourth quarter.
We estimate the lower promotional allowances as a percentage of sales as compared to prior periods, together with the reduction of Java Monster sales, had the effect of increasing gross profit percentage by approximately 2% in the fourth quarter. Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 3.2% compared to 2016 and 2015 fourth quarters. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 12% compared to 12.9% in the same quarter a year ago, but they increased in absolute dollars.  The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to increased sponsorship and endorsement costs and premium.
General and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were 17.5% as compared to 11% in the same quarter last year. General and administrative costs, excluding distributed termination expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 11.4% in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to 10.5% for the 2015 fourth quarter.
Payroll expenses were up $12.3 million, primarily to support the strategic brand that we have acquired from Coca-Cola. And stock-based compensation, which is a noncash item, was $3.1 million higher. Distributor termination expenses were $46.3 million in the fourth quarter as compared to $3.3 million in the 2015 fourth quarter. Regulatory matters and litigation concerning the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, use, safety and sale of the company's products were $5.1 million in the 2016 fourth quarter as compared to $6 million in the 2015 fourth quarter.
Our effective tax rate in the quarter decreased from 39.5% in the 2015 fourth quarter to 29.9% in the 2016 fourth quarter, primarily due to an increase in the domestic production deduction as well as an increase in the stock compensation deduction as a result of the adoption of new accounting guidance effective January 1, 2016, under which excess tax benefits are recorded in net income. Net income was $172.9 million in the 2016 fourth quarter compared to net income of $138.7 million in the 2015 fourth quarter, an increase of 24.7%.
The weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding decreased from 617.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2015 to 580.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2016 as a result of share buybacks, including the modified Dutch tender auction, which was completed in June 2016. Net income was impacted by the substantial increased in distributor termination expenses previously mentioned above.
Earlier diluted -- sorry, diluted earnings per share for the 2016 fourth quarter increased 32.6% to $0.30 from $0.22 in the fourth quarter of 2015. We estimate that distributor termination expenses in the 2016 fourth quarter of $46.3 million negatively affected diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.05 per share after tax. Distributor termination expenses for the 2015 fourth quarter had no effect on diluted earnings per share after tax. We refer you to the press release for the specific factors affecting profitability for the 2016 and 2015 fourth quarters, respectively.
Turning to the full year results. The company achieved record gross sales of $3.5 billion for the full year, up 12.2% from $3.1 billion in 2015. Net sales were up 12% from $2.7 billion to $3 billion. Gross and net sales for the year were adversely affected by unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates totaling $31 million and $22.3 million, respectively, for the year.
Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to 63.7% for the year ended December 31, 2016, from 60% for the year ended December 31, 2015. Operating income was up 21.4% to $1.1 billion from $893.7 million in 2015. Our effective tax rate decreased to 34% in 2016 from 38.7% in 2015.
Net income was $712.7 million, up 30.4% over net income of $546.7 million in 2015, and diluted earnings per share increased 25.6% to $1.19 from $0.95 in 2015. We refer you to the press release for the specific factors impacting profitability for the 2016 and 2015 financial years, respectively.
We have made good progress in the implementation of our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola bottlers globally. Domestically, we transitioned distribution of Monster Energy drinks in Wisconsin to Coca-Cola bottlers early in January 2017 and are making good progress in the United States in non-traditional channels, including food service accounts.
In EMEA, in the fourth quarter of 2016, we commenced distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in Bahrain, Mauritius, Qatar and United Arab Emirates. In EMEA, in the first quarter of 2017, we commenced distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in Nigeria and Oman with additional launches planned in the second quarter of 2017 for Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kuwait and Pakistan.
In LatAm, in the fourth quarter of 2016, we've transitioned distribution of Monster to Coca-Cola bottlers in Brazil, Costa Rica, Lithuania [ph] and Panama. In the first quarter of 2017, we launched distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in certain countries in the Caribbean and transitioned distribution to Coca-Cola bottlers in certain other smaller markets in that geographic region.
In China, in the fourth quarter of 2016, we commenced distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in selected markets that include Shanghai, Hunan Province, Shenzhen, Guangzhou, Zhanjiang and Hainan. We also commenced distribution in the Maldives [ph] in the fourth quarter of 2016. We have received approval for our products in India and are planning to relaunch Monster in India later this year.
As previously reported, we successfully completed our acquisition of the concentrated flavor business operated by American Fruits & Flavors on April 1, 2016. As a result of the AFF Transaction, we achieved raw material cost savings of $22 million in the 2016 fourth quarter, which were broadly in line with the expectations.
According to the Nielsen reports for the 13 weeks through February 18, 2017, all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots, increased by 0.6% versus the same period a year ago.  Sales of Monster grew 0.1% in the 13-week period, while sales of NOS increased 7.3% and sales of Full Throttle decreased 6.3%. Sales of Red Bull increased 0.8%. Sales of Rockstar decreased by 0.9%. Sales of 5-Hour decreased 5.7%, and sales of AMP decreased 24.6%.
According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended February 18, 2017, sales in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots in dollars, increased 0.1% over the same period last year. Sales of Monster decreased by 0.9% [ph] over the same period last year, while NOS was up 6.2%, and Full Throttle sales decreased 6.2%. Sales of Red Bull increased by 0.7%. Rockstar was down 4.5%. 5-Hour was down 8.5%, and AMP was down 25.5%.
We point out that the energy shot category has been declining for some time, and if we exclude the energy shot category, energy plus coffee and protein drinks, where we have experienced production capacity shortages, for the 4 weeks ended February 18, 2017, sales in the convenience and gas channels in dollars, in fact, increased 1.4% over the same period last year. And on this basis, sales of Monster increased by 1.6%.
According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended February 18, 2017, Monster's market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots in dollars, decreased by 0.4 point over the same period last year to 35%. NOS' share increased 0.2 point to 4.3%, and Full Throttle's share decreased 0.1 point to 1%. Red Bull's share increased 0.2 point to 34.7%. Rockstar's share was down 0.4 point to 8%. 5-Hour's share was lower by 0.7 point to -- at 7.6%, and AMP's share decreased 0.5 points -- 0.5 point to 1.3%.
According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended February 18, 2017, sales of energy plus coffee drinks in dollars in the convenience and gas channel decreased 5.1% over the same period last year. Sales of Java Monster were 19.7% lower than the same period last year, while sales of Starbucks Doubleshot Energy were 12.6% higher. We continue to experience production capacity shortages for Java Monster, which I will reiterate later in the call.
According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada, for the 12 weeks ended January 7, 2017, the energy drink category decreased 5% in dollars, due largely to lower pricing of private label brands. Monster sales increased 1% versus a year ago. Our market share increased 1.8 share points to 30%. Red Bull's sales decreased 2%, and its market share increased 0.9 point to 38.2%. Rockstar's sales increased [ph] 6%, and its market share decreased 0.2 point to 18.7%.
According to Nielsen, all outlets combined in Mexico, the energy drink category grew 23.9% during the month of January 2017. Monster sales increased 22.3%. Our market share in value decreased 0.4 point to 26.8% against the comparable period last year. Sales of Burn decreased 22.7%. Burn's market share decreased 2 points to 3.4%. Red Bull sales decreased 8.9%, and its market share decreased about 4.1 points to 11.4%. Vive 100's market share increased 9.6 points to 37.8%, while Boost's market share decreased 4.8 points to 13.6%.
The transition to the KO bottlers system in August 2016, while initially slow, has since improved, and we are now seeing wider availability of Monster in the traditional trade channel in Mexico. According to Nielsen, Monster's numerical distribution in the traditional trade channel grew from 10% in January 2016 to 24% in January 2017.
The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover a single month, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico.
According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ended December 2016, the actual 13-week periods vary by a few weeks between different markets. Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year grew from 13.5% to 15.4% in Great Britain; from 20.3% to 22.9% in France; from 13.4% to 15.2% in Germany; from 8.7% to 9.5% in Italy; from 8.9% to 12.4% in Ireland; from 7.1% to 10.9% in Norway; and from 8.8% to 12% in the Czech Republic.
In the same period, Monster's market share grew from 10.9% to 11.1% in Sweden; from 8.7% to 10.5% in Belgium; and from 23.8% to 27.2% in Spain.  Monster's retail market share in value for the 13 weeks ending -- ended in December 2016 as compared to the same period last year decreased from 6.7% to 5% in the Netherlands. Monster's retail market share in value for the 13 weeks ending December 2016 grew from 15.8% to 16% in South Africa.
According to IRI, Monster's market share increased in the 13 weeks ended December 2016 from 28.2% to 28.5%. I would like to point out that the Nielsen and IRI numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen and IRI in EMEA vary from country to country. According to Nielsen, Monster's retail market share in value in Chile increased to 26.9% in January 2017 as compared to 19.9% last year, and after just 2 months of the KO bottlers system, Monster's market share in value in Brazil grew to 5% in December 2016 as compared to 3.7% in the same period last year. In South Korea, Monster's retail market share in value increased from 13.3% to 23.7% in December 2016 compared to the same period last year. According to INTAGE, Monster's market share in value in the convenience store channel in Japan grew from 38.6% to 43.3% in December 2016.

Net sales for the Monster Energy drink segment in the fourth quarter of 2016 increased 17% from $585.1 million to $684.4 million from the comparable period last year. Gross sales for the Monster Energy segment for the fourth quarter of 2016 increased 14.3% from $677.7 million to $774.8 million for the comparable period last year. Net sales for the Monster Energy drink segment in the fourth quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $3.2 million of foreign currency movements. In comparison, gross to net sales for the Monster Energy drink segment of $677.7 million and $585.1 million, respectively, for the 2015 fourth quarter were impacted by advance purchases made by the company's customers due to a preannounced price increase effective August 31, 2015, on certain of the company's Monster Energy brand energy drinks. The company estimates that both gross and net sales for the 2015 fourth quarter for the Monster Energy drink segment were reduced by approximately $12 million and $11 million, respectively, as a result of such advance purchases. Gross and net sales for the Monster Energy drink segment for the 2016 fourth quarter, after adjusting the 2015 fourth quarter comparisons for advance purchases, increased by 12.4% and 14.8%, respectively.
Net sales for the Strategic Brand segment were $64.5 million for the fourth quarter as compared to $60.4 million in the same quarter last year. Net sales for the company's Strategic Brand segment were negatively impacted by approximately $0.1 million of foreign currency movements in the quarter.
Net sales for the Other segment, which includes third-party sales made by AFF, were $4.7 million in the 2016 fourth quarter. There were no sales for the Other segment in the comparable 2015 fourth quarter.
We continued to experience production capacity shortages for our retort products, Java Monster and Muscle Monster. We are taking steps to address the issues, including procuring products from Europe, but anticipate that it will still take a number of months before production availability allows us to restore normal supply patterns and fully meet consumer demand that exists for these products. We estimate that sales in the quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $22 million as a result of such production capacity shortages.
Net sales to customers outside of the United States were $193.5 million in the 2016 fourth quarter compared to $145.3 million in the corresponding quarter in 2015. In local currencies, net sales to customers outside of the United States were approximately $3.3 million higher. Included in reported geographic sales are our sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the United States and transshipped [ph] to the military and their customers overseas. In Europe, the Middle East and Africa, net sales in the fourth quarter in local currencies increased 14% and 33% in dollars over the same period last year.
Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales decreased from 53.4% in the same period last year to 52.8% during the quarter. For the full year of 2016, net sales increased 36% in local currencies and 30% in dollars over 2015.
Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales increased from 48.4% in 2015 to 51.1% in '16. Monster continued to gain momentum and increase market share throughout Europe in the fourth quarter. In particular, in Great Britain, Germany, Spain, France, Czech Republic, Ireland, Poland and Norway, Monster achieved increased sales gains as well as increased market share.
In Asia Pacific, net sales in the fourth quarter increased 53.1% in dollars and 41.1% in local currencies over the same period last year. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales decreased from 49.6% in the same period last year to 44.1% during the 2016 fourth quarter. In Japan, net sales in the quarter increased 45.1% or 25.1% in local currency, primarily due to the strengthening of the Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar as compared to the same quarter last year. We continue to experience strong performance in Japan. In South Korea, net sales increased 135.9% or 130.3% in local currency as compared to the same quarter last year.
In Oceana, which includes Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti, French Polynesia, New Caledonia and Guam, net sales increased 3.6%, minus 3.4% in local currencies as compared to the same quarter last year. As previously mentioned, we are moving ahead with plans for local production in India with a view to reentering the market in 2017.
In Latin America, including Mexico and the Caribbean, gross sales in the fourth quarter increased 20.7% in dollars and 23.6% in local currencies. Net sales in the fourth quarter increased 19.7% and 21.8% in local currencies over the same period last year. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales increased from 48.9% in the same period last year to 52.5% during the 2016 fourth quarter. Net sales increased in Brazil 115.3% in dollars or 117.2% in local currency largely due to the transition of Monster to Coca-Cola bottlers, which took place on November 1, 2016. Net sales in Chile increased 148.6% in dollars and 137.7% in local currency.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $377.6 million compared to $2.18 billion at December 31, 2015. Short-term investments were $220.6 million compared to $744.6 million at December 31, 2015. Long-term investments decreased to $2.4 million from $15.3 million at December 31, 2015.
Accounts receivable increased to $448.1 million at December 31, 2016, from $353 million at December 31, 2015. Days outstanding for accounts receivables were 48.2 days compared 43.2 days at December 31, 2015.  Inventories increased to $162 million from $156.1 million at December 31, 2015. Average days of inventory was 57 days at December 31, 2016, compared to 58 days at December 31, 2015.
In September 2016, we launched Mutant, an exciting super soda in limited convenience stores in certain U.S. markets with encouraging sales to the point of distribution. For the 13 weeks ended January 31, 2017, for Nielsen total U.S. convenience, Mutant had the highest dollar share gain of any single-serve sparkling softdrink brand. For single-serve packages sold in convenience stores during the same period in [ph] dollars, Mutant outsold a number of well-established single-serve brands such as 7UP. We remain confident about the potential of this brand.
We are planning the launch of our new Hydro line, which is a non-carbonated, lightly sweetened energy drink, is packaged in a unique 16.9-ounce PET can, the size of which is exclusive to us in the U.S. at this time. We are planning to launch Hydro to the retail trade towards the end of March and early April.
Monster Energy Ultra Violet was launched exclusively with Sam's Club and will be expanded to all channels at the end of March 2017. We are also planning to launch Full Throttle orange at the end of March. We have a robust innovation pipeline, and further launches are planned for the remainder of 2017.
We estimate January 2017 gross sales to be approximately 10.4% higher than in January 2016. On a foreign exchange adjusted basis, we estimate January 2017 gross sales to be approximately 11.6% higher than in January 2016. In this regard, we caution again that sales over the short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributing centers as well as shifts in the timing of production, in some instances, where our bottlers are responsible for production and unilaterally [ph] determine their production schedules, which affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers. We reiterate that sales average for a period, such as a single month, would not necessarily be due to 2 [ph] or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period.
With regard to the litigation between the company and the San Francisco City Attorney, we advised that the action was settled in January 2017 on terms acceptable to the company. The settlement does not include any penalty under California's Unfair Competition Law any finding or admission of liability or wrongdoing or any change in the formula -- to the formulation of Monster Energy drinks or to whom the drinks may be sold. In consideration of the release of claims and dismissal of the action with prejudice, the company agreed to maintain various current marketing and laboring practices for its energy drink products through December 31, 2018.
On February 28, 2017, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a new repurchase program for the repurchase of up to $500 million of the company's outstanding common stock. No availability remained under the previously authorized share repurchase programs.
In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points. One, as previously reported, our acquisition of AFF represents an important milestone for the company and gives us ownership of our proprietary formulas for our principal products. We recognized the reduction in operating cost of $22 million in the fourth quarter as a result of the acquisition.
Two, North American and international gross margins remain healthy. Three, while the U.S. Nielsen market statistics show that the energy category slowed in the U.S. towards the end of the fourth quarter, equivalent and given the [ph] first quarter equivalent market statistics for many countries around the world show that the energy category is continuing to grow and that Monster is generally growing ahead of the category. Currency exchange rates continue to affect our results. The new additions to the Monster family continue to gain momentum and add to the company's sales.
We're excited about the prospects for our new product launches. We are pleased with our performance in our international markets and reiterate the growth potential for us in China, one of the largest energy drink markets globally. We have successfully transitioned additional international companies to Coca-Cola bottlers in the fourth quarter, and we'll be transitioning a number of other markets to Coca-Cola bottlers in 2017.
I'd like to open the floor to questions about the quarter and the year."

We've positioned Mutant in selected channels at full pricing. We've not been aggressive in our promotion. If you look at the average pricing in Nielsen, Mutant's average pricing in all the different periods, depending which period you look at, is still about $1.96. If you compare that, that's quite a substantial premium to the other softdrinks and its main competitor softdrink that we're looking at competing with, which is Mountain Dew. And so we have strategically not promoted Mutant during the winter period. We are taking steps to deal with expanded distribution. We will obviously increase our promotional and other activities around the brand as we continue to go into spring and summer. So when we look at the numbers and we look at these sales per point, we think the sales per point are pretty good in relation to a lot of the other well-established brands in the area. If you look at the last 4 weeks, that has dropped off a little bit, again, because of the, we believe, the lack of promotional spend and -- behind the brand, but that was intentional in this period of time. It is a soda, and we are looking to, as I said, expand distribution, expand the channels and also become substantially more active in the promotion of the brand as we start going into spring now. So we're still positive about the brand and its prospects and sell-through, particularly where we have seen -- at the substantial price premium, we've seen substantial sales per point that are higher than a lot of very well-established brands that have been around for a long time."

So there are challenges. We also have a group of 10 bottlers. It's a little bit different to Chile. Chile, there were 2 main bottlers that, really, we started to have some pretty -- we really have pretty good momentum for the brand. It was well established. It didn't have a deep distribution, but where it was, it was really selling into the high teens and pretty nicely. So when the 2 Coke bottlers in Chile took it over, they really did embrace the brand, and obviously, we're able to -- to sort of more structured market, we're able to expand the market and roll it out probably more quickly and more, I think, efficiently than is the case in Brazil. And so the results have been very good, and we've been very encouraged by the result. In the case of the Brazilian market, it is a much more non-traditional market. You have literally well over 1 million of these little traditional stores all over the place, and they're harder to get to, harder to service. You go -- invariably, there's a very, very large and integrated [ph] wholesaler system that helps get to these stores, and it's just -- you're just not comparing apples and apples. So we've got to manage a group of 10-odd bottlers in a very different environment, country and also that is going through tough financial conditions at the moment. But that being said, we think that it will take some time. But as it has in many of the Coke markets where you do deal with these very big bottlers or, basically, groups of bottlers, it takes time for them to get coordinated and get their system going. But when it does start going, it does really work. It does improve, and it's -- and so we're very encouraged by what we've seen. We're at a point now where we're selling at a rate, which is higher than we've ever sold even when we were with our previous distributor at the peak before we announced the Coke transaction and they tended to lose interest in the brand and stopped putting their efforts behind it because they were also a good distributor. And so we are encouraged by where we're going. But it will take time to build up. The good news is that there -- it's a big energy market. We do quite nicely with Burn there and really, the -- by far, the largest player is Red Bull. That is really our main competitor at a -- and we're at sort of a similar price point, which, for us, means that we will -- gives us a lot of opportunity to grow into that market against the Red Bull share, which is at a premium price and is not at the low end. They do have low-end brands, but at least we know there is a lot of good business to be going after there. So -- but it's going to take time to develop."

On October 14, 2016, we announced the 3-for-1 stock split of the company's common stock to be effective in the form of a 200% stock dividend. The common stock dividend was issued on November 9, 2016, and the company's common stock began trading as the split -- at a split-adjusted price on November 10, 2016.

Sales in the beverage industry in the fourth quarter continued to be soft globally. In the fourth quarter, net sales were $753.8 million, up 16.8% from $645.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. The company achieved record gross sales of $848.8 million, up 14.2% from $743.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2015.
The comparative net and gross sales of $645.4 million and $743.2 million, respectively, for the 2015 fourth quarter were impacted by advance purchases made by the company's customers due to a preannounced price increase effective August 31, 2015, on certain of the company's Monster Energy brand energy drinks. The company estimates that both net and gross sales for the 2015 fourth quarter were reduced by approximately $11 million and $12 million, respectively, as a result of such advance purchases.
Net and gross sales for the 2016 fourth quarter, after adjusting the 2015 fourth quarter comparatives for advance purchases, increased by 14.8% and 12.4%, respectively. Unfavorable currency exchange rates reduced net sales by approximately $3.3 million and gross sales by approximately $5.9 million in the 2016 fourth quarter.
Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the fourth quarter was 66.1% as compared to 62.5% for the comparable 2015 fourth quarter. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to cost of goods savings as the result of AFF Transaction and product mix as well as reduced promotional allowances as a percentage of sales in the fourth quarter.
We estimate the lower promotional allowances as a percentage of sales as compared to prior periods, together with the reduction of Java Monster sales, had the effect of increasing gross profit percentage by approximately 2% in the fourth quarter. Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 3.2% compared to 2016 and 2015 fourth quarters. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 12% compared to 12.9% in the same quarter a year ago, but they increased in absolute dollars.  The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to increased sponsorship and endorsement costs and premium.
General and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were 17.5% as compared to 11% in the same quarter last year. General and administrative costs, excluding distributed termination expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 11.4% in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to 10.5% for the 2015 fourth quarter.
Payroll expenses were up $12.3 million, primarily to support the strategic brand that we have acquired from Coca-Cola. And stock-based compensation, which is a noncash item, was $3.1 million higher. Distributor termination expenses were $46.3 million in the fourth quarter as compared to $3.3 million in the 2015 fourth quarter. Regulatory matters and litigation concerning the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, use, safety and sale of the company's products were $5.1 million in the 2016 fourth quarter as compared to $6 million in the 2015 fourth quarter.
Our effective tax rate in the quarter decreased from 39.5% in the 2015 fourth quarter to 29.9% in the 2016 fourth quarter, primarily due to an increase in the domestic production deduction as well as an increase in the stock compensation deduction as a result of the adoption of new accounting guidance effective January 1, 2016, under which excess tax benefits are recorded in net income. Net income was $172.9 million in the 2016 fourth quarter compared to net income of $138.7 million in the 2015 fourth quarter, an increase of 24.7%.
The weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding decreased from 617.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2015 to 580.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2016 as a result of share buybacks, including the modified Dutch tender auction, which was completed in June 2016. Net income was impacted by the substantial increased in distributor termination expenses previously mentioned above.
Earlier diluted -- sorry, diluted earnings per share for the 2016 fourth quarter increased 32.6% to $0.30 from $0.22 in the fourth quarter of 2015. We estimate that distributor termination expenses in the 2016 fourth quarter of $46.3 million negatively affected diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.05 per share after tax. Distributor termination expenses for the 2015 fourth quarter had no effect on diluted earnings per share after tax. We refer you to the press release for the specific factors affecting profitability for the 2016 and 2015 fourth quarters, respectively.
Turning to the full year results. The company achieved record gross sales of $3.5 billion for the full year, up 12.2% from $3.1 billion in 2015. Net sales were up 12% from $2.7 billion to $3 billion. Gross and net sales for the year were adversely affected by unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates totaling $31 million and $22.3 million, respectively, for the year.
Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to 63.7% for the year ended December 31, 2016, from 60% for the year ended December 31, 2015. Operating income was up 21.4% to $1.1 billion from $893.7 million in 2015. Our effective tax rate decreased to 34% in 2016 from 38.7% in 2015.
Net income was $712.7 million, up 30.4% over net income of $546.7 million in 2015, and diluted earnings per share increased 25.6% to $1.19 from $0.95 in 2015. We refer you to the press release for the specific factors impacting profitability for the 2016 and 2015 financial years, respectively.
We have made good progress in the implementation of our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola bottlers globally. Domestically, we transitioned distribution of Monster Energy drinks in Wisconsin to Coca-Cola bottlers early in January 2017 and are making good progress in the United States in non-traditional channels, including food service accounts.
In EMEA, in the fourth quarter of 2016, we commenced distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in Bahrain, Mauritius, Qatar and United Arab Emirates. In EMEA, in the first quarter of 2017, we commenced distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in Nigeria and Oman with additional launches planned in the second quarter of 2017 for Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kuwait and Pakistan.
In LatAm, in the fourth quarter of 2016, we've transitioned distribution of Monster to Coca-Cola bottlers in Brazil, Costa Rica, Guyana and Panama. In the first quarter of 2017, we launched distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in certain countries in the Caribbean and transitioned distribution to Coca-Cola bottlers in certain other smaller markets in that geographic region.
In China, in the fourth quarter of 2016, we commenced distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in selected markets that include Shanghai, Hunan Province, Shenzhen, Guangzhou, Zhanjiang and Hainan. We also commenced distribution in the Maldives [ph] in the fourth quarter of 2016. We have received approval for our products in India and are planning to relaunch Monster in India later this year.
As previously reported, we successfully completed our acquisition of the concentrated flavor business operated by American Fruits & Flavors on April 1, 2016. As a result of the AFF Transaction, we achieved raw material cost savings of $22 million in the 2016 fourth quarter, which were broadly in line with the expectations.
According to the Nielsen reports for the 13 weeks through February 18, 2017, all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots, increased by 0.6% versus the same period a year ago.  Sales of Monster grew 0.1% in the 13-week period, while sales of NOS increased 7.3% and sales of Full Throttle decreased 6.3%. Sales of Red Bull increased 0.8%. Sales of Rockstar decreased by 0.9%. Sales of 5-Hour decreased 5.7%, and sales of AMP decreased 24.6%.
According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended February 18, 2017, sales in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots in dollars, increased 0.1% over the same period last year. Sales of Monster decreased by 0.9% [ph] over the same period last year, while NOS was up 6.2%, and Full Throttle sales decreased 6.2%. Sales of Red Bull increased by 0.7%. Rockstar was down 4.5%. 5-Hour was down 8.5%, and AMP was down 25.5%.
We point out that the energy shot category has been declining for some time, and if we exclude the energy shot category, energy plus coffee and protein drinks, where we have experienced production capacity shortages, for the 4 weeks ended February 18, 2017, sales in the convenience and gas channels in dollars, in fact, increased 1.4% over the same period last year. And on this basis, sales of Monster increased by 1.6%.
According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended February 18, 2017, Monster's market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots in dollars, decreased by 0.4 point over the same period last year to 35%. NOS' share increased 0.2 point to 4.3%, and Full Throttle's share decreased 0.1 point to 1%. Red Bull's share increased 0.2 point to 34.7%. Rockstar's share was down 0.4 point to 8%. 5-Hour's share was lower by 0.7 point to -- at 7.6%, and AMP's share decreased 0.5 points -- 0.5 point to 1.3%.
According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended February 18, 2017, sales of energy plus coffee drinks in dollars in the convenience and gas channel decreased 5.1% over the same period last year. Sales of Java Monster were 19.7% lower than the same period last year, while sales of Starbucks Doubleshot Energy were 12.6% higher. We continue to experience production capacity shortages for Java Monster, which I will address later in the call.
According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada, for the 12 weeks ended January 7, 2017, the energy drink category decreased 5% in dollars, due largely to lower pricing of private label brands. Monster sales increased 1% versus a year ago. Our market share increased 1.8 share points to 7%. Red Bull's sales decreased 2%, and its market share increased 0.9 point to 38.2%. Rockstar's sales increased [ph] 6%, and its market share decreased 0.2 point to 18.7%.
According to Nielsen, all outlets combined in Mexico, the energy drink category grew 23.9% during the month of January 2017. Monster sales increased 22.3%. Our market share in value decreased 0.4 point to 26.8% against the comparable period last year. Sales of Burn decreased 22.7%. Burn's market share decreased 2 points to 3.4%. Red Bull sales decreased 8.9%, and its market share decreased about 4.1 points to 11.4%. Vive 100's market share increased 9.6 points to 37.8%, while Boost's market share decreased 4.8 points to 13.6%.
The transition to the KO bottlers system in August 2016, while initially slow, has since improved, and we are now seeing wider availability of Monster in the traditional trade channel in Mexico. According to Nielsen, Monster's numerical distribution in the traditional trade channel grew from 10% in January 2016 to 24% in January 2017.
The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover a single month, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico.
According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ended December 2016, the actual 13-week periods vary by a few weeks between different markets. Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year grew from 13.5% to 15.4% in Great Britain; from 20.3% to 22.9% in France; from 13.4% to 15.2% in Germany; from 8.7% to 9.5% in Italy; from 8.9% to 12.4% in Ireland; from 7.1% to 10.9% in Norway; and from 8.8% to 12% in the Czech Republic.
In the same period, Monster's market share grew from 10.9% to 11.1% in Sweden; from 8.7% to 10.5% in Belgium; and from 23.8% to 27.2% in Spain.  Monster's retail market share in value for the 13 weeks ending -- ended in December 2016 as compared to the same period last year decreased from 6.7% to 5% in the Netherlands. Monster's retail market share in value for the 13 weeks ending December 2016 grew from 15.8% to 16% in South Africa.
According to IRI, Monster's market share increased in the 13 weeks ended December 2016 from 28.2% to 28.5%. I would like to point out that the Nielsen and IRI numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen and IRI in EMEA vary from country to country. According to Nielsen, Monster's retail market share in value in Chile increased to 26.9% in January 2017 as compared to 19.9% last year, and after just 2 months of the KO bottlers system, Monster's market share in value in Brazil grew to 5% in December 2016 as compared to 3.7% in the same period last year. In South Korea, Monster's retail market share in value increased from 13.3% to 23.7% in December 2016 compared to the same period last year. According to INTAGE, Monster's market share in value in the convenience store channel in Japan grew from 38.6% to 43.3% in December 2016.

Net sales for the Monster Energy drink segment in the fourth quarter of 2016 increased 17% from $585.1 million to $684.4 million from the comparable period last year. Gross sales for the Monster Energy drink segment for the fourth quarter of 2016 increased 14.3% from $677.7 million to $774.8 million for the comparable period last year. Net sales for the Monster Energy drink segment in the fourth quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $3.2 million of foreign currency movements. In comparison of gross and net sales for the Monster Energy drink segment of $677.7 million and $585.1 million, respectively, for the 2015 fourth quarter were impacted by advance purchases made by the company's customers due to a preannounced price increase effective August 31, 2015, on certain of the company's Monster Energy brand energy drinks. The company estimates that both gross and net sales for the 2015 fourth quarter for the Monster Energy drink segment were reduced by approximately $12 million and $11 million, respectively, as a result of such advance purchases. Gross and net sales for the Monster Energy drink segment for the 2016 fourth quarter, after adjusting the 2015 fourth quarter comparisons for advance purchases, increased by 12.4% and 14.8%, respectively.
Net sales for the Strategic Brand segment were $64.5 million for the fourth quarter as compared to $60.4 million in the same quarter last year. Net sales for the company's Strategic Brand segment were negatively impacted by approximately $0.1 million of foreign currency movements in the quarter.
Net sales for the Other segment, which includes third-party sales made by AFF, were $4.7 million in the 2016 fourth quarter. There were no sales for the Other segment in the comparable 2015 fourth quarter.
We continued to experience production capacity shortages for our retort products, Java Monster and Muscle Monster. We are taking steps to address the issues, including procuring products from Europe, but anticipate that it will still take a number of months before production availability allows us to restore normal supply patterns and fully meet consumer demand that exists for these products. We estimate that sales in the quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $22 million as a result of such production capacity shortages.
Net sales to customers outside of the United States were $193.5 million in the 2016 fourth quarter compared to $145.3 million in the corresponding quarter in 2015. In local currencies, net sales to customers outside of the United States were approximately $3.3 million higher. Included in reported geographic sales are our sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the United States and transshipped [ph] to the military and their customers overseas. In Europe, the Middle East and Africa, net sales in the fourth quarter in local currencies increased 14% and 33% in dollars over the same period last year.
Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales decreased from 53.4% in the same period last year to 52.8% during the quarter. For the full year of 2016, net sales increased 36% in local currencies and 30% in dollars over 2015.
Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales increased from 48.4% in 2015 to 51.1% in '16. Monster continued to gain momentum and increase market share throughout Europe in the fourth quarter. In particular, in Great Britain, Germany, Spain, France, Czech Republic, Ireland, Poland and Norway, Monster achieved increased sales gains as well as increased market share.
In Asia Pacific, net sales in the fourth quarter increased 53.1% in dollars and 41.1% in local currencies over the same period last year. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales decreased from 49.6% in the same period last year to 44.1% during the 2016 fourth quarter. In Japan, net sales in the quarter increased 45.1% or 25.1% in local currency, primarily due to the strengthening of the Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar as compared to the same quarter last year. We continue to experience strong performance in Japan. In South Korea, net sales increased 135.9% or 130.3% in local currency as compared to the same quarter last year.
In Oceana, which includes Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti, French Polynesia, New Caledonia and Guam, net sales increased 3.6%, minus 3.4% in local currencies as compared to the same quarter last year. As previously mentioned, we are moving ahead with plans for local production in India with a view to reentering the market in 2017.
In Latin America, including Mexico and the Caribbean, gross sales in the fourth quarter increased 20.7% in dollars and 23.6% in local currencies. Net sales in the fourth quarter increased 19.7% and 21.8% in local currencies over the same period last year. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales increased from 48.9% in the same period last year to 52.5% during the 2016 fourth quarter. Net sales increased in Brazil 115.3% in dollars or 117.2% in local currency largely due to the transition of Monster to Coca-Cola bottlers, which took place on November 1, 2016. Net sales in Chile increased 148.6% in dollars and 137.7% in local currency.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $377.6 million compared to $2.18 billion at December 31, 2015. Short-term investments were $220.6 million compared to $744.6 million at December 31, 2015. Long-term investments decreased to $2.4 million from $15.3 million at December 31, 2015.
Accounts receivable increased to $448.1 million at December 31, 2016, from $353 million at December 31, 2015. Days outstanding for accounts receivables were 48.2 days compared 43.2 days at December 31, 2015.  Inventories increased to $162 million from $156.1 million at December 31, 2015. Average days of inventory was 57 days at December 31, 2016, compared to 58 days at December 31, 2015.
In September 2016, we launched Mutant, an exciting super soda in limited convenience stores in certain U.S. markets with encouraging sales to the point of distribution. For the 13 weeks ended January 21, 2017, for Nielsen total U.S. convenience, Mutant had the highest dollar share gain of any single-serve sparkling softdrink brand. For single-serve packages sold in convenience stores during the same period in dollars, Mutant outsold a number of well-established single-serve brands such as 7UP. We remain confident about the potential of this brand.
We are planning the launch of our new Hydro line, which is a non-carbonated, lightly sweetened energy drink, is packaged in a unique 16.9-ounce PET can, the size of which is exclusive to us in the U.S. at this time. We are planning to launch Hydro to the retail trade towards the end of March and early April.
Monster Energy Ultra Violet was launched exclusively with Sam's Club and will be expanded to all channels at the end of March 2017. We are also planning to launch Full Throttle orange at the end of March. We have a robust innovation pipeline, and further launches are planned for the remainder of 2017.
We estimate January 2017 gross sales to be approximately 10.4% higher than in January 2016. On a foreign exchange adjusted basis, we estimate January 2017 gross sales to be approximately 11.6% higher than in January 2016. In this regard, we caution again that sales over the short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributing centers as well as shifts in the timing of production, in some instances, where our bottlers are responsible for production and unilaterally determine their production schedules, which affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers. We reiterate that sales average for a period, such as a single month, would not necessarily be intuited to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period.
With regard to the litigation between the company and the San Francisco City Attorney, we advised that the action was settled in January 2017 on terms acceptable to the company. The settlement does not include any penalty under California's Unfair Competition Law any finding or admission of liability or wrongdoing or any change in the formula -- to the formulation of Monster Energy drinks or to whom the drinks may be sold. In consideration of the release of claims and dismissal of the action with prejudice, the company agreed to maintain various current marketing and laboring practices for its energy drink products through December 31, 2018.
On February 28, 2017, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a new repurchase program for the repurchase of up to $500 million of the company's outstanding common stock. No availability remained under the previously authorized share repurchase programs.
In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points. One, as previously reported, our acquisition of AFF represents an important milestone for the company and gives us ownership of our proprietary formulas for our principal products. We recognized the reduction in operating cost of $22 million in the fourth quarter as a result of the acquisition.
Two, North American and international gross margins remain healthy. Three, while the U.S. Nielsen market statistics show that the energy category slowed in the U.S. towards the end of the fourth quarter, equivalent and given the [ph] first quarter equivalent market statistics for many countries around the world show that the energy category is continuing to grow and that Monster is generally growing ahead of the category. Currency exchange rates continue to affect our results. The new additions to the Monster family continue to gain momentum and add to the company's sales.
We're excited about the prospects for our new product launches. We are pleased with our performance in our international markets and reiterate the growth potential for us in China, one of the largest energy drink markets globally. We have successfully transitioned additional international countries to Coca-Cola bottlers in the fourth quarter, and we'll be transitioning a number of other markets to Coca-Cola bottlers in 2017.
I'd like to open the floor to questions about the quarter and the year."

We've positioned Mutant in selected channels at full pricing. We've not been aggressive in our promotion. If you look at the average pricing in Nielsen, Mutant's average pricing in all the different periods, depending which period you look at, is still about $1.96. If you compare that, that's quite a substantial premium to the other softdrinks and its main competitor softdrink that we're looking at competing with, which is Mountain Dew. And so we have strategically not promoted Mutant during the winter period. We are taking steps to deal with expanded distribution. We will obviously increase our promotional and other activities around the brand as we continue to go into spring and summer. So when we look at the numbers and we look at these sales per point, we think the sales per point are pretty good in relation to a lot of the other well-established brands in the area. If you look at the last 4 weeks, that has dropped off a little bit, again, because of the, we believe, the lack of promotional spend and -- behind the brand, but that was intentional in this period of time. It is a soda, and we are looking to, as I said, expand distribution, expand the channels and also become substantially more active in the promotion of the brand as we start going into spring now. So we're still positive about the brand and its prospects and sell-through, particularly where we have seen -- at the substantial price premium, we've seen substantial sales per point that are higher than a lot of very well-established brands that have been around for a long time."

So there are challenges. We also have a group of 10 bottlers. It's a little bit different to Chile. Chile, there were 2 main bottlers that, really, we started to have some pretty -- we really have pretty good momentum for the brand. It was well established. It didn't have a deep distribution, but where it was, it was already selling into the high teens and grew pretty nicely. So when the 2 Coke bottlers in Chile took it over, they really did embrace the brand, and obviously, we're able to -- to sort of more structured market, we're able to expand the market and roll it out probably more quickly and more, I think, efficiently than is the case in Brazil. And so the results have been very good, and we've been very encouraged by the result. In the case of the Brazilian market, it is a much more non-traditional market. You have literally well over 1 million of these little traditional stores all over the place, and they're harder to get to, harder to service. You go -- invariably, there's a very, very large and integrated [ph] wholesaler system that helps get to these stores, and it's just -- you're just not comparing apples and apples. So we've got to manage a group of 10-odd bottlers in a very different environment, country and also that is going through tough financial conditions at the moment. But that being said, we think that it will take some time. But as it has in many of the Coke markets where you do deal with these very big bottlers or, basically, groups of bottlers, it takes time for them to get coordinated and get their system going. But when it does start going, it does really work. It does improve, and it's -- and so we're very encouraged by what we've seen. We're at a point now where we're selling at a rate, which is higher than we've ever sold even when we were with our previous distributor at the peak before we announced the Coke transaction and they tended to lose interest in the brand and stopped putting their efforts behind it because they were also a good distributor. And so we are encouraged by where we're going. But it will take time to build up. The good news is that there -- it's a big energy market. We do quite nicely with Burn there and really, the -- by far, the largest player is Red Bull. That is really our main competitor at a -- and we're at sort of a similar price point, which, for us, means that we will -- gives us a lot of opportunity to grow into that market against the Red Bull share, which is at a premium price and is not at the low end. They do have low-end brands, but at least we know there is a lot of good business to be gone after there. So -- but it's going to take time to develop."

On October 14, 2016, we announced the 3-for-1 stock split of the company's common stock to be effective in the form of a 200% stock dividend. The common stock dividend was issued on November 9, 2016, and the company's common stock began trading as the split -- at a split-adjusted price on November 10, 2016. Accordingly, all per share amounts, common stock outstanding and common stock repurchase presented on this call have been adjusted retroactively where applicable to reflect the stock split.
Sales in the beverage industry in the fourth quarter continued to be soft globally. In the fourth quarter, net sales were $753.8 million, up 16.8% from $645.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. The company achieved record gross sales of $848.8 million, up 14.2% from $743.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2015.
The comparative net and gross sales of $645.4 million and $743.2 million, respectively, for the 2015 fourth quarter were impacted by advance purchases made by the company's customers due to a preannounced price increase effective August 31, 2015, on certain of the company's Monster Energy brand energy drinks. The company estimates that both net and gross sales for the 2015 fourth quarter were reduced by approximately $11 million and $12 million, respectively, as a result of such advance purchases.
Net and gross sales for the 2016 fourth quarter, after adjusting the 2015 fourth quarter comparatives for advance purchases, increased by 14.8% and 12.4%, respectively. Unfavorable currency exchange rates reduced net sales by approximately $3.3 million and gross sales by approximately $5.9 million in the 2016 fourth quarter.
Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the fourth quarter was 66.1% as compared to 62.5% for the comparable 2015 fourth quarter. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to cost of goods savings as the result of AFF Transaction and product mix as well as reduced promotional allowances as a percentage of sales in the fourth quarter.
We estimate the lower promotional allowances as a percentage of sales as compared to prior periods, together with the reduction of Java Monster sales, had the effect of increasing gross profit percentage by approximately 2% in the fourth quarter. Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 3.2% compared to 2016 and 2015 fourth quarters. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 12% compared to 12.9% in the same quarter a year ago, but they increased in absolute dollars.  The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to increased sponsorship and endorsement costs and premium.
General and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were 17.5% as compared to 11% in the same quarter last year. General and administrative costs, excluding distributed termination expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 11.4% in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to 10.5% for the 2015 fourth quarter.
Payroll expenses were up $12.3 million, primarily to support the strategic brand that we have acquired from Coca-Cola. And stock-based compensation, which is a noncash item, was $3.1 million higher. Distributor termination expenses were $46.3 million in the fourth quarter as compared to $3.3 million in the 2015 fourth quarter. Regulatory matters and litigation concerning the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, use, safety and sale of the company's products were $5.1 million in the 2016 fourth quarter as compared to $6 million in the 2015 fourth quarter.
Our effective tax rate in the quarter decreased from 39.5% in the 2015 fourth quarter to 29.9% in the 2016 fourth quarter, primarily due to an increase in the domestic production deduction as well as an increase in the stock compensation deduction as a result of the adoption of new accounting guidance effective January 1, 2016, under which excess tax benefits are recorded in net income. Net income was $172.9 million in the 2016 fourth quarter compared to net income of $138.7 million in the 2015 fourth quarter, an increase of 24.7%.
The weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding decreased from 617.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2015 to 580.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2016 as a result of share buybacks, including the modified Dutch tender auction, which was completed in June 2016. Net income was impacted by the substantial increased in distributor termination expenses previously mentioned above.
Earlier diluted -- sorry, diluted earnings per share for the 2016 fourth quarter increased 32.6% to $0.30 from $0.22 in the fourth quarter of 2015. We estimate that distributor termination expenses in the 2016 fourth quarter of $46.3 million negatively affected diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.05 per share after tax. Distributor termination expenses for the 2015 fourth quarter had no effect on diluted earnings per share after tax. We refer you to the press release for the specific factors affecting profitability for the 2016 and 2015 fourth quarters, respectively.
Turning to the full year results. The company achieved record gross sales of $3.5 billion for the full year, up 12.2% from $3.1 billion in 2015. Net sales were up 12% from $2.7 billion to $3 billion. Gross and net sales for the year were adversely affected by unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates totaling $31 million and $22.3 million, respectively, for the year.
Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to 63.7% for the year ended December 31, 2016, from 60% for the year ended December 31, 2015. Operating income was up 21.4% to $1.1 billion from $893.7 million in 2015. Our effective tax rate decreased to 34% in 2016 from 38.7% in 2015.
Net income was $712.7 million, up 30.4% over net income of $546.7 million in 2015, and diluted earnings per share increased 25.6% to $1.19 from $0.95 in 2015. We refer you to the press release for the specific factors impacting profitability for the 2016 and 2015 financial years, respectively.
We have made good progress in the implementation of our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola bottlers globally. Domestically, we transitioned distribution of Monster Energy drinks in Wisconsin to Coca-Cola bottlers early in January 2017 and are making good progress in the United States in non-traditional channels, including food service accounts.
In EMEA, in the fourth quarter of 2016, we commenced distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in Bahrain, Mauritius, Qatar and United Arab Emirates. In EMEA, in the first quarter of 2017, we commenced distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in Nigeria and Oman with additional launches planned in the second quarter of 2017 for Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kuwait and Pakistan.
In LatAm, in the fourth quarter of 2016, we've transitioned distribution of Monster to Coca-Cola bottlers in Brazil, Costa Rica, Guyana and Panama. In the first quarter of 2017, we launched distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in certain countries in the Caribbean and transitioned distribution to Coca-Cola bottlers in certain other smaller markets in that geographic region.
In China, in the fourth quarter of 2016, we commenced distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in selected markets that include Shanghai, Hunan Province, Shenzhen, Guangzhou, Zhanjiang and Hainan. We also commenced distribution in the Maldives [ph] in the fourth quarter of 2016. We have received approval for our products in India and are planning to relaunch Monster in India later this year.
As previously reported, we successfully completed our acquisition of the concentrated flavor business operated by American Fruits & Flavors on April 1, 2016. As a result of the AFF Transaction, we achieved raw material cost savings of $22 million in the 2016 fourth quarter, which were broadly in line with the expectations.
According to the Nielsen reports for the 13 weeks through February 18, 2017, all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots, increased by 0.6% versus the same period a year ago.  Sales of Monster grew 0.1% in the 13-week period, while sales of NOS increased 7.3% and sales of Full Throttle decreased 6.3%. Sales of Red Bull increased 0.8%. Sales of Rockstar decreased by 0.9%. Sales of 5-Hour decreased 5.7%, and sales of AMP decreased 24.6%.
According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended February 18, 2017, sales in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots in dollars, increased 0.1% over the same period last year. Sales of Monster decreased by 0.9% [ph] over the same period last year, while NOS was up 6.2%, and Full Throttle sales decreased 6.2%. Sales of Red Bull increased by 0.7%. Rockstar was down 4.5%. 5-Hour was down 8.5%, and AMP was down 25.5%.
We point out that the energy shot category has been declining for some time, and if we exclude the energy shot category, energy plus coffee and protein drinks, where we have experienced production capacity shortages, for the 4 weeks ended February 18, 2017, sales in the convenience and gas channels in dollars, in fact, increased 1.4% over the same period last year. And on this basis, sales of Monster increased by 1.6%.
According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended February 18, 2017, Monster's market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots in dollars, decreased by 0.4 point over the same period last year to 35%. NOS' share increased 0.2 point to 4.3%, and Full Throttle's share decreased 0.1 point to 1%. Red Bull's share increased 0.2 point to 34.7%. Rockstar's share was down 0.4 point to 8%. 5-Hour's share was lower by 0.7 point to -- at 7.6%, and AMP's share decreased 0.5 points -- 0.5 point to 1.3%.
According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended February 18, 2017, sales of energy plus coffee drinks in dollars in the convenience and gas channel decreased 5.1% over the same period last year. Sales of Java Monster were 19.7% lower than the same period last year, while sales of Starbucks Doubleshot Energy were 12.6% higher. We continue to experience production capacity shortages for Java Monster, which I will address later in the call.
According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada, for the 12 weeks ended January 7, 2017, the energy drink category decreased 5% in dollars, due largely to lower pricing of private label brands. Monster sales increased 1% versus a year ago. Our market share increased 1.8 share points to 7%. Red Bull's sales decreased 2%, and its market share increased 0.9 point to 38.2%. Rockstar's sales increased [ph] 6%, and its market share decreased 0.2 point to 18.7%.
According to Nielsen, all outlets combined in Mexico, the energy drink category grew 23.9% during the month of January 2017. Monster sales increased 22.3%. Our market share in value decreased 0.4 point to 26.8% against the comparable period last year. Sales of Burn decreased 22.7%. Burn's market share decreased 2 points to 3.4%. Red Bull sales decreased 8.9%, and its market share decreased about 4.1 points to 11.4%. Vive 100's market share increased 9.6 points to 37.8%, while Boost's market share decreased 4.8 points to 13.6%.
The transition to the KO bottlers system in August 2016, while initially slow, has since improved, and we are now seeing wider availability of Monster in the traditional trade channel in Mexico. According to Nielsen, Monster's numerical distribution in the traditional trade channel grew from 10% in January 2016 to 24% in January 2017.
The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover a single month, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico.
According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ended December 2016, the actual 13-week periods vary by a few weeks between different markets. Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year grew from 13.5% to 15.4% in Great Britain; from 20.3% to 22.9% in France; from 13.4% to 15.2% in Germany; from 8.7% to 9.5% in Italy; from 8.9% to 12.4% in Ireland; from 7.1% to 10.9% in Norway; and from 8.8% to 12% in the Czech Republic.
In the same period, Monster's market share grew from 10.9% to 11.1% in Sweden; from 8.7% to 10.5% in Belgium; and from 23.8% to 27.2% in Spain.  Monster's retail market share in value for the 13 weeks ending -- ended in December 2016 as compared to the same period last year decreased from 6.7% to 5% in the Netherlands. Monster's retail market share in value for the 13 weeks ending December 2016 grew from 15.8% to 16% in South Africa.
According to IRI, Monster's market share increased in the 13 weeks ended December 2016 from 28.2% to 28.5%. I would like to point out that the Nielsen and IRI numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen and IRI in EMEA vary from country to country. According to Nielsen, Monster's retail market share in value in Chile increased to 26.9% in January 2017 as compared to 19.9% last year, and after just 2 months of the KO bottlers system, Monster's market share in value in Brazil grew to 5% in December 2016 as compared to 3.7% in the same period last year. In South Korea, Monster's retail market share in value increased from 13.3% to 23.7% in December 2016 compared to the same period last year. According to INTAGE, Monster's market share in value in the convenience store channel in Japan grew from 38.6% to 43.3% in December 2016.
According to IRI in Australia, Monster's market share in value grew from 3.1% to 6.3% in December. According to IRI in New Zealand, Monster's market share in value grew from 2.3% to 5.7% for the last 4 weeks ending December 4, 2016, versus the same period last year.
Net sales for the Monster Energy drink segment in the fourth quarter of 2016 increased 17% from $585.1 million to $684.4 million from the comparable period last year. Gross sales for the Monster Energy drink segment for the fourth quarter of 2016 increased 14.3% from $677.7 million to $774.8 million for the comparable period last year. Net sales for the Monster Energy drink segment in the fourth quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $3.2 million of foreign currency movements. In comparison of gross and net sales for the Monster Energy drink segment of $677.7 million and $585.1 million, respectively, for the 2015 fourth quarter were impacted by advance purchases made by the company's customers due to a preannounced price increase effective August 31, 2015, on certain of the company's Monster Energy brand energy drinks. The company estimates that both gross and net sales for the 2015 fourth quarter for the Monster Energy drink segment were reduced by approximately $12 million and $11 million, respectively, as a result of such advance purchases. Gross and net sales for the Monster Energy drink segment for the 2016 fourth quarter, after adjusting the 2015 fourth quarter comparisons for advance purchases, increased by 12.4% and 14.8%, respectively.
Net sales for the Strategic Brand segment were $64.5 million for the fourth quarter as compared to $60.4 million in the same quarter last year. Net sales for the company's Strategic Brand segment were negatively impacted by approximately $0.1 million of foreign currency movements in the quarter.
Net sales for the Other segment, which includes third-party sales made by AFF, were $4.7 million in the 2016 fourth quarter. There were no sales for the Other segment in the comparable 2015 fourth quarter.
We continued to experience production capacity shortages for our retort products, Java Monster and Muscle Monster. We are taking steps to address the issues, including procuring products from Europe, but anticipate that it will still take a number of months before production availability allows us to restore normal supply patterns and fully meet consumer demand that exists for these products. We estimate that sales in the quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $22 million as a result of such production capacity shortages.
Net sales to customers outside of the United States were $193.5 million in the 2016 fourth quarter compared to $145.3 million in the corresponding quarter in 2015. In local currencies, net sales to customers outside of the United States were approximately $3.3 million higher. Included in reported geographic sales are our sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the United States and transshipped [ph] to the military and their customers overseas. In Europe, the Middle East and Africa, net sales in the fourth quarter in local currencies increased 14% and 33% in dollars over the same period last year.
Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales decreased from 53.4% in the same period last year to 52.8% during the quarter. For the full year of 2016, net sales increased 36% in local currencies and 30% in dollars over 2015.
Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales increased from 48.4% in 2015 to 51.1% in '16. Monster continued to gain momentum and increase market share throughout Europe in the fourth quarter. In particular, in Great Britain, Germany, Spain, France, Czech Republic, Ireland, Poland and Norway, Monster achieved increased sales gains as well as increased market share.

Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales decreased from 49.6% in the same period last year to 44.1% during the 2016 fourth quarter. In Japan, net sales in the quarter increased 45.1% or 25.1% in local currency, primarily due to the strengthening of the Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar as compared to the same quarter last year. We continue to experience strong performance in Japan. In South Korea, net sales increased 135.9% or 130.3% in local currency as compared to the same quarter last year.
In Oceana, which includes Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti, French Polynesia, New Caledonia and Guam, net sales increased 3.6%, minus 3.4% in local currencies as compared to the same quarter last year. As previously mentioned, we are moving ahead with plans for local production in India with a view to reentering the market in 2017.
In Latin America, including Mexico and the Caribbean, gross sales in the fourth quarter increased 20.7% in dollars and 23.6% in local currencies. Net sales in the fourth quarter increased 19.7% and 21.8% in local currencies over the same period last year. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales increased from 48.9% in the same period last year to 52.5% during the 2016 fourth quarter. Net sales increased in Brazil 115.3% in dollars or 117.2% in local currency largely due to the transition of Monster to Coca-Cola bottlers, which took place on November 1, 2016. Net sales in Chile increased 148.6% in dollars and 137.7% in local currency.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $377.6 million compared to $2.18 billion at December 31, 2015. Short-term investments were $220.6 million compared to $744.6 million at December 31, 2015. Long-term investments decreased to $2.4 million from $15.3 million at December 31, 2015.
Accounts receivable increased to $448.1 million at December 31, 2016, from $353 million at December 31, 2015. Days outstanding for accounts receivables were 48.2 days compared 43.2 days at December 31, 2015.  Inventories increased to $162 million from $156.1 million at December 31, 2015. Average days of inventory was 57 days at December 31, 2016, compared to 58 days at December 31, 2015.
In September 2016, we launched Mutant, an exciting super soda in limited convenience stores in certain U.S. markets with encouraging sales to the point of distribution. For the 13 weeks ended January 21, 2017, for Nielsen total U.S. convenience, Mutant had the highest dollar share gain of any single-serve sparkling softdrink brand. For single-serve packages sold in convenience stores during the same period in dollars, Mutant outsold a number of well-established single-serve brands such as 7UP. We remain confident about the potential of this brand.
We are planning the launch of our new Hydro line, which is a non-carbonated, lightly sweetened energy drink, is packaged in a unique 16.9-ounce PET can, the size of which is exclusive to us in the U.S. at this time. We are planning to launch Hydro to the retail trade towards the end of March and early April.
Monster Energy Ultra Violet was launched exclusively with Sam's Club and will be expanded to all channels at the end of March 2017. We are also planning to launch Full Throttle orange at the end of March. We have a robust innovation pipeline, and further launches are planned for the remainder of 2017.
We estimate January 2017 gross sales to be approximately 10.4% higher than in January 2016. On a foreign exchange adjusted basis, we estimate January 2017 gross sales to be approximately 11.6% higher than in January 2016. In this regard, we caution again that sales over the short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributing centers as well as shifts in the timing of production, in some instances, where our bottlers are responsible for production and unilaterally determine their production schedules, which affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers. We reiterate that sales average for a period, such as a single month, would not necessarily be intuited to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period.
With regard to the litigation between the company and the San Francisco City Attorney, we advised that the action was settled in January 2017 on terms acceptable to the company. The settlement does not include any penalty under California's Unfair Competition Law any finding or admission of liability or wrongdoing or any change in the formula -- to the formulation of Monster Energy drinks or to whom the drinks may be sold. In consideration of the release of claims and dismissal of the action with prejudice, the company agreed to maintain various current marketing and laboring practices for its energy drink products through December 31, 2018.
On February 28, 2017, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a new repurchase program for the repurchase of up to $500 million of the company's outstanding common stock. No availability remained under the previously authorized share repurchase programs.
In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points. One, as previously reported, our acquisition of AFF represents an important milestone for the company and gives us ownership of our proprietary formulas for our principal products. We recognized the reduction in operating cost of $22 million in the fourth quarter as a result of the acquisition.
Two, North American and international gross margins remain healthy. Three, while the U.S. Nielsen market statistics show that the energy category slowed in the U.S. towards the end of the fourth quarter, equivalent and given the [ph] first quarter equivalent market statistics for many countries around the world show that the energy category is continuing to grow and that Monster is generally growing ahead of the category. Currency exchange rates continue to affect our results. The new additions to the Monster family continue to gain momentum and add to the company's sales.
We're excited about the prospects for our new product launches. We are pleased with our performance in our international markets and reiterate the growth potential for us in China, one of the largest energy drink markets globally. We have successfully transitioned additional international countries to Coca-Cola bottlers in the fourth quarter, and we'll be transitioning a number of other markets to Coca-Cola bottlers in 2017.
I'd like to open the floor to questions about the quarter and the year."

We've positioned Mutant in selected channels at full pricing. We've not been aggressive in our promotion. If you look at the average pricing in Nielsen, Mutant's average pricing in all the different periods, depending which period you look at, is still about $1.96. If you compare that, that's quite a substantial premium to the other softdrinks and its main competitor softdrink that we're looking at competing with, which is Mountain Dew. And so we have strategically not promoted Mutant during the winter period. We are taking steps to deal with expanded distribution. We will obviously increase our promotional and other activities around the brand as we continue to go into spring and summer. So when we look at the numbers and we look at these sales per point, we think the sales per point are pretty good in relation to a lot of the other well-established brands in the area. If you look at the last 4 weeks, that has dropped off a little bit, again, because of the, we believe, the lack of promotional spend and -- behind the brand, but that was intentional in this period of time. It is a soda, and we are looking to, as I said, expand distribution, expand the channels and also become substantially more active in the promotion of the brand as we start going into spring now. So we're still positive about the brand and its prospects and sell-through, particularly where we have seen -- at the substantial price premium, we've seen substantial sales per point that are higher than a lot of very well-established brands that have been around for a long time."

So there are challenges. We also have a group of 10 bottlers. It's a little bit different to Chile. Chile, there were 2 main bottlers that, really, we started to have some pretty -- we really have pretty good momentum for the brand. It was well established. It didn't have a deep distribution, but where it was, it was already selling into the high teens and grew pretty nicely. So when the 2 Coke bottlers in Chile took it over, they really did embrace the brand, and obviously, we're able to -- to sort of more structured market, we're able to expand the market and roll it out probably more quickly and more, I think, efficiently than is the case in Brazil. And so the results have been very good, and we've been very encouraged by the result. In the case of the Brazilian market, it is a much more non-traditional market. You have literally well over 1 million of these little traditional stores all over the place, and they're harder to get to, harder to service. You go -- invariably, there's a very, very large and integrated [ph] wholesaler system that helps get to these stores, and it's just -- you're just not comparing apples and apples. So we've got to manage a group of 10-odd bottlers in a very different environment, country and also that is going through tough financial conditions at the moment. But that being said, we think that it will take some time. But as it has in many of the Coke markets where you do deal with these very big bottlers or, basically, groups of bottlers, it takes time for them to get coordinated and get their system going. But when it does start going, it does really work. It does improve, and it's -- and so we're very encouraged by what we've seen. We're at a point now where we're selling at a rate, which is higher than we've ever sold even when we were with our previous distributor at the peak before we announced the Coke transaction and they tended to lose interest in the brand and stopped putting their efforts behind it because they were also a good distributor. And so we are encouraged by where we're going. But it will take time to build up. The good news is that there -- it's a big energy market. We do quite nicely with Burn there and really, the -- by far, the largest player is Red Bull. That is really our main competitor at a -- and we're at sort of a similar price point, which, for us, means that we will -- gives us a lot of opportunity to grow into that market against the Red Bull share, which is at a premium price and is not at the low end. They do have low-end brands, but at least we know there is a lot of good business to be gone after there. So -- but it's going to take time to develop."

Sales continued to be challenging in the beverage industry in the first quarter and remain weak. In the first quarter, net sales was $742.1 million, up 9.1% from [ $680.2 ] million in the first quarter of 2016. The company achieved record first quarter growth sales of $845.5 million, up 8.8% from $777.5 million in the first quarter of 2016. 
Unfavorable currency exchange rates reduced net sales by approximately $3.7 million in the 2017 first quarter. 
Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the first quarter was [ 64.8% ] as compared to a [ 62.2% ] for the comparable 2016 first quarter. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to cost of goods savings as a result of the AFF Transaction, which was partially offset by product mix and certain increases in other costs. 
Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 3.1% for the 2017 first quarter as compared to 3.4% in the 2016 first quarter. 
Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 11.7% compared to 10.2% in the same quarter a year ago. The increase was primarily due to increased sponsorship and endorsement costs and commissions. 
General and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were 14.4% as compared to 11.1% in the same quarter last year. General and administrative costs, excluding distributed termination expenses as a percentage of net sales, increased to 11.8% in the first quarter of 2017 compared to 10.6% for the 2016 first quarter. 
Payroll expenses were up $13 million, primarily to support the strategic brand that we acquired from Coca-Cola as well as the launches in China and other countries internationally and stock-based compensation, which is a noncash item, was $3.1 million higher. 
Distributed termination expenses were $19.9 million in the first quarter as compared to $3.4 million in the 2016 first quarter. 
Legal expenses related to regulatory matters and litigation concerning the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage, safety and sale of the company's products were $1.9 million in the 2017 first quarter as compared to $5.4 million in the 2016 first quarter. 
Our effective tax rate decreased from 35.8% in the 2016 first quarter to 32.8% in the 2017 first quarter, primarily due to an increase in profits earned by certain foreign subsidiaries in lower tax jurisdictions in the U.S. as well as an increase in equity compensation deductions. 
Net income was $178 million in the 2017 first quarter compared to net income of [ $163.9 ] million in the 2016 first quarter, an increase of 8.6%. 
The weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding decreased from 620.7 million for the first quarter of 2016 to 582 million for the first quarter of 2017 as a result of share buybacks, including the modified Dutch tender auction, which was completed in June 2016. The net income was impacted by the substantial increase in distributed termination expenses previously mentioned above. 
Diluted earnings per share for the 2017 first quarter increased 15.8% to $0.31 per share from $0.26 in the first quarter of 2016. We estimate that distributed termination expenses in the 2017 first quarter of $19.9 million negatively affected diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.02 per share after tax. 
We continue to make good progress in the implementation of our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola bottlers globally. Domestically, we positioned distribution of Monster Energy drinks in Wisconsin to Coca-Cola bottlers in early January 2017 in Boston, Minnesota, including Minneapolis and St. Paul, in March 2017 and in part North Dakota, including [indiscernible] in April, 2017. 
We're also making good progress in the U.S. in nontraditional channels, including food service accounts. 
In EMEA, in the first quarter of 2017, we commenced distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in Nigeria, Oman and smaller cottages in EMEA. And in April 2017, we commenced distribution of Monster with the Coca-Cola bottler in Kazakhstan. 
Further additional launches are planned in the remainder of the second quarter of 2017 in certain countries in Africa and the Middle East. 
In the first quarter of 2017, we launched distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in certain countries in the Caribbean. In the second quarter of 2017, we anticipate the launch in Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in certain other smaller and medium-sized markets in that geographic region. 
In China during the first quarter of 2017, we continued the launches in Shenzhen, [indiscernible], Shandong, Hainan, [indiscernible] and [indiscernible]. We also extended distribution in the [indiscernible] Province. Further launches are planned in China and in other countries, including a relaunch in India in 2017. 
We also commenced distribution in Malaysia in the same period. 
We continue to make progress towards our planned relaunch in India later this year. We are also on track to commence distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in Vietnam, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan in the second quarter. 
As a result of the AFF Transaction, we achieved raw material cost savings of $23.3 million in the 2017 first quarter, which were broadly in line with the expectations. 
According to the Nielsen reports for the 13 weeks through April 22, 2017, all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots, increased by 2.5% versus the same period a year ago. 
Sales of Monster grew 1.8% in the 13-week period while sales of NOS increased 10.6% and sales of Full Throttle decreased 5.1%. 
Sales of Red Bull increased 5.3%. Sales of Rockstar increased by 1.9%. Sales of 5-Hour decreased 6.4%, and sales of AMP decreased 29.9%. 
According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended April 22, 2017, sales in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots in dollars, increased 2.7% over the same period last year. Sales of Monster increased by 1.5% over the same period last year while NOS was up 12.7% and Full Throttle sales decreased 2.1%. Sales of Red Bull increased by 5.8%. Rockstar was up 4.6%. 5-Hour was down 7.2%, and AMP was down 29.9%. 
We point out that the energy shot category has been slowing for some time. And if we exclude the energy shots as well as energy coffee and energy protein drinks where we have experienced production capacity shortages, for the 4 weeks ended April 22, 2017, sales in the convenience and gas channel in dollars, in fact, increased by 4.6% over the same period last year. The sales of Monster increasing by 4.5%. 
We note that the Nielsen reports for the 13 weeks and 4 weeks ended April 22, 2017, exclude sales of NOS and Full Throttle 8 packs, which were not yet in the Nielsen system. 
According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended April  22, 2017, Monster's market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots in dollars, decreased by 0.4 points over the same period last year to 35%. NOS' share increased [ 0.4 ] points to 4.2% and Full Throttle's share remained the same at 1%. Red Bull's share increased 1 point to 36%, Rockstar's share was up point 1 of a point to 8%, 5-Hour's share was lower by 0.8 of a point at 7.4%, and AMP's share decreased 0.6 of a point to 1.2%. 
According to Nielsen, in the 4 weeks ended April 22, 2017, sales of energy plus coffee drinks in dollars in the convenience and gas channel decreased 6.3% over the same period last year. 
Sales of Java Monster were 19.5% lower than in the same period last year while sales of Starbucks Doubleshot Energy were 8.6% higher. 
We continue to experience production capacity shortages with Java Monster, which I will address later in the call. 
According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada, for the 12 weeks ended April 1, 2017, the energy drink category increased 2% in dollars, Monster sales increased 10% versus a year ago. Our market share increased 2.1 share points to 30.5%. Red Bull's sales increased 3%, and its market share decreased 0.4 of a point to 35.9%. Rockstar's sales increased 5% and its market share increased 0.8 points to 19.4%. 
According to Nielsen, for all outlets combined in Mexico, the energy drink category grew 27% during the month of March 2017. Monster sales increased 41.1%. Our market share in value increased 2.7 points to 26.7% against the comparable period last year. Sales of Burn decreased 27%. Burn's market share decreased 2.7 points to 3.7%. Red Bull sales decreased 3.5%, and its market share decreased by 3.7 points to 11.6%. 
Vive 100's market share increased 4.5 points to 41.9% while Boost's market share decreased 2.1 points to 7.9%. 
The transition to the KO bottlers system in August 2016 resulted in significantly wider availability of Monster in the traditional trade channel mom-and-pop stores in Mexico. 
According to Nielsen, distribution of Monster grew from 10% in March 2016 to 24% in March 2017 in this channel. This translates to growth in Monster's value share of 9 percentage points versus March 2016 in the traditional channel. 
The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. 
Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. 
Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. 
I would like to point out that the Nielsen and IRI numbers for EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen and IRI or EMEA vary from country to country. 
According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ending March 2017, the extra 13 weeks period differ vary by few days between different markets.

We continue to experience production capacity shortages for our retort products, Java Monster and Muscle Monster. To reduce the shortfall, we have commenced manufacturing certain flavors of Java Monster in Europe, which will shortly be available to our customers in the U.S. We've also procured additional production in the U.S., which will be coming on stream earlier in the third quarter of 2017 and will result in additional Java Monster and Monster volumes being available for distribution for retailers thereafter. 
As a result, we anticipate that it will still be a number of months before production availability allows us to restore normal supply patterns and fully meet consumer demand that exists for these products. 
We estimate that net sales in the quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $12 million as a result of such production capacity shortages. 
Net sales to customers outside the U.S. were [ $190.9 ] million for the 2017 first quarter compared to $149.1 million in the corresponding quarter in 2016. 
In local currencies, net sales to customers outside of the U.S. were approximately $3.7 million higher.

We are pleased with the rollout of certain SKUs in the outer range in EMEA markets. In 2017, we added additional SKUs of Ultra across EMEA with the introduction of Ultra [indiscernible], which will be available in 10 additional EMEA markets in 2017.

Net sales in the first quarter increased 42.2% in dollars and 41.8% in local currencies over the same period last year. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales increased from 41.1% in the same period last year to 48.8% during the 2017 first quarter. 
Net sales increased in Brazil [ to ] 396.4% in dollars or [ 481.7% ] in local currency, largely due to the transition of Monster to Coca-Cola bottlers, which took place on November 1, 2016. 
Net sales in Chile increased 47.6% in dollars and 59.1% in local currency. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $576.3 million compared to $377.6 million at December 31, 2016. Short-term investments were $209.4 million compared to $220.6 million at December 31, 2016. Long-term investments decreased to $0.5 million from $2.4 million at December 31, 2015. 
Accounts receivable increased to $509.5 million at March 31, 2017, from $448.1 million at December 31, 2016. 
Days outstanding for accounts receivable were 54.9 days compared to 48.2 days at December 31, 2016. 
Inventories increased to $171.3 million from [ $162  ] million at December 31, 2016. Average days of inventory was 59 days at March 31, 2017, compared to 57 days at December 31, 2016.
As previously reported, in September 2016, we launched Mutant, an exciting super soda in limited convenience stores in certain U.S. markets with encouraging sales for point of distribution. We would be launching a line extension of our Mutant brand family, namely [ White Lightning ], a 0 sugar offering, to limit the customers initially followed with a general market launch in July. 
We remain confident about the potential of this brand. 
In preparation for the launch of Hydro, we commenced limited deliveries of Hydro products to our bottlers and full service distributors at the end of the quarter and are planning for the launch of Hydro to the general result trade at the end of this month. Hydro is a noncarbonated lightly sweetened energy drink that is packaged in a unique 16.9-ounce PET can, the size of which is exclusive to us in the U.S. at this time. 
We are planning to launch Hydro in a 550 ML PET bottle in United Kingdom and Ireland during the second quarter of 2017. We expanded distribution of Monster Energy Ultra Violet and launched Full Throttle orange during the first quarter of 2017. 
At the end of April 2017, we launched a new Lewis Hamilton signature Monster Energy drink in Great Britain, which will be followed by launches in 24 European markets in the second quarter of 2017 and in South Africa in July. 
We have a robust innovation pipeline and further launches such as Mango Local, a new flavor in our Monster Energy juice family, which is planned for a third quarter 2017 launch and a new expresso Monster Energy drink in [indiscernible] in 2 flavors planned for launch before year-end. 
April 2017 had 1 fewer selling day compared with April 2016. We estimate April 2017 gross sales to be approximately 9.5% higher than in April 2016. 
On a foreign exchange adjusted basis, we estimate April 2017 gross sales to be approximately 10.6% higher [ than ] in April of 2016. 
In this regard, we caution again that sales have a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week and holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives as well as shifts in the timing of production in some instances with our bottlers are responsible for production, and to determine their production schedules, which affect the dates on which we invoice such bottlers. 
We reiterate that sales over the short period such as a single month should not necessarily be future to regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period. 
On February 28, 2017, the company's Board of Directors authorized a new repurchase program for the repurchase of up to $500 million of the company's outstanding common stock. No shares were repurchased under this repurchase program during the first quarter. 
In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points. We recognized the reduction in raw material costs of $23.3 million in the first quarter as a result of our acquisition of AFF. North America and international gross margins remain healthy. By the U.S. Nielsen market statistics show that the energy drink category slowed in the U.S. towards the end of the 2016 fourth quarter. It appears to have picked up steam through the first quarter. Equivalent market statistics for many countries around the world show that the energy category is continuing to grow and that Monster is generally growing ahead of the category. 
Currency exchange rates continue to affect our results. The new additions to the Monster family continue to gain momentum and add to the company's sales. 
We're excited about the prospects for our new product launches. We are pleased with our performance in our international markets and reiterate the growth potential for us in China, one of the largest energy drink markets globally. 
We have successfully transitioned additional international countries to Coca-Cola bottlers in the first quarter, and we'll be transitioning a number of other markets to Coca-Cola bottlers in 2017. 
I'd like to open the floor to questions about the quarter and the year. Thank you."

I mean, we're getting sales that we're comfortable with, still rates, but they vary from area to area depending on the execution of the bottler, depending on the positioning in the stores and basically pricing and point-of-sale. So we think that it's certainly going to take time to continue -- you can't just put stuff -- a brand like Monster, which is not known on the shelf and expected to immediately start achieving velocities that are -- where you'd like it to be. There is a buildup, and we're going to go through this buildup over appeared of time. So really -- it really is premature. We're comparable with the velocities. We're getting in the volumes. We're comfortable with the attention and focus. We're putting a lot of effort that it. We're building up our own infrastructure and team there to support the brand, support sampling and in-store execution. And we are seeing good execution from point-of-sale and the things of that nature. And we are quite happy with it. But really, it's just premature to talk. But we are comfortable with the markets. It is a large market, and it will continue. We are right in the middle the rollout, as we've indicated, where there were a whole new number of regions we've introduced this probably late probably Chinese New Year with late February into March. We are planning launches, we planned launches, and we have launched throughout April, and we're continuing May. And then pretty much most of it will be done, so there will be a few more areas to do in June and July. But pretty much, we think it'll be pretty much done by then. There may be 1 or 2 hiccups that we don't anticipate at this point, but it will take time. And it's just a very big market, and you're going to be patient with and build slowly."

If you take the Nielsen numbers and then factor in the negative effect on the production issues we've had and there've really been sort of more identified by -- we've tried to keep the 2 main SKUs in production on the shelf, but really, what it does -- what it's done is that most of the other SKUs have been out of production and off-the-shelf. And that has continued. So you've got to really take that into account in looking at the growth of the industry and the growth of Monster in the U.S. We did sort of have probably less innovation hitting in this period than we had last year sort of the reverse for Red Bull. But again, we've got to -- we've explained on a number of occasions what our innovation is for this year and how it's going to come in later in the year because of timing. So we really think that you guys are going to make your own adjustment call on how you look at the U.S. and the growth. We don't give guidance on the growth, either to U.S. or on a broader basis. But we feel pretty comfortable about the industry. We are seeing growth if you look at the Nielsen numbers, and that's what I was referring to earlier, it was down to almost a negative inconvenience in December, and then it's grown just under a percent in January. It was 1.5% or so roughly. In February, it was 2.5% in -- or 2.6% in March, and it's actually gone up a little higher in April. So clearly, there's a nice trend. But you can see the numbers as well as we can, and we think that, that is positive going forward."

Sales continue to be challenging in the beverage industry in the first quarter and remain weak. In the first quarter, net sales was $742.1 million, up 9.1% from $680.2 million in the first quarter of 2016. The company achieved record first quarter gross sales of $845.5 million, up 8.8% from $777.5 million in the first quarter of 2016. Unfavorable currency exchange rates reduced net sales by approximately $3.7 million in the 2017 first quarter.
Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the first quarter was 64.8% as compared to 62.2% for the comparable 2016 first quarter. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to cost of goods savings as a result of the AFF Transaction, which was partially offset by product mix and certain increases in other costs.
Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 3.1% for the 2017 first quarter as compared to 3.4% in the 2016 first quarter. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 11.7% compared to 10.2% in the same quarter a year ago. The increase was primarily due to increased sponsorship and endorsement costs and commissions.
General and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were 14.4% as compared to 11.1% in the same quarter last year. General and administrative costs, excluding distributed termination expenses as a percentage of net sales, increased to 11.8% in the first quarter of 2017 compared to 10.6% for the 2016 first quarter.
Payroll expenses were up $13 million, primarily to support the strategic brand that we acquired from Coca-Cola as well as the launches in China and other countries internationally and stock-based compensation, which is a noncash item, was $3.1 million higher. Distributed termination expenses were $19.9 million in the first quarter as compared to $3.4 million in the 2016 first quarter.
Legal expenses related to regulatory matters and litigation concerning the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage, safety and sale of the company's product were $1.9 million in the 2017 first quarter as compared to $5.4 million in the 2016 first quarter.
Our effective tax rate decreased from 35.8% in the 2016 first quarter to 32.8% in the 2017 first quarter, primarily due to an increase in profits earned by certain foreign subsidiaries in lower tax jurisdictions there in the U.S. as well as an increase in equity compensation deductions.
Net income was $178 million in the 2017 first quarter compared to net income of $163.9 million in the 2016 first quarter, an increase of 8.6%.
The weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding decreased from 620.7 million for the first quarter of 2016 to 582 million for the first quarter of 2017 as a result of share buybacks, including the modified Dutch tender auction, which was completed in June 2016. The net income was impacted by the substantial increase in distributed termination expenses previously mentioned above.
Diluted earnings per share for the 2017 first quarter increased 15.8% to $0.31 per share from $0.26 in the first quarter of 2016. We estimate that distributed termination expenses in the 2017 first quarter of $19.9 million negatively affected diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.02 per share after tax.
We continue to make good progress in the implementation of our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola bottlers globally. Domestically, we transitioned distribution of Monster Energy drinks in Wisconsin to Coca-Cola bottlers in early January 2017, in parts of Minnesota, including Minneapolis and St. Paul, in March 2017 and in a part of North Dakota, including Fargo in April 2017. We're also making good progress in the U.S. in nontraditional channels, including food service accounts.
In EMEA, in the first quarter of 2017, we commenced distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in Nigeria, Oman and then -- and smaller countries in EMEA. And in April 2017, we commenced distribution of Monster with the Coca-Cola bottler in Kazakhstan. Further additional launches are planned in the remainder of the second quarter of 2017 in certain countries in Africa and the Middle East.
In the first quarter of 2017, we launched distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in certain countries in the Caribbean. In the second quarter of 2017, we anticipate launching Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in certain other smaller and medium-sized markets in that geographic region.
In China during the first quarter of 2017, we continued with launches in Tianjin, Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Anhui, Zhejiang and Jiangsu. We also extended distribution in the Guangdong province. Further launches are planned in China and in other countries, including a relaunch in India in 2017. We also commenced distribution in Malaysia in the same period. We continue to make progress towards our planned relaunch in India later this year. We are also on track to commence distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in Vietnam, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan in the second quarter.
As a result of the AFF Transaction, we achieved raw material cost savings of $23.3 million in the 2017 first quarter, which were broadly in line with the expectations.
According to the Nielsen reports, for the 13 weeks through April 22, 2017, all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots, increased by 2.5% versus the same period a year ago. Sales of Monster grew 1.8% in the 13-week period, while sales of NOS increased 10.6% and sales of Full Throttle decreased 5.1%. Sales of Red Bull increased 5.3%. Sales of Rockstar increased by 1.9%. Sales of 5-Hour decreased 6.4%. And sales of AMP decreased 29.9%.
According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended April 22, 2017, sales in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots in dollars, increased 2.7% over the same period last year. Sales of Monster increased by 1.5% over the same period last year, while NOS was up 12.7% and Full Throttle sales decreased 2.1%. Sales of Red Bull increased by 5.8%, Rockstar was up 4.6%, 5-Hour was down 7.2% and AMP was down 29.9%.
We point out that the energy shot category has been slowing for some time. And if we exclude the energy shots as well as energy coffee and energy protein drinks, where we have experienced production capacity shortages, for the 4 weeks ended April 22, 2017, sales in the convenience and gas channel in dollars, in fact, increased by 4.6% over the same period last year. The sales of Monster increasing by 4.5%.
We note that the Nielsen reports for the 13 weeks and 4 weeks ended April 22, 2017, exclude sales of NOS and Full Throttle 8 packs, which were not yet in the Nielsen system.
According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended April  22, 2017, Monster's market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots in dollars, decreased by 0.4 points over the same period last year to 35%. NOS' share increased 0.4 points to 4.2% and Full Throttle's share remained the same at 1%. Red Bull's share increased 1 point to 36%, Rockstar's share was up 0.1 of a point to 8%, 5-Hour's share was lower by 0.8 of a point at 7.4% and AMP's share decreased 0.6 of a point to 1.2%.
According to Nielsen, in the 4 weeks ended April 22, 2017, sales of Energy + Coffee Drinks in dollars in the convenience and gas channel decreased 6.3% over the same period last year. Sales of Java Monster were 19.5% lower than in the same period last year, while sales of Starbucks Doubleshot Energy were 8.6% higher. We continue to experience production capacity shortages with Java Monster, which I will address later in the call.
According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada, for the 12 weeks ended April 1, 2017, the energy drink category increased 2% in dollars. Monster sales increased 10% versus a year ago. Our market share increased 2.1 share points to 30.5%. Red Bull's sales increased 3%, and its market share decreased 0.4 of a point to 35.9%. Rockstar's sales increased 5% and its market share increased 0.8 points to 19.4%.
According to Nielsen, for all outlets combined in Mexico, the energy drink category grew 27% during the month of March 2017. Monster sales increased 41.1%. Our market share in value increased 2.7 points to 26.7% against the comparable period last year. Sales of Burn decreased 27%. Burn's market share decreased 2.7 points to 3.7%. Red Bull sales decreased 3.5%, and its market share decreased by 3.7 points to 11.6%.
Vive 100's market share increased 4.5 points to 41.9%, while Boost's market share decreased 2.1 points to 7.9%. The transition to the KO bottler system in August 2016 resulted in significantly wider availability of Monster in the traditional trade channel, mom-and-pop stores in Mexico.
According to Nielsen, distribution of Monster grew from 10% in March 2016 to 24% in March 2017 in this channel. This translates to growth in Monster's value share of 9 percentage points versus March 2016 in the traditional channel.
The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico.
I would like to point out that the Nielsen and IRI numbers for EMEA should only be used as a guide, because the channels read by Nielsen and IRI or EMEA vary from country to country.
According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ending March 2017, the extra 13-week periods differ -- vary by few days between different markets. Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year grew from 13% to 15.5% in Great Britain; from 9.5% to 10.6% in Belgium; from 9.1% to 11.6% in Norway; from 21.5% to 23.7% in France; from 24.4% to 26.5% in Spain; and from 13% to 16.3% in Germany.

Net sales for the Monster Energy drink segment in -- for the first quarter of 2017 increased 7.5% from $621.7 million to $668.6 million from the comparable period last year. Gross sales for the Monster Energy drink segment for the first quarter of 2017 increased 7.4% from $713.5 million to $766.6 million for the comparable period last year. Net sales for the Monster Energy drink segment in the first quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $4.7 million of foreign currency movements.
Net sales for the Strategic Brand segment was $68 million for the first quarter as compared to $58.5 million in the same quarter last year. Net sales for the company's Strategic Brand segment were positively impacted by approximately $1 million of foreign currency movements in the quarter.
Net sales for the Other segment, which includes third-party sales made by AFF, were $5.5 million in the 2017 first quarter. There were no sales for the Other segment in the comparable 2016 first quarter.
We continue to experience production capacity shortages for our retort products, Java Monster and Muscle Monster. To reduce the shortfall, we have commenced manufacturing certain flavors of Java Monster in Europe, which will shortly be available to our customers in the U.S. We have also procured additional production in the U.S., which will be coming on stream earlier in the third quarter of 2017 and will result in additional Java Monster and Muscle Monster volumes being available for distribution to retailers thereafter. 
As a result, we anticipate that it will still be a number of months before production availability allows us to restore normal supply patterns and fully meet consumer demand that exists for these products. We estimate that net sales in the quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $12 million as a result of such production capacity shortages.
Net sales to customers outside the U.S. were $190.9 million for the 2017 first quarter compared to $149.1 million in the corresponding quarter in 2016. In local currencies, net sales to customers outside of the U.S. were approximately $3.7 million higher.   Included in reported geographic sales are our sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the U.S. and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas.
In Europe, the Middle East and Africa, net sales in the first quarter increased 17.7% in dollars and 21.7% in local currencies over the same period last year. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales increased from 50.2% in the same period last year to 50.3% during the quarter.
We are pleased with the rollout of certain SKUs in the outer range in EMEA markets. In 2017, we added additional SKUs of Ultra across EMEA with the introduction of Ultra Citron, which will be available in 10 additional EMEA markets in 2017. 
Various SKUs in the Ultra range are now sold in 33 EMEA markets.
We are also pleased that Monster continued to perform well and gained market share in Great Britain, Germany, France, Spain, Norway, Denmark, Poland, Ireland, Italy and the Czech Republic. 
In Asia Pacific, net sales for the first quarter increased 58.1% in dollars and 60.5% in local currencies over the same period last year. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales increased from 45.2% in the same period last year to 47.7% during the 2017 first quarter.

In Oceana, which includes Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti, French Polynesia, New Caledonia and Guam, net sales increased 44.7% or 50% in local currencies as compared to the same quarter last year.
 
As previously mentioned, we are moving ahead with plans for local production in India with a view towards reentering the market in 2017. 
In Latin America, including Mexico and the Caribbean, gross sales in the first quarter increased 36.2% in dollars and 34.9% in local currencies. Net sales in the first quarter increased 42.2% in dollars and 41.8% in local currencies over the same period last year. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales increased from 41.1% in the same period last year to 48.8% during the 2017 first quarter.

Net sales in Chile increased 47.6% in dollars and 59.1% in local currency.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $576.3 million compared to $377.6 million at December 31, 2016. Short-term investments were $209.4 million compared to $220.6 million at December 31, 2016. Long-term investments decreased to $0.5 million from $2.4 million at December 31, 2016.
Accounts receivable increased to $509.5 million at March 31, 2017, from $448.1 million at December 31, 2016. Days outstanding for accounts receivable were 54.9 days compared to 48.2 days at December 31, 2016. 
Inventories increased to $171.3 million from $162  million at December 31, 2016. Average days of inventory was 59 days at March 31, 2017, compared to 57 days at December 31, 2016.
As previously reported, in September 2016, we launched Mutant, an exciting super soda in limited convenience stores in certain U.S. markets with encouraging sales for point of distribution. We will be launching a line extension of our Mutant brand family, namely WHITE LIGHTNING, 0 sugar offering, to limited customers initially followed with a general market launch in July. We remain confident about the potential of this brand.
In preparation for the launch of Hydro, we commenced limited deliveries of Hydro products to our bottlers and full service distributors at the end of the quarter and are planning for the launch of Hydro to the general retail trade at the end of this month. Hydro is a noncarbonated lightly sweetened energy drink that is packaged in a unique 16.9-ounce PET can, the size of which is exclusive to us in the U.S. at this time. 
We are planning to launch Hydro in a 550 ML PET bottle in United Kingdom and Ireland during the second quarter of 2017. We expanded distribution of Monster Energy Ultra Violet and launched Full Throttle orange during the first quarter of 2017.
At the end of April 2017, we launched a new Lewis Hamilton signature Monster Energy drink in Great Britain, which will be followed by launches in 24 European markets in the second quarter of 2017 and in South Africa in July.
We have a robust innovation pipeline and further launches such as Manga [indiscernible], a new flavor in our Monster Energy juice family, which is planned for a third quarter 2017 launch and the new expresso Monster Energy drink in 8-ounce slim cans in 2 flavors planned for launch before year-end.
April 2017 had 1 fewer selling day compared with April 2016. We estimate April 2017 gross sales to be approximately 9.5% higher than in April 2016. On a foreign exchange adjusted basis, we estimate April 2017 gross sales to be approximately 10.6% higher than in April of 2016. 
In this regard, we caution again that sales have a short period, are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives as well as shifts in the timing of production in some instances where our bottlers are responsible for production and unilaterally determine their production schedules, which affect the dates on which we invoice such bottlers. 
We reiterate that sales over the short period such as a single month should not necessarily be in future to regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period.
On February 28, 2017, the company's Board of Directors authorized a new repurchase program for the repurchase of up to $500 million of the company's outstanding common stock. No shares were repurchased under this repurchase program during the first quarter. 
In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points. We recognized the reduction in raw material costs of $23.3 million in the first quarter as a result of our acquisition of AFF. North America and international gross margins remain healthy. While the U.S. Nielsen market statistics show that the energy drink category slowed in the U.S. towards the end of the 2016 fourth quarter, it appears to have picked up steam through the first quarter. Equivalent market statistics for many countries around the world show that the energy category is continuing to grow and that Monster is generally growing ahead of the category.
Currency exchange rates continue to affect our results. The new additions to the Monster family continue to gain momentum and add to the company's sales.
We're excited about the prospects for our new product launches. We are pleased with our performance in our international markets and reiterate the growth potential for us in China, one of the largest energy drink markets globally.
We have successfully transitioned additional international countries to Coca-Cola bottlers in the first quarter, and we'll be transitioning a number of other markets to Coca-Cola bottlers in 2017.
I'd like to open the floor to questions about the quarter and the year. Thank you."

I mean, we're getting sales that we are comfortable with, sell rates, but they vary from area to area depending on the execution of the bottler, depending on the positioning in the stores and basically pricing and point-of-sale. So we think that it's certainly going to take time to continue. You can't just put stuff -- a brand like Monster, which is not known on the shelf and expected to immediately start achieving velocities that are -- where you would like it to be. There is a buildup, and we're going to go through this buildup over a period of time. So really -- it really is premature. We're comfortable with the velocities we're getting and the volumes. We're comfortable with the attention and focus. We're putting a lot of effort behind it. We're building up our own infrastructure and team there to support the brand, support sampling and in-store execution. And we are seeing good execution from a point of view about point-of-sale and things of that nature. And we are quite happy with it. But really, it's just premature to talk. But -- we are comfortable with the market. It is a large market, and it will continue. We are right in the middle the rollout. As we've indicated, with the whole new number of regions, we introduced probably late because of the Chinese New Year was late February into March. We are planning launches. We plan launches, and we have launched throughout April, and we're continuing in May. And then pretty much most of it will be done, so there will be a few more areas to do in June and July. But pretty much -- we think it will be pretty much done by then. There may be 1 or 2 hiccups that we don't anticipate at this point, but it will take time. And it's just a very big market that you got to be patient with and just build slowly."

If you take the Nielsen numbers and then factor in the negative effect on the production issues we've had -- and they've really been sort of more identified by -- we've tried to keep the 2 main SKUs in production on the shelf, but really what it does -- what it's done is that most of the other SKUs have been out of production and off the shelf. And that has continued. So you've got to really take that into account in looking at the growth of the industry and the growth of Monster in the U.S. We did sort of have probably less innovation hitting in this period than we had last year through sort of the reverse for Red Bull. But again, we've got -- we've explained on a number of occasions what our innovation is for this year and how it's going to come in later in the year because of timing. So we really think that you guys are going to make your own judgment call on how you look at the U.S. and the growth. We don't give guidance on the growth, either in the -- to U.S. or on a broader basis. But we feel pretty comfortable about the industry. We are seeing growth. If you look at the Nielsen numbers, and that's what I was referring to earlier. It was down to almost negative in convenience in December, and then it's grown just under a percent in January. It was 1.5% or so roughly. In February, it was 2.5% in -- or 2.6% in March, and it's actually gone up a little higher in April. So clearly, there is a nice trend. But -- you can see the numbers as well as we can, and we think that, that is positive going forward."

So we will be -- have launched by July through the different BUs. There is obviously no instantaneous, miraculous listing on all the shelves. We're going to continue to build, because particularly in China there is a modern trade, which is easier and that -- obviously, you pick up listings on that more -- much more quickly. But the very, very bulk -- large bulk of the business is still traditional trade, and that means it's got to be built up store by store slowly, one by one. So that is going to still take time to get that penetration up, and that is going to be a slow build, as we continue to build, as we continue to gain momentum, as we hopefully increase our velocity, we'll also be increasing our exposure and distribution through the whole system.

We're going to do in-store price promotions. We're doing sampling, extensive sampling promotions as well for Mutant. And that's all starting to kick in now, starting in May and June, the promotions. And as I said, the sampling activities. We also indicated that we had started in certain -- with certain limited retailers. We're actually starting some distribution of basically our new 0-calorie WHITE LIGHTNING Mutant drink, which will then give us a better positioning on shelf and give us alternative offerings, full calorie, and sugar and 0. And that will be probably in the general market by beginning of July. So those two things together, we believe was a much broader rollout now. We've opened the market.

Sales continue to be challenging in the beverage industry in the first quarter and remain weak. In the first quarter, net sales was $742.1 million, up 9.1% from $680.2 million in the first quarter of 2016. The company achieved record first quarter gross sales of $845.5 million, up 8.8% from $777.5 million in the first quarter of 2016. Unfavorable currency exchange rates reduced net sales by approximately $3.7 million in the 2017 first quarter.
Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the first quarter was 64.8% as compared to 62.2% for the comparable 2016 first quarter. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to cost of goods savings as a result of the AFF Transaction, which was partially offset by product mix and certain increases in other costs.
Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 3.1% for the 2017 first quarter as compared to 3.4% in the 2016 first quarter. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 11.7% compared to 10.2% in the same quarter a year ago. The increase was primarily due to increased sponsorship and endorsement costs and commissions.
General and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were 14.4% as compared to 11.1% in the same quarter last year. General and administrative costs, excluding distributed termination expenses as a percentage of net sales, increased to 11.8% in the first quarter of 2017 compared to 10.6% for the 2016 first quarter.
Payroll expenses were up $13 million, primarily to support the strategic brands that we acquired from Coca-Cola as well as the launches in China and other countries internationally and stock-based compensation, which is a noncash item, was $3.1 million higher. Distributor termination expenses were $19.9 million in the first quarter as compared to $3.4 million in the 2016 first quarter.
Legal expenses related to regulatory matters and litigation concerning the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage, safety and sale of the company's product were $1.9 million in the 2017 first quarter as compared to $5.4 million in the 2016 first quarter.
Our effective tax rate decreased from 35.8% in the 2016 first quarter to 32.8% in the 2017 first quarter, primarily due to an increase in profits earned by certain foreign subsidiaries in lower tax jurisdictions than the U.S. as well as an increase in equity compensation deductions.
Net income was $178 million in the 2017 first quarter compared to net income of $163.9 million in the 2016 first quarter, an increase of 8.6%.
The weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding decreased from 620.7 million for the first quarter of 2016 to 582 million for the first quarter of 2017 as a result of share buybacks, including the modified Dutch tender auction, which was completed in June 2016. The net income was impacted by the substantial increase in distributor termination expenses previously mentioned above.
Diluted earnings per share for the 2017 first quarter increased 15.8% to $0.31 per share from $0.26 in the first quarter of 2016. We estimate that distributed termination expenses in the 2017 first quarter of $19.9 million negatively affected diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.02 per share after tax.
We continue to make good progress in the implementation of our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola bottlers globally. Domestically, we transitioned distribution of Monster Energy drinks in Wisconsin to Coca-Cola bottlers in early January 2017; in parts of Minnesota, including Minneapolis and St. Paul, in March 2017; and in a part of North Dakota, including Fargo, in April 2017. We're also making good progress in the U.S. in nontraditional channels, including food service accounts.
In EMEA, in the first quarter of 2017, we commenced distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in Nigeria, Oman and then -- and smaller countries in EMEA. And in April 2017, we commenced distribution of Monster with the Coca-Cola bottler in Kazakhstan. Further additional launches are planned in the remainder of the second quarter of 2017 in certain countries in Africa and the Middle East.
In the first quarter of 2017, we launched distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in certain countries in the Caribbean. In the second quarter of 2017, we anticipate launching Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in certain other smaller and medium-sized markets in that geographic region.
In China during the first quarter of 2017, we continued with launches in Tianjin, Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Anhui, Zhejiang and Jiangsu. We also extended distribution in the Guangdong province. Further launches are planned in China and in other countries, including a relaunch in India in 2017. We also commenced distribution in Malaysia in the same period. We continue to make progress towards our planned relaunch in India later this year. We are also on track to commence distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in Vietnam, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan in the second quarter.
As a result of the AFF Transaction, we achieved raw material cost savings of $23.3 million in the 2017 first quarter, which were broadly in line with expectations.
According to the Nielsen reports, for the 13 weeks through April 22, 2017, all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots, increased by 2.5% versus the same period a year ago. Sales of Monster grew 1.8% in the 13-week period, while sales of NOS increased 10.6% and sales of Full Throttle decreased 5.1%. Sales of Red Bull increased 5.3%. Sales of Rockstar increased by 1.9%. Sales of 5-Hour decreased 6.4%. And sales of AMP decreased 29.9%.
According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended April 22, 2017, sales in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots, in dollars, increased 2.7% over the same period last year. Sales of Monster increased by 1.5% over the same period last year, while NOS was up 12.7% and Full Throttle sales decreased 2.1%. Sales of Red Bull increased by 5.8%, Rockstar was up 4.6%, 5-Hour was down 7.2% and AMP was down 29.9%.
We point out that the energy shot category has been slowing for some time. And if we exclude the energy shots as well as energy coffee and energy protein drinks, where we have experienced production capacity shortages, for the 4 weeks ended April 22, 2017, sales in the convenience and gas channel in dollars, in fact, increased by 4.6% over the same period last year, with sales of Monster increasing by 4.5%.
We note that the Nielsen reports for the 13 weeks and 4 weeks ended April 22, 2017, exclude sales of NOS and Full Throttle 8 packs, which were not yet in the Nielsen system.
According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended April  22, 2017, Monster's market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots in dollars, decreased by 0.4 points over the same period last year to 35%. NOS' share increased 0.4 points to 4.2% and Full Throttle's share remained the same at 1%. Red Bull's share increased 1 point to 36%, Rockstar's share was up 0.1 of a point to 8%, 5-Hour's share was lower by 0.8 of a point at 7.4% and AMP's share decreased 0.6 of a point to 1.2%.
According to Nielsen, in the 4 weeks ended April 22, 2017, sales of Energy + Coffee Drinks in dollars in the convenience and gas channel decreased 6.3% over the same period last year. Sales of Java Monster were 19.5% lower than in the same period last year, while sales of Starbucks Doubleshot Energy were 8.6% higher. We continue to experience production capacity shortages with Java Monster, which I will address later in the call.
According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada, for the 12 weeks ended April 1, 2017, the energy drink category increased 2% in dollars. Monster sales increased 10% versus a year ago. Our market share increased 2.1 share points to 30.5%. Red Bull's sales increased 3%, and its market share decreased 0.4 of a point to 35.9%. Rockstar's sales increased 5% and its market share increased 0.8 points to 19.4%.
According to Nielsen, for all outlets combined in Mexico, the energy drink category grew 27% during the month of March 2017. Monster sales increased 41.1%. Our market share in value increased 2.7 points to 26.7% against the comparable period last year. Sales of Burn decreased 27%. Burn's market share decreased 2.7 points to 3.7%. Red Bull sales decreased 3.5%, and its market share decreased by 3.7 points to 11.6%.
Vive 100's market share increased 4.5 points to 41.9%, while Boost's market share decreased 2.1 points to 7.9%. The transition to the KO bottler system in August 2016 resulted in significantly wider availability of Monster in the traditional trade channel, mom-and-pop stores in Mexico.
According to Nielsen, distribution of Monster grew from 10% in March 2016 to 24% in March 2017 in this channel. This translates to growth in Monster's value share of 9 percentage points versus March 2016 in the traditional channel.
The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico.
I would like to point out that the Nielsen and IRI numbers for EMEA should only be used as a guide, because the channels read by Nielsen and IRI for EMEA vary from country to country.
According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ending March 2017, the actual 13-week periods differ -- vary by a few days between different markets.

Net sales for the Monster Energy drink segment in -- for the first quarter of 2017 increased 7.5% from $621.7 million to $668.6 million from the comparable period last year. Gross sales for the Monster Energy drink segment for the first quarter of 2017 increased 7.4% from $713.5 million to $766.6 million for the comparable period last year. Net sales for the Monster Energy drink segment in the first quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $4.7 million of foreign currency movements.
Net sales for the Strategic Brand segment was $68 million for the first quarter as compared to $58.5 million in the same quarter last year. Net sales for the company's Strategic Brand segment were positively impacted by approximately $1 million of foreign currency movements in the quarter.
Net sales for the Other segment, which includes third-party sales made by AFF, were $5.5 million in the 2017 first quarter. There were no sales for the Other segment in the comparable 2016 first quarter.
We continue to experience production capacity shortages for our retort products, Java Monster and Muscle Monster. To reduce the shortfall, we have commenced manufacturing certain flavors of Java Monster in Europe, which will shortly be available to our customers in the U.S. We have also procured additional production in the U.S., which will be coming on stream early in the third quarter of 2017 and will result in additional Java Monster and Muscle Monster volumes being available for distribution to retailers thereafter. 
As a result, we anticipate that it will still be a number of months before production availability allows us to restore normal supply patterns and fully meet consumer demand that exists for these products. We estimate that net sales in the quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $12 million as a result of such production capacity shortages.
Net sales to customers outside the U.S. were $190.9 million for the 2017 first quarter compared to $149.1 million in the corresponding quarter in 2016. In local currencies, net sales to customers outside of the U.S. were approximately $3.7 million higher.   Included in reported geographic sales are our sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the U.S. and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas.
In Europe, the Middle East and Africa, net sales in the first quarter increased 17.7% in dollars and 21.7% in local currencies over the same period last year. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales increased from 50.2% in the same period last year to 50.3% during the quarter.
We are pleased with the rollout of certain SKUs in the Ultra range in EMEA markets. In 2017, we added additional SKUs of Ultra across EMEA with the introduction of Ultra Citron, which will be available in 10 additional EMEA markets in 2017. 
Various SKUs in the Ultra range are now sold in 33 EMEA markets.
We are also pleased that Monster continued to perform well and gained market share in Great Britain, Germany, France, Spain, Norway, Denmark, Poland, Ireland, Italy and the Czech Republic. 
In Asia Pacific, net sales in the first quarter increased 58.1% in dollars and 60.5% in local currencies over the same period last year. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales increased from 45.2% in the same period last year to 47.7% during the 2017 first quarter.

In South Korea, net sales increased 15% or 18.2% in local currency as compared to the same quarter last year.
In Oceana, which includes Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti, French Polynesia, New Caledonia and Guam, net sales increased 44.7% or 50% in local currencies as compared to the same quarter last year.
 
As previously mentioned, we are moving ahead with plans for local production in India with a view towards reentering the market in 2017. 
In Latin America, including Mexico and the Caribbean, gross sales in the first quarter increased 36.2% in dollars and 34.9% in local currencies. Net sales in the first quarter increased 42.2% in dollars and 41.8% in local currencies over the same period last year. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales increased from 41.1% in the same period last year to 48.8% during the 2017 first quarter.
Net sales increased in Brazil 396.4% in dollars or 481.7% in local currency, largely due to the transition of Monster to Coca-Cola bottlers, which took place on November 1, 2016.
Net sales in Chile increased 47.6% in dollars and 59.1% in local currency.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $576.3 million compared to $377.6 million at December 31, 2016. Short-term investments were $209.4 million compared to $220.6 million at December 31, 2016. Long-term investments decreased to $0.5 million from $2.4 million at December 31, 2016.
Accounts receivable increased to $509.5 million at March 31, 2017, from $448.1 million at December 31, 2016. Days outstanding for accounts receivable were 54.9 days compared to 48.2 days at December 31, 2016. 
Inventories increased to $171.3 million from $162  million at December 31, 2016. Average days of inventory was 59 days at March 31, 2017, compared to 57 days at December 31, 2016.
As previously reported, in September 2016, we launched Mutant, an exciting super soda in limited convenience stores in certain U.S. markets with encouraging sales per point of distribution. We will be launching a line extension of our Mutant brand family, namely WHITE LIGHTNING, 0 sugar offering, to limited customers initially, followed with a general market launch in July. We remain confident about the potential of this brand.
In preparation for the launch of Hydro, we commenced limited deliveries of Hydro products to our bottlers and full service distributors at the end of the quarter and are planning for the launch of Hydro to the general retail trade at the end of this month. Hydro is a noncarbonated lightly sweetened energy drink that is packaged in a unique 16.9-ounce PET can, the size of which is exclusive to us in the U.S. at this time. 
We are planning to launch Hydro in a 550 ml PET bottle in the United Kingdom and Ireland during the second quarter of 2017. We expanded distribution of Monster Energy Ultra Violet and launched Full Throttle Orange during the first quarter of 2017.
At the end of April 2017, we launched a new Lewis Hamilton signature Monster Energy drink in Great Britain, which will be followed by launches in 24 European markets in the second quarter of 2017 and in South Africa in July.
We have a robust innovation pipeline and further launches such as  [ Mango Loca ], a new flavor in our Monster Energy juice family, which is planned for a third quarter 2017 launch and the new X-Presso Monster Energy drink in 8-ounce slim cans in 2 flavors planned for launch before year-end.
April 2017 had 1 fewer selling day compared with April 2016. We estimate April 2017 gross sales to be approximately 9.5% higher than in April 2016. On a foreign exchange adjusted basis, we estimate April 2017 gross sales to be approximately 10.6% higher than in April 2016. 
In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week on which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives as well as shifts in the timing of production in some instances where our bottlers are responsible for production and unilaterally determine their production schedules, which affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers. 
We reiterate that sales over the short period such as a single month should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period.
On February 28, 2017, the company's Board of Directors authorized a new repurchase program for the repurchase of up to $500 million of the company's outstanding common stock. No shares were repurchased under this repurchase program during the first quarter. 
In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points. We recognized the reduction in raw material costs of $23.3 million in the first quarter as a result of our acquisition of AFF. North American and international gross margins remain healthy. While the U.S. Nielsen market statistics show that the energy drink category slowed in the U.S. towards the end of the 2016 fourth quarter, it appears to have picked up steam through the first quarter. Equivalent market statistics for many countries around the world show that the energy category is continuing to grow and that Monster is generally growing ahead of the category.
Currency exchange rates continue to affect our results. The new additions to the Monster family continue to gain momentum and add to the company's sales.
We're excited about the prospects for our new product launches. We are pleased with our performance in our international markets and reiterate the growth potential for us in China, one of the largest energy drink markets globally.
We have successfully transitioned additional international countries to Coca-Cola bottlers in the first quarter and will be transitioning a number of other markets to Coca-Cola bottlers in 2017.
I'd like to open the floor to questions about the quarter and the year. Thank you."

I mean, we're getting sales that we are comfortable with, sell rates, but they vary from area to area depending on the execution of the bottler, depending on the positioning in the stores and basically pricing and point-of-sale. So we think that it's certainly going to take time to continue. You can't just put stuff -- a brand like Monster, which is not known on the shelf and expect it to immediately start achieving velocities that are -- where you'd would like it to be. There is a buildup, and we're going to go through this buildup over a period of time. So really -- it really is premature. We're comfortable with the velocities we're getting and the volumes. We're comfortable with the attention and focus. We're putting a lot of effort behind it. We're building up our own infrastructure and team there to support the brand, support sampling and in-store execution. And we are seeing good execution from the point of view of our point-of-sale and things of that nature. And we are quite happy with that. But really, it's just premature to talk. But -- we are comfortable with the market. It is a large market, and it will continue. We are right in the middle the rollouts. As we've indicated, where there were a whole new number of regions we introduced, probably late because of the Chinese New Year was late February into March. We are planning launches. We plan launches, and we have launched throughout April, and we're continuing May. And then pretty much most of it will be done, so there will be a few more areas to do in June and July. But pretty much -- we think it will be pretty much done by then. There may be 1 or 2 hiccups that we don't anticipate at this point, but it will take time. And it's just a very big market that you got to be patient with and just build slowly."

So you've got to really take that into account in looking at the growth of the industry and the growth of Monster in the U.S. We did sort of have probably less innovation hitting in this period than we had last year. It's sort of the reverse for Red Bull. But again, we've got and -- we've explained on a number of occasions what our innovation is for this year and how it's going to come in later in the year just because of timing. So we really think that you guys are going to make your own judgment call on how you look at the U.S. and the growth. We don't give guidance on the growth, either in the -- to U.S. or on a broader basis. But we feel pretty comfortable about the industry. We are seeing growth. If you look at the Nielsen numbers, and that's what I was referring to earlier. It was down to almost negative in convenience in December, and then it's grown just under a percent in January. It was 1.5% or so roughly, in February. It was 2.5% in -- or 2.6% in March, and it's actually gone up a little higher in April. So clearly, there is a nice trend.

Okay. When we say July, we will have launched through all of the business units in the -- on the 2, now, Coke bottlers. There were 3 Coke bottlers. And as you are aware, the Coca-Cola owned bottler, they've sold their -- and refranchised their system that's been divided effectively between COFCO and Swire. And then there was some interchange of territories between COFCO and Swire so that their own territories are more aligned and more adjacent to each other. So we will be -- have launched by July through the different BUs. There is obviously no instantaneous, miraculous listing on all the shelves. We're going to continue to build, because particularly in China there is a modern trade, which is easier and that -- obviously, you pick up listings on that more -- much more quickly. But the very, very bulk -- large bulk of the business is still traditional trade, and that means it's got to be built up store by store slowly, one by one. So that is going to still take time to get that penetration up. And that is going to be a slow build, as we continue to build, as we continue to gain momentum, as we hopefully increase our velocity, we'll also be increasing our exposure and distribution through the whole system. So that's still going to take some time. There is a distinction between those 2."

We do have -- we'll have that same build in marketing and G&A spend. But initially, in some of the newer markets, we obviously are overspending in our G&A side, particularly payroll, in order to support the launches of brands. And so that will take some time. But as we continue, it will have less and less impact, as we get maturer in these markets. But we still have -- do have some large markets. I mean, going through the market in China. At the moment, we are continuing to increase our headcount quite substantially. As we're going to each of these launches and each of these BUs, we have to have representation. When we're going to -- India, we will need more people. So there is a disconnect, but it is becoming less impactful. And because of that, we are seeing, we think, some better gross margins and better bottom line margins as we go forward."

We are at the same time going down the track of actually having our product registered and approved. So that's all happening. So that is -- again, will also be a later launch, later this year. With regard to Pakistan, that is -- we just pretty much, I think we're about or we are in the throes of just starting to sell now. But it's a smaller market from a premium energy drink product brand. We think there is a much larger market that we can look at. And again, we're also looking at the possibility of launching Mutant there, also still later this year. So they're sort of slightly different markets, and we are in the planning stages with them and in the process. So they're all, hopefully, going to come through before the end of the year."

We've made the Vans Warped Tour very much a Mutant property, which will get us a lot of sampling, a lot of exposure in 40-something markets and concerts around the U.S. We will also -- we've also switched, not completely but a lot of exposure of Mutant into the Monster Jam series, which are those big trucks, and that's going to happen for the rest of the year. We're going to do in-store price promotions. We're doing sampling, extensive sampling promotions as well for Mutant. And that's all starting to kick in now, starting in May and June, the promotions and as I said, the sampling activities. We also indicated that we had started in certain -- with certain limited retailers. We're actually starting some distribution of basically, our new 0-calorie WHITE LIGHTNING Mutant drink, which will then give us a better positioning on shelf and give us alternative offerings, full calorie, and sugar and 0. And that will be probably in the general market by beginning of July. So those 2 things together, we believe with a much broader rollout now, we've opened the market. The number of accounts we're going to in the channels, we are expanding that at the same time now and getting listings. And so, again, by the time you get to summer, mid-year, we think that we will have much better distribution for Mutant."

Sales continue to be challenging in the beverage industry in the first quarter and remain weak. In the first quarter, net sales was $742.1 million, up 9.1% from $680.2 million in the first quarter of 2016. The company achieved record first quarter gross sales of $845.5 million, up 8.8% from $777.5 million in the first quarter of 2016. Unfavorable currency exchange rates reduced net sales by approximately $3.7 million in the 2017 first quarter.
Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the first quarter was 64.8% as compared to 62.2% for the comparable 2016 first quarter. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to cost of goods savings as a result of the AFF Transaction, which was partially offset by product mix and certain increases in other costs.
Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 3.1% for the 2017 first quarter as compared to 3.4% in the 2016 first quarter. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 11.7% compared to 10.2% in the same quarter a year ago. The increase was primarily due to increased sponsorship and endorsement costs and commissions.
General and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were 14.4% as compared to 11.1% in the same quarter last year. General and administrative costs, excluding distributed termination expenses as a percentage of net sales, increased to 11.8% in the first quarter of 2017 compared to 10.6% for the 2016 first quarter.
Payroll expenses were up $13 million, primarily to support the strategic brands that we acquired from Coca-Cola as well as the launches in China and other countries internationally and stock-based compensation, which is a noncash item, was $3.1 million higher. Distributor termination expenses were $19.9 million in the first quarter as compared to $3.4 million in the 2016 first quarter.
Legal expenses related to regulatory matters and litigation concerning the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage, safety and sale of the company's product were $1.9 million in the 2017 first quarter as compared to $5.4 million in the 2016 first quarter.
Our effective tax rate decreased from 35.8% in the 2016 first quarter to 32.8% in the 2017 first quarter, primarily due to an increase in profits earned by certain foreign subsidiaries in lower tax jurisdictions than the U.S. as well as an increase in equity compensation deductions.
Net income was $178 million in the 2017 first quarter compared to net income of $163.9 million in the 2016 first quarter, an increase of 8.6%.
The weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding decreased from 620.7 million for the first quarter of 2016 to 582 million for the first quarter of 2017 as a result of share buybacks, including the modified Dutch tender auction, which was completed in June 2016. The net income was impacted by the substantial increase in distributor termination expenses previously mentioned above.
Diluted earnings per share for the 2017 first quarter increased 15.8% to $0.31 per share from $0.26 in the first quarter of 2016. We estimate that distributed termination expenses in the 2017 first quarter of $19.9 million negatively affected diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.02 per share after tax.
We continue to make good progress in the implementation of our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola bottlers globally. Domestically, we transitioned distribution of Monster Energy drinks in Wisconsin to Coca-Cola bottlers in early January 2017; in parts of Minnesota, including Minneapolis and St. Paul, in March 2017; and in a part of North Dakota, including Fargo, in April 2017. We're also making good progress in the U.S. in nontraditional channels, including food service accounts.
In EMEA, in the first quarter of 2017, we commenced distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in Nigeria, Oman and then -- and smaller countries in EMEA. And in April 2017, we commenced distribution of Monster with the Coca-Cola bottler in Kazakhstan. Further additional launches are planned in the remainder of the second quarter of 2017 in certain countries in Africa and the Middle East.
In the first quarter of 2017, we launched distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in certain countries in the Caribbean. In the second quarter of 2017, we anticipate launching Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in certain other smaller and medium-sized markets in that geographic region.
In China during the first quarter of 2017, we continued with launches in Tianjin, Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Anhui, Zhejiang and Jiangsu. We also extended distribution in the Guangdong province. Further launches are planned in China and in other countries, including a relaunch in India in 2017. We also commenced distribution in Malaysia in the same period. We continue to make progress towards our planned relaunch in India later this year. We are also on track to commence distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in Vietnam, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan in the second quarter.
As a result of the AFF Transaction, we achieved raw material cost savings of $23.3 million in the 2017 first quarter, which were broadly in line with expectations.
According to the Nielsen reports, for the 13 weeks through April 22, 2017, all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots, increased by 2.5% versus the same period a year ago. Sales of Monster grew 1.8% in the 13-week period, while sales of NOS increased 10.6% and sales of Full Throttle decreased 5.1%. Sales of Red Bull increased 5.3%. Sales of Rockstar increased by 1.9%. Sales of 5-Hour decreased 6.4%. And sales of AMP decreased 29.9%.
According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended April 22, 2017, sales in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots, in dollars, increased 2.7% over the same period last year. Sales of Monster increased by 1.5% over the same period last year, while NOS was up 12.7% and Full Throttle sales decreased 2.1%. Sales of Red Bull increased by 5.8%, Rockstar was up 4.6%, 5-Hour was down 7.2% and AMP was down 29.9%.
We point out that the energy shot category has been slowing for some time. And if we exclude the energy shots as well as energy coffee and energy protein drinks, where we have experienced production capacity shortages, for the 4 weeks ended April 22, 2017, sales in the convenience and gas channel in dollars, in fact, increased by 4.6% over the same period last year, with sales of Monster increasing by 4.5%.
We note that the Nielsen reports for the 13 weeks and 4 weeks ended April 22, 2017, exclude sales of NOS and Full Throttle 8 packs, which were not yet in the Nielsen system.
According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended April  22, 2017, Monster's market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots in dollars, decreased by 0.4 points over the same period last year to 35%. NOS' share increased 0.4 points to 4.2% and Full Throttle's share remained the same at 1%. Red Bull's share increased 1 point to 36%, Rockstar's share was up 0.1 of a point to 8%, 5-Hour's share was lower by 0.8 of a point at 7.4% and AMP's share decreased 0.6 of a point to 1.2%.
According to Nielsen, in the 4 weeks ended April 22, 2017, sales of Energy + Coffee Drinks in dollars in the convenience and gas channel decreased 6.3% over the same period last year. Sales of Java Monster were 19.5% lower than in the same period last year, while sales of Starbucks Doubleshot Energy were 8.6% higher. We continue to experience production capacity shortages with Java Monster, which I will address later in the call.
According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada, for the 12 weeks ended April 1, 2017, the energy drink category increased 2% in dollars. Monster sales increased 10% versus a year ago. Our market share increased 2.1 share points to 30.5%. Red Bull's sales increased 3%, and its market share decreased 0.4 of a point to 35.9%. Rockstar's sales increased 5% and its market share increased 0.8 points to 19.4%.
According to Nielsen, for all outlets combined in Mexico, the energy drink category grew 27% during the month of March 2017. Monster sales increased 41.1%. Our market share in value increased 2.7 points to 26.7% against the comparable period last year. Sales of Burn decreased 27%. Burn's market share decreased 2.7 points to 3.7%. Red Bull sales decreased 3.5%, and its market share decreased by 3.7 points to 11.6%.
Vive 100's market share increased 4.5 points to 41.9%, while Boost's market share decreased 2.1 points to 7.9%. The transition to the KO bottler system in August 2016 resulted in significantly wider availability of Monster in the traditional trade channel, mom-and-pop stores in Mexico.
According to Nielsen, distribution of Monster grew from 10% in March 2016 to 24% in March 2017 in this channel. This translates to growth in Monster's value share of 9 percentage points versus March 2016 in the traditional channel.
The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico.
I would like to point out that the Nielsen and IRI numbers for EMEA should only be used as a guide, because the channels read by Nielsen and IRI for EMEA vary from country to country.
According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ending March 2017, the actual 13-week periods differ -- vary by a few days between different markets. Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year grew from 13% to 15.5% in Great Britain; from 9.5% to 10.6% in Belgium; from 9.1% to 11.6% in Norway; from 21.5% to 23.7% in France; from 24.4% to 26.5% in Spain; and from 13% to 16.3% in Germany.
According to Nielsen, for the period ending March 2017, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year declined from 6.8% to 5.2% in The Netherlands and from 11.1% to 10.8% in Sweden, although the retail value of sales grew 22.1% in Sweden in the comparable period.
For the 13-week period ending March 2017, according to Nielsen, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year grew from 11.3% to 11.6% in the Czech Republic; from 15.8% to 17.7% in South Africa; and from 6.9% to 9.7% in Italy.

And after transitioning to the KO bottler system in November 2016, Monster's market share in value in Brazil grew to 7.4% in March 2017 as compared to 2.9% in the same period last year.
According to Nielsen, in South Korea, Monster's retail market share in value increased from 17.9% to 24.5% in February 2017 compared to the same period last year.
According to INTAGE, Monster's market share in value in the convenience store channel in Japan grew from 39.9% to 44.2% in March 2017.
According to IRI, in Australia, Monster's market share in value grew from 3.1% to 7.1% in March 2017. And in New Zealand, Monster's market share in value grew from 2.3% to 5.5% for the first quarter of 2017 versus the same period last year.
Net sales for the Monster Energy drink segment in -- for the first quarter of 2017 increased 7.5% from $621.7 million to $668.6 million from the comparable period last year. Gross sales for the Monster Energy drink segment for the first quarter of 2017 increased 7.4% from $713.5 million to $766.6 million for the comparable period last year. Net sales for the Monster Energy drink segment in the first quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $4.7 million of foreign currency movements.
Net sales for the Strategic Brand segment was $68 million for the first quarter as compared to $58.5 million in the same quarter last year. Net sales for the company's Strategic Brand segment were positively impacted by approximately $1 million of foreign currency movements in the quarter.
Net sales for the Other segment, which includes third-party sales made by AFF, were $5.5 million in the 2017 first quarter. There were no sales for the Other segment in the comparable 2016 first quarter.
We continue to experience production capacity shortages for our retort products, Java Monster and Muscle Monster. To reduce the shortfall, we have commenced manufacturing certain flavors of Java Monster in Europe, which will shortly be available to our customers in the U.S. We have also procured additional production in the U.S., which will be coming on stream early in the third quarter of 2017 and will result in additional Java Monster and Muscle Monster volumes being available for distribution to retailers thereafter. 
As a result, we anticipate that it will still be a number of months before production availability allows us to restore normal supply patterns and fully meet consumer demand that exists for these products. We estimate that net sales in the quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $12 million as a result of such production capacity shortages.
Net sales to customers outside the U.S. were $190.9 million for the 2017 first quarter compared to $149.1 million in the corresponding quarter in 2016. In local currencies, net sales to customers outside of the U.S. were approximately $3.7 million higher.   Included in reported geographic sales are our sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the U.S. and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas.
In Europe, the Middle East and Africa, net sales in the first quarter increased 17.7% in dollars and 21.7% in local currencies over the same period last year. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales increased from 50.2% in the same period last year to 50.3% during the quarter.
We are pleased with the rollout of certain SKUs in the Ultra range in EMEA markets. In 2017, we added additional SKUs of Ultra across EMEA with the introduction of Ultra Citron, which will be available in 10 additional EMEA markets in 2017. 
Various SKUs in the Ultra range are now sold in 33 EMEA markets.
We are also pleased that Monster continued to perform well and gained market share in Great Britain, Germany, France, Spain, Norway, Denmark, Poland, Ireland, Italy and the Czech Republic. 
In Asia Pacific, net sales in the first quarter increased 58.1% in dollars and 60.5% in local currencies over the same period last year. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales increased from 45.2% in the same period last year to 47.7% during the 2017 first quarter.
In Japan, net sales in the quarter increased 18.8% or 22.3% in local currency as compared to the same quarter last year. We continue to experience strong performance in Japan.
In South Korea, net sales increased 15% or 18.2% in local currency as compared to the same quarter last year.
In Oceana, which includes Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti, French Polynesia, New Caledonia and Guam, net sales increased 44.7% or 50% in local currencies as compared to the same quarter last year.
 
As previously mentioned, we are moving ahead with plans for local production in India with a view towards reentering the market in 2017. 
In Latin America, including Mexico and the Caribbean, gross sales in the first quarter increased 36.2% in dollars and 34.9% in local currencies. Net sales in the first quarter increased 42.2% in dollars and 41.8% in local currencies over the same period last year. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales increased from 41.1% in the same period last year to 48.8% during the 2017 first quarter.
Net sales increased in Brazil 396.4% in dollars or 481.7% in local currency, largely due to the transition of Monster to Coca-Cola bottlers, which took place on November 1, 2016.
Net sales in Chile increased 47.6% in dollars and 59.1% in local currency.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $576.3 million compared to $377.6 million at December 31, 2016. Short-term investments were $209.4 million compared to $220.6 million at December 31, 2016. Long-term investments decreased to $0.5 million from $2.4 million at December 31, 2016.
Accounts receivable increased to $509.5 million at March 31, 2017, from $448.1 million at December 31, 2016. Days outstanding for accounts receivable were 54.9 days compared to 48.2 days at December 31, 2016. 
Inventories increased to $171.3 million from $162  million at December 31, 2016. Average days of inventory was 59 days at March 31, 2017, compared to 57 days at December 31, 2016.
As previously reported, in September 2016, we launched Mutant, an exciting super soda in limited convenience stores in certain U.S. markets with encouraging sales per point of distribution. We will be launching a line extension of our Mutant brand family, namely WHITE LIGHTNING, 0 sugar offering, to limited customers initially, followed with a general market launch in July. We remain confident about the potential of this brand.
In preparation for the launch of Hydro, we commenced limited deliveries of Hydro products to our bottlers and full service distributors at the end of the quarter and are planning for the launch of Hydro to the general retail trade at the end of this month. Hydro is a noncarbonated lightly sweetened energy drink that is packaged in a unique 16.9-ounce PET can, the size of which is exclusive to us in the U.S. at this time. 
We are planning to launch Hydro in a 550 ml PET bottle in the United Kingdom and Ireland during the second quarter of 2017. We expanded distribution of Monster Energy Ultra Violet and launched Full Throttle Orange during the first quarter of 2017.
At the end of April 2017, we launched a new Lewis Hamilton signature Monster Energy drink in Great Britain, which will be followed by launches in 24 European markets in the second quarter of 2017 and in South Africa in July.
We have a robust innovation pipeline and further launches such as  [ Mango Loca ], a new flavor in our Monster Energy juice family, which is planned for a third quarter 2017 launch and the new X-Presso Monster Energy drink in 8-ounce slim cans in 2 flavors planned for launch before year-end.
April 2017 had 1 fewer selling day compared with April 2016. We estimate April 2017 gross sales to be approximately 9.5% higher than in April 2016. On a foreign exchange adjusted basis, we estimate April 2017 gross sales to be approximately 10.6% higher than in April 2016. 
In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week on which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives as well as shifts in the timing of production in some instances where our bottlers are responsible for production and unilaterally determine their production schedules, which affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers. 
We reiterate that sales over the short period such as a single month should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period.
On February 28, 2017, the company's Board of Directors authorized a new repurchase program for the repurchase of up to $500 million of the company's outstanding common stock. No shares were repurchased under this repurchase program during the first quarter. 
In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points. We recognized the reduction in raw material costs of $23.3 million in the first quarter as a result of our acquisition of AFF. North American and international gross margins remain healthy. While the U.S. Nielsen market statistics show that the energy drink category slowed in the U.S. towards the end of the 2016 fourth quarter, it appears to have picked up steam through the first quarter. Equivalent market statistics for many countries around the world show that the energy category is continuing to grow and that Monster is generally growing ahead of the category.
Currency exchange rates continue to affect our results. The new additions to the Monster family continue to gain momentum and add to the company's sales.
We're excited about the prospects for our new product launches. We are pleased with our performance in our international markets and reiterate the growth potential for us in China, one of the largest energy drink markets globally.
We have successfully transitioned additional international countries to Coca-Cola bottlers in the first quarter and will be transitioning a number of other markets to Coca-Cola bottlers in 2017.
I'd like to open the floor to questions about the quarter and the year. Thank you."

So we think that it's certainly going to take time to continue. You can't just put stuff -- a brand like Monster, which is not known on the shelf and expect it to immediately start achieving velocities that are -- where you'd would like it to be. There is a buildup, and we're going to go through this buildup over a period of time. So really -- it really is premature. We're comfortable with the velocities we're getting and the volumes. We're comfortable with the attention and focus. We're putting a lot of effort behind it. We're building up our own infrastructure and team there to support the brand, support sampling and in-store execution. And we are seeing good execution from the point of view of our point-of-sale and things of that nature. And we are quite happy with that. But really, it's just premature to talk. But -- we are comfortable with the market. It is a large market, and it will continue. We are right in the middle the rollouts. As we've indicated, where there were a whole new number of regions we introduced, probably late because of the Chinese New Year was late February into March. We are planning launches. We plan launches, and we have launched throughout April, and we're continuing May. And then pretty much most of it will be done, so there will be a few more areas to do in June and July. But pretty much -- we think it will be pretty much done by then. There may be 1 or 2 hiccups that we don't anticipate at this point, but it will take time. And it's just a very big market that you got to be patient with and just build slowly."

It's sort of the reverse for Red Bull.

We don't give guidance on the growth, either in the -- to U.S. or on a broader basis. But we feel pretty comfortable about the industry. We are seeing growth. If you look at the Nielsen numbers, and that's what I was referring to earlier. It was down to almost negative in convenience in December, and then it's grown just under a percent in January. It was 1.5% or so roughly, in February. It was 2.5% in -- or 2.6% in March, and it's actually gone up a little higher in April. So clearly, there is a nice trend.

We've made the Vans Warped Tour very much a Mutant property, which will get us a lot of sampling, a lot of exposure in 40-something markets and concerts around the U.S. We will also -- we've also switched, not completely but a lot of exposure of Mutant into the Monster Jam series, which are those big trucks, and that's going to happen for the rest of the year. We're going to do in-store price promotions. We're doing sampling, extensive sampling promotions as well for Mutant. And that's all starting to kick in now, starting in May and June, the promotions and as I said, the sampling activities. We also indicated that we had started in certain -- with certain limited retailers. We're actually starting some distribution of basically, our new 0-calorie WHITE LIGHTNING Mutant drink, which will then give us a better positioning on shelf and give us alternative offerings, full calorie, and sugar and 0. And that will be probably in the general market by beginning of July. So those 2 things together, we believe with a much broader rollout now, we've opened the market. The number of accounts we're going to in the channels, we are expanding that at the same time now and getting listings. And so, again, by the time you get to summer, mid-year, we think that we will have much better distribution for Mutant."

Sales continued to be challenging the beverage industry in the second quarter and remained weak. In the second quarter, net sales were $907.1 million, up 9.6% from $827.5 million in the second quarter of 2016. The company achieved record second quarter growth sales of $1.04 billion, up 9.8% from $945.8 million in the second quarter of 2016.
Unfavorable currency exchange rates reduced net sales by approximately $8.2 million in the 2017 second quarter. The comparable 2016 second quarter net and gross sales included $5 million of accelerated deferred revenue related to distributed terminations.
Excluding such as tolerated recognition of deferred revenue from the comparable 2016 second quarter, net and gross sales for the 2017 second quarter increased 10.3% and 10.4%, respectively. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the second quarter was 64.3% as compared to 62.6% for the comparable 2016 second quarter. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to cost of goods savings as a result of the AFF transaction and product mix in the U.S, which was partially offset by geographic mix and certain increases in other costs.
Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 3% for the 2017 second quarter as compared to 3.2% in the 2016 second quarter.
Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 12.6% compared to 11.2% in the same quarter a year ago. The increase is primarily due to increased sponsorship and endorsement costs and commissions. General and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were 10.1% as compared to 13.3% in the same quarter last year. Including in general and administrative costs were dissipated termination expenses of $0.2 million and $25.3 million for the 2017 and 2016 second quarters, respectively. Included in general and administrative expenses for the 2016 quarter were AFF related expenses of $3.6 million and modified debt option tender offer expenses of $1.5 million.
General and administrative expenses, excluding restricted terminations, AFF transaction expenses and stock repurchase expenses were 10.1% of net sales for the 2017 second quarter compared with 9.6% of net sales for the comparable 2016 second quarter, largely due to an increase in payroll costs.
[indiscernible] expenses were up $10.1 million, primarily due to headcount growth internationally, including to support the launches in China and other countries as stock-based compensation and noncash item was $1.3 million higher.
Legal expenses relating to regulated matters and litigation concerning the advertising, marketing commercial, ingredients, usage, safety and sale of the company's products were $2.4 million in the 2017 second quarter as compared to $3.8 million in the 2016 second quarter. Our effective tax rate decreased slightly from 36.1% in the 2016 second quarter to 35.9% in the 2017 second quarter, primarily due to an increase in equity compensation deductions.
Net income was $222.6 million in the 2017 second quarter compared to net income of $184.2 million in the 2016 second quarter, an increase of 20.9%. The weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding decreased from $614.9 million for the second quarter of 2016 to $578 million for the second quarter of 2017 as a result of share buybacks, including the modified debt auction tender offer, which was completed in June 2016.
Diluted earnings per share for the 2017 second quarter increased 28.6% to $0.39 from $0.30 in the second quarter of 2016.
We continue to make good progress in the implementation of our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola bottlers globally. Domestically, we transitioned distribution of Monster Energy Drink to Coca-Cola bottlers in the part of the North Dakota, including Fargo in April 2017. We are also making good progress in the U.S. in nontraditional channels, including food service accounts and e-commerce.
In the EMEA, in the second quarter of 2017, we commenced this region of Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in Kazakhstan, Jordan and Pakistan. Additional launches are planned in the third quarter of 2017 in certain countries in Africa, the Middle East and Eastern Europe. In the second quarter of 2017, we launched distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in certain countries in the Caribbean. In the second half of 2017, we anticipate launching Monster and Coca-Cola in additional countries in central and South America and in the Caribbean.
In China, during the second quarter of 2017, we continue to launch in 14 new operating units. The 2 remaining operating units in China will launch during July 2017. We also transitioned distribution in Hong Kong and Macau, to Coca-Cola bottlers. We continue to make progress towards our planned relaunch in India later this year.

Nielsen statistics from Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the off-store convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the convenience chain in turn, can be materially influence by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain where one or more energy brands during a particular month. Consequently, [indiscernible] could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico.
I would like to point out that the Nielsen and IRI numbers for EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen and IRI for EMEA vary from country to country.

To reduce the shortfall, we are manufacturing certain to flavors of Java Monster in Europe, which are now available to our customers in the U.S. We will also procure additional production in the U.S. which will be coming on stream in the third quarter of 2017 and will result in additional Java Monster and Muscle Monster volumes being available for distribution to retailers thereafter.

We launched the line extension of our Mutant brand family namely White Lightning, a zero sugar offering to limited customers in the second quarter, with the general market launch in July. We remain confident about the potential of this brand.

We launched Monster Energy Ultra Violet nationally during the quarter, of the limited sales club stores customers the previous quarter. We launched Mango Loco, a new flavor in the Monster Energy juice family, exclusively with the convenience store customer in June and will launch to the general market nationally in September 2017. We also launched Monster Hydro in a 550-ML PET bottle in the United Kingdom and Ireland during the second quarter of 2017. At the end of April 2017, we launched a new Lewis Hamilton signature Monster energy drink in Great Britain, which is followed by launches and 21 European markets in the second quarter 2017 and in South Africa in July.
We have a robust innovation pipeline including a new Espresso Monster energy drink in 8-oz slim cans in 2 flavors and NOS nitros Mango planned for launch before the year end in the United States. We estimate 2017 July gross sales to be approximately 13.8% higher than in July 2016.
On a foreign exchange adjusted basis, we estimate July 2017 gross sales to be approximately 14.7% higher than in July 2016. In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in holidays for timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributorship incentives as well as shifts in the timing of production, in some instances where our bottlers are responsible for production and determined the production schedules, which affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers. We also reiterate that sales over a short period such as the single month should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for our full quarter or any future period.
On February 28, the company's Board of Directors authorized a new repurchase program for the repurchase of up to $500 million of the company's outstanding common stock. No shares were repurchased under this repurchase program during the first and second quarters.
In conclusion, I would like to summarize recent positive points. One, we recognized the reduction in raw material costs of $28.6 million in the second quarter as a result of our acquisition of AFF. Two, North American and international gross margins remain healthy. Three, while the U.S. Nielsen markets show that the energy category slowed in the U.S., towards the end of the 2016 fourth quarter, it appears to have picked up steam this year as well as in July. The current market statistics for many countries around the world show that the energy category continuing to grow and that Monster generally growing ahead of the category.
Currency exchange rates continue to affect our results. The new additions to the Monster family continue to gain momentum and add to the company's sales. Five, we are excited about the prospects for our company's new product launches. Six, we are pleased with our performance in our international markets and reiterate the growth potential for us in China under the largest energy drink markets globally. Seven, according to Nielsen, in the last 12 months ended July 1, 2017, Monster is in the top 10 beverage brands in Great Britain on a value basis. Eight, we successfully launched or transitioned Monster energy drinks to Coca-Cola bottlers in a number of the first half of 2017 and anticipate further transitions and launches in the second half of the year.
I would like to open the floor to questions about the quarter and the year. Thank you."

And always the we are right in the phrase now of getting production, and that means getting back our shelf space and that all takes will take a bit of time. With regard to Hydro, your point is noted and that is correct that the ACB at the moment is about 40%. So we've, obviously, still got some work to do to get Hydro out and get it again, it sort of launched a little bit off-cycle. So we are getting it into that change into the stores, but it is taking some time. But again, we are -- there are sort of supply constrictions on the number of packages we're able to put out. This obviously, has been is of concern to us but unfortunately, we do believe in the package. We feel that the package is important for the product to create the right image and the right personality around the brand and the product. So we are continuing to address the supply issues and hopefully, we're selling all we can supply. So we will continue to I think, improve the supply situation and as that goes, so we will continue to supply to increase and improve our distribution. But there is really positive side of the brand and that it is pulling it received good consumer response. We are looking at addressing the brand with an additional package, which won't be have the same supply constraints slightly larger sized bottle and we believe will be able to launch that and get that on the shelves of the same time as we can and that will supplement we believe, the can and consumer demand consumer will have a choice, but we do not want to replace the can with a similar sized bottle, this will be larger bottle where at the moment, we haven't finalized the exact size, but it's probably likely to be about a 750 ML size [indiscernible] So we're looking to have both products. We're also looking to have different flavors in the bottle so there will be choice of additional flavors and hopefully, we'll be able to get that solidify shelf space and therefore, satisfy consumers and retailers so that there will always be supply of hydrogels. Even though many times be some shortages in the can size until we get that -- those supply issues rectified."

As you say, you've got most of the European markets with a lot more SKUs, but even within the European markets, there is a tremendous disparity between what you've got on shelves in the U.K. and Germany and Spain versus other markets, and it varies pretty dramatically. You also have a lot of the what I'd call the sublines, strategic lines that we've got the families that haven't been launched. We launched Ultra, but you really have no coffee and you have very little rehab in Europe, and we just sort of going out with punch and repositioning the juice line. But again, we've launched Hydro pretty much in the United Kingdom and Ireland, but we are looking to launch Hydro quite quickly and not everywhere but in the number of selected markets in Europe, including South Africa, we think there is a good, good potential for the brand. So -- and then when you go out of that, you go to South America and Asia, the SKUs are much, much more limited. And so we've got just a lot of potential, even if you go down to places like Chile where we're doing a lot of business there. There is still is a pretty much a handful or so of SKUs. So there is a lot of potential. But if you look to the sort of an average, I would say, you're probably looking at probably 30% to 40% of the SKUs on average, in other overseas markets versus the U.S. Just as a very, very broad across a number of, but that's not only weighted or any sort of statistical analysis, that's just pretty much anecdotally, our gut feel."

You called out $13 million and $25 million year-to-date drag for the quarter and year-to-date, respectively, if I'm not mistaken, so it's a couple of points to the sales growth.

So we seem to be ahead of the Nielsen generally, continuing to gain share both internationally and in the U.S. So there no inconsistent with our previous growth in the quarter that we're seeing in the month of July, just doing better, generally, across the board. With regard to Java and Muscle Monster, where we sat incrementally, I mean, we've lost shelf space. You look at -- even if you look at Java our numbers are looking at the numbers on the channels, even for our two main Java products, which we basically been in stock most of the time this year, our distribution is down at about 71% whereas on our other top brands, we're at in the high 80s and low 90s. So we still got -- clearly, you lost some distribution even for the 2 main SKUs. The others, if you look at Salted Caramel, which we introduced quite a bit of time ago, that at 40%. So we've got a lot of opportunity. We just got to get supplies back, and that is one of the reasons we hesitate a bit earlier because it's one thing getting back supplies in line, it's another thing making sure that we ahve those applies on a consistent basis before we go back out and reestablish shelf space and get that shelf space because we obviously don't want another hick up with retailers. So we really do have quite a bit of upside potential in just improving our supply channels, having products on shelf, getting back our listings for not only the line extensions, Corona and Salted Caramel but and Irish, but even just getting back our distribution levels and consistency with Mean Bean and Loco and so we look at that as being positive and it's going to start basically, taking place during this quarter, but it's going to be on an increased rolling basis. And we think that by the fourth quarter, we would have very much be back into where we were. And we look at the coffee category growth pretty well so, and that's been slow down I think even with the issues we've had with our competitors. But we think that's going to continue to grow and move back into growth. With regard to Muscle Monster, which is the same issue, which is supply. We are also looking at evaluating and are going to relaunch and reposition Muscle Monster in antiseptic plastic bottle, which will be a resealable bottle. So Muscle Monster is going to move into a plastic bottle, we think, hopefully, still later this year. We've done some testing with the bottle and the labeling and hopefully, that's going to be the position to start the next few months. And so that transition, we think, will be a positive transition for Muscle Monster to also get it back and give it a kickstart again because we are all positive about that sector, which we think we are underrepresented in at the moment. So that's another so we think some potential upside."

Sales continue to be challenging in the beverage industry in the second quarter and remain weak. In the second quarter, net sales were $907.1 million, up 9.6% from $827.5 million in the second quarter of 2016. The company achieved record second quarter gross sales of $1.04 billion, up 9.8% from $945.8 million in the second quarter of 2016.
Unfavorable currency exchange rates reduced net sales by approximately $8.2 million in the 2017 second quarter. The comparable 2016 second quarter net and gross sales included $5 million of accelerated deferred revenue related to distributor terminations. Excluding such accelerated recognition of deferred revenue from the comparable 2016 second quarter, net and gross sales for the 2017 second quarter increased 10.3% and 10.4%, respectively.
Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the second quarter was 64.3% as compared to 62.6% for the comparable 2016 second quarter. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to cost of goods savings as a result of the AFF transaction and product mix in the U.S., which was partially offset by geographic mix and certain increases in other costs.
Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 3% for the 2017 second quarter as compared to 3.2% in the 2016 second quarter.
Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 12.6% compared to 11.2% in the same quarter a year ago. The increase was primarily due to increased sponsorship and endorsement costs and commissions.
General and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were 10.1% as compared to 13.3% in the same quarter last year. Included in general and administrative costs were distributor termination expenses of $0.2 million and $25.3 million for the 2017 and 2016 second quarters, respectively. Included in general and administrative expenses for the 2016 second quarter were AFF transaction-related expenses of $3.6 million and modified Dutch auction tender offer expenses of $1.5 million.
General and administrative expenses, excluding distributor terminations, AFF transaction expenses and stock repurchase expenses, were 10.1% of net sales for the 2017 second quarter compared with 9.6% of net sales for the comparable 2016 second quarter, largely due to an increase in payroll costs.
Payroll expenses were up $10.1 million, primarily due to headcount growth internationally, including to support the launches in China and other countries. And stock-based compensation, a noncash item, was $1.3 million higher.
Legal expenses relating to regulatory matters and litigation concerning the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage, safety and sale of the company's products were $2.4 million in the 2017 second quarter as compared to $3.8 million in the 2016 second quarter.
Our effective tax rate decreased slightly from 36.1% in the 2016 second quarter to 35.9% in the 2017 second quarter, primarily due to an increase in equity compensation deductions.
Net income was $222.6 million in the 2017 second quarter compared to net income of $184.2 million in the 2016 second quarter, an increase of 20.9%. The weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding decreased from 614.9 million for the second quarter of 2016 to 578 million for the second quarter of 2017 as a result of share buybacks, including the modified Dutch auction tender offer which was completed in June 2016. Diluted earnings per share for the 2017 second quarter increased 28.6% to $0.39 from $0.30 in the second quarter of 2016.
We continue to make good progress in the implementation of our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola bottlers globally. Domestically, we transitioned distribution of Monster Energy drink to Coca-Cola bottlers in a part of North Dakota, including Fargo in April 2017. We're also making good progress in the U.S. in nontraditional channels, including food service accounts and e-commerce.
In the EMEA, in the second quarter of 2017, we commenced distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in Kazakhstan, Jordan and Pakistan. Additional launches are planned in the third quarter of 2017 in certain countries in Africa, the Middle East and Eastern Europe. In the second quarter of 2017, we launched the distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in certain countries in the Caribbean. In the second half of 2017, we anticipate launching Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in certain additional countries in Central and South America and in the Caribbean.
In China, during the second quarter of 2017, we continued with launches in 14 new operating units. The 2 remaining operating units in China will launch during July 2017. We also transitioned distribution in Hong Kong and Macau to Coca-Cola bottlers. We continue to make progress towards our planned relaunch in India later this year. We are planning to commence distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in Vietnam and Taiwan in the third quarter.

According to Nielsen reports for the 13 weeks through July 22, 2017, for all outlets combined, namely, convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots, increased by 0.8% versus the same period a year ago. Sales of Monster grew 2.2% in the 13-week period while sales of NOS increased 11.8% and sales of Full Throttle increased 1.1%. Sales of Red Bull increased 2%, sales of Rockstar decreased by 1%, sales of 5-Hour decreased 8.7% and sales of Amp decreased 25.8%.

Sales of Red Bull increased by 2%, Rockstar was down 2.6%, 5-Hour was down 11.3% and Amp was down 23.4%. We point out that the energy shot category has been slowing for some time. And if we exclude the energy shots as well as the energy coffee and energy protein drinks where we have experienced production capacity shortages for the 4 weeks ended July 22, 2017, sales in the convenience and gas channels in dollars, in fact, increased by 4.3% over the same period last year with sales of Monster increasing by 10%.
According to Nielsen, in the 4 weeks ended July 22, 2017, Monster's market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including shots in dollars, increased by 1.5 points over the same period last year to 36.7%. NOS' share increased 0.3 points to 4% and Full Throttle share remained the same at 0.9%. Red Bull's share increased 0.1 point to 35.5%, Rockstar's share was down 0.3 points to 7.6%, 5-Hour's share was lower by 1.2 at 7.1% and Amp's share decreased 0.4 points to 1.1%.

Sales of Java Monster were 21.2% lower than in the same period last year, while sales of Starbucks Doubleshot Energy were 0.4% lower.

According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada for the 12 weeks ended June 24, 2017, the energy drink category remained flat in dollars. Monster sales increased 11% versus a year ago. Our market share increased 3.1 share points to 31.3%. Red Bull sales decreased 1% and its market share decreased 1.3 points to 37.3%.

Our market share in value increased 3.3 points to 27.1% against the comparable period last year. Sales of Burn decreased 37.8%. Burn's market share decreased 2.1 points to 2.9%. Red Bull sales decreased 6.8% and its market share decreased by 1.7 points to 11.1%. Vive 100's market share decreased 0.7 points to 42.3%, while Boost's market share decreased 1.7 points to 8%.
The Nielsen statistics from Mexico cover a single month, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico.
I would like to point out that the Nielsen and IRI numbers for EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen and IRI for EMEA vary from country to country.
According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ending July 2017, the actual 13-week periods vary by a few days between different markets. Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year grew from 13.9% to 17.3% in Great Britain and from 22.3% to 23.1% in France.

Net sales of the Monster Energy Drinks segment for the second quarter of 2017 increased 9.7% from $743.5 million to $815.3 million from the comparable period last year. Net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment in the second quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $8.3 million of foreign currency movements.
Net sales for the Strategic Brands segment were $85.6 million for the second quarter as compared to $77.4 million in the same quarter last year. Net sales for the company's Strategic Brands segment were positively impacted by approximately $0.1 million of foreign currency movements in the quarter.
Net sales for the Other segment, which includes third-party sales made by AFF, were $6.2 million in the 2017 second quarter as compared to $6.6 million in the same quarter last year. We continue to experience production capacity shortages for our retort products Java Monster and Muscle Monster. To reduce the shortfall, we are manufacturing certain flavors of Java Monster in Europe, which are now available to our customers in the U.S. We will also procure additional production in the U.S. which will be coming on stream in the third quarter of 2017 and will result in additional Java Monster and Muscle Monster volumes being available for distribution to retailers thereafter.
As a result, we anticipate that it will still be a few months before production availability allows us to restore normal supply patterns and fully meet consumer demand that exists for these products. We estimate that net sales were negatively impacted as a result of such production capacity shortages by approximately $13 million in the second quarter and year-to-date by approximately $25 million.
Net sales to customers outside the U.S. were $247.9 million in the 2017 second quarter compared to $200.2 million in the corresponding quarter in 2016.
In local currencies, net sales to customers outside the U.S. were approximately $8.2 million higher. Included in reported geographic sales are our sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the U.S. and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas.
In Europe, the Middle East and Africa, net sales in the second quarter increased 18.6% in dollars and 24.8% in local currencies over the same period last year. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales decreased from 50.8% in the same period last year to 49% during the quarter.
We are pleased with the rollout of certain SKUs in the Ultra range in EMEA markets. In 2017, we have added certain SKUs of Ultra across EMEA with the introduction of Ultra Citron, which will be available in 10 additional EMEA markets in 2017. Various SKUs in the Ultra range are now sold in 33 EMEA markets.
We are also pleased that Monster continued to perform well and gained market share in Great Britain, Germany, France, Spain, Norway, Denmark, Poland, Ireland, Italy, Czech Republic and South Africa.
In Asia Pacific, net sales in the second quarter increased 64.6% in dollars and 66.6% in local currencies over the same period last year. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales increased from 46.1% in the same period last year to 50.7% during the 2017 second quarter.

Net sales in Chile increased 35.4% in dollars and 33.4% in local currency.
Turning to the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents amounted to $777.7 million compared to $377.6 million at December 31, 2016. Short-term investments were $323.9 million compared to $220.6 million at December 31, 2016. Long-term investments increased to $48.6 million from $2.4 million at December 31, 2016.
Accounts receivable increased to $537.1 million at June 30, 2017, from $448.1 million at December 31, 2016. Days outstanding for accounts receivables were 47 days compared to 48 days -- 48.2 days at December 31, 2016. Inventories increased to $190.6 million from $162 million at December 31, 2016. Average days of inventory was 53 days at June 30, 2017 compared to 57 days at December 31, 2016.
We launched a line extension of our Mutant brand family, namely, White Lightning, a zero-sugar offering to limited customers in the second quarter, with the general market launch in July. We remain confident about the potential of this brand.
We launched our Monster Hydro energy drinks in 3 flavors. Monster Hydro is a noncarbonated, lightly sweetened energy drink that is packaged in a unique 16.9-ounce PET can, the size of which is exclusive to us in the U.S. at this time. We launched Monster Energy Ultra Violet nationally during the quarter after limited sales with a club store customer the previous quarter. We launched Mango Loco, a new flavor in the Monster Energy juice family, exclusively with a convenience store customer in June and will launch to the general market nationally in September 2017. We also launched Monster Hydro in a 550 ml PET bottle in the United Kingdom and Ireland during the second quarter of 2017. At the end of April 2017, we launched a new Lewis Hamilton signature Monster Energy drink in Great Britain, which was followed by launches in 21 European markets in the second quarter of 2017 and in South Africa in July.
We have a robust innovation pipeline, including a new X-Presso Monster energy drink in 8-ounce slim cans in 2 flavors and NOS Nitrous Mango planned for launch before the year-end in the United States.
We estimate 2017 July gross sales to be approximately 13.8% higher than in July 2016. On a foreign exchange adjusted basis, we estimate July 2017 gross sales to be approximately 14.7% higher than in July 2016. In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives as well as shifts in the timing of production in some instances where our bottlers are responsible for production and unilaterally determine their production schedules, which affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers. We also reiterate that sales over a short period, such as a single month, should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period.
On February 28, the company's Board of Directors authorized a new repurchase program for the repurchase of up to $500 million of the company's outstanding common stock. No shares were repurchased under this repurchase program during the first and second quarters.
In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points. One, we recognized a reduction in raw material costs of $28.6 million in the second quarter as a result of our acquisition of AFF.
Two, North American and international gross margins remain healthy.
Three, while the U.S. Nielsen end market statistics show that the energy category slowed in the U.S. towards the end of the 2016 fourth quarter, it appears to have picked up steam this year as well as in July. Equivalent market statistics for many countries around the world show that the energy category is continuing to grow and that Monster is generally growing ahead of the category. Currency exchange rates continue to affect our results.
The new additions to the Monster family continue to gain momentum and add to the company's sales.
Five, we are excited about the prospects for our company's new product launches.
Six, we are pleased with our performance in our international markets and reiterate the growth potential for us in China, one of the largest energy drink markets globally.
Seven, according to Nielsen, in the last 12 months ended July 1, 2017, Monster is in the top 10 beverage brands in Great Britain on a value basis.
Eight, we have successfully launched or transitioned Monster Energy drinks to Coca-Cola bottlers in a number of countries in the first half of 2017 and anticipate further transitions and launches in the second half of the year.
I'd like to open the floor to questions about the quarter and the year. Thank you."

But again, we are -- there are sort of supply constrictions on the number of packages we're able to put out. This obviously has been -- is of concern to us. But unfortunately, we do believe in the package. We feel that the package is important for the product to create the right image and the right personality around the brand and the product. So we are continuing to address the supply issues. And literally, we're selling all we can supply. So we will continue to, I think, improve the supply situation. And as that goes, so we will continue to supply -- to increase and improve our distribution. But that's really a positive side of the brand, that it is pulling and it's received good consumer response. We are looking at addressing the brand with an additional package, which won't be -- have the same supply constraints, slightly larger-sized bottle. And we believe we'll be able to launch that and get that on the shelves at the same time as the can. And that will supplement, we believe, the can and consumer demand. The consumer will have a choice, but we do not want to replace the can with a similar-sized bottle. This will be a larger bottle. We, at the moment, we haven't finalized the exact size, but it's probably likely to be about a 750-mil size resealable. So we're looking to have both products. We're also looking to have different flavors in the bottle so there will be a choice of additional flavors. And hopefully, we'll be able to get that and solidify shelf space and therefore, satisfy consumers and retailers so that there will always be a supply of Hydro on shelves, even though there may at times be some shortages in the can size until we get that -- those supply issues rectified."

And as you say, you've got most of the European markets with a lot more SKUs. But even within the European markets, there is a tremendous disparity between what you've got on shelves in the U.K. and Germany and Spain versus other markets. And it varies pretty dramatically. You also have a lot of the, what I'd call, the sublines, the strategic lines that we've got, the families that haven't yet even been launched. We've launched Ultra, but you really have no coffee and you have very little Rehab in Europe. And we're just sort of going out with Punch and repositioning the juice line. But again, we've launched Hydro pretty much in United Kingdom and Ireland, but we are looking to launch Hydro quite quickly -- not everywhere, but in a number of selected markets in Europe, including South Africa. We think there is a good, good potential for the brand. So -- and then when you go out of that, you go to South America and Asia, the SKUs are much, much more limited. And so we've got just a lot of potential, even if you go down to places like Chile where we're doing a lot of business there. There still is pretty much a handful or so of SKUs. So there is a lot of potential. But if you look to the sort of an average, I would say, you're probably looking at probably 30% to 40% of the SKUs on average in other overseas markets versus the U.S., just as a very, very broad -- across a number of, but that's not on a weighted or any sort of statistical analysis, that's just pretty much anecdotally our gut feel."

And you had spoken to some of the acceleration you're seeing. Is that sort of representative of the acceleration you're seeing? That's question number one. And then, Rodney, for you, question number two, with respect to Java and Muscle Monster. As that supply comes back on, how are you ensuring that's all incremental? You called out the $13 million and $25 million year-to-date drag for the quarter and year-to-date, respectively, if I'm not mistaken. So that's a couple of points to U.S. sales growth. So any comments there with respect to how incremental that could potentially be for the U.S. would be helpful."

We're seeing it as well. So we seem to be ahead of the Nielsen generally, continuing to gain share both internationally and in the U.S. So there's nothing that's inconsistent with our previous growth in the quarter that we are seeing in the month of July. Just is doing better, generally, across the board. With regard to Java and Muscle Monster, where is that incremental, I mean, we've lost shelf space. You look at -- even if you look at Java, our numbers -- I was looking at the numbers on all major channels. Even for our 2 main Java products, which we've basically been in stock most of the time this year, our distribution is down at about 71%. Whereas on our other top brands, we're at in the high 80s and low 90s. So we've still got -- clearly, you lost some distribution even for the 2 main SKUs. The others, if you look at Salted Caramel, which we introduced quite a bit of time ago, that's at 40%. So we've got a lot of opportunity. We've just got to get supplies back. And that is one of the reasons we hesitated a bit earlier because it's one thing getting back supplies in line, it's another thing making sure that we have those supplies on a consistent basis before we go back out and reestablish shelf space and get back shelf space because we obviously don't want another hiccup with retailers. So we really do have quite a bit of upside potential in just improving our supply channels, having products on shelf, getting back our listings for not only the line extensions, Kona and Salted Caramel and Irish, but even just getting back our distribution levels and consistency with Mean Bean and Loca Moca. So we look at that as being positive. And it's going to start basically taking place during this quarter, but it's going to be on an increased rolling basis. And we think that by the fourth quarter, we would have very much be back into where we were. And we look at the coffee category growing pretty well so, and that's been slowed down, I think, even with the issues we've had and with our competitors. But we think that's going to continue to grow and move back into growth. With regard to Muscle Monster, it's the same issue, which is supply. We are also looking and evaluating and going to relaunch and reposition Muscle Monster in an aseptic plastic bottle, which will be a resealable bottle. So Muscle Monster is going to move into a plastic bottle, we think, hopefully, still later this year. We've done some testing with the bottle and the labeling. And hopefully, that's going to be in the position to start in the next few months. And so that transition, we think, will be a positive transition for Muscle Monster to also get it back and give it a kickstart again because we are positive about that sector, which we think we are underrepresented in at the moment. So that's another source of, we think, some potential upside."

Sales continue to be challenging in the beverage industry in the second quarter and remain weak. In the second quarter, net sales were $907.1 million, up 9.6% from $827.5 million in the second quarter of 2016. The company achieved record second quarter gross sales of $1.04 billion, up 9.8% from $945.8 million in the second quarter of 2016.
Unfavorable currency exchange rates reduced net sales by approximately $8.2 million in the 2017 second quarter. The comparable 2016 second quarter net and gross sales included $5 million of accelerated deferred revenue related to distributor terminations. Excluding such accelerated recognition of deferred revenue from the comparable 2016 second quarter, net and gross sales for the 2017 second quarter increased 10.3% and 10.4%, respectively.
Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the second quarter was 64.3% as compared to 62.6% for the comparable 2016 second quarter. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to cost of goods savings as a result of the AFF transaction and product mix in the U.S., which was partially offset by geographic mix and certain increases in other costs.
Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 3% for the 2017 second quarter as compared to 3.2% in the 2016 second quarter.
Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 12.6% compared to 11.2% in the same quarter a year ago. The increase was primarily due to increased sponsorship and endorsement costs and commissions.
General and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were 10.1% as compared to 13.3% in the same quarter last year. Included in general and administrative costs were distributor termination expenses of $0.2 million and $25.3 million for the 2017 and 2016 second quarters, respectively. Included in general and administrative expenses for the 2016 second quarter were AFF transaction-related expenses of $3.6 million and modified Dutch auction tender offer expenses of $1.5 million.
General and administrative expenses, excluding distributor terminations, AFF transaction expenses and stock repurchase expenses, were 10.1% of net sales for the 2017 second quarter compared with 9.6% of net sales for the comparable 2016 second quarter, largely due to an increase in payroll costs.
Payroll expenses were up $10.1 million, primarily due to headcount growth internationally, including to support the launches in China and other countries. And stock-based compensation, a noncash item, was $1.3 million higher.
Legal expenses relating to regulatory matters and litigation concerning the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage, safety and sale of the company's products were $2.4 million in the 2017 second quarter as compared to $3.8 million in the 2016 second quarter.
Our effective tax rate decreased slightly from 36.1% in the 2016 second quarter to 35.9% in the 2017 second quarter, primarily due to an increase in equity compensation deductions.
Net income was $222.6 million in the 2017 second quarter compared to net income of $184.2 million in the 2016 second quarter, an increase of 20.9%. The weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding decreased from 614.9 million for the second quarter of 2016 to 578 million for the second quarter of 2017 as a result of share buybacks, including the modified Dutch auction tender offer which was completed in June 2016. Diluted earnings per share for the 2017 second quarter increased 28.6% to $0.39 from $0.30 in the second quarter of 2016.
We continue to make good progress in the implementation of our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola bottlers globally. Domestically, we transitioned distribution of Monster Energy drink to Coca-Cola bottlers in a part of North Dakota, including Fargo in April 2017. We're also making good progress in the U.S. in nontraditional channels, including food service accounts and e-commerce.
In the EMEA, in the second quarter of 2017, we commenced distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in Kazakhstan, Jordan and Pakistan. Additional launches are planned in the third quarter of 2017 in certain countries in Africa, the Middle East and Eastern Europe. In the second quarter of 2017, we launched the distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in certain countries in the Caribbean. In the second half of 2017, we anticipate launching Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in certain additional countries in Central and South America and in the Caribbean.
In China, during the second quarter of 2017, we continued with launches in 14 new operating units. The 2 remaining operating units in China will launch during July 2017. We also transitioned distribution in Hong Kong and Macau to Coca-Cola bottlers. We continue to make progress towards our planned relaunch in India later this year. We are planning to commence distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in Vietnam and Taiwan in the third quarter.

According to Nielsen reports for the 13 weeks through July 22, 2017, for all outlets combined, namely, convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots, increased by 0.8% versus the same period a year ago. Sales of Monster grew 2.2% in the 13-week period while sales of NOS increased 11.8% and sales of Full Throttle increased 1.1%. Sales of Red Bull increased 2%, sales of Rockstar decreased by 1%, sales of 5-Hour decreased 8.7% and sales of Amp decreased 25.8%.
According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended July 22, 2017, sales in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots in dollars, increased 1.7% over the same period last year.

Sales of Red Bull increased by 2%, Rockstar was down 2.6%, 5-Hour was down 11.3% and Amp was down 23.4%. We point out that the energy shot category has been slowing for some time. And if we exclude the energy shots as well as the energy coffee and energy protein drinks where we have experienced production capacity shortages for the 4 weeks ended July 22, 2017, sales in the convenience and gas channels in dollars, in fact, increased by 4.3% over the same period last year with sales of Monster increasing by 10%.
According to Nielsen, in the 4 weeks ended July 22, 2017, Monster's market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including shots in dollars, increased by 1.5 points over the same period last year to 36.7%. NOS' share increased 0.3 points to 4% and Full Throttle share remained the same at 0.9%. Red Bull's share increased 0.1 point to 35.5%, Rockstar's share was down 0.3 points to 7.6%, 5-Hour's share was lower by 1.2 at 7.1% and Amp's share decreased 0.4 points to 1.1%.
According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended July 22, 2017, sales of Energy Plus Coffee drinks, in dollars, in the convenience and gas channel decreased 11% over the same period last year. Sales of Java Monster were 21.2% lower than in the same period last year, while sales of Starbucks Doubleshot Energy were 0.4% lower. We continue to experience production capacity shortages for Java Monster, which I will address later in the call.
According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada for the 12 weeks ended June 24, 2017, the energy drink category remained flat in dollars. Monster sales increased 11% versus a year ago. Our market share increased 3.1 share points to 31.3%. Red Bull sales decreased 1% and its market share decreased 1.3 points to 37.3%. Rockstar sales decreased 14% and its market share decreased 1.8 points to 16.8%.
According to Nielsen, for all outlets combined in Mexico, the energy drink category grew 7.6% during the month of June 2017. Monster sales increased 22.6%. Our market share in value increased 3.3 points to 27.1% against the comparable period last year. Sales of Burn decreased 37.8%. Burn's market share decreased 2.1 points to 2.9%. Red Bull sales decreased 6.8% and its market share decreased by 1.7 points to 11.1%. Vive 100's market share decreased 0.7 points to 42.3%, while Boost's market share decreased 1.7 points to 8%.
The Nielsen statistics from Mexico cover a single month, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico.
I would like to point out that the Nielsen and IRI numbers for EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen and IRI for EMEA vary from country to country.
According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ending July 2017, the actual 13-week periods vary by a few days between different markets. Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year grew from 13.9% to 17.3% in Great Britain and from 22.3% to 23.1% in France.

Net sales for the Other segment, which includes third-party sales made by AFF, were $6.2 million in the 2017 second quarter as compared to $6.6 million in the same quarter last year. We continue to experience production capacity shortages for our retort products Java Monster and Muscle Monster. To reduce the shortfall, we are manufacturing certain flavors of Java Monster in Europe, which are now available to our customers in the U.S. We will also procure additional production in the U.S. which will be coming on stream in the third quarter of 2017 and will result in additional Java Monster and Muscle Monster volumes being available for distribution to retailers thereafter.
As a result, we anticipate that it will still be a few months before production availability allows us to restore normal supply patterns and fully meet consumer demand that exists for these products. We estimate that net sales were negatively impacted as a result of such production capacity shortages by approximately $13 million in the second quarter and year-to-date by approximately $25 million.
Net sales to customers outside the U.S. were $247.9 million in the 2017 second quarter compared to $200.2 million in the corresponding quarter in 2016.
In local currencies, net sales to customers outside the U.S. were approximately $8.2 million higher. Included in reported geographic sales are our sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the U.S. and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas.
In Europe, the Middle East and Africa, net sales in the second quarter increased 18.6% in dollars and 24.8% in local currencies over the same period last year. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales decreased from 50.8% in the same period last year to 49% during the quarter.
We are pleased with the rollout of certain SKUs in the Ultra range in EMEA markets. In 2017, we have added certain SKUs of Ultra across EMEA with the introduction of Ultra Citron, which will be available in 10 additional EMEA markets in 2017. Various SKUs in the Ultra range are now sold in 33 EMEA markets.
We are also pleased that Monster continued to perform well and gained market share in Great Britain, Germany, France, Spain, Norway, Denmark, Poland, Ireland, Italy, Czech Republic and South Africa.
In Asia Pacific, net sales in the second quarter increased 64.6% in dollars and 66.6% in local currencies over the same period last year. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales increased from 46.1% in the same period last year to 50.7% during the 2017 second quarter.
In Japan, net sales in the quarter increased 53% or 55% in local currency as compared to the same quarter last year. We continue to experience strong performance in Japan.
In South Korea, net sales increased 84.7% or 78.7% in local currency as compared to the same quarter last year.
In Oceania, which includes Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti, French Polynesia, New Caledonia and Guam, net sales decreased 3.1% or minus 4.3% in local currencies as compared to the same quarter last year.
As previously mentioned, we are moving ahead with plans for local production in India with a view to reentering the market in 2017.
In Latin America, including Mexico, and the Caribbean, gross sales in the second quarter increased 28.6% in dollars and 28.8% in local currencies. Net sales in the second quarter increased 25% in dollars and 24.8% in local currencies over the same period last year. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales decreased from 50% in the same period last year to 46.7% during the 2017 second quarter.
Net sales increased in Brazil 849.6% in dollars or 728.8% in local currency, largely due to the transition of Monster to Coca-Cola bottlers which took place on November 1, 2016.
Net sales in Chile increased 35.4% in dollars and 33.4% in local currency.
Turning to the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents amounted to $777.7 million compared to $377.6 million at December 31, 2016. Short-term investments were $323.9 million compared to $220.6 million at December 31, 2016. Long-term investments increased to $48.6 million from $2.4 million at December 31, 2016.
Accounts receivable increased to $537.1 million at June 30, 2017, from $448.1 million at December 31, 2016. Days outstanding for accounts receivables were 47 days compared to 48 days -- 48.2 days at December 31, 2016. Inventories increased to $190.6 million from $162 million at December 31, 2016. Average days of inventory was 53 days at June 30, 2017 compared to 57 days at December 31, 2016.
We launched a line extension of our Mutant brand family, namely, White Lightning, a zero-sugar offering to limited customers in the second quarter, with the general market launch in July. We remain confident about the potential of this brand.
We launched our Monster Hydro energy drinks in 3 flavors. Monster Hydro is a noncarbonated, lightly sweetened energy drink that is packaged in a unique 16.9-ounce PET can, the size of which is exclusive to us in the U.S. at this time. We launched Monster Energy Ultra Violet nationally during the quarter after limited sales with a club store customer the previous quarter. We launched Mango Loco, a new flavor in the Monster Energy juice family, exclusively with a convenience store customer in June and will launch to the general market nationally in September 2017. We also launched Monster Hydro in a 550 ml PET bottle in the United Kingdom and Ireland during the second quarter of 2017. At the end of April 2017, we launched a new Lewis Hamilton signature Monster Energy drink in Great Britain, which was followed by launches in 21 European markets in the second quarter of 2017 and in South Africa in July.
We have a robust innovation pipeline, including a new X-Presso Monster energy drink in 8-ounce slim cans in 2 flavors and NOS Nitrous Mango planned for launch before the year-end in the United States.
We estimate 2017 July gross sales to be approximately 13.8% higher than in July 2016. On a foreign exchange adjusted basis, we estimate July 2017 gross sales to be approximately 14.7% higher than in July 2016. In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives as well as shifts in the timing of production in some instances where our bottlers are responsible for production and unilaterally determine their production schedules, which affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers. We also reiterate that sales over a short period, such as a single month, should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period.
On February 28, the company's Board of Directors authorized a new repurchase program for the repurchase of up to $500 million of the company's outstanding common stock. No shares were repurchased under this repurchase program during the first and second quarters.
In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points. One, we recognized a reduction in raw material costs of $28.6 million in the second quarter as a result of our acquisition of AFF.
Two, North American and international gross margins remain healthy.
Three, while the U.S. Nielsen end market statistics show that the energy category slowed in the U.S. towards the end of the 2016 fourth quarter, it appears to have picked up steam this year as well as in July. Equivalent market statistics for many countries around the world show that the energy category is continuing to grow and that Monster is generally growing ahead of the category. Currency exchange rates continue to affect our results.
The new additions to the Monster family continue to gain momentum and add to the company's sales.
Five, we are excited about the prospects for our company's new product launches.
Six, we are pleased with our performance in our international markets and reiterate the growth potential for us in China, one of the largest energy drink markets globally.
Seven, according to Nielsen, in the last 12 months ended July 1, 2017, Monster is in the top 10 beverage brands in Great Britain on a value basis.
Eight, we have successfully launched or transitioned Monster Energy drinks to Coca-Cola bottlers in a number of countries in the first half of 2017 and anticipate further transitions and launches in the second half of the year.
I'd like to open the floor to questions about the quarter and the year. Thank you."

Or basically that drag dissipates as you're kind of lapping the decline that you started to see last year? And then on Hydro, can you just update us on maybe what you're seeing from a distribution ramp perspective because if you look at the ACV, I think it's still below 40% even though it's come up pretty nicely.

So we think that there will be -- still be some drag, some reduction -- shortages going forward, but we think it will be reduced. But to the extent, we are not sure. And obviously, we are right in the phase now of getting production, and that means getting back our shelf space. And that all takes -- will take a bit of time. With regard to Hydro, your point is noted. And that is correct that the ACV at the moment is at about 40%. So we've, obviously, still got some work to do to get Hydro out and get it. Again, it was sort of launched a little bit off-cycle. And so we are getting it into the trains and into the stores, but it is taking some time. But again, we are -- there are sort of supply constrictions on the number of packages we're able to put out. This obviously has been -- is of concern to us. But unfortunately, we do believe in the package. We feel that the package is important for the product to create the right image and the right personality around the brand and the product. So we are continuing to address the supply issues. And literally, we're selling all we can supply. So we will continue to, I think, improve the supply situation. And as that goes, so we will continue to supply -- to increase and improve our distribution. But that's really a positive side of the brand, that it is pulling and it's received good consumer response. We are looking at addressing the brand with an additional package, which won't be -- have the same supply constraints, slightly larger-sized bottle. And we believe we'll be able to launch that and get that on the shelves at the same time as the can. And that will supplement, we believe, the can and consumer demand. The consumer will have a choice, but we do not want to replace the can with a similar-sized bottle. This will be a larger bottle. We, at the moment, we haven't finalized the exact size, but it's probably likely to be about a 750-mil size resealable. So we're looking to have both products. We're also looking to have different flavors in the bottle so there will be a choice of additional flavors. And hopefully, we'll be able to get that and solidify shelf space and therefore, satisfy consumers and retailers so that there will always be a supply of Hydro on shelves, even though there may at times be some shortages in the can size until we get that -- those supply issues rectified."

But even within the European markets, there is a tremendous disparity between what you've got on shelves in the U.K. and Germany and Spain versus other markets. And it varies pretty dramatically. You also have a lot of the, what I'd call, the sublines, the strategic lines that we've got, the families that haven't yet even been launched. We've launched Ultra, but you really have no coffee and you have very little Rehab in Europe. And we're just sort of going out with Punch and repositioning the juice line. But again, we've launched Hydro pretty much in United Kingdom and Ireland, but we are looking to launch Hydro quite quickly -- not everywhere, but in a number of selected markets in Europe, including South Africa. We think there is a good, good potential for the brand. So -- and then when you go out of that, you go to South America and Asia, the SKUs are much, much more limited. And so we've got just a lot of potential, even if you go down to places like Chile where we're doing a lot of business there. There still is pretty much a handful or so of SKUs. So there is a lot of potential.

You look at -- even if you look at Java, our numbers -- I was looking at the numbers on all major channels. Even for our 2 main Java products, which we've basically been in stock most of the time this year, our distribution is down at about 71%. Whereas on our other top brands, we're at in the high-80s and low-90s. So we've still got -- clearly, you lost some distribution even for the 2 main SKUs. The others, if you look at Salted Caramel, which we introduced quite a bit of time ago, that's at 40%. So we've got a lot of opportunity. We've just got to get supplies back. And that is one of the reasons we hesitated a bit earlier because it's one thing getting back supplies in line, it's another thing making sure that we have those supplies on a consistent basis before we go back out and reestablish shelf space and get back shelf space because we obviously don't want another hiccup with retailers. So we really do have quite a bit of upside potential in just improving our supply channels, having products on shelf, getting back our listings for not only the line extensions, Kona and Salted Caramel and Irish, but even just getting back our distribution levels and consistency with Mean Bean and Loca Moca. So we look at that as being positive. And it's going to start basically taking place during this quarter, but it's going to be on an increased rolling basis. And we think that by the fourth quarter, we would have very much be back into where we were. And we look at the coffee category growing pretty well so, and that's been slowed down, I think, even with the issues we've had and with our competitors. But we think that's going to continue to grow and move back into growth. With regard to Muscle Monster, it's the same issue, which is supply. We are also looking and evaluating and going to relaunch and reposition Muscle Monster in an aseptic plastic bottle, which will be a resealable bottle. So Muscle Monster is going to move into a plastic bottle, we think, hopefully, still later this year. We've done some testing with the bottle and the labeling. And hopefully, that's going to be in the position to start in the next few months. And so that transition, we think, will be a positive transition for Muscle Monster to also get it back and give it a kickstart again because we are positive about that sector, which we think we are underrepresented in at the moment. So that's another source of, we think, some potential upside."

Sales continue to be challenging in the beverage industry in the second quarter and remain weak. In the second quarter, net sales were $907.1 million, up 9.6% from $827.5 million in the second quarter of 2016. The company achieved record second quarter gross sales of $1.04 billion, up 9.8% from $945.8 million in the second quarter of 2016.
Unfavorable currency exchange rates reduced net sales by approximately $8.2 million in the 2017 second quarter. The comparable 2016 second quarter net and gross sales included $5 million of accelerated deferred revenue related to distributor terminations. Excluding such accelerated recognition of deferred revenue from the comparable 2016 second quarter, net and gross sales for the 2017 second quarter increased 10.3% and 10.4%, respectively.
Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the second quarter was 64.3% as compared to 62.6% for the comparable 2016 second quarter. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to cost of goods savings as a result of the AFF transaction and product mix in the U.S., which was partially offset by geographic mix and certain increases in other costs.
Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 3% for the 2017 second quarter as compared to 3.2% in the 2016 second quarter.
Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 12.6% compared to 11.2% in the same quarter a year ago. The increase was primarily due to increased sponsorship and endorsement costs and commissions.
General and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were 10.1% as compared to 13.3% in the same quarter last year. Included in general and administrative costs were distributor termination expenses of $0.2 million and $25.3 million for the 2017 and 2016 second quarters, respectively. Included in general and administrative expenses for the 2016 second quarter were AFF transaction-related expenses of $3.6 million and modified Dutch auction tender offer expenses of $1.5 million.
General and administrative expenses, excluding distributor terminations, AFF transaction expenses and stock repurchase expenses, were 10.1% of net sales for the 2017 second quarter compared with 9.6% of net sales for the comparable 2016 second quarter, largely due to an increase in payroll costs.
Payroll expenses were up $10.1 million, primarily due to headcount growth internationally, including to support the launches in China and other countries. And stock-based compensation, a noncash item, was $1.3 million higher.
Legal expenses relating to regulatory matters and litigation concerning the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage, safety and sale of the company's products were $2.4 million in the 2017 second quarter as compared to $3.8 million in the 2016 second quarter.
Our effective tax rate decreased slightly from 36.1% in the 2016 second quarter to 35.9% in the 2017 second quarter, primarily due to an increase in equity compensation deductions.
Net income was $222.6 million in the 2017 second quarter compared to net income of $184.2 million in the 2016 second quarter, an increase of 20.9%. The weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding decreased from 614.9 million for the second quarter of 2016 to 578 million for the second quarter of 2017 as a result of share buybacks, including the modified Dutch auction tender offer which was completed in June 2016. Diluted earnings per share for the 2017 second quarter increased 28.6% to $0.39 from $0.30 in the second quarter of 2016.
We continue to make good progress in the implementation of our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola bottlers globally. Domestically, we transitioned distribution of Monster Energy drink to Coca-Cola bottlers in a part of North Dakota, including Fargo in April 2017. We're also making good progress in the U.S. in nontraditional channels, including food service accounts and e-commerce.
In the EMEA, in the second quarter of 2017, we commenced distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in Kazakhstan, Jordan and Pakistan. Additional launches are planned in the third quarter of 2017 in certain countries in Africa, the Middle East and Eastern Europe. In the second quarter of 2017, we launched the distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in certain countries in the Caribbean. In the second half of 2017, we anticipate launching Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in certain additional countries in Central and South America and in the Caribbean.
In China, during the second quarter of 2017, we continued with launches in 14 new operating units. The 2 remaining operating units in China will launch during July 2017. We also transitioned distribution in Hong Kong and Macau to Coca-Cola bottlers. We continue to make progress towards our planned relaunch in India later this year. We are planning to commence distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in Vietnam and Taiwan in the third quarter.
Raw material cost savings from the AFF transaction were approximately $28.1 million in the second quarter of 2017."

According to Nielsen reports for the 13 weeks through July 22, 2017, for all outlets combined, namely, convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots, increased by 0.8% versus the same period a year ago. Sales of Monster grew 2.2% in the 13-week period while sales of NOS increased 11.8% and sales of Full Throttle increased 1.1%. Sales of Red Bull increased 2%, sales of Rockstar decreased by 1%, sales of 5-Hour decreased 8.7% and sales of Amp decreased 25.8%.
According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended July 22, 2017, sales in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots in dollars, increased 1.7% over the same period last year. Sales of Monster increased by 6% over the same period last year, while NOS was up 9.5% and Full Throttle sales increased 1.7%. Sales of Red Bull increased by 2%, Rockstar was down 2.6%, 5-Hour was down 11.3% and Amp was down 23.4%. We point out that the energy shot category has been slowing for some time. And if we exclude the energy shots as well as the energy coffee and energy protein drinks where we have experienced production capacity shortages for the 4 weeks ended July 22, 2017, sales in the convenience and gas channels in dollars, in fact, increased by 4.3% over the same period last year with sales of Monster increasing by 10%.
According to Nielsen, in the 4 weeks ended July 22, 2017, Monster's market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including shots in dollars, increased by 1.5 points over the same period last year to 36.7%. NOS' share increased 0.3 points to 4% and Full Throttle share remained the same at 0.9%. Red Bull's share increased 0.1 point to 35.5%, Rockstar's share was down 0.3 points to 7.6%, 5-Hour's share was lower by 1.2 at 7.1% and Amp's share decreased 0.4 points to 1.1%.
According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended July 22, 2017, sales of Energy Plus Coffee drinks, in dollars, in the convenience and gas channel decreased 11% over the same period last year. Sales of Java Monster were 21.2% lower than in the same period last year, while sales of Starbucks Doubleshot Energy were 0.4% lower. We continue to experience production capacity shortages for Java Monster, which I will address later in the call.
According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada for the 12 weeks ended June 24, 2017, the energy drink category remained flat in dollars. Monster sales increased 11% versus a year ago. Our market share increased 3.1 share points to 31.3%. Red Bull sales decreased 1% and its market share decreased 1.3 points to 37.3%. Rockstar sales decreased 14% and its market share decreased 1.8 points to 16.8%.
According to Nielsen, for all outlets combined in Mexico, the energy drink category grew 7.6% during the month of June 2017. Monster sales increased 22.6%. Our market share in value increased 3.3 points to 27.1% against the comparable period last year. Sales of Burn decreased 37.8%. Burn's market share decreased 2.1 points to 2.9%. Red Bull sales decreased 6.8% and its market share decreased by 1.7 points to 11.1%. Vive 100's market share decreased 0.7 points to 42.3%, while Boost's market share decreased 1.7 points to 8%.
The Nielsen statistics from Mexico cover a single month, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico.
I would like to point out that the Nielsen and IRI numbers for EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen and IRI for EMEA vary from country to country.
According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ending July 2017, the actual 13-week periods vary by a few days between different markets. Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year grew from 13.9% to 17.3% in Great Britain and from 22.3% to 23.1% in France.
According to Nielsen, for the period ending June 2017, the actual 13-week periods vary by a few days between different markets. Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year grew from 13.9% to 14.7% in Germany, from 10.5% to 11% in Norway, from 24.9% to 26.5% in Spain, from 10.3% to 11.4% in Belgium, from 11.7% to 12.4% in Czech Republic, from 7.6% to 11.1% in Italy, from 7.9% to 10.3% in Ireland and from 13% to 16.2% in South Africa.
According to Nielsen, in the latest 13-week period ended June 2017, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year declined from 10.7% to 9.6% in Sweden, although the retail value of sales grew 18.1% in the same comparative period and declined from 7.4% to 5.6% in the Netherlands, which is being addressed.
According to IRI, Monster has increased its market share from 27.4% to 34.5% in Greece in the 13 weeks ended June 2017.

And Monster's market share in value in Brazil for the month of June 2017 increased from 2.5% to 11.5% as compared to the same period last year.

Net sales of the Monster Energy Drinks segment for the second quarter of 2017 increased 9.7% from $743.5 million to $815.3 million from the comparable period last year. Net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment in the second quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $8.3 million of foreign currency movements.
Net sales for the Strategic Brands segment were $85.6 million for the second quarter as compared to $77.4 million in the same quarter last year. Net sales for the company's Strategic Brands segment were positively impacted by approximately $0.1 million of foreign currency movements in the quarter.
Net sales for the Other segment, which includes third-party sales made by AFF, were $6.2 million in the 2017 second quarter as compared to $6.6 million in the same quarter last year. We continue to experience production capacity shortages for our retort products Java Monster and Muscle Monster. To reduce the shortfall, we are manufacturing certain flavors of Java Monster in Europe, which are now available to our customers in the U.S. We will also procure additional production in the U.S. which will be coming on stream in the third quarter of 2017 and will result in additional Java Monster and Muscle Monster volumes being available for distribution to retailers thereafter.
As a result, we anticipate that it will still be a few months before production availability allows us to restore normal supply patterns and fully meet consumer demand that exists for these products. We estimate that net sales were negatively impacted as a result of such production capacity shortages by approximately $13 million in the second quarter and year-to-date by approximately $25 million.
Net sales to customers outside the U.S. were $247.9 million in the 2017 second quarter compared to $200.2 million in the corresponding quarter in 2016.

In Europe, the Middle East and Africa, net sales in the second quarter increased 18.6% in dollars and 24.8% in local currencies over the same period last year. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales decreased from 50.8% in the same period last year to 49% during the quarter.
We are pleased with the rollout of certain SKUs in the Ultra range in EMEA markets. In 2017, we have added certain SKUs of Ultra across EMEA with the introduction of Ultra Citron, which will be available in 10 additional EMEA markets in 2017. Various SKUs in the Ultra range are now sold in 33 EMEA markets.
We are also pleased that Monster continued to perform well and gained market share in Great Britain, Germany, France, Spain, Norway, Denmark, Poland, Ireland, Italy, Czech Republic and South Africa.
In Asia Pacific, net sales in the second quarter increased 64.6% in dollars and 66.6% in local currencies over the same period last year. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales increased from 46.1% in the same period last year to 50.7% during the 2017 second quarter.

Net sales in Chile increased 35.4% in dollars and 33.4% in local currency.
Turning to the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents amounted to $777.7 million compared to $377.6 million at December 31, 2016. Short-term investments were $323.9 million compared to $220.6 million at December 31, 2016. Long-term investments increased to $48.6 million from $2.4 million at December 31, 2016.
Accounts receivable increased to $537.1 million at June 30, 2017, from $448.1 million at December 31, 2016. Days outstanding for accounts receivables were 47 days compared to 48 days -- 48.2 days at December 31, 2016. Inventories increased to $190.6 million from $162 million at December 31, 2016. Average days of inventory was 53 days at June 30, 2017 compared to 57 days at December 31, 2016.
We launched a line extension of our Mutant brand family, namely, White Lightning, a zero-sugar offering to limited customers in the second quarter, with the general market launch in July. We remain confident about the potential of this brand.
We launched our Monster Hydro energy drinks in 3 flavors. Monster Hydro is a noncarbonated, lightly sweetened energy drink that is packaged in a unique 16.9-ounce PET can, the size of which is exclusive to us in the U.S. at this time. We launched Monster Energy Ultra Violet nationally during the quarter after limited sales with a club store customer the previous quarter. We launched Mango Loco, a new flavor in the Monster Energy juice family, exclusively with a convenience store customer in June and will launch to the general market nationally in September 2017. We also launched Monster Hydro in a 550 ml PET bottle in the United Kingdom and Ireland during the second quarter of 2017. At the end of April 2017, we launched a new Lewis Hamilton signature Monster Energy drink in Great Britain, which was followed by launches in 21 European markets in the second quarter of 2017 and in South Africa in July.
We have a robust innovation pipeline, including a new X-Presso Monster energy drink in 8-ounce slim cans in 2 flavors and NOS Nitrous Mango planned for launch before the year-end in the United States.
We estimate 2017 July gross sales to be approximately 13.8% higher than in July 2016. On a foreign exchange adjusted basis, we estimate July 2017 gross sales to be approximately 14.7% higher than in July 2016. In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives as well as shifts in the timing of production in some instances where our bottlers are responsible for production and unilaterally determine their production schedules, which affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers. We also reiterate that sales over a short period, such as a single month, should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period.
On February 28, the company's Board of Directors authorized a new repurchase program for the repurchase of up to $500 million of the company's outstanding common stock. No shares were repurchased under this repurchase program during the first and second quarters.
In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points. One, we recognized a reduction in raw material costs of $28.6 million in the second quarter as a result of our acquisition of AFF.
Two, North American and international gross margins remain healthy.
Three, while the U.S. Nielsen end market statistics show that the energy category slowed in the U.S. towards the end of the 2016 fourth quarter, it appears to have picked up steam this year as well as in July. Equivalent market statistics for many countries around the world show that the energy category is continuing to grow and that Monster is generally growing ahead of the category. Currency exchange rates continue to affect our results.
The new additions to the Monster family continue to gain momentum and add to the company's sales.
Five, we are excited about the prospects for our company's new product launches.
Six, we are pleased with our performance in our international markets and reiterate the growth potential for us in China, one of the largest energy drink markets globally.
Seven, according to Nielsen, in the last 12 months ended July 1, 2017, Monster is in the top 10 beverage brands in Great Britain on a value basis.
Eight, we have successfully launched or transitioned Monster Energy drinks to Coca-Cola bottlers in a number of countries in the first half of 2017 and anticipate further transitions and launches in the second half of the year.
I'd like to open the floor to questions about the quarter and the year. Thank you."

Or basically that drag dissipates as you're kind of lapping the decline that you started to see last year? And then on Hydro, can you just update us on maybe what you're seeing from a distribution ramp perspective because if you look at the ACV, I think it's still below 40% even though it's come up pretty nicely. And that's still below the number that you're seeing for the Green and the Ultra. So can -- do you think that you can get to that level pretty quickly from a Hydro perspective?"

We think that there still will be a drag from July, but we are seeing every month, we are seeing improved deliveries. And we think that we will be fully up to speed towards the end of the quarter. So we think that there will be -- still be some drag, some reduction -- shortages going forward, but we think it will be reduced. But to the extent, we are not sure. And obviously, we are right in the phase now of getting production, and that means getting back our shelf space. And that all takes -- will take a bit of time. With regard to Hydro, your point is noted. And that is correct that the ACV at the moment is at about 40%. So we've, obviously, still got some work to do to get Hydro out and get it. Again, it was sort of launched a little bit off-cycle. And so we are getting it into the trains and into the stores, but it is taking some time. But again, we are -- there are sort of supply constrictions on the number of packages we're able to put out. This obviously has been -- is of concern to us. But unfortunately, we do believe in the package. We feel that the package is important for the product to create the right image and the right personality around the brand and the product. So we are continuing to address the supply issues. And literally, we're selling all we can supply. So we will continue to, I think, improve the supply situation. And as that goes, so we will continue to supply -- to increase and improve our distribution. But that's really a positive side of the brand, that it is pulling and it's received good consumer response. We are looking at addressing the brand with an additional package, which won't be -- have the same supply constraints, slightly larger-sized bottle. And we believe we'll be able to launch that and get that on the shelves at the same time as the can. And that will supplement, we believe, the can and consumer demand. The consumer will have a choice, but we do not want to replace the can with a similar-sized bottle. This will be a larger bottle. We, at the moment, we haven't finalized the exact size, but it's probably likely to be about a 750-mil size resealable. So we're looking to have both products. We're also looking to have different flavors in the bottle so there will be a choice of additional flavors. And hopefully, we'll be able to get that and solidify shelf space and therefore, satisfy consumers and retailers so that there will always be a supply of Hydro on shelves, even though there may at times be some shortages in the can size until we get that -- those supply issues rectified."

And as you say, you've got most of the European markets with a lot more SKUs. But even within the European markets, there is a tremendous disparity between what you've got on shelves in the U.K. and Germany and Spain versus other markets. And it varies pretty dramatically. You also have a lot of the, what I'd call, the sublines, the strategic lines that we've got, the families that haven't yet even been launched. We've launched Ultra, but you really have no coffee and you have very little Rehab in Europe. And we're just sort of going out with Punch and repositioning the juice line. But again, we've launched Hydro pretty much in United Kingdom and Ireland, but we are looking to launch Hydro quite quickly -- not everywhere, but in a number of selected markets in Europe, including South Africa. We think there is a good, good potential for the brand. So -- and then when you go out of that, you go to South America and Asia, the SKUs are much, much more limited. And so we've got just a lot of potential, even if you go down to places like Chile where we're doing a lot of business there. There still is pretty much a handful or so of SKUs. So there is a lot of potential. But if you look to the sort of an average, I would say, you're probably looking at probably 30% to 40% of the SKUs on average in other overseas markets versus the U.S., just as a very, very broad -- across a number of, but that's not on a weighted or any sort of statistical analysis, that's just pretty much anecdotally our gut feel."

And then, Rodney, for you, question number two, with respect to Java and Muscle Monster. As that supply comes back on, how are you ensuring that's all incremental? You called out the $13 million and $25 million year-to-date drag for the quarter and year-to-date, respectively, if I'm not mistaken. So that's a couple of points to U.S. sales growth.

We're seeing it as well. So we seem to be ahead of the Nielsen generally, continuing to gain share both internationally and in the U.S. So there's nothing that's inconsistent with our previous growth in the quarter that we are seeing in the month of July. Just is doing better, generally, across the board. With regard to Java and Muscle Monster, where is that incremental, I mean, we've lost shelf space. You look at -- even if you look at Java, our numbers -- I was looking at the numbers on all major channels. Even for our 2 main Java products, which we've basically been in stock most of the time this year, our distribution is down at about 71%. Whereas on our other top brands, we're at in the high 80s and low 90s. So we've still got -- clearly, you lost some distribution even for the 2 main SKUs. The others, if you look at Salted Caramel, which we introduced quite a bit of time ago, that's at 40%. So we've got a lot of opportunity. We've just got to get supplies back. And that is one of the reasons we hesitated a bit earlier because it's one thing getting back supplies in line, it's another thing making sure that we have those supplies on a consistent basis before we go back out and reestablish shelf space and get back shelf space because we obviously don't want another hiccup with retailers. So we really do have quite a bit of upside potential in just improving our supply channels, having products on shelf, getting back our listings for not only the line extensions, Kona and Salted Caramel and Irish, but even just getting back our distribution levels and consistency with Mean Bean and Loca Moca. So we look at that as being positive. And it's going to start basically taking place during this quarter, but it's going to be on an increased rolling basis. And we think that by the fourth quarter, we would have very much be back into where we were. And we look at the coffee category growing pretty well so, and that's been slowed down, I think, even with the issues we've had and with our competitors. But we think that's going to continue to grow and move back into growth. With regard to Muscle Monster, it's the same issue, which is supply. We are also looking and evaluating and going to relaunch and reposition Muscle Monster in an aseptic plastic bottle, which will be a resealable bottle. So Muscle Monster is going to move into a plastic bottle, we think, hopefully, still later this year. We've done some testing with the bottle and the labeling. And hopefully, that's going to be in the position to start in the next few months. And so that transition, we think, will be a positive transition for Muscle Monster to also get it back and give it a kickstart again because we are positive about that sector, which we think we are underrepresented in at the moment. So that's another source of, we think, some potential upside."

Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the third quarter was 62.6% as compared to 63.8% for the comparable 2016 third quarter. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to geographic sales mix as our international operations generally have lower profit margins, product sales mix, as well as increases in other costs. Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 3.2% for the 2017 third quarter as compared to 3.1% in the 2016 third quarter.
Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 12.7% compared to 12.1% in the same quarter a year ago. The increase was primarily due to increased sponsorship and endorsement costs, commissions, merchandise displays and trade development. General and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were 11.8% as compared to 11.7% in the same quarter last year, including general and administrative cost to distributed -- expenses of $15.9 million and $4.7 million for the 2017 and 2016 third quarters, respectively.
General and administrative expenses, excluding distributed terminations were 10.1% of net sales for the 2017 third quarter compared with 11.1% of net sales in the comparable 2016 third quarter.
Favorable expenses were up $6.5 million primarily due to headcount growth internationally, including to support the launches in China and other countries and stock-based compensation, a noncash item was $1.1 million higher.
-- Expenses relating to regulatory matters and litigation concerning the advertising, marketing, promotion usage, safety and sale of the company's products were $2.9 million in the 2017 third quarter as compared to $4.9 million in the 2016 third quarter.
Our effective tax rate decreased from 33.8% in the 2016 third quarter to 31.9% in the 2017 third quarter primarily due to profit driven by foreign subsidiaries in lower tax jurisdictions. Net income was $218.7 million in the 2017 third quarter compared to net income of $191.6 million in the 2016 third quarter, an increase of 14.1%. The weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding decreased from 583.3 million for the third quarter 2016 to 578.4 million for the third quarter of 2017 as a result of share buyback. Diluted earnings per share for the 2017 third quarter increased 15.1% to $0.38 from $0.33 in the third quarter of 2016. We estimate that distributed termination expenses in the 2016 third quarter reduced reported earnings by approximately $0.02 per share after tax.

We launched a line extension of our brand family and white lightening, a 0 sugar offering, for the general market in July. We remain confident about the potential of this brand. We launched Mango Loco, a new flavor in the Monster Energy juice family exclusively with the convenience costumer in June and launched to the general market nationally in September 2017. We also launched Monster Energy Fury in September 2017 in Nigeria. We are in the process of launching Espresso Monster in 2 flavors as well as NOS Nitro Mango in the United States. Sales of Monster Hydro which is launched in the 550 ML PET bottle in United Kingdom and Ireland during the second quarter of 2017 have been encouraging. The Lewis Hamilton signature Monster Energy drink launched in the second quarter and is now available in 22 EMEA markets including South America.

We estimate October 2017 gross sales to be approximately 19.9% higher than in October 2016. On the foreign exchange adjusted basis, we estimate October 2017 growth sales to be approximately 18.6% higher than in October 2016. In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors. Factors, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distribution centers, as well as shifts in the timing of production in some instances where our bottlers are responsible for production and unilaterally determine their production schedules, which affect the dates in which we invoice such bottlers. We note that in October 2017, there were 22 selling days as compared to 21 selling days in October 2016.
We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month should not necessarily be in a regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period. 
On February 28, 2017, the company's Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program for the repurchase of up to 500 million of the company's outstanding common stock. During the third quarter, we purchased 4.5 million shares of common stock at an average purchase price of $54.91 per share for a total of $248.8 million excluding broker commissions.
In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points. We recognized a reduction in raw material cost of $27.7 million the third quarter as a result of our acquisition of AFF. North America and international gross margins remain healthy. The U.S. Nielsen convenience markets statistics for the 4 weeks ended October 21, 2017, reflect the company achieved nits highest market share in category dollars as a 42.3% market share and that the Monster Energy brand achieved its highest market share in the energy category at a 37.2% market share.
Equivalent market statistics from many countries around the world show that the energy category is continuing to grow and that Monster is generally growing ahead of the category. The new additions to the Monster family continue to add to the company sales. We're excited about the prospect for our new product launches. We are pleased with our performance in our international markets and reiterate the growth potential for us in China, one of the largest energy drinks markets globally. we have successfully launched or transitioned Monster Energy drinks to Coca-Cola Bottlers in a number of markets this year and anticipate further transitions and launches.
I'd like to open the floor to questions about the quarter."

So on balance this quarter, there was -- with the Java coming back on stream, there was a reduction in the overall margin because of those items.

We are positive for the coffee category and that is why we are right in the throes literally this week of starting to sell and launch Espresso Monster, and we will be coming, launching early the new café Monster in glass bottle. So we think there is good growth potential for the coffee category and the coffee plus energy category. We think it's a good growth category, beverages generally and for us.

Hydro, we have really -- a really good response both to the package and to the ingredients and taste. So both of them have Hydro well, which makes us very positive for this sort of sub-brand or subcategory. We have continued to experience production challenges and being able to get enough cans and that's been a challenge. So while we look at distribution and sales numbers, we think those numbers have been negatively affected by the fact that they don't actually relate or -- and give the full story because we're out of stock all of the time, when you're out of stock, it doesn't show in the Nielsen numbers. So we believe the result of actually been more positive than are reflected in the actual sales according to the Nielsen. And that is consistent with our feedback from our -- from the market and the field and from retailers. So we are very positive about it. The way we're addressing that is we will be launching a line of 4 SKUs, 1 we'll probably going to take 1 of the 3 SKUs and convert that into 750 ml bottles and we're going to have 3 other 750 ml PET bottles, one of which will be a 0-calorie, 0 sugar product. So with those 4 products being launched early in 2018, then we will continue to maintain our sales of the cans. We are looking and are engaged in negotiations to secure additional capacity and additional production facilities to make the plastic can, the PET can because we do believe that is a very attractive package and it is I think important for the brand. So ultimately, once we get that rectified, we'll obviously expand the offerings in the PET can. But so going out from an early point next year, we will have PET cans and a 750 ml with a 25-ounce plastic bottle. So we believe that that will cater for the out of stocks and the erratic supply because you'll have 1 or the other products in stock pretty much at all times in stores, and we are positive about Hydro as being a new category for us and a new growth area for us in 2018."

We are learning how to market and promote our products, distribute our products in China. We had some challenges in basically securing space for us, basically there's no real energy category. So it's not as though you can focus on energy category and say you have got an energy product, let's put a new product in the energy category. So there has been some struggle with the Coke bottlers where they focus and perhaps the easier way where they believe they were doing adequate job is to struggling to find a position in the product, they find position in the Coca-Cola and the product goes into the Coke cooler. Now that seems fine. But ultimately if the other products by the Red Bull Gold or which is the leader in the category are being sold in an independent gold door are in the warm shelf, the consumer is not expected to go into the Coke cooler and find the energy drink and were really going through a learning curve with our bottlers and try to explain to them that the first is not in the Coke cooler. The first is being and the essential distribution point is to be right next to Red Bull. And if you get a secondary point of distribution, which is obviously always positive, then you will go into the Coke cooler with that second redistribution point. So that is just some educational challenge to really get and communicate that to the very, very big sales force. So on the 1 hand, you got this really big sales force available to us, which is very big positive. On the other hand, they are used is selling and putting their products into the Coke door and into the Coke cooler, where they have many of them. We are really having to refine that and tweak that slightly and that's part of the challenge we have. So we remain very positive and we believe that it's going to continue to grow. Our sales are going to grow and it's a very, very important market for us. It's just going through a learning curve and getting everything down so as we continue to progress. So that is really what we can China, sales are good. That's substantial. If you look at other markets and comparable other markets we've launched at, sales are higher. But we are working through these operational challenges and we'll get through them, there's no doubt. It's just a question of getting them in having the time to train everybody and it is and what the priorities are. So that's really our update on China."

With regard to Mutant, we're still putting our heads down. We are looking at expanding our distribution and our channels. We believe that the brand has got good potential. We are continuing to put promotional efforts behind the brand this year, and we have the bottlers support, and we will continue to put focus on Mutant, and we see that as a long-term potential benefit than good opportunity for the company. But it is, again, looking at analysis if you look at the brands in the soft drinks industry and average age of the brands, all decades all we're going up against, we're doing quite well if you look at where we are in relation to the other brands. And we are going to continue -- we'll continue to make progress against them as we continue to develop the brand. We're doing some testing at the moment. We're going out to test a 38 ml cap as opposed to the 26 ml, which is really, really looks good on in the product. It does transformed the visual image of the product and its position. And as soon as we get some input back from some key channels and key accounts, we're going -- we are testing this larger cap format in, we will determine whether will actually transition all the production into the larger cap or stay with the traditional 28 ml cap that you normally use for soda products. That's the 1 thing we are looking in the Mutant line and we think that this is so far out from our own feeling internally is that we think that this cap will be quite a positive addition to the line going forward."

The global beverage industry generally continues to face headwinds, although the energy category continues to gain momentum. In the third quarter, net sales were $909.5 million, up 15.4% from $788 million in the third quarter of 2016. The company recorded third quarter gross sales of $1.04 billion, up 14.1% from $913.3 million in the third quarter of 2016.
Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the third quarter was 62.6% as compared to 63.8% for the comparable 2016 third quarter. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to geographic sales mix as our international operations generally have lower profit margins, product sales mix, as well as the increases in other costs. Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 3.2% for the 2017 third quarter as compared to 3.1% in the 2016 third quarter.
Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 12.7% compared to 12.1% in the same quarter a year ago. The increase was primarily due to increased sponsorship and endorsement costs, commissions, merchandise displays and trade development. General and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were 11.8% as compared to 11.7% in the same quarter last year. Included in general and administrative costs were distributor termination expenses of $15.9 million and $4.7 million for the 2017 and 2016 third quarters, respectively.
General and administrative expenses, excluding distributor terminations were 10.1% of net sales for the 2017 third quarter compared with 11.1% of net sales for the comparable 2016 third quarter.
Payroll expenses were up $6.5 million, primarily due to headcount growth internationally, including to support the launches in China and other countries and stock-based compensation, a noncash item, was $1.1 million higher.
Legal expenses relating to regulatory matters and litigation concerning the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage, safety and sale of the company's products were $2.9 million in the 2017 third quarter as compared to $4.9 million in the 2016 third quarter.
Our effective tax rate decreased from 33.8% in the 2016 third quarter to 31.9% in the 2017 third quarter primarily due to profits earned by foreign subsidiaries in lower tax jurisdictions. Net income was $218.7 million in the 2017 third quarter compared to net income of $191.6 million in the 2016 third quarter, an increase of 14.1%. The weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding decreased from 583.3 million for the third quarter of 2016 to 578.4 million for the third quarter of 2017 as a result of share buyback. Diluted earnings per share for the 2017 third quarter increased 15.1% to $0.38 from $0.33 in the third quarter of 2016. We estimate that distributor termination expenses in the 2016 third quarter reduced reported earnings by approximately $0.02 per share after tax.
We continue to make good progress in the implementation of our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola bottlers globally. We are also making good progress in the U.S. in nontraditional channels, including food service, accounts and e-commerce.
In EMEA, we commenced distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in Georgia and Kuwait in the third quarter of 2017 and in Ghana and Morocco in October 2017. Additional launches are planned during the fourth quarter of 2017 and in the first quarter of 2018.
In the third quarter of 2017, we commenced distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in Nicaragua. And in October, we transitioned Monster Energy in the Bahamas, Grenada and Jamaica,  the latter not to a Coca-Cola bottler. We are also planning to launch in and/or transition to additional countries in the Caribbean and Central and South America in 2018.
In China, during the third quarter of 2017, we launched the 2 -- the final 2 operating units and are now focusing our efforts towards establishing Monster in the country with an emphasis on key cities and accounts.  We also transitioned Vietnam and have begun distribution in Taiwan. We're also planning to relaunch Monster in India. 
Raw material cost savings from the AFF transaction were approximately $27.7 million in the third quarter of 2017 as compared to $23.3 million in the third quarter of 2016. According to Nielsen reports for the 13 weeks through October 21, 2017, all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots increased by 2.6% versus the same period a year ago.
Sales of Monster grew 6.6% in the 13-week period, while sales of NOS increased 10.3%, and sales of Full Throttle decreased 1%. Sales of Red Bull increased 2.8%. Sales of Rockstar increased by 0.2%. Sales of 5-hour decreased 6.4% and sales of Amp decreased 32.2%. 
According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended October 21, 2017, sales in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots in dollars, increased 3.6% over the same period last year. Sales of Monster increased by 7.9% over the same period last year while NOS was up 5.8% and Full Throttle sales decreased 3.6%. Sales of Red Bull increased by 5.1%, Rockstar was up 1%, 5-hour was down 6.6% and Amp was down 39.4%.
We pointed out that the energy shot category has been slowing for some time. If we exclude energy shots, as well as energy coffee and energy protein, where we have experienced production capacity shortages, for the 4 weeks ended October 21, 2017, sales in the convenience and gas channel in dollars in fact increased by 5.8% over the same period last year, with sales of Monster increasing by 11%.
According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended October 21, 2017, Monster's market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots in dollars increased by 1.5 points over the same period last year to 37.2%. Monster share increased 0.1 point to 4.1% and Full Throttle share decreased 0.1 point to 0.9%. Red Bull share increased 0.5 point to 35%; Rockstar share was down 0.2 point to 7.8%; 5-hour's share was lower by 0.7 point at 6.9%, and Amp's share decreased by 0.6 point to 0.9%.
According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended October 21, 2017, sales of energy plus coffee drinks in dollars in the convenience and gas channel decreased to 8.6% over the same period last year. Sales of Java Monster were 12.2% lower than in the same period last year, while sales of Starbucks Doubleshot Energy were 4.8% lower. 
We worked through our production capacity shortages for both Java Monster and Muscle Monster. We have secured additional production of Java Monster and Muscle Monster in the United States, which came online in the third quarter of 2017. Those products  came off allocation at the end of the quarter.
 Such production to get an additional production available to us in Europe has eliminated our shortages for Java Monster and Muscle Monster. Together with our bottling partners, we are currently focused on regaining lost shelf space for these products.
According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada, for the 12 weeks ended August 19, 2017, the energy drink category increased 2% in dollars. Monster sales increased 5% versus a year ago. Our market share increased 0.8 share points to 32.1%; Red Bull sales remained the same, and its market share decreased 1.4 points to 37.8%. Rockstar sales remained the same, and its market share increased by 0.3 point to 15.9%.
According to Nielsen, for all outlets combined in Mexico, the energy drink category grew 6% during the month of September 2017. Monster sales increased 34.8%. Our market share in value increased 6.1 points to 28.5% against the comparable period last year. Sales of Burn decreased 46.4%. Burn's market share decreased 2.4 points to 2.5%. Red Bull sales decreased 1.6% and its market share decreased by 0.8 points to 10.8%.
Vive 100's market share decreased 4 points to 40.2%, while Boost's market share decreased 0.5 point to 8.8%. The Nielsen statistics for Mexico covers single months which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain which dominates the market.
Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by 1 or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico.
I'd like to point out that the Nielsen and IRI numbers for EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen and IRI for EMEA vary from country to country. According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ending October 8, 2017, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year grew from 14.3% to 18.5% in Great Britain from 8.7% to 13.2% in Italy and in France from 22.7% to 24%.

We are pleased with the rollout of certain SKUs in the Ultra range in EMEA markets.

Various SKUs in the Ultra range are now sold in 35 EMEA markets.

Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales remained the same at 47.6% during the 2017 third quarter.

Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $465.6 million compared to $377.6 million at December 31, 2016. Short-term investments were $630.3 million compared to $220.6 million at December 31, 2016. Long-term investments increased to $7 million from $2.4 million at December 31, 2016.
Accounts receivable increased to $535.3 million at September 30, 2017, from $448.1 million at December 31, 2016. Days outstanding for accounts receivables were 46.7 days compared to 48.2 days at December 31, 2016.
Inventories increased to $230.3 million from $162 million at December 31, 2016. Average days of inventory was 56.5 days at September 30, 2017, compared to 57 days at December 31, 2016.
We launched a line extension of our Mutant brand family, namely White Lightning, a 0 sugar offering, to the general market in July. We remain confident about the potential of this brand. We launched Mango Loco, a new flavor in the Monster Energy juice family exclusively with the convenience store costumer in June and launched to the general market nationally in September of 2017. We also launched Monster Energy Fury in September 2017 in Nigeria. We are in the process of launching X-Presso Monster in 2 flavors as well as NOS Nitro Mango in the United States. Sales of Monster Hydro which was launched in a 550 ml PET bottle in United Kingdom and Ireland during the second quarter of 2017 have been encouraging. The Lewis Hamilton signature Monster Energy drink launched in the second quarter and is now available in 22 EMEA markets, including South Africa. We are planning to launch the Lewis Hamilton drinks in Australia in early 2018. We remain confident about the potential for this product.
We estimate October 2017 gross sales to be approximately 19.9% higher than in October 2016. On the foreign exchange adjusted basis, we estimate October 2017 growth sales to be approximately 18.6% higher than in October 2016. In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors. Factors, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distribution centers, as well as shifts in the timing of production in some instances where our bottlers are responsible for production and unilaterally determine their production schedules, which affect the dates in which we invoice such bottlers. We note that in October 2017, there were 22 selling days as compared to 21 selling days in October 2016.
We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period. 
On February 28, 2017, the company's Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program for the repurchase of up to $500 million of the company's outstanding common stock. During the third quarter, we purchased 4.5 million shares of common stock at an average purchase price of $54.91 per share for a total of $248.8 million excluding broker commissions.
In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points. We recognized a reduction in raw material cost of $27.7 million in the third quarter as a result of our acquisition of AFF. North America and international gross margins remain healthy. The U.S. Nielsen convenience markets statistics for the 4 weeks ended October 21, 2017 reflect that the company achieved its highest market share in the energy category in dollars at a 42.3% market share, and that the Monster Energy brand achieved its highest market share in the energy category at a 37.2% market share.
Equivalent market statistics for many countries around the world show that the energy category is continuing to grow and that Monster is generally growing ahead of the category. The new additions to the Monster family continue to add to the company sales. We're excited about the prospect for our new product launches. We are pleased with our performance in our international markets and reiterate the growth potential for us in China, one of the largest energy drink markets globally. We have successfully launched or transitioned Monster Energy drinks to Coca-Cola bottlers in a number of markets this year and anticipate further transitions and launches.
I'd like to open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you."

So the quarter was more pronounced because it was a larger growth in sales internationally. So that accounted for a significant portion of the reduction in overall gross margin. We had some other issues relating to input costs, some cost increases -- I shouldn't say issues, cost increases in relation to input costs, and there was some impact as well of product mix, where we have different products that we sell that have different -- every SKU has a different margin. So on balance this quarter, there was -- with the Java coming back on stream, there was a reduction in the overall margin because of those items. So those are the 3 major factors that contributed to the reduction in gross margin."

So we've got obviously fought back and get back the shelf space that contracted during that period. But we are -- we're quite encouraged that we'll get back shelf space quite quickly. We are positive for the coffee category, and that is why we're right in the throes literally this week of starting to sell and launch X-Presso Monster, and we will be coming, launching -- early in the New Year, we'll be launching Caffe Monster in glass bottles. So we think there is good growth potential for the coffee category and the coffee plus energy category. We still think those are good -- it's a good growth category, beverages generally and for us. And with getting back into our inventory position and eliminating our shortages, we think that from the fourth quarter, we will start to see the benefits come through. So we are positive about it but to what extent and how quickly, obviously, we're not going to give guidance on that because it is uncertain anyway to us even at this time."

Hydro, we've had really -- a really good response both to the package and to the ingredients and taste. So both of them have resonated well and which makes us very positive for this sort of sub-brand or subcategory. We have continued to experience production challenges and being able to get enough cans, and that's been a challenge. So while we look at distribution and sales numbers, we think those numbers have been negatively affected by the fact that they don't actually relate or -- and give the full story because we're out of stock. A lot of the time, if you're out of stock, it doesn't show in the Nielsen numbers. So we believe the results have actually been more positive than are reflected in the actual sales reported to in the Nielsen. And that is consistent with our feedback from our -- from the market and the field and from retailers. So we are very positive about it. The way we're addressing that is we will be launching a line of 4 SKUs, 1 of -- we're probably going to take 1 of the existing 3 SKUs and convert that into a 750 ml bottle, and we're going to have 3 other 750 ml PET bottles, one of which will be a 0 calorie, 0 sugar product. So with those 4 products being launched early in 2018, then we will continue to maintain our sales of the cans. We are looking and are engaged in negotiations to secure additional capacity and additional production facilities to make the plastic can, the PET can, because we do believe that is a very attractive package and it is, I think, important for the brand. So ultimately, once we get that rectified, we will obviously expand the offerings in the PET can. But so going out from an early point next year, we will have PET cans and a 750 ml with a 25-ounce plastic bottle. So we believe that, that will cater for the out of stocks and the erratic supply and because you'll have 1 or the other products in stock pretty much at all times in stores, and we are positive about Hydro as being a new category for us and a new growth area for us in 2018."

We are learning how to market and promote our products, distribute our products in China. We have had some challenges in basically securing space for us. Basically, there's no real energy category. So it's not as though you can focus on an energy category and say you got an energy product, let's just put your new product in the energy category. And so there has been some struggle with the Coke bottlers where their focus and perhaps the easier way where they believe they were doing adequate job is to -- if they're struggling to find a position for the product, they find a position in the Coke cooler and your product goes into the Coke cooler. Now that seems to sound fine. But ultimately, if the other products like the Red Bull Gold or which is the leader in the category and it's all being sold in an independent cold door, even on the warm shelf, the consumer is not expecting to go into the Coke cooler and find that energy drink. And we're really going through a learning curve with our bottlers to try and explain to them that the first prize is not actually being in the Coke cooler. The first is prize is actually being -- and the essential distribution point is to be right next to Red Bull. And if you get a secondary point of distribution, which is obviously always positive, then you would go into the Coke cooler with that secondary distribution point. So that is just an educational challenge to really get and communicate that to the very, very big sales force. So on the one hand, you've got this really big sales force available to us, which is a very big positive. On the other hand, they are used to selling and putting their products into the Coke door and into the Coke cooler, where they have many of them. We are really having to refine that and tweak that slightly. And that's part of the challenge we have. So we remain very positive, and we believe that it's going to continue to grow, our sales are going to continue to grow. And it's a very, very important market for us. It's just going through a learning curve and getting everything down as we continue to progress. So that is really what we can -- all we can say in China is the sales are good. That's substantial. If you look at our other markets and comparable other markets that we've launched at, sales are higher. But we are working through these operational challenges. And we'll get through them, there's no doubt. It's just a question of getting them and having the time to train everybody and understand what the priorities are. So that's really an update on China."

We are continuing to put promotional efforts behind the brand this year, and we have the bottlers' support, and we will continue to put focus on Mutant, and we see that as a long-term potential benefit and good opportunity for the company. But it is -- again, looking at an analysis, you look at the brands in the softdrink industry and the average age of the brands of old -- decades old that we're going up against, we're doing quite well if you look at where we are in relation to the other brands. And we are going to continue to -- we'll continue to make progress against them as we continue to develop the brand. We're doing some testing at the moment. We're going out to test a 38 ml cap as opposed to the 26 ml, which is really, really, really  looks good on the product. It does transform the visual image of the product and its position. And as soon as we get some input back from some key channels and key accounts, we're going -- we're testing this larger cap format in, we will determine whether we'll actually transition all of the production into the larger cap or stay with the traditional 28 ml -- 26, 28 ml cap that you normally use for soda products. That's the 1 thing we are looking at in the Mutant line. And we think that this is so far from our own feeling internally is that we think that this cap will be quite a positive addition to the line going forward."

The global beverage industry generally continues to face headwinds, although the energy category continues to gain momentum. In the third quarter, net sales were $909.5 million, up 15.4% from $788 million in the third quarter of 2016. The company recorded third quarter gross sales of $1.04 billion, up 14.1% from $913.3 million in the third quarter of 2016.
Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the third quarter was 62.6% as compared to 63.8% for the comparable 2016 third quarter. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to geographic sales mix as our international operations generally have lower profit margins, product sales mix, as well as the increases in other costs. Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 3.2% for the 2017 third quarter as compared to 3.1% in the 2016 third quarter.
Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 12.7% compared to 12.1% in the same quarter a year ago. The increase was primarily due to increased sponsorship and endorsement costs, commissions, merchandise displays and trade development. General and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were 11.8% as compared to 11.7% in the same quarter last year. Included in general and administrative costs were distributor termination expenses of $15.9 million and $4.7 million for the 2017 and 2016 third quarters, respectively.
General and administrative expenses, excluding distributor terminations were 10.1% of net sales for the 2017 third quarter compared with 11.1% of net sales for the comparable 2016 third quarter.
Payroll expenses were up $6.5 million, primarily due to headcount growth internationally, including to support the launches in China and other countries and stock-based compensation, a noncash item, was $1.1 million higher.
Legal expenses relating to regulatory matters and litigation concerning the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage, safety and sale of the company's products were $2.9 million in the 2017 third quarter as compared to $4.9 million in the 2016 third quarter.
Our effective tax rate decreased from 33.8% in the 2016 third quarter to 31.9% in the 2017 third quarter primarily due to profits earned by foreign subsidiaries in lower tax jurisdictions. Net income was $218.7 million in the 2017 third quarter compared to net income of $191.6 million in the 2016 third quarter, an increase of 14.1%. The weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding decreased from 583.3 million for the third quarter of 2016 to 578.4 million for the third quarter of 2017 as a result of share buyback. Diluted earnings per share for the 2017 third quarter increased 15.1% to $0.38 from $0.33 in the third quarter of 2016. We estimate that distributor termination expenses in the 2017 third quarter reduced reported earnings by approximately $0.02 per share after tax.
We continue to make good progress in the implementation of our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola bottlers globally. We are also making good progress in the U.S. in nontraditional channels, including food service, accounts and e-commerce.
In EMEA, we commenced distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in Georgia and Kuwait in the third quarter of 2017 and in Ghana and Morocco in October 2017. Additional launches are planned during the fourth quarter of 2017 and in the first quarter of 2018.
In the third quarter of 2017, we commenced distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in Nicaragua. And in October, we transitioned Monster Energy in the Bahamas, Grenada and Jamaica,  the latter not to a Coca-Cola bottler. We are also planning to launch in and/or transition to additional countries in the Caribbean and Central and South America in 2018.
In China, during the third quarter of 2017, we launched the 2 -- the final 2 operating units and are now focusing our efforts towards establishing Monster in the country with an emphasis on key cities and accounts.  We also transitioned Vietnam and have begun distribution in Taiwan. We're also planning to relaunch Monster in India. 
Raw material cost savings from the AFF transaction were approximately $27.7 million in the third quarter of 2017 as compared to $23.3 million in the third quarter of 2016. According to Nielsen reports for the 13 weeks through October 21, 2017, all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots increased by 2.6% versus the same period a year ago.
Sales of Monster grew 6.6% in the 13-week period, while sales of NOS increased 10.3%, and sales of Full Throttle decreased 1%. Sales of Red Bull increased 2.8%. Sales of Rockstar increased by 0.2%. Sales of 5-hour decreased 6.4% and sales of Amp decreased 32.2%. 
According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended October 21, 2017, sales in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots in dollars, increased 3.6% over the same period last year. Sales of Monster increased by 7.9% over the same period last year while NOS was up 5.8% and Full Throttle sales decreased 3.6%. Sales of Red Bull increased by 5.1%, Rockstar was up 1%, 5-hour was down 6.6% and Amp was down 39.4%.
We pointed out that the energy shot category has been slowing for some time. If we exclude energy shots, as well as energy coffee and energy protein, where we have experienced production capacity shortages, for the 4 weeks ended October 21, 2017, sales in the convenience and gas channel in dollars in fact increased by 5.8% over the same period last year, with sales of Monster increasing by 11%.
According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended October 21, 2017, Monster's market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots in dollars increased by 1.5 points over the same period last year to 37.2%. NOS' share increased 0.1 point to 4.1% and Full Throttle share decreased 0.1 point to 0.9%. Red Bull share increased 0.5 point to 35%; Rockstar share was down 0.2 point to 7.8%; 5-hour's share was lower by 0.7 point at 6.9%, and Amp's share decreased by 0.6 point to 0.9%.
According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended October 21, 2017, sales of energy plus coffee drinks in dollars in the convenience and gas channel decreased 8.6% over the same period last year. Sales of Java Monster were 12.2% lower than in the same period last year, while sales of Starbucks Doubleshot Energy were 4.8% lower. 
We worked through our production capacity shortages for both Java Monster and Muscle Monster. We have secured additional production of Java Monster and Muscle Monster in the United States, which came online in the third quarter of 2017. Those products  came off allocation at the end of the quarter.
[ Such ] production [ to get an ] additional production available to us in Europe has eliminated our shortages for Java Monster and Muscle Monster. Together with our bottling partners, we are currently focused on regaining lost shelf space for these products.
According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada, for the 12 weeks ended August 19, 2017, the energy drink category increased 2% in dollars. Monster sales increased 5% versus a year ago. Our market share increased 0.8 share points to 32.1%; Red Bull sales remained the same, and its market share decreased 1.4 points to 37.8%. Rockstar sales remained the same, and its market share increased by 0.3 point to 15.9%.
According to Nielsen, for all outlets combined in Mexico, the energy drink category grew 6% during the month of September 2017. Monster sales increased 34.8%. Our market share in value increased 6.1 points to 28.5% against the comparable period last year. Sales of Burn decreased 46.4%. Burn's market share decreased 2.4 points to 2.5%. Red Bull sales decreased 1.6% and its market share decreased by 0.8 points to 10.8%.
Vive 100's market share decreased 4 points to 40.2%, while Boost's market share decreased 0.5 point to 8.8%. The Nielsen statistics for Mexico covers single months which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain which dominates the market.
Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by 1 or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico.
I'd like to point out that the Nielsen and IRI numbers for EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen and IRI for EMEA vary from country to country. According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ending October 8, 2017, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year grew from 14.3% to 18.5% in Great Britain, from 8.7% to 13.2% in Italy and in France from 22.7% to 24%.
According to Nielsen for the 13 weeks period ending October 8, 2017, Monster's retail market share in value increased from 10.4% -- decreased from 10.4% to 10.1% in Sweden, although the retail sales value in sales grew 25.7% in the same comparative period.
According to Nielsen in the 13-week period ending September 17, 2017, Monster's retail market share grew from 10.5% to 11.7% in Belgium, from 11.4% to 12.1% in the Czech Republic, from 13.9% to 15.6% in Germany and from 30.7% to 33.4% in Greece, from 5.5% to 6.4% in the Netherlands, from 10.9% to 15.3% in Norway and from 25.7% to 27.2% in Spain.

According to Nielsen for the 13-week period ending August 2017, Monster's retail market share in Ireland grew from 9.1% to 13.3%. I would like to point out that the Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen in the EMEA vary from country to country.
According to Nielsen, for the month of September 2017 in Chile, Monster's retail market share in value increased from 21.7% to 30.8% compared to the same period last year.

According to IRI, in Australia, Monster's market share in value grew from 6.1% to 7.4% in September 2017 as compared to the same period last year. According to IRI in New Zealand, Monster's market share in value for the 4 weeks ended September 3, 2017, grew from 4% to 6.2% as compared to the same period last year.

According to INTAGE, Monster's market share in value in the convenience store channel in Japan grew from 41.7% to 45.1% in September 2017 versus the same period last year. Net sales for the Monster Energy drink segment for the third quarter of 2017 increased 16.6% from $710.1 million to $827.7 million from the comparable period last year.
Net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment in the third quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $0.4 million of foreign currency movements. Net sales for the Strategic Brands segment was $76.6 million for the third quarter as compared to $72.1 million in the same quarter last year. Net sales for the company's Strategic Brands segment were positively impacted by approximately $1.1 million of foreign currency movements in the quarter.
Net sales for the Other segment, which includes third-party sales made by AFF were $5.2 million in the 2017 third quarter as compared to $5.7 million in the same quarter last year. Net sales to customers outside the U.S. were $260.1 million in the 2017 third quarter compared to $190.8 million in the corresponding quarter in 2016.
Foreign exchange had the effect of increasing net sales in U.S. dollars by approximately $0.7 million. Included in the report of geographic sales are our sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the U.S. and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas.
In Europe, the Middle East and Africa, net sales in the third quarter increased 42.5% in dollars and 40.6% in local currencies over the same period last year. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales increased from 50.5% in the same period last year to 50.9% during the quarter. We are pleased with the rollout of certain SKUs in the Ultra range in EMEA markets. In 2017, we added certain SKUs of Ultra across EMEA with the introduction of Ultra Citron, which is now available in 10 additional EMEA markets in 2017. Various SKUs in the Ultra range are now sold in 35 EMEA markets.
We are also pleased that Monster continued to perform well and gain market share in Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Great Britain, Greece, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain and South Africa.
In Asia Pacific, net sales in the third quarter increased 22% in dollars and 26.6% in local currencies over the same period last year. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales was 46.5% versus 46.6% over the same period last year. In Japan, net sales in the quarter increased 27.9% or 36.7% in local currency as compared to the same quarter last year.
We continue to experience strong performance in Japan. In South Korea, net sales increased 16.7% or 16.2% in local currency as compared to the same quarter last year. In Oceania, which includes Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti, French Polynesia, New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea and Guam, net sales decreased 2.5% or minus 5.1% in local currencies as compared to the same quarter last year.
As previously mentioned, we are moving ahead with plans for local production in India with a view towards reentering that market.
In Latin America, including Mexico and the Caribbean, gross sales in the third quarter increased 29.8% in dollars and 27.1% in local currencies. Net sales in the third quarter increased 34.3% in dollars and 31.4% in local currencies over the same period last year.
Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales remained the same at 47.6% during the 2017 third quarter.
Net sales increased in Brazil 497.2% in dollars or 482.3% in local currency, largely due to the transition of Monster to Coca-Cola bottlers which took place on November 1, 2016. Net sales in Chile increased 160.8% in dollars and 159.1% in local currency.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $465.6 million compared to $377.6 million at December 31, 2016. Short-term investments were $630.3 million compared to $220.6 million at December 31, 2016. Long-term investments increased to $7 million from $2.4 million at December 31, 2016.
Accounts receivable increased to $535.3 million at September 30, 2017, from $448.1 million at December 31, 2016. Days outstanding for accounts receivables were 46.7 days compared to 48.2 days at December 31, 2016.
Inventories increased to $213.3 million from $162 million at December 31, 2016. Average days of inventory was 56.5 days at September 30, 2017, compared to 57 days at December 31, 2016.
We launched a line extension of our Mutant brand family, namely White Lightning, a 0 sugar offering, to the general market in July. We remain confident about the potential of this brand. We launched Mango Loco, a new flavor in the Monster Energy juice family exclusively with a convenience store customer in June and launched to the general market nationally in September of 2017. We also launched Monster Energy Fury in September 2017 in Nigeria. We are in the process of launching X-Presso Monster in 2 flavors as well as NOS Nitro Mango in the United States. Sales of Monster Hydro which was launched in a 550 ml PET bottle in United Kingdom and Ireland during the second quarter of 2017 have been encouraging. The Lewis Hamilton signature Monster Energy drink launched in the second quarter and is now available in 22 EMEA markets, including South Africa. We are planning to launch the Lewis Hamilton drinks in Australia in early 2018. We remain confident about the potential for this product.
We estimate October 2017 gross sales to be approximately 19.9% higher than in October 2016. On the foreign exchange adjusted basis, we estimate October 2017 growth sales to be approximately 18.6% higher than in October 2016. In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors. Factors, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distribution centers, as well as shifts in the timing of production in some instances where our bottlers are responsible for production and unilaterally determine their production schedules, which affect the dates in which we invoice such bottlers. We note that in October 2017, there were 22 selling days as compared to 21 selling days in October 2016.
We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period. 
On February 28, 2017, the company's Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program for the repurchase of up to $500 million of the company's outstanding common stock. During the third quarter, we purchased 4.5 million shares of common stock at an average purchase price of $54.91 per share for a total of $248.8 million excluding broker commissions.
In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points. We recognized a reduction in raw material cost of $27.7 million in the third quarter as a result of our acquisition of AFF. North America and international gross margins remain healthy. The U.S. Nielsen convenience markets statistics for the 4 weeks ended October 21, 2017 reflect that the company achieved its highest market share in the energy category in dollars at a 42.3% market share, and that the Monster Energy brand achieved its highest market share in the energy category at a 37.2% market share.
Equivalent market statistics for many countries around the world show that the energy category is continuing to grow and that Monster is generally growing ahead of the category. The new additions to the Monster family continue to add to the company sales. We're excited about the prospect for our new product launches. We are pleased with our performance in our international markets and reiterate the growth potential for us in China, one of the largest energy drink markets globally. We have successfully launched or transitioned Monster Energy drinks to Coca-Cola bottlers in a number of markets this year and anticipate further transitions and launches.
I'd like to open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you."

We had some other issues relating to input costs, some cost increases -- I shouldn't say issues, cost increases in relation to input costs, and there was some impact as well of product mix, where we have different products that we sell that have different -- every SKU has a different margin. So on balance this quarter, there was -- with the Java coming back on stream, there was a reduction in the overall margin because of those items. So those are the 3 major factors that contributed to the reduction in gross margin."

We are positive for the coffee category, and that is why we're right in the throes literally this week of starting to sell and launch X-Presso Monster, and we will be coming, launching -- early in the New Year, we'll be launching Caffe Monster in glass bottles. So we think there is good growth potential for the coffee category and the coffee plus energy category. We still think those are good -- it's a good growth category, beverages generally and for us. And with getting back into our inventory position and eliminating our shortages, we think that from the fourth quarter, we will start to see the benefits come through.

Hydro, we've had really -- a really good response both to the package and to the ingredients and taste. So both of them have resonated well and which makes us very positive for this sort of sub-brand or subcategory. We have continued to experience production challenges and being able to get enough cans, and that's been a challenge. So while we look at distribution and sales numbers, we think those numbers have been negatively affected by the fact that they don't actually relate or -- and give the full story because we're out of stock. A lot of the time, if you're out of stock, it doesn't show in the Nielsen numbers. So we believe the results have actually been more positive than are reflected in the actual sales reported to in the Nielsen. And that is consistent with our feedback from our -- from the market and the field and from retailers. So we are very positive about it. The way we're addressing that is we will be launching a line of 4 SKUs, 1 of -- we're probably going to take 1 of the existing 3 SKUs and convert that into a 750 ml bottle, and we're going to have 3 other 750 ml PET bottles, one of which will be a 0 calorie, 0 sugar product. So with those 4 products being launched early in 2018, then we will continue to maintain our sales of the cans. We are looking and are engaged in negotiations to secure additional capacity and additional production facilities to make the plastic can, the PET can, because we do believe that is a very attractive package and it is, I think, important for the brand. So ultimately, once we get that rectified, we will obviously expand the offerings in the PET can. But so going out from an early point next year, we will have PET cans and a 750 ml with a 25-ounce plastic bottle. So we believe that, that will cater for the out of stocks and the erratic supply and because you'll have 1 or the other products in stock pretty much at all times in stores, and we are positive about Hydro as being a new category for us and a new growth area for us in 2018."

We are learning how to market and promote our products, distribute our products in China. We have had some challenges in basically securing space for us. Basically, there's no real energy category. So it's not as though you can focus on an energy category and say you got an energy product, let's just put your new product in the energy category. And so there has been some struggle with the Coke bottlers where their focus and perhaps the easier way where they believe they were doing adequate job is to -- if they're struggling to find a position for the product, they find a position in the Coke cooler and your product goes into the Coke cooler. Now that seems to sound fine. But ultimately, if the other products like the Red Bull Gold or which is the leader in the category and it's all being sold in an independent cold door, even on the warm shelf, the consumer is not expecting to go into the Coke cooler and find an energy drink. And we're really going through a learning curve with our bottlers to try and explain to them that the first prize is not actually being in the Coke cooler. The first is prize is actually being -- and the essential distribution point is to be right next to Red Bull. And if you get a secondary point of distribution, which is obviously always positive, then you would go into the Coke cooler with that secondary distribution point. So that is just an educational challenge to really get and communicate that to the very, very big sales force. So on the one hand, you've got this really big sales force available to us, which is a very big positive. On the other hand, they are used to selling and putting their products into the Coke door and into the Coke cooler, where they have many of them. We are really having to refine that and tweak that slightly. And that's part of the challenge we have. So we remain very positive, and we believe that it's going to continue to grow, our sales are going to continue to grow. And it's a very, very important market for us. It's just going through a learning curve and getting everything down as we continue to progress. So that is really what we can -- all we can say in China is the sales are good. That's substantial. If you look at our other markets and comparable other markets that we've launched at, sales are higher. But we are working through these operational challenges. And we'll get through them, there's no doubt. It's just a question of getting them and having the time to train everybody and understand what the priorities are. So that's really an update on China."

We are continuing to put promotional efforts behind the brand this year, and we have the bottlers' support, and we will continue to put focus on Mutant, and we see that as a long-term potential benefit and good opportunity for the company. But it is -- again, looking at an analysis, you look at the brands in the softdrink industry and the average age of the brands of old -- decades old that we're going up against, we're doing quite well if you look at where we are in relation to the other brands. And we are going to continue to -- we'll continue to make progress against them as we continue to develop the brand. We're doing some testing at the moment. We're going out to test a 38 ml cap as opposed to the 26 ml, which is really, really, really looks good on the product. It does transform the visual image of the product and its position. And as soon as we get some input back from some key channels and key accounts, we're going -- we're testing this larger cap format in, we will determine whether we'll actually transition all of the production into the larger cap or stay with the traditional 28 ml -- 26, 28 ml cap that you normally use for soda products. That's the 1 thing we are looking at in the Mutant line. And we think that this is so far out from our own feeling internally is that we think that this cap will be quite a positive addition to the line going forward."

The global beverage industry generally continues to face headwinds, although the energy category continues to gain momentum. In the third quarter, net sales were $909.5 million, up 15.4% from $788 million in the third quarter of 2016. The company recorded third quarter gross sales of $1.04 billion, up 14.1% from $913.3 million in the third quarter of 2016.
Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the third quarter was 62.6% as compared to 63.8% for the comparable 2016 third quarter. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to geographic sales mix as our international operations generally have lower profit margins, product sales mix, as well as the increases in other costs. Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 3.2% for the 2017 third quarter as compared to 3.1% in the 2016 third quarter.
Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 12.7% compared to 12.1% in the same quarter a year ago. The increase was primarily due to increased sponsorship and endorsement costs, commissions, merchandise displays and trade development. General and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were 11.8% as compared to 11.7% in the same quarter last year. Included in general and administrative costs were distributor termination expenses of $15.9 million and $4.7 million for the 2017 and 2016 third quarters, respectively.
General and administrative expenses, excluding distributor terminations were 10.1% of net sales for the 2017 third quarter compared with 11.1% of net sales for the comparable 2016 third quarter.
Payroll expenses were up $6.5 million, primarily due to headcount growth internationally, including to support the launches in China and other countries and stock-based compensation, a noncash item, was $1.1 million higher.
Legal expenses relating to regulatory matters and litigation concerning the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage, safety and sale of the company's products were $2.9 million in the 2017 third quarter as compared to $4.9 million in the 2016 third quarter.
Our effective tax rate decreased from 33.8% in the 2016 third quarter to 31.9% in the 2017 third quarter primarily due to profits earned by foreign subsidiaries in lower tax jurisdictions. Net income was $218.7 million in the 2017 third quarter compared to net income of $191.6 million in the 2016 third quarter, an increase of 14.1%. The weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding decreased from 583.3 million for the third quarter of 2016 to 578.4 million for the third quarter of 2017 as a result of share buyback. Diluted earnings per share for the 2017 third quarter increased 15.1% to $0.38 from $0.33 in the third quarter of 2016. We estimate that distributor termination expenses in the 2017 third quarter reduced reported earnings by approximately $0.02 per share after tax.
We continue to make good progress in the implementation of our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola bottlers globally. We are also making good progress in the U.S. in nontraditional channels, including food service, accounts and e-commerce.
In EMEA, we commenced distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in Georgia and Kuwait in the third quarter of 2017 and in Ghana and Morocco in October 2017. Additional launches are planned during the fourth quarter of 2017 and in the first quarter of 2018.
In the third quarter of 2017, we commenced distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in Nicaragua. And in October, we transitioned Monster Energy in the Bahamas, Grenada and Jamaica, the latter not to a Coca-Cola bottler. We are also planning to launch in and/or transition to additional countries in the Caribbean and Central and South America in 2018.
In China, during the third quarter of 2017, we launched the 2 -- the final 2 operating units and are now focusing our efforts towards establishing Monster in the country with an emphasis on key cities and accounts. We also transitioned Vietnam and have begun distribution in Taiwan. We're also planning to relaunch Monster in India. 
Raw material cost savings from the AFF transaction were approximately $27.7 million in the third quarter of 2017 as compared to $23.3 million in the third quarter of 2016. According to Nielsen reports for the 13 weeks through October 21, 2017, all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots increased by 2.6% versus the same period a year ago.
Sales of Monster grew 6.6% in the 13-week period, while sales of NOS increased 10.3%, and sales of Full Throttle decreased 1%. Sales of Red Bull increased 2.8%. Sales of Rockstar increased by 0.2%. Sales of 5-hour decreased 6.4% and sales of Amp decreased 32.2%. 
According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended October 21, 2017, sales in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots in dollars, increased 3.6% over the same period last year. Sales of Monster increased by 7.9% over the same period last year while NOS was up 5.8% and Full Throttle sales decreased 3.6%. Sales of Red Bull increased by 5.1%, Rockstar was up 1%, 5-hour was down 6.6% and Amp was down 39.4%.
We pointed out that the energy shot category has been slowing for some time. If we exclude energy shots, as well as energy coffee and energy protein, where we have experienced production capacity shortages, for the 4 weeks ended October 21, 2017, sales in the convenience and gas channel in dollars in fact increased by 5.8% over the same period last year, with sales of Monster increasing by 11%.
According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended October 21, 2017, Monster's market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots in dollars increased by 1.5 points over the same period last year to 37.2%. NOS' share increased 0.1 point to 4.1% and Full Throttle share decreased 0.1 point to 0.9%. Red Bull share increased 0.5 point to 35%; Rockstar share was down 0.2 point to 7.8%; 5-hour's share was lower by 0.7 point at 6.9%, and Amp's share decreased by 0.6 point to 0.9%.
According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended October 21, 2017, sales of energy plus coffee drinks in dollars in the convenience and gas channel decreased 8.6% over the same period last year. Sales of Java Monster were 12.2% lower than in the same period last year, while sales of Starbucks Doubleshot Energy were 4.8% lower. 
We worked through our production capacity shortages for both Java Monster and Muscle Monster. We have secured additional production of Java Monster and Muscle Monster in the United States, which came online in the third quarter of 2017. Those products came off allocation at the end of the quarter.
[ Such ] production [ to get an ] additional production available to us in Europe has eliminated our shortages for Java Monster and Muscle Monster. Together with our bottling partners, we are currently focused on regaining lost shelf space for these products.
According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada, for the 12 weeks ended August 19, 2017, the energy drink category increased 2% in dollars. Monster sales increased 5% versus a year ago. Our market share increased 0.8 share points to 32.1%; Red Bull sales remained the same, and its market share decreased 1.4 points to 37.8%. Rockstar sales remained the same, and its market share increased by 0.3 point to 15.9%.
According to Nielsen, for all outlets combined in Mexico, the energy drink category grew 6% during the month of September 2017. Monster sales increased 34.8%. Our market share in value increased 6.1 points to 28.5% against the comparable period last year. Sales of Burn decreased 46.4%. Burn's market share decreased 2.4 points to 2.5%. Red Bull sales decreased 1.6% and its market share decreased by 0.8 points to 10.8%.
Vive 100's market share decreased 4 points to 40.2%, while Boost's market share decreased 0.5 point to 8.8%. The Nielsen statistics for Mexico covers single months which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain which dominates the market.
Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico.
I'd like to point out that the Nielsen and IRI numbers for EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen and IRI for EMEA vary from country to country. According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ending October 8, 2017, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year grew from 14.3% to 18.5% in Great Britain, from 8.7% to 13.2% in Italy and in France from 22.7% to 24%.

We are pleased with the rollout of certain SKUs in the Ultra range in EMEA markets. In 2017, we added certain SKUs of Ultra across EMEA with the introduction of Ultra Citron, which is now available in 10 additional EMEA markets in 2017. Various SKUs in the Ultra range are now sold in 35 EMEA markets.

Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales remained the same at 47.6% during the 2017 third quarter.
Net sales increased in Brazil 497.2% in dollars or 482.3% in local currency, largely due to the transition of Monster to Coca-Cola bottlers which took place on November 1, 2016. Net sales in Chile increased 160.8% in dollars and 159.1% in local currency.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $465.6 million compared to $377.6 million at December 31, 2016. Short-term investments were $630.3 million compared to $220.6 million at December 31, 2016. Long-term investments increased to $7 million from $2.4 million at December 31, 2016.
Accounts receivable increased to $535.3 million at September 30, 2017, from $448.1 million at December 31, 2016. Days outstanding for accounts receivables were 46.7 days compared to 48.2 days at December 31, 2016.
Inventories increased to $213.3 million from $162 million at December 31, 2016. Average days of inventory was 56.5 days at September 30, 2017, compared to 57 days at December 31, 2016.
We launched a line extension of our Mutant brand family, namely White Lightning, a 0 sugar offering, to the general market in July. We remain confident about the potential of this brand. We launched Mango Loco, a new flavor in the Monster Energy juice family exclusively with a convenience store customer in June and launched to the general market nationally in September of 2017. We also launched Monster Energy Fury in September 2017 in Nigeria. We are in the process of launching X-Presso Monster in 2 flavors as well as NOS Nitro Mango in the United States. Sales of Monster Hydro which was launched in a 550 ml PET bottle in United Kingdom and Ireland during the second quarter of 2017 have been encouraging. The Lewis Hamilton signature Monster Energy drink launched in the second quarter and is now available in 22 EMEA markets, including South Africa. We are planning to launch the Lewis Hamilton drinks in Australia in early 2018. We remain confident about the potential for this product.
We estimate October 2017 gross sales to be approximately 19.9% higher than in October 2016. On the foreign exchange adjusted basis, we estimate October 2017 growth sales to be approximately 18.6% higher than in October 2016. In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors. Factors, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distribution centers, as well as shifts in the timing of production in some instances where our bottlers are responsible for production and unilaterally determine their production schedules, which affect the dates in which we invoice such bottlers. We note that in October 2017, there were 22 selling days as compared to 21 selling days in October 2016.
We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period. 
On February 28, 2017, the company's Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program for the repurchase of up to $500 million of the company's outstanding common stock. During the third quarter, we purchased 4.5 million shares of common stock at an average purchase price of $54.91 per share for a total of $248.8 million excluding broker commissions.
In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points. We recognized a reduction in raw material cost of $27.7 million in the third quarter as a result of our acquisition of AFF. North America and international gross margins remain healthy. The U.S. Nielsen convenience markets statistics for the 4 weeks ended October 21, 2017 reflect that the company achieved its highest market share in the energy category in dollars at a 42.3% market share, and that the Monster Energy brand achieved its highest market share in the energy category at a 37.2% market share.
Equivalent market statistics for many countries around the world show that the energy category is continuing to grow and that Monster is generally growing ahead of the category. The new additions to the Monster family continue to add to the company sales. We're excited about the prospect for our new product launches. We are pleased with our performance in our international markets and reiterate the growth potential for us in China, one of the largest energy drink markets globally. We have successfully launched or transitioned Monster Energy drinks to Coca-Cola bottlers in a number of markets this year and anticipate further transitions and launches.
I'd like to open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you."

We had some other issues relating to input costs, some cost increases -- I shouldn't say issues, cost increases in relation to input costs, and there was some impact as well of product mix, where we have different products that we sell that have different -- every SKU has a different margin. So on balance this quarter, there was -- with the Java coming back on stream, there was a reduction in the overall margin because of those items.

Hydro, we've had really -- a really good response both to the package and to the ingredients and taste. So both of them have resonated well and which makes us very positive for this sort of sub-brand or subcategory. We have continued to experience production challenges and being able to get enough cans, and that's been a challenge. So while we look at distribution and sales numbers, we think those numbers have been negatively affected by the fact that they don't actually relate or -- and give the full story because we're out of stock. A lot of the time, if you're out of stock, it doesn't show in the Nielsen numbers. So we believe the results have actually been more positive than are reflected in the actual sales reported to in the Nielsen. And that is consistent with our feedback from our -- from the market and the field and from retailers. So we are very positive about it. The way we're addressing that is we will be launching a line of 4 SKUs, 1 of -- we're probably going to take 1 of the existing 3 SKUs and convert that into a 750 ml bottle, and we're going to have 3 other 750 ml PET bottles, one of which will be a 0 calorie, 0 sugar product. So with those 4 products being launched early in 2018, then we will continue to maintain our sales of the cans. We are looking and are engaged in negotiations to secure additional capacity and additional production facilities to make the plastic can, the PET can, because we do believe that is a very attractive package and it is, I think, important for the brand. So ultimately, once we get that rectified, we will obviously expand the offerings in the PET can. But so going out from an early point next year, we will have PET cans and a 750 ml with a 25-ounce plastic bottle. So we believe that, that will cater for the out of stocks and the erratic supply and because you'll have one or the other products in stock pretty much at all times in stores, and we are positive about Hydro as being a new category for us and a new growth area for us in 2018."

We are learning how to market and promote our products, distribute our products in China. We have had some challenges in basically securing space for us. Basically, there's no real energy category. So it's not as though you can focus on an energy category and say you got an energy product, let's just put your new product in the energy category. And so there has been some struggle with the Coke bottlers where their focus and perhaps the easier way where they believe they were doing adequate job is to -- if they're struggling to find a position for the product, they find a position in the Coke cooler and your product goes into the Coke cooler. Now that seems to sound fine. But ultimately, if the other products like the Red Bull Gold or which is the leader in the category and it's all being sold in an independent cold door, even on the warm shelf, the consumer is not expecting to go into the Coke cooler and find an energy drink. And we're really going through a learning curve with our bottlers to try and explain to them that the first prize is not actually being in the Coke cooler. The first is prize is actually being -- and the essential distribution point is to be right next to Red Bull. And if you get a secondary point of distribution, which is obviously always positive, then you would go into the Coke cooler with that secondary distribution point. So that is just an educational challenge to really get and communicate that to the very, very big sales force. So on the one hand, you've got this really big sales force available to us, which is a very big positive. On the other hand, they are used to selling and putting their products into the Coke door and into the Coke cooler, where they have many of them. We are really having to refine that and tweak that slightly. And that's part of the challenge we have. So we remain very positive, and we believe that it's going to continue to grow, our sales are going to continue to grow. And it's a very, very important market for us. It's just going through a learning curve and getting everything down as we continue to progress. So that is really what we can -- all we can say in China is the sales are good. That's substantial. If you look at our other markets and comparable other markets that we've launched at, sales are higher. But we are working through these operational challenges. And we'll get through them, there's no doubt. It's just a question of getting them and having the time to train everybody and understand what the priorities are. So that's really an update on China."

With regard to Mutant, we're still putting our heads down. We are sort of looking at expanding our distribution and our channels. We believe that the brand has got good potential. We are continuing to put promotional efforts behind the brand this year, and we have the bottlers' support, and we will continue to put focus on Mutant, and we see that as a long-term potential benefit and good opportunity for the company. But it is -- again, looking at an analysis, you look at the brands in the soft drink industry and the average age of the brands of old -- decades old that we're going up against, we're doing quite well if you look at where we are in relation to the other brands. And we are going to continue to -- we'll continue to make progress against them as we continue to develop the brand. We're doing some testing at the moment. We're going out to test a 38 ml cap as opposed to the 26 ml, which is really, really, really looks good on the product. It does transform the visual image of the product and its position. And as soon as we get some input back from some key channels and key accounts, we're going -- we're testing this larger cap format in, we will determine whether we'll actually transition all of the production into the larger cap or stay with the traditional 28 ml -- 26, 28 ml cap that you normally use for soda products. That's the one thing we are looking at in the Mutant line. And we think that this is so far out from our own feeling internally is that we think that this cap will be quite a positive addition to the line going forward."
