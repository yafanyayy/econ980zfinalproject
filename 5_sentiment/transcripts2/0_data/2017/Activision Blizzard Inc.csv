Our performance in 2016 further strengthened our position as the world's leading stand-alone interactive entertainment company. We achieved record results in 2016, delivering all-time high revenue",692,"Thank you, Amrita, and thank you all for joining us today. Our performance in 2016 further strengthened our position as the world's leading stand-alone interactive entertainment company. We achieved record results in 2016, delivering all-time high revenues of $6.6 billion and record non-GAAP EPS of $2.18, up 42% and 68%, respectively, over last year. We also delivered record non-GAAP operating margins of 35%.
We overperformed our plan for the quarter, delivering record revenues of $2 billion and record non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.65, up 49% and 160%, respectively, over last year. We also delivered our strongest annual operating cash flow in history at $2.2 billion, up 71% over last year.
Our success continues to be driven by our 2 greatest assets, our incredibly talented people and the devoted community of gamers we serve. We have roughly 450 million players in 196 countries, and they spent over 40 billion hours playing our games in 2016. And they watched a record 3 billion hours as spectators of our games. We continue to see opportunities to expand audiences, deepen engagement and increase player investment. In fact, prioritization of opportunity remains our greatest challenge, but we remain vigilant in ensuring that the right resources are connected with the right priorities.
We have a number of important successes in 2016 that we'd like to acknowledge. Blizzard's new franchise, Overwatch, has captured the imaginations of players all over the world, and we've only scratched the surface. The truly extraordinary Overwatch team launched the most successful new intellectual property in our company's history. We now have over 25 million registered players, and engagement has continued to grow.
The King team was very focused on continuously releasing fresh content with new levels and features as well as increasing live operations efforts with events and competitions. As a result, mobile bookings for the Candy Crush franchise grew in 2016.
King also made meaningful progress with its advertising initiatives. Last year's advertising tests had 2 primary goals: to design and build an outstanding ad platform that would actually enhance our users' in-game experience and to deliver significant value to advertisers. We're encouraged with the early results. In most tests, our users play more game rounds, spend more time in the game and have a self-reported better game experience with advertising.
Additionally, our platform delivers meaningful value to advertisers. We partnered with some of the world's top advertisers, including Nestl√©, Fox Entertainment and Visa, and our viewability, verifiability and completion metrics are all encouraging. Ads are perceived as more unique and interesting when shown on King inventory, and viewers are more likely to take action after seeing an ad in King games. The King team will continue to build on their efforts this year, and we believe advertising has the potential to be a growth driver in the years to come. 
We also nurtured emerging growth opportunities outside of our games, including esports, television and film and consumer products, and we enhanced the organizations that will support these initiatives. These new opportunities are consistent with and organic to our company's mission, and they have the potential to become important stand-alone businesses in pursuit of our goal to become the leading 21st century entertainment company.
We accelerated our eSports efforts with integration of Major League Gaming, the formation of the Call of Duty World League and the announcement of the Overwatch League. Our ambition is to create nothing less than the esports equivalent of the world's established major professional leagues. To this end, in 2017, we plan to start the process of selling teams and commercializing media rights for the Overwatch League. We look forward to welcoming team owners with the expertise, skills and investment required to build the professional league together.
We plan to invest in these long-term growth pillars further in 2017 and expect them to have even greater impact in 2018 and beyond. I couldn't be more excited about our prospects for the future, and our team's dedication and enthusiasm reinforces my confidence that we will continue to achieve our ambitious plans.
Thomas and Dennis will now share with you the results of our record quarter and our record year."
4222231,416154291,1128879,"Activision Blizzard, Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 09, 2017",2017-02-09,"Earnings Calls","Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Bobby. Due to our portfolio strength and digital momentum, we far exceeded our plans in 2016. We surpassed our initial revenue guidance by $0.5 billion and our initial non-GAAP EPS guidance by more than $0.40. And we also outperformed expectati",2075,"Thank you, Bobby. Due to our portfolio strength and digital momentum, we far exceeded our plans in 2016. We surpassed our initial revenue guidance by $0.5 billion and our initial non-GAAP EPS guidance by more than $0.40. And we also outperformed expectations for the holiday quarter.
In driving our record setting year and as we look ahead, we remain focused on our 3 strategic pillars: first, expanding our audiences; second, deepening engagement; and third, providing opportunities for more player investment.
Let's start with audience reach, which was 447 million monthly active users this quarter. Blizzard had record Q4 MAUs of 41 million; and for the year, Blizzard had its highest annual MAUs ever up 37% from 2015 and up 87% since 2014. This is a remarkable achievement demonstrating the strength of the Blizzard portfolio and capabilities.
Overwatch, released in may, set a record for the strongest launch year financial performance of any game in Blizzard's 26-year history. The game is critically acclaimed, receiving 55 Game of the Year awards and reached 25 million registered players faster than any franchise in Blizzard history, beating Diablo III's launch year unit sales record set in 2012, which for a new IP is an extraordinary accomplishment.
In Q4, MAUs rose to a new franchise high as existing players stayed engaged and new players joined the fun. Showcasing its continued global appeal, Overwatch has players all over the world, including great success in Korea and China.
It's always difficult for [indiscernible] companies to succeed there, and Overwatch's popularity is a testament to Blizzard's unique ability to create globally appealing games.
World of Warcraft: Legion expansion, which launched in late August, continues to reenergize the community. For the year, MAUs were up 10%; and for the quarter, MAUs were up over 20% versus year ago.
Hearthstone players enjoyed a tremendous amount of new content in 2016 with 1 adventure and 2 expansions, including Mean Streets of Gadgetzan, in the fourth quarter. For the year, Hearthstone had record MAUs up over 20% year-over-year, and for the quarter, MAUs were also up versus year ago.
Activision had Q4 MAUs of 51 million. On a full year basis, Activision had its highest annual MAUs ever, up 3% from 2015 and up 23% since 2014. Black Ops III's digital season led to record MAUs for Call of Duty in the year, and Destiny showed steady engagement in its third year. Call of Duty was the #1 franchise in North America for the eighth year in a row and the #1 console franchise globally [indiscernible] withheld for 7 of the last 8 years.
Activision's November release, Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare, is a high-quality, innovative game that pairs with modern warfare remastered [ph], offers a tremendous amount of value and game play variety. However, sales underperformed our expectations, and it's clear that for a portion of our audience, the space setting just didn't resonate. We had a passionate, experienced studio, deeply committed to this direction, and despite the risks we saw, we believe it is important to consider the passions of our game teams in deciding what content to create. But it wasn't the success we planned. It allows us to protect the core tenets of our culture that Bobby discussed: empowering our talented teams to have the chance to pursue opportunities that they are passionate about.  Providing an environment that recommends passion is a critical component of our success, and the process to learn from our mistakes is what makes our company special. And it's why the most talented people in our industry are attracted to our company.
In 2017, Activision will take Call of Duty back to its roots, and traditional combat will once again take center stage. This is what our dedicated community of Call of Duty players and Sledgehammer Games, who has been developing this year's title, are the most excited about. The Call of Duty community remains strong, and Call of Duty is the most successful video game franchise of the last 20 years. Overall, franchise MAUs were stable in Q4 as players engaged on multiple titles. Life-to-date on current-gen consoles, Call of Duty alone has 3 of the top 10 games. This demonstrates the value of year-round engagement and life operations on both new releases and our highly engaging prior releases.
Activision also released Skylanders Imaginators during the fourth quarter, an innovative new game that allows players to create and play their very own Skylanders. The game has delighted kids around the world and has grown the franchise to become the 11th biggest console franchise of all time with more than 300 million toys sold. Based on this franchise strength, our film and TV division launched its first initiative, Skylanders Academy on Netflix in October, which has been very well received. The second season will be delivered later this year, and Netflix has already ordered a third season.
In 2017, rather than releasing a new console title, we will be supporting the award-winning Skylanders Imaginators with multiple adventure packs, new characters and new in-game content. We're also excited to bring Skylanders Imaginators to Nintendo Switch as a launch title next month, and we have a new Skylanders mobile game in development.
Now turning to our second strategic pillar, deepening engagement. Our compelling games, deep game play and consistent follow-on content drove not only large communities but also strong engagement with over 10 billion hours of play time in Q4. Our 43 billion hours of engagement in 2016 was on par with Netflix and 1.5x Snapchat. And importantly, we own our content.
Blizzard's Q4 play time set a new record, breaking the previous record set in Q3. During the fourth quarter, Overwatch had its second and third seasonal events, Halloween Terror and Winter Wonderland, showcasing the successful year-round event-based approach to content. Each successive [ph] event drove new engagement records, including the most recent Lunar New Year event. And Overwatch has more exciting contents coming.
Blizzard's increased investment in World of Warcraft development resources is paying off to a more regular content cadence for players with 2 patches released since Legion launched. This has resulted in higher engagement for the franchise with an increase in total play time for the quarter surpassing Legion's launch quarter and all non-launch quarters in the last 4 years. More content is coming later this year as the full Legion story unfolds.
King's player base continues to be highly engaged with time spent of 34 minutes per daily active user, an increase over last year and last quarter. This was due in part to our increased focus on life operation efforts. King also released a new franchise sequel at the start of this year, Bubble Witch Saga 3, which is off to a great start. Playing our games is just one way our players engage with our franchises. We recently announced our new Consumer Product division headed by Tim Kilpin, a veteran of Mattel and Disney. Elevating our nascent Consumer Products business to a more strategic level is a great opportunity to provide our communities with more high-quality products and collectibles based on our own intellectual properties.
Our audiences also connect with our franchises by viewing our games. In fact, Activision Blizzard accounted for 5 of the top 10 most viewed games on Twitch in 2016. Esports has become not only a catalyst for increased region engagement but also a stand-alone opportunity.
Our Major League Gaming division hit a number of milestones this year, including hosting tournaments for Call of Duty, Overwatch and World of Warcraft; launching the enhanced viewing experience; integrating the MLG.tv player into Call of Duty; growing video viewers on social platforms like Facebook and Instagram by 50% and increasing price [ph] play engagement by over 60% year-over-year.
Activision's launch of the Call of Duty World League sparked strong growth for Call of Duty esports. Activision doubled the 2016 price pool to over 3.5 million [ph] across 16 hosted events. Millions of fans were drawn to the action with the 2016 season delivering 120 million video views and more than twice the time spent viewing compared to last year's season. We look forward to placing [ph] more action in the months to come.
Last year, Blizzard held its 10th BlizzCon and celebrated its 25th anniversary. BlizzCon again sold out in minutes and drew a large global audience with over 25,000 in-person attendees and 10 million people from around the world tuning in. Blizzard also sold a record number of DIRECTV pay-per-view tickets to fans wanting the full BlizzCon virtual experience.
Blizzard announced the formation of the Overwatch League at BlizzCon. For fans, it will offer city-based teams around the world competing in annual seasons with standardized schedules, creating a consistent experience to build passion and allegiance. For team owners, guaranteed slots and clear rights will enable stability and transparency that they can invest in. For players, contracts, including benefits and the combine [ph] for player selection will open up the sort of [ph] career opportunities associated with traditional sports. The Overwatch League is being designed to bring a new era to esports with an epic entertainment experience for everyone involved.
Blizzard feels it has the community passion in place and the required structure established to commence the process of selling teams and media rights for the Overwatch League later this year. We'll have more exciting news to share in the months ahead.
In January, Blizzard kicked off its Heroes Global Championship and announced its upcoming 3rd annual collegiate esports competition, Heroes of the Dorm, which will be streamed exclusively via Facebook Live, ensuring broader global accessibility to esports audiences.
Turning next to the third pillar of our strategy, providing opportunities for more player investment. In-game purchases were yet again close to $1 billion in the quarter and a record $3.8 billion for the year, more than double last year's $1.7 billion. Even without the benefit of the addition of King to our portfolio, the company's in-game purchases would have grown 33% this year. World of Warcraft content and continued strength in Overwatch seasonal events delivered Blizzard's record levels of in-game revenues in the quarter and for the full year. Activision's record in-game revenues for 2016 were driven by a record setting Call of Duty: Black Ops III in-game content season, where, for the first time, add-on revenues were greater than DLC and Season Pass combined even with record Season Pass participation. 
Over the past several years, Activision has methodically and creatively evolved the Call of Duty business model, and this performance illustrates the impact those strategies have had in a relatively short period of time. It also showcases the virtuous cycle created when engaging content leads to more player investment. And this year is the first time we have 3 player communities at scale concurrently in Infinite Warfare, Modern Warfare Remastered and Black Ops III, and we will be supporting each of them with new content throughout the year.
Destiny continues to have a large and committed audience, which is eager for new content and adventures. Activision, along with their partners at Bungie plan to answer the call with the release of a full Destiny sequel later this year designed to thrill our existing loyal fan base and bring many new players into the fold. We plan to support the release of the sequel with a great content planned post launch, setting the stage for growth with this year's sequel and the content season that will follow.
King continues to perform from a player investment perspective despite lower MAUs. Bookings per paying users has increased 6 quarters in a row to its highest level ever. Importantly, we saw stability in the Candy Crush franchise throughout the year with fourth quarter and full year mobile gross bookings increasing year-over-year for the franchise.
We have also invested in a mobile incubation pipeline with multiple games for a number of our core franchises across the company. We will rely on our own talented teams and partners and leverage King's mobile expertise. Some of these games have reached the prototype phase and we believe could drive growth in future years. We have more to share on our expanding mobile efforts down the road.
So in summary, despite many opportunities for improvement, 2016 was, by far, our best year ever for what we've accomplished and for the groundwork we laid to realize the significant growth opportunities that lie ahead.
Dennis will now review the numbers in more detail."

Q4 was another great quarter capping off a record setting year. For the full year for the first time, we had over $1.5 billion in revenues on 3 different interactive platforms: console, PC and mobile, nearly $1 billion in Asia-Pacif",1800,"Great. Thanks, Thomas. Q4 was another great quarter capping off a record setting year. For the full year for the first time, we had over $1.5 billion in revenues on 3 different interactive platforms: console, PC and mobile, nearly $1 billion in Asia-Pacific revenues and more digital revenues for the year than our prior record for total company revenues, all of which helped contribute to record non-GAAP operating margin of 35%, year-over-year EPS growth of 68% and nearly $2.2 billion of operating cash flow, up 71% year-over-year. These results highlight the powerful combination of owned IP, a direct and increasingly digital customer connection and global scale. 
We're obviously very encouraged by this and believe we're only in the early innings of realizing this multi-year opportunity. Looking back, I'd like to first start with our segment results. As reminder, our segment results, unlike our consolidated results are still presented excluding the impact of deferrals as they always have been. Blizzard had its strongest financial performance in history, including record revenue up more than 50% versus last year, a record $1 billion in segment operating income for the year, up 81% versus last year and record Q4 revenue, up 46% versus last year. This historic performance underscores the significant progress Blizzard us made towards transforming into a multi-franchise, multiplatform and multi-geography company. 
In 2016, Blizzard had more than 60% of its revenues from non-World of Warcraft franchises, 20% of its revenues from non-PC platforms and more than 25% of its revenues in APAC. Activision's Q4 had strong catalog and digital performance from Call of Duty: Black Ops III which offset new release underperformance. Activision delivered limit Q4 and full year in-game revenues. And a strong digital performance help drive a record full year segment operating margin of 35%. 
In 2016, King contributed more than we originally planned 30% accretion to our overall results. They continue to have 2 of the top 10 grossing games in the U.S. for the 13th quarter a row. And importantly, the Candy Crush franchise showed continued stability with an increase in mobile bookings year-over-year. 
Now let's turn to our consolidated results. Unless otherwise indicated, I will be referencing non-GAAP as redefined figures, which includes the impact of deferrals. If you would like to calculate metrics as we used to report them, you would add the impact of deferrals to our non-GAAP as redefined figures. Please refer to our earnings release for full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations. 
For the quarter, we generated record Q4 GAAP revenues of $2.01 billion, $158 million above our November guidance and $661 million or 49% above Q4 last year. The net effect of deferred revenue was $438 million for the quarter. We generated GAAP EPS of $0.33. We generated an all-quarter record non-GAAP EPS of $0.65, $0.25 above guidance. The impact of deferrals on non-GAAP EPS was $0.27. The over-performance in the quarter versus guidance was driven primarily be Overwatch and World of Warcraft as well as favorable adjustments to our tax rate versus guidance. 
In Q4, we saw the power of our diverse portfolio and year-round engagement model were even with lower Call of Duty frontline sales, we were able to deliver growth and record results. 
Turning to the full year. We generated record GAAP revenues of $6.61 billion, up 42% year-over-year and operating margin of 21% and EPS of $1.28. The impact of deferred revenue was negative $9 million for the year. 
On a non-GAAP basis, we generated record EPS of $2.18, up 68% year-over-year. The impact of deferrals on non-GAAP EPS was $0.02 in 2016. The digital transition continues to be [indiscernible] for our business, and digital revenues in Q4 were all quarter record $1.5 billion, double last year's figure. 
For the year, we delivered record digital revenues of $4.9 billion, up 94% versus last year. The primary driver for our digital momentum is the continued growth of in-game content. As Thomas mentioned, in-game purchases were close to $1 billion for the quarter and a record $3.8 billion for the year, more than double the $1.7 billion we had last year. We believe we still are in the early days of its important vector in our business with more opportunity ahead. In terms of cash flow, our strong business performance had led to record cash flow generation. For the year, we delivered a record to $2.2 billion of operating cash flow, up 71% year-over-year. For the quarter, we generate operating cash flow of $859 million. 
From a balance sheet perspective, we had a number of positive developments in 2016. The durably of underlying business has driven continue to credit rating improvement. During the year, S&P upgraded us to investment-grade. And Moody's, who had updated us in 2015 concurrent with the King deal announcement moved us up another notch. 
In August, we restructured our term loans, which allowed us to realize interest rate savings and in September we issued new 5 and 10-year notes, which replaced our prior 2021 notes at a more cost-effective rate. So a very busy year on the capital structure front. 
Regarding liquidity, we finished the year with approximately $3.3 billion in cash and investments on the balance sheet with almost $1.4 billion held domestically. Our strong balance sheet and cash flow have allowed us to return significant capital to our various stakeholders. Since 2010, we have repurchased $7.8 billion of our shares and paid out over $1.3 billion in dividend. In addition, since 2013, of the $7.1 billion of gross debt we have borrowed to fund the Vivendi buyback and the King transaction, we've already repaid $2.1 billion as of the end of 2016. 
Continuing on this trend, our board has once again approved a balanced approach to capital allocation for 2017: increasing our dividend by 15% to $0.30 per share, payable in May; authorizing debt paydown of $500 million this year, of which we've already paid down $139 million and authorizing a $1 billion stock repurchase over the next 2 years. 
Now let's turn and look forward to our outlook for 2017. In 2017, as expected, we have a lighter slate of full game releases. Given fewer major top launches of this year, we expect to build on our strong momentum on year round engagement and in-game player investment across our portfolio. A few other things to call out: while strategically important, emerging new revenue streams like team sales for the Overwatch League and the associated media rights are not embedded in our current guidance. In addition, as have said previously, we expect advertising to begin to contribute in 2017 and have a more substantial impact in 2018 and beyond. 
In terms of segments: We expect a more evenly weighted contribution from Activision, Blizzard and King in 2017 than in 2016. We expect Blizzard to have a lower 2017 performance given a lighter release slate. However, Blizzard has lots of exciting plans for live ops and additional in-game content for every franchise, including Overwatch, Hearthstone and World of Warcraft. For Activision, we expect to have lower performance in the first half of the year Call of Duty digital season compared with the record performance of Black Ops III in the first half of 2016. That said, we do expect a larger back half of the year as we released the Destiny sequel and a new Call of Duty title. We're enthusiastic about this year's Call of Duty release going back to its roots. And as such, we are guiding it up into for versus last year Q4 performance. In addition, as Thomas mentioned, the Skylander's franchise will not have a full game console release of this year, but we will continue to engage the community and drive player investment through new toys and digital content. For King, we expect to be modestly up year-over-year, mainly driven by a full year contribution from the business, the introduction of advertising and ongoing live ops across the portfolio. 
Turning to the numbers. On a GAAP basis for 2017, we expect revenues of $6 billion, including GAAP deferrals of $300 million with product cost of 22% and operating expenses of 64%. Our GAAP interest expense is expected to be $156 million and our GAAP tax rate is expected to be 21%. We expect $765 million fully diluted shares both for GAAP and non-GAAP and GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.72. 
Our GAAP numbers include a $0.03 net of taxes GAAP only restructuring charge, which is related to our continued transition to digital. For 2017 on a non-GAAP basis, we expect product cost of 22% and operating expenses of 47%. We expect non-GAAP interest expense of $149 million. We expect a return to the historical tax rate of 24% at 2016's tax rate was lower due to discrete items and stronger international mix to Blizzard's overperformance. We expect non-GAAP EPS of $1.70, including a GAAP deferral of $0.15. 
Please note that we expect that more of a deferral impact in Q4 2017 than we had in Q4 2016 due to the larger expected launches of Destiny and Call of Duty in second half of the year, part of which will be deferred into 2018. Also just to remind everyone, if you'd like to calculate non-GAAP metrics as we used to report them, you would add the impact of deferrals or $0.15 to our non-GAAP as redefined EPS of $1.70 to get our full year 2017 number. 
Now let's turn to our Q1 outlook. On a GAAP basis for Q1, we expect revenues of $1.55 billion, including GAAP deferrals of negative $500 million, product cost of 21% and operating expenses of 60%. Our GAAP interest expense is expected to be $43 million, and our GAAP tax rate is expected to be 21%. We expect $760 million fully diluted shares both for GAAP and non-GAAP, and GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.25. For Q1 on a non-GAAP basis, we expect product cost of 21% and operating expenses of 43%. We expect non-GAAP interest expense of $39 million and tax rate of 24% and non-GAAP EPS of $0.51, including a GAAP deferral of negative $0.33. 
So in summary, 2016 strong performance highlights the tremendous opportunity and potential we have in front of us. The combination of leading owned IP and franchises, a direct digital connection to our consumers, best-in-class content creation capabilities and geographic platform and business model diversity provides an incredibly powerful engine for sustaine d financial performance. So while in 2017, as expected, we'll have a lighter release slate, our strong business platform combined with promising emerging opportunities like eSports, advertising and Consumer Products provides us with a compelling opportunity for growth in 2018 and beyond.

So the first thing I will say is just a that I think the most important Call of Duty ecosystem is a strong. And we continue to see very strong MAUs. And that this is the first time we'll have 3 active games with 3 different player communities at scale with far more, for rematch and Black Ops III. And the plan is we're going to be driving engagement for all of those titles with great content throughout the year. As far as the second part of your question, as I've said many times before, anyone standing franchise like Call of Duty, there's a balancing act between staying true to the things people love about the franchise and also the need to never become complacent and to keep pushing for innovation, to keep the franchise fresh and vital. I would argue over a period of many years now, we've managed that balance on Call of Duty better than just about any long-standing franchise in any medium. Last year, I don't think we got that balance right, if it were, to have great play innovations that many of our fans appreciated and loved but it also had a setting that didn't appeal to all of our fans. The good news is that I'm excited to say that in 2017, we think we have this balance in perfect harmony with the game that our teams are incredibly passionate about with a lot of great innovation, but that also has the traditional combat that we know our fans are going to love. The game is being made by Sledgehammer, as Thomas mentioned, there proven team it's passionate about this title, over 2 years ago now. And they've been hard at work at it ever since and we can't wait to unveil it to the world soon. And without discussing too much about what else you got into Call of Duty pipeline, I can also tell you that we're confident our fans are going to love those games as well and we've never been more excited either creatively or commercially about our 3-year Call of Duty slate."

We've entered 2017 with strong momentum to gain past the 25 million players mark last month. And each seasonal events that we run had set the new record for engagement. Our plan is to continue evolving Overwatch with new hero and map content, new game mode and additional event. We've seen very strong engagement and digital sales from these efforts last year. Looking into the future, we also see opportunities in the areas like the linear media and Consumer Products that we think this will help deepen connections with the franchise and also expose Overwatch to new audiences. In addition, we want to create new ways for players to engage with the franchise through the Overwatch League. eSports is growing, but the ecosystem isn't always easy to navigate for players, viewers or teens. So with the Overwatch League, we're working their hard to address those challenges. Our focus is on creating stability and the participation for teams and owners and accessibility of content for fines. We'll have global city-based teams with the standardized annual schedule, creating professional high-quality content and guaranteed league slots for the team. This is all built on a game that's easy to understand with short matches and great options. The core experience is very fun to watch and already audience for it around the world. Based on this, we think that we'll see significant new business and engagement opportunities. We're going to start identifying team owners soon, that's our next step and we're looking forward to holding our first combine and kicking off the league later this year. So with all that said, we're very excited about Overwatch's future."

So far, the results have been are positive. They've been positive both for the players with an increasing game play and an increase in spend. And it's been positive for advertisers. So we have seen competition rates, which are above-industry benchmarks. And we defined completion rates as when the player really starts a video ad and finish with the video ad. And further on, we have engaged third parties to third-party research, to finalize the impact on players. And the results was that our ads stand out more when they are presented and shown on our platform, on our games then when they are shown on other platforms. So we are very pleased with the results so far. So we are continuing on our plan and the year. And the plan for this year is, first of all, to continue to invest in building the technical infrastructure and to continue building out the team. Secondly, we will continue to test various formats. And as we do so, we will also ramp up the inventory. So our expectation for this year is to have a positive contribution for the bottom line, and we expect to scale the impact on the bottom line in 2018."

And now I'd like to introduce our CEO, Bobby Kotick."

Our performance in 2016 further strengthened our position as the world's leading stand-alone interactive entertainment company. We achieved record results in 2016, delivering all-time high revenue",692,"Thank you, Amrita, and thank you all for joining us today. Our performance in 2016 further strengthened our position as the world's leading stand-alone interactive entertainment company. We achieved record results in 2016, delivering all-time high revenues of $6.6 billion and record non-GAAP EPS of $2.18, up 42% and 68%, respectively, over last year. We also delivered record non-GAAP operating margins of 35%.
We overperformed our plan for the quarter, delivering record revenues of $2 billion and record non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.65, up 49% and 160%, respectively, over last year. We also delivered our strongest annual operating cash flow in history at $2.2 billion, up 71% over last year.
Our success continues to be driven by our 2 greatest assets, our incredibly talented people and the devoted community of gamers we serve. We have roughly 450 million players in 196 countries, and they spent over 40 billion hours playing our games in 2016. And they watched a record 3 billion hours as spectators of our games. We continue to see opportunities to expand audiences, deepen engagement and increase player investment. In fact, prioritization of opportunity remains our greatest challenge, but we remain vigilant in ensuring that the right resources are connected with the right priorities.
We have a number of important successes in 2016 that we'd like to acknowledge. Blizzard's new franchise, Overwatch, has captured the imaginations of players all over the world, and we've only scratched the surface. The truly extraordinary Overwatch team launched the most successful new intellectual property in our company's history. We now have over 25 million registered players, and engagement has continued to grow.
The King team was very focused on continuously releasing fresh content with new levels and features as well as increasing live operations efforts with events and competitions. As a result, mobile bookings for the Candy Crush franchise grew in 2016.
King also made meaningful progress with its advertising initiatives. Last year's advertising tests had 2 primary goals: to design and build an outstanding ad platform that would actually enhance our users' in-game experience and to deliver significant value to advertisers. We're encouraged with the early results. In most tests, our users play more game rounds, spend more time in the game and have a self-reported better game experience with advertising.
Additionally, our platform delivers meaningful value to advertisers. We partnered with some of the world's top advertisers, including Nestl√©, Fox Entertainment and Visa, and our viewability, verifiability and completion metrics are all encouraging. Ads are perceived as more unique and interesting when shown on King inventory, and viewers are more likely to take action after seeing an ad in King games. The King team will continue to build on their efforts this year, and we believe advertising has the potential to be a growth driver in the years to come. 
We also nurtured emerging growth opportunities outside of our games, including esports, television and film and consumer products, and we enhanced the organizations that will support these initiatives. These new opportunities are consistent with and organic to our company's mission, and they have the potential to become important stand-alone businesses in pursuit of our goal to become the leading 21st century entertainment company.
We accelerated our esports efforts with integration of Major League Gaming, the formation of the Call of Duty World League and the announcement of the Overwatch League. Our ambition is to create nothing less than the esports equivalent of the world's established major professional leagues. To this end, in 2017, we plan to start the process of selling teams and commercializing media rights for the Overwatch League. We look forward to welcoming team owners with the expertise, skills and investment required to build the professional league together.
We plan to invest in these long-term growth pillars further in 2017 and expect them to have even greater impact in 2018 and beyond. I couldn't be more excited about our prospects for the future, and our team's dedication and enthusiasm reinforces my confidence that we will continue to achieve our ambitious plans.
Thomas and Dennis will now share with you the results of our record quarter and our record year."
4222231,416154291,1129056,"Activision Blizzard, Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 09, 2017",2017-02-09,"Earnings Calls","Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Bobby. Due to our portfolio strength and digital momentum, we far exceeded our plans in 2016. We surpassed our initial revenue guidance by $0.5 billion and our initial non-GAAP EPS guidance by more than $0.40. And we also outperformed expectati",2070,"Thank you, Bobby. Due to our portfolio strength and digital momentum, we far exceeded our plans in 2016. We surpassed our initial revenue guidance by $0.5 billion and our initial non-GAAP EPS guidance by more than $0.40. And we also outperformed expectations for the holiday quarter.
In driving our record setting year and as we look ahead, we remain focused on our 3 strategic pillars: first, expanding our audiences; second, deepening engagement; and third, providing opportunities for more player investment.
Let's start with audience reach, which was 447 million monthly active users this quarter. Blizzard had record Q4 MAUs of 41 million; and for the year, Blizzard had its highest annual MAUs ever up 37% from 2015 and up 87% since 2014. This is a remarkable achievement demonstrating the strength of the Blizzard portfolio and capabilities.
Overwatch, released in May, set a record for the strongest launch year financial performance of any game in Blizzard's 26-year history. The game is critically acclaimed, receiving 55 Game of the Year awards and reached 25 million registered players faster than any franchise in Blizzard history, beating Diablo III's launch year unit sales record set in 2012, which for a new IP is an extraordinary accomplishment.
In Q4, MAUs rose to a new franchise high as existing players stayed engaged and new players joined the fun. Showcasing its continued global appeal, Overwatch has players all over the world, including great success in Korea and China.
It's always difficult for western companies to succeed there, and Overwatch's popularity is a testament to Blizzard's unique ability to create globally appealing games.
World of Warcraft: Legion expansion, which launched in late August, continues to reenergize the community. For the year, MAUs were up 10%; and for the quarter, MAUs were up over 20% versus year ago.
Hearthstone players enjoyed a tremendous amount of new content in 2016 with 1 adventure and 2 expansions, including Mean Streets of Gadgetzan, in the fourth quarter. For the year, Hearthstone had record MAUs up over 20% year-over-year, and for the quarter, MAUs were also up versus year ago.
Activision had Q4 MAUs of 51 million. On a full year basis, Activision had its highest annual MAUs ever, up 3% from 2015 and up 23% since 2014. Black Ops III's digital season led to record MAUs for Call of Duty in the year, and Destiny showed steady engagement in its third year. Call of Duty was the #1 franchise in North America for the eighth year in a row and the #1 console franchise globally [indiscernible] withheld for 7 of the last 8 years.
Activision's November release, Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare, is a high-quality, innovative game that pairs with Modern Warfare Remastered, offers a tremendous amount of value and game play variety. However, sales underperformed our expectations, and it's clear that for a portion of our audience, the space setting just didn't resonate. We had a passionate, experienced studio, deeply committed to this direction, and despite the risks we saw, we believe it is important to consider the passions of our game teams in deciding what content to create. But it wasn't the success we planned. It allows us to protect the core tenets of our culture that Bobby discussed: empowering our talented teams to have the chance to pursue opportunities that they are passionate about.  Providing an environment that recommends passion is a critical component of our success, and the process to learn from our mistakes is what makes our company special. And it's why the most talented people in our industry are attracted to our company.
In 2017, Activision will take Call of Duty back to its roots, and traditional combat will once again take center stage. This is what our dedicated community of Call of Duty players and Sledgehammer Games, who has been developing this year's title, are the most excited about. The Call of Duty community remains strong, and Call of Duty is the most successful video game franchise of the last 20 years. Overall, franchise MAUs were stable in Q4 as players engaged on multiple titles. Life-to-date on current-gen consoles, Call of Duty alone has 3 of the top 10 games. This demonstrates the value of year-round engagement and life operations on both new releases and our highly engaging prior releases.
Activision also released Skylanders Imaginators during the fourth quarter, an innovative new game that allows players to create and play their very own Skylanders. The game has delighted kids around the world and has grown the franchise to become the 11th biggest console franchise of all time with more than 300 million toys sold. Based on this franchise strength, our film and TV division launched its first initiative, Skylanders Academy on Netflix in October, which has been very well received. The second season will be delivered later this year, and Netflix has already ordered a third season.
In 2017, rather than releasing a new console title, we will be supporting the award-winning Skylanders Imaginators with multiple adventure packs, new characters and new in-game content. We're also excited to bring Skylanders Imaginators to Nintendo Switch as a launch title next month, and we have a new Skylanders mobile game in development.
Now turning to our second strategic pillar, deepening engagement. Our compelling games, deep game play and consistent follow-on content drove not only large communities but also strong engagement with over 10 billion hours of play time in Q4. Our 43 billion hours of engagement in 2016 was on par with Netflix and 1.5x Snapchat. And importantly, we own our content.
Blizzard's Q4 play time set a new record, breaking the previous record set in Q3. During the fourth quarter, Overwatch had its second and third seasonal events, Halloween Terror and Winter Wonderland, showcasing the successful year-round event-based approach to content. Each successive event drove new engagement records, including the most recent Lunar New Year event. And Overwatch has more exciting contents coming.
Blizzard's increased investment in World of Warcraft development resources is paying off to a more regular content cadence for players with 2 patches released since Legion launched. This has resulted in higher engagement for the franchise with an increase in total play time for the quarter surpassing Legion's launch quarter and all non-launch quarters in the last 4 years. More content is coming later this year as the full Legion story unfolds.
King's player base continues to be highly engaged with time spent of 34 minutes per daily active user, an increase over last year and last quarter. This was due in part to our increased focus on life operation efforts. King also released a new franchise sequel at the start of this year, Bubble Witch Saga 3, which is off to a great start. Playing our games is just one way our players engage with our franchises. We recently announced our new Consumer Product division headed by Tim Kilpin, a veteran of Mattel and Disney. Elevating our nascent Consumer Products business to a more strategic level is a great opportunity to provide our communities with more high-quality products and collectibles based on our own intellectual properties.
Our audiences also connect with our franchises by viewing our games. In fact, Activision Blizzard accounted for 5 of the top 10 most viewed games on Twitch in 2016. Esports has become not only a catalyst for increased region engagement but also a stand-alone opportunity.
Our Major League Gaming division hit a number of milestones this year, including hosting tournaments for Call of Duty, Overwatch and World of Warcraft; launching the enhanced viewing experience; integrating the MLG.tv player into Call of Duty; growing video viewers on social platforms like Facebook and Instagram by 50% and increasing price [ph] play engagements by over 60% year-over-year.
Activision's launch of the Call of Duty World League sparked strong growth for Call of Duty esports. Activision doubled the 2016 price pool to over $3.5 million across 16 hosted events. Millions of fans were drawn to the action with the 2016 season delivering 120 million video views and more than twice the time spent viewing compared to last year's season. We look forward to placing more action in the months to come.
Last year, Blizzard held its 10th BlizzCon and celebrated its 25th anniversary. BlizzCon again sold out in minutes and drew a large global audience with over 25,000 in-person attendees and 10 million people from around the world tuning in. Blizzard also sold a record number of DIRECTV pay-per-view tickets to fans wanting the full BlizzCon virtual experience.
Blizzard announced the formation of the Overwatch League at BlizzCon. For fans, it will offer city-based teams around the world competing in annual seasons with standardized schedules, creating a consistent experience to build passion and allegiance. For team owners, guaranteed slots and clear rights will enable stability and transparency that they can invest in. For players, contracts, including benefits and the combine for player selection will open up the sort of career opportunities associated with traditional sports. The Overwatch League is being designed to bring a new era to esports with an epic entertainment experience for everyone involved.
Blizzard feels it has the community passion in place and the required structure established to commence the process of selling teams and media rights for the Overwatch League later this year. We'll have more exciting news to share in the months ahead.
In January, Blizzard kicked off its Heroes Global Championship and announced its upcoming 3rd annual collegiate esports competition, Heroes of the Dorm, which will be streamed exclusively via Facebook Live, ensuring broader global accessibility to esports audiences.
Turning next to the third pillar of our strategy, providing opportunities for more player investment. In-game purchases were yet again close to $1 billion in the quarter and a record $3.8 billion for the year, more than double last year's $1.7 billion. Even without the benefit of the addition of King to our portfolio, the company's in-game purchases would have grown 33% this year. World of Warcraft content and continued strength in Overwatch seasonal events delivered Blizzard's record levels of in-game revenues in the quarter and for the full year. Activision's record in-game revenues for 2016 were driven by a record setting Call of Duty: Black Ops III in-game content season, where, for the first time, add-on revenues were greater than DLC and Season Pass combined even with record Season Pass participation. 
Over the past several years, Activision has methodically and creatively evolved the Call of Duty business model, and this performance illustrates the impact those strategies have had in a relatively short period of time. It also showcases the virtuous cycle created when engaging content leads to more player investment. And this year is the first time we have 3 player communities at scale concurrently in Infinite Warfare, Modern Warfare Remastered and Black Ops III, and we will be supporting each of them with new content throughout the year.
Destiny continues to have a large and committed audience, which is eager for new content and adventures. Activision, along with their partners at Bungie plan to answer the call with the release of a full Destiny sequel later this year designed to thrill to our existing loyal fan base and bring many new players into the fold. We plan to support the release of the sequel with a great content plan post launch, setting the stage for growth with this year's sequel and the content season that will follow.
King continues to perform from a player investment perspective despite lower MAUs. Bookings per paying user has increased 6 quarters in a row to its highest level ever. Importantly, we saw stability in the Candy Crush franchise throughout the year with fourth quarter and full year mobile gross bookings increasing year-over-year for the franchise.
We have also invested in a mobile incubation pipeline with multiple games for a number of our core franchises across the company. We will rely on our own talented teams and partners and leverage King's mobile expertise. Some of these games have reached the prototype phase and we believe could drive growth in future years. We have more to share on our expanding mobile efforts down the road.
So in summary, despite many opportunities for improvement, 2016 was, by far, our best year ever for what we've accomplished and for the groundwork we laid to realize the significant growth opportunities that lie ahead.
Dennis will now review the numbers in more detail."

For the full year for the first time, we had over $1.5 billion in revenues on 3 different interactive platforms: console, PC and mobile, nearly $1 billion in Asia-Pacif",1807,"Great. Thanks, Thomas. Q4 was another great quarter capping off a record-setting year. For the full year for the first time, we had over $1.5 billion in revenues on 3 different interactive platforms: console, PC and mobile, nearly $1 billion in Asia-Pacific revenues and more digital revenues for the year than our prior record for total company revenues, all of which helped contribute to record non-GAAP operating margin of 35%, year-over-year EPS growth of 68% and nearly $2.2 billion of operating cash flow, up 71% year-over-year. These results highlight the powerful combination of owned IP, a direct and increasingly digital customer connection and global scale. We're obviously very encouraged by this and believe we're only in the early innings of realizing this multi-year opportunity.
Looking back, I'd like to first start with our segment results. As reminder, our segment results, unlike our consolidated results, are still presented excluding the impact of deferrals as they always have been. Blizzard had its strongest financial performance in history, including record revenue up more than 50% versus last year; a record $1 billion in segment operating income for the year, up 81% versus last year; and record Q4 revenue, up 46% versus last year. This historic performance underscores the significant progress Blizzard has made towards transforming into a multi-franchise, multi-platform and multi-geography company. In 2016, Blizzard had more than 60% of its revenues from non-World of Warcraft franchises, 20% of its revenues from non-PC platforms and more than 25% of its revenues in APAC.
Activision's Q4 had strong catalog and digital performance from Call of Duty: Black Ops III, which offset new release underperformance. Activision delivered record Q4 and full year in-game revenues. And the strong digital performance helped drive a record full year segment operating margin of 35%.
In 2016, King contributed more than the originally planned 30% accretion to our overall results. They continue to have 2 of the top 10 grossing games in the U.S. for the 13th quarter in a row, and importantly, the Candy Crush franchise showed continued stability with an increase in mobile bookings year-over-year.
Now let's turn to our consolidated results. Unless otherwise indicated, I will be referencing non-GAAP as redefined figures, which include the impact of deferrals. If you would like to calculate metrics as we used to report them, you would add the impact of deferrals to our non-GAAP as redefined figures. Please refer to our earnings release for full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations.
For the quarter, we generated record Q4 GAAP revenues of $2.01 billion, $158 million above our November guidance and $661 million or 49% above Q4 last year. The net effect of deferred revenue was $438 million for the quarter. We generated GAAP EPS of $0.33. We generated an all-quarter record non-GAAP EPS of $0.65, $0.25 above guidance. The impact of deferrals on non-GAAP EPS was $0.27. The overperformance in the quarter versus guidance was driven primarily be Overwatch and World of Warcraft as well as favorable adjustments to our tax rate versus guidance. In Q4, you saw the power of our diverse portfolio and year-round engagement model where even with lower Call of Duty frontline sales, we were able to deliver growth and record results.
Turning to the full year. We generated record GAAP revenues of $6.61 billion, up 42% year-over-year and operating margin of 21% and EPS of $1.28. The impact of deferred revenue was negative $9 million for the year. On a non-GAAP basis, we generated record EPS of $2.18, up 68% year-over-year. The impact of deferrals on non-GAAP EPS was $0.02 in 2016.
The digital transition continues to be a nice tailwind for our business, and digital revenues in Q4 were an all-quarter record $1.5 billion, double last year's figure. For the year, we delivered record digital revenues of $4.9 billion, up 94% versus last year.
The primary driver for our digital momentum is the continued growth of in-game content. As Thomas mentioned, in-game purchases were close to $1 billion for the quarter and a record $3.8 billion for the year, more than double the $1.7 billion we had last year. We believe we still are in the early days of this important vector in our business with more opportunity ahead.
In terms of cash flow, our strong business performance had led to record cash flow generation. For the year, we delivered a record to $2.2 billion of operating cash flow, up 71% year-over-year. For the quarter, we generated operating cash flow of $859 million.
From a balance sheet perspective, we had a number of positive developments in 2016. The durability of our underlying business has driven continued to credit rating improvement. During the year, S&P upgraded us to investment grade, and Moody's, who had updated us in 2015 concurrent with the King deal announcement, moved us up another notch.
In August, we restructured our term loans, which allowed us to realize interest rate savings, and in September, we issued new 5- and 10-year notes, which replaced our prior 2021 notes at a more cost-effective rate. So a very busy year on the capital structure front.
Regarding liquidity, we finished the year with approximately $3.3 billion in cash and investments on the balance sheet with almost $1.4 billion held domestically. Our strong balance sheet and cash flow have allowed us to return significant capital to our various stakeholders. Since 2010, we have repurchased $7.8 billion of our shares and paid out over $1.3 billion in dividends. In addition, since 2013, of the $7.1 billion of gross debt we have borrowed to fund the Vivendi buyback and the King transaction, we've already repaid $2.1 billion as of the end of 2016.
Continuing on this trend, our board has once again approved a balanced approach to capital allocation for 2017: increasing our dividend by 15% to $0.30 per share payable in May; authorizing debt paydown of $500 million this year, of which we've already paid down $139 million in February; and authorizing a $1 billion stock repurchase over the next 2 years.
Now let's turn and look forward to our outlook for 2017. In 2017, as expected, we have a lighter slate of full game releases. Given fewer major launches this year, we expect to build on our strong momentum on year-round engagement and in-game player investment across our portfolio. A few other things to call out: While strategically important, emerging new revenue streams like team sales for the Overwatch League and the associated media rights are not embedded in our current guidance. In addition, as we have said previously, we expect advertising to begin to contribute in 2017 and have a more substantial impact in 2018 and beyond.
In terms of segments, we expect a more evenly weighted contribution from Activision, Blizzard and King in 2017 than in 2016. We expect Blizzard to have a lower 2017 performance given a lighter release slate. However, Blizzard has lots of exciting plans for live ops and additional in-game content for every franchise, including Overwatch, Hearthstone and World of Warcraft.
For Activision, we expect to have lower performance in the first half of the year given a smaller Call of Duty digital season compared with the record performance of Black Ops III in the first half of 2016. That said, we do expect a larger back half of the year as we release the Destiny sequel and a new Call of Duty title. We're enthusiastic about this year's Call of Duty release going back to its roots, and as such, we are guiding it up in Q4 versus last year's Q4 performance.
In addition, as Thomas mentioned, the Skylanders franchise will not have a full game console release this year, but we will continue to engage the community and drive player investment through new toys and digital content. For King, we expect to be modestly up year-over-year, mainly driven by a full year contribution from the business, the introduction of advertising and ongoing live ops across the portfolio.
Turning to the numbers. On a GAAP basis for 2017, we expect revenues of $6 billion, including GAAP deferrals of $300 million, with product cost of 22% and operating expenses of 64%. Our GAAP interest expense is expected to be $156 million, and our GAAP tax rate is expected to be 21%. We expect 765 million fully diluted shares, both for GAAP and non-GAAP, and GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.72.  Our GAAP numbers include a $0.03 net of taxes GAAP-only restructuring charge, which is related to our continued transition to digital.
For 2017, on a non-GAAP basis, we expect product cost of 22% and operating expenses of 47%. We expect non-GAAP interest expense of $149 million. We expect a return to the historical tax rate of 24% as 2016's tax rate was lower due to discrete items and stronger international mix due to Blizzard's overperformance. We expect non-GAAP EPS of $1.70, including a GAAP deferral of $0.15.
Please note that we expect more of a deferral impact in Q4 2017 than we had in Q4 2016 due to the larger expected launches of Destiny and Call of Duty in the second half of the year, part of which will be deferred into 2018. Also, just to remind everyone, if you would like to calculate non-GAAP metrics as we used to report them, you would add the impact of deferrals or $0.15 to our non-GAAP as redefined EPS of $1.70 to get to our full year 2017 number.
Now let's turn to our Q1 outlook. On a GAAP basis for Q1, we expect revenues of $1.55 billion, including GAAP deferrals of negative $500 million, product cost of 21% and operating expenses of 60%. Our GAAP interest expense is expected to be $43 million, and our GAAP tax rate is expected to be 21%. We expect 760 million fully diluted shares, both for GAAP and non-GAAP, and GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.25.
For Q1, on a non-GAAP basis, we expect product cost of 21% and operating expenses of 43%. We expect non-GAAP interest expense of $39 million, a tax rate of 24% and non-GAAP EPS of $0.51, including a GAAP deferral of negative $0.33.
So in summary, 2016's strong performance highlights the tremendous opportunity and potential we have in front of us. The combination of leading owned IP and franchises, a direct digital connection to our consumers, best-in-class content creation capabilities and geographic platform and business model diversity provides an incredibly powerful engine for sustained financial performance. So while in 2017, as expected, we will have a lighter release slate, our strong business platform combined with promising emerging opportunities like esports, advertising and consumer products provides us with a compelling opportunity for growth in 2018 and beyond.

It's Eric. So the first thing I will say is just that, I think, the most important thing is, remember, the Call of Duty ecosystem is strong, and we continue to see very strong MAUs and that this is the first time we'll have 3 active games with 3 different player communities at scale with Infinite Warfare, Modern Warfare Remastered and Black Ops III. And the plan is we're going to be driving engagements for all of those titles with great content throughout the year. As far as the second part of your question, as I've said many times before, with any long standing franchise like Call of Duty, there's a balancing act we need to strike between staying true to the things people love about the franchise and also the need to never become complacent and to keep pushing for innovations to keep the franchise fresh and vital. I would argue, over a period of many years now, we've managed that balance on Call of Duty better than just about any long standing franchise in any medium. Last year, I don't think we got that balance right. Infinite Warfare had a ton of great game play innovations that many of our fans appreciated and loved, but it also had a setting that didn't appeal to all of our fans. The good news is that I'm excited to say that, in 2017, we think we have this balance in perfect harmony with the game that our teams are incredibly passionate about with a lot of great innovations but that also has the traditional combat that we know our fans are going to love. The game is being made by Sledgehammer, and as Thomas mentioned, they're a proven team. They're passionate about this title. We greenlit it over 2 years ago now. And they've been hard at work at it ever since, and we can't wait to unveil it to the world soon. And without discussing too much about what else we've got in the Call of Duty pipeline, I can also tell you that we're confident our fans are going to love those games as well, and we've never been more excited, either creatively or commercially, about our 3-year Call of Duty slate."

And each seasonal events that we run has set a new record for engagement. Our plan is to continue evolving Overwatch with new hero and map content, new game modes and additional events. We've seen very strong engagement and digital sales from these efforts last year. Looking into the future, we also see opportunities in areas like linear media and consumer product. We think that this will help it -- help deepen connections with the franchise and also expose Overwatch to new audiences. In addition, we want to create new ways for players to engage with the franchise through the Overwatch League. Esports is growing, but the ecosystem isn't always easy to navigate for players, viewers or teams. So with the Overwatch League, we're working very hard to address those challenges. Our focus is on creating stability and participation for teams and owners and accessibility of the content for fans. We'll have global city-based teams with a standardized annual schedule, creating professional high-quality content and guaranteed league slots for the teams. This is all built on a game that's easy to understand with short matches and great action. The core experience is very fun to watch, and there's already a sizable audience for it around the world. Based on this, we think that we'll see significant new business and engagement opportunities. We're going to start identifying team owners soon. That's our next step, and we're looking forward to holding our first combine and kicking off the league later this year. So with all that said, we're very excited about Overwatch's future."

It's a very engaged user base. So in the last earning call -- earnings call, I said that we are very careful and protective of the user experience. And so we've been testing and we are testing several ad formats. We've been testing with very high-quality consumer brands like Nestl√© or Fox in our key games. We've been testing in Candy. We've been testing in Candy Crush Soda Saga. And we are testing integrated ad formats, which are integrated in the game play and are supportive of the game play. And so far, the results have been very positive. They've been positive both for the players with an increasing game play and an increase in ad spend, and it's been positive for advertisers. So we have seen completion rates, which are above-industry benchmarks, and we define completion rates as when the player really starts a video ad and finishes the video ad. And further on, we have engaged third parties through third-party research to finalize the impact on players, and the result was that our ads stand out more when they are presented and shown on our platform, on our games than when they are shown on other platforms. So we are very pleased with the results so far. So we are continuing on our plan and the year -- and the plan for this year is, first of all, to continue to invest in building the technical infrastructure and to continue building out the team. Secondly, we will continue to test various ad formats, and as we do so we will also ramp up the inventory. So our expectation for this year is to have a positive contribution to the bottom line, and we expect to scale the impact on the bottom line in 2018."

Yes, digital tailwinds have obviously been a huge -- an important factor across all of our businesses and think we have the diversity of being across multiple platforms, so having huge success on mobile, which is almost all digital; on PC, which has, over time, become almost all digital. And then the last real holdout is really on console where full game download mix is still the minority of player purchases. In general, it varies based on title and region and audience type. So for a game in big and mass market as Call of Duty, you see a slightly lower percentage mix of digital just because it is so mass market, but it's now in the low to mid-20s. And that's up from 0, 3 or 4 years ago. And -- but in games like Destiny and Overwatch, we see in the mid-30s. So -- and that trend is continuing every year where we see 5-plus percentage points of mix moving every year in terms of overall business mix. So it should be a nice tailwind for us and for others in the industry over the next few years as well."

The cornerstone of that is a great cinematic story. That's been a real focus with a great cast of memorable, relatable characters coupled with some very nice ways to make the game more accessible to a casual play.

We have launched Bubble Witch 3, and we are extremely pleased not only with the quality of the game but also with the response from the players and acceptance from the players.

If you think about consumer products as they relate to the NFL or the NBA, these are billions of dollars of revenues for the leagues, and we think they'll be great opportunities for a league and team merchandise. That'll be important component of what we do in the Consumer Products business.

Blizzard's new franchise, Overwatch, has captured the imaginations of players all over the world, and we've only scratched the surface. The truly extraordinary Overwatch team launched the most successful new intellectual property in our company's history. We now have over 25 million registered players, and engagement has continued to grow.
The King team was very focused on continuously releasing fresh content with new levels and features as well as increasing live operations efforts with events and competitions. As a result, mobile bookings for the Candy Crush franchise grew in 2016.
King also made meaningful progress with its advertising initiatives. Last year's advertising tests had 2 primary goals: to design and build an outstanding ad platform that would actually enhance our users' in-game experience and to deliver significant value to advertisers. We're encouraged with the early results. In most tests, our users play more game rounds, spend more time in the game and have a self-reported better game experience with advertising.
Additionally, our platform delivers meaningful value to advertisers. We partnered with some of the world's top advertisers, including Nestl√©, Fox Entertainment and Visa, and our viewability, verifiability and completion metrics are all encouraging. Ads are perceived as more unique and interesting when shown on King inventory, and viewers are more likely to take action after seeing an ad in King games. The King team will continue to build on their efforts this year, and we believe advertising has the potential to be a growth driver in the years to come. 
We also nurtured emerging growth opportunities outside of our games, including esports, television and film and consumer products, and we enhanced the organizations that will support these initiatives. These new opportunities are consistent with and organic to our company's mission, and they have the potential to become important stand-alone businesses in pursuit of our goal to become the leading 21st century entertainment company.
We accelerated our esports efforts with integration of Major League Gaming, the formation of the Call of Duty World League and the announcement of the Overwatch League. Our ambition is to create nothing less than the esports equivalent of the world's established major professional leagues. To this end, in 2017, we plan to start the process of selling teams and commercializing media rights for the Overwatch League. We look forward to welcoming team owners with the expertise, skills and investment required to build the professional league together.
We plan to invest in these long-term growth pillars further in 2017 and expect them to have even greater impact in 2018 and beyond. I couldn't be more excited about our prospects for the future, and our team's dedication and enthusiasm reinforces my confidence that we will continue to achieve our ambitious plans.
Thomas and Dennis will now share with you the results of our record quarter and our record year."

We surpassed our initial revenue guidance by $0.5 billion and our initial non-GAAP EPS guidance by more than $0.40. And we also outperformed expectati",2072,"Thank you, Bobby. Due to our portfolio strength and digital momentum, we far exceeded our plans in 2016. We surpassed our initial revenue guidance by $0.5 billion and our initial non-GAAP EPS guidance by more than $0.40. And we also outperformed expectations for the holiday quarter.
In driving our record setting year and as we look ahead, we remain focused on our 3 strategic pillars: first, expanding our audiences; second, deepening engagement; and third, providing opportunities for more player investment.
Let's start with audience reach, which was 447 million monthly active users this quarter. Blizzard had record Q4 MAUs of 41 million; and for the year, Blizzard had its highest annual MAUs ever up 37% from 2015 and up 87% since 2014. This is a remarkable achievement demonstrating the strength of the Blizzard portfolio and capabilities.
Overwatch, released in May, set a record for the strongest launch year financial performance of any game in Blizzard's 26-year history. The game is critically acclaimed, receiving 55 Game of the Year awards and reached 25 million registered players faster than any franchise in Blizzard history, beating Diablo III's launch year unit sales record set in 2012, which for a new IP is an extraordinary accomplishment.
In Q4, MAUs rose to a new franchise high as existing players stayed engaged and new players joined the fun. Showcasing its continued global appeal, Overwatch has players all over the world, including great success in Korea and China.
It's always difficult for western companies to succeed there, and Overwatch's popularity is a testament to Blizzard's unique ability to create globally appealing games.
World of Warcraft: Legion expansion, which launched in late August, continues to reenergize the community. For the year, MAUs were up 10%; and for the quarter, MAUs were up over 20% versus year ago.
Hearthstone players enjoyed a tremendous amount of new content in 2016 with 1 adventure and 2 expansions, including Mean Streets of Gadgetzan, in the fourth quarter. For the year, Hearthstone had record MAUs up over 20% year-over-year, and for the quarter, MAUs were also up versus year ago.
Activision had Q4 MAUs of 51 million. On a full year basis, Activision had its highest annual MAUs ever, up 3% from 2015 and up 23% since 2014. Black Ops III's digital season led to record MAUs for Call of Duty in the year, and Destiny showed steady engagement in its third year. Call of Duty was the #1 franchise in North America for the eighth year in a row and the #1 console franchise globally and Mattel was held for 7 of the last 8 years.
Activision's November release, Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare, is a high-quality, innovative game that pairs with Modern Warfare Remastered, offers a tremendous amount of value and game play variety. However, sales underperformed our expectations, and it's clear that for a portion of our audience, the space setting just didn't resonate. We had a passionate, experienced studio, deeply committed to this direction, and despite the risks we saw, we believe it is important to consider the passions of our game teams in deciding what content to create. But it wasn't the success we planned. It allows us to protect the core tenets of our culture that Bobby discussed: empowering our talented teams to have the chance to pursue opportunities that they are passionate about.  Providing an environment that recommends passion is a critical component of our success, and the process to learn from our mistakes is what makes our company special. And it's why the most talented people in our industry are attracted to our company.
In 2017, Activision will take Call of Duty back to its roots, and traditional combat will once again take center stage. This is what our dedicated community of Call of Duty players and Sledgehammer Games, who has been developing this year's title, are the most excited about. The Call of Duty community remains strong, and Call of Duty is the most successful video game franchise of the last 20 years. Overall, franchise MAUs were stable in Q4 as players engaged on multiple titles. Life-to-date on current-gen consoles, Call of Duty alone has 3 of the top 10 games. This demonstrates the value of year-round engagement and life operations on both new releases and our highly engaging prior releases.
Activision also released Skylanders Imaginators during the fourth quarter, an innovative new game that allows players to create and play their very own Skylanders. The game has delighted kids around the world and has grown the franchise to become the 11th biggest console franchise of all time with more than 300 million toys sold. Based on this franchise strength, our film and TV division launched its first initiative, Skylanders Academy on Netflix in October, which has been very well received. The second season will be delivered later this year, and Netflix has already ordered a third season.
In 2017, rather than releasing a new console title, we will be supporting the award-winning Skylanders Imaginators with multiple adventure packs, new characters and new in-game content. We're also excited to bring Skylanders Imaginators to Nintendo Switch as a launch title next month, and we have a new Skylanders mobile game in development.
Now turning to our second strategic pillar, deepening engagement. Our compelling games, deep game play and consistent follow-on content drove not only large communities but also strong engagement with over 10 billion hours of play time in Q4. Our 43 billion hours of engagement in 2016 was on par with Netflix and 1.5x Snapchat. And importantly, we own our content.
Blizzard's Q4 play time set a new record, breaking the previous record set in Q3. During the fourth quarter, Overwatch had its second and third seasonal events, Halloween Terror and Winter Wonderland, showcasing the successful year-round event-based approach to content. Each successive event drove new engagement records, including the most recent Lunar New Year event. And Overwatch has more exciting contents coming.
Blizzard's increased investment in World of Warcraft development resources is paying off to a more regular content cadence for players with 2 patches released since Legion launched. This has resulted in higher engagement for the franchise with an increase in total play time for the quarter surpassing Legion's launch quarter and all non-launch quarters in the last 4 years. More content is coming later this year as the full Legion story unfolds.
King's player base continues to be highly engaged with time spent of 34 minutes per daily active user, an increase over last year and last quarter. This was due in part to our increased focus on life operation efforts. King also released a new franchise sequel at the start of this year, Bubble Witch Saga 3, which is off to a great start. Playing our games is just one way our players engage with our franchises. We recently announced our new Consumer Product division headed by Tim Kilpin, a veteran of Mattel and Disney. Elevating our nascent Consumer Products business to a more strategic level is a great opportunity to provide our communities with more high-quality products and collectibles based on our own intellectual properties.
Our audiences also connect with our franchises by viewing our games. In fact, Activision Blizzard accounted for 5 of the top 10 most viewed games on Twitch in 2016. Esports has become not only a catalyst for increased reach and engagement but also a stand-alone opportunity.
Our Major League Gaming division hit a number of milestones this year, including hosting tournaments for Call of Duty, Overwatch and World of Warcraft; launching the enhanced viewing experience; integrating the MLG.tv player into Call of Duty; growing video viewers on social platforms like Facebook and Instagram by 50% and increasing price play engagements by over 60% year-over-year.
Activision's launch of the Call of Duty World League sparked strong growth for Call of Duty esports. Activision doubled the 2016 price pool to over $3.5 million across 16 hosted events. Millions of fans were drawn to the action with the 2016 season delivering 120 million video views and more than twice the time spent viewing compared to last year's season. We look forward to placing more action in the months to come.
Last year, Blizzard held its 10th BlizzCon and celebrated its 25th anniversary. BlizzCon again sold out in minutes and drew a large global audience with over 25,000 in-person attendees and 10 million people from around the world tuning in. Blizzard also sold a record number of DIRECTV pay-per-view tickets to fans wanting the full BlizzCon virtual experience.
Blizzard announced the formation of the Overwatch League at BlizzCon. For fans, it will offer city-based teams around the world competing in annual seasons with standardized schedules, creating a consistent experience to build passion and allegiance. For team owners, guaranteed slots and clear rights will enable stability and transparency that they can invest in. For players, contracts, including benefits and the combine for player selection will open up the sort of career opportunities associated with traditional sports. The Overwatch League is being designed to bring a new era to esports with an epic entertainment experience for everyone involved.
Blizzard feels it has the community passion in place and the required structure established to commence the process of selling teams and media rights for the Overwatch League later this year. We'll have more exciting news to share in the months ahead.
In January, Blizzard kicked off its Heroes Global Championship and announced its upcoming 3rd annual collegiate esports competition, Heroes of the Dorm, which will be streamed exclusively via Facebook Live, ensuring broader global accessibility to esports audiences.
Turning next to the third pillar of our strategy, providing opportunities for more player investment. In-game purchases were yet again close to $1 billion in the quarter and a record $3.8 billion for the year, more than double last year's $1.7 billion. Even without the benefit of the addition of King to our portfolio, the company's in-game purchases would have grown 33% this year. World of Warcraft content and continued strength in Overwatch seasonal events delivered Blizzard's record levels of in-game revenues in the quarter and for the full year. Activision's record in-game revenues for 2016 were driven by a record setting Call of Duty: Black Ops III in-game content season, where, for the first time, add-on revenues were greater than DLC and Season Pass combined even with record Season Pass participation. 
Over the past several years, Activision has methodically and creatively evolved the Call of Duty business model, and this performance illustrates the impact those strategies have had in a relatively short period of time. It also showcases the virtuous cycle created when engaging content leads to more player investment. And this year is the first time we have 3 player communities at scale concurrently in Infinite Warfare, Modern Warfare Remastered and Black Ops III, and we will be supporting each of them with new content throughout the year.
Destiny continues to have a large and committed audience, which is eager for new content and adventures. Activision, along with their partners at Bungie plan to answer the call with the release of a full Destiny sequel later this year designed to thrill to our existing loyal fan base and bring many new players into the fold. We plan to support the release of the sequel with a great content plan post launch, setting the stage for growth with this year's sequel and the content season that will follow.
King continues to perform from a player investment perspective despite lower MAUs. Bookings per paying user has increased 6 quarters in a row to its highest level ever. Importantly, we saw stability in the Candy Crush franchise throughout the year with fourth quarter and full year mobile gross bookings increasing year-over-year for the franchise.
We have also invested in a mobile incubation pipeline with multiple games for a number of our core franchises across the company. We will rely on our own talented teams and partners and leverage King's mobile expertise. Some of these games have reached the prototype phase and we believe could drive growth in future years. We have more to share on our expanding mobile efforts down the road.
So in summary, despite many opportunities for improvement, 2016 was, by far, our best year ever for what we've accomplished and for the groundwork we laid to realize the significant growth opportunities that lie ahead.
Dennis will now review the numbers in more detail."

For the full year for the first time, we had over $1.5 billion in revenues on 3 different interactive platforms: console, PC and mobile, nearly $1 billion in Asia-Pacif",1807,"Great. Thanks, Thomas. Q4 was another great quarter capping off a record-setting year. For the full year for the first time, we had over $1.5 billion in revenues on 3 different interactive platforms: console, PC and mobile, nearly $1 billion in Asia-Pacific revenues and more digital revenues for the year than our prior record for total company revenues, all of which helped contribute to record non-GAAP operating margin of 35%, year-over-year EPS growth of 68% and nearly $2.2 billion of operating cash flow, up 71% year-over-year. These results highlight the powerful combination of owned IP, a direct and increasingly digital customer connection and global scale. We're obviously very encouraged by this and believe we're only in the early innings of realizing this multi-year opportunity.
Looking back, I'd like to first start with our segment results. As reminder, our segment results, unlike our consolidated results, are still presented excluding the impact of deferrals as they always have been. Blizzard had its strongest financial performance in history, including record revenue up more than 50% versus last year; a record $1 billion in segment operating income for the year, up 81% versus last year; and record Q4 revenue, up 46% versus last year. This historic performance underscores the significant progress Blizzard has made towards transforming into a multi-franchise, multi-platform and multi-geography company. In 2016, Blizzard had more than 60% of its revenues from non-World of Warcraft franchises, 20% of its revenues from non-PC platforms and more than 25% of its revenues in APAC.
Activision's Q4 had strong catalog and digital performance from Call of Duty: Black Ops III, which offset new release underperformance. Activision delivered record Q4 and full year in-game revenues. And the strong digital performance helped drive a record full year segment operating margin of 35%.
In 2016, King contributed more than the originally planned 30% accretion to our overall results. They continue to have 2 of the top 10 grossing games in the U.S. for the 13th quarter in a row, and importantly, the Candy Crush franchise showed continued stability with an increase in mobile bookings year-over-year.
Now let's turn to our consolidated results. Unless otherwise indicated, I will be referencing non-GAAP as redefined figures, which include the impact of deferrals. If you would like to calculate metrics as we used to report them, you would add the impact of deferrals to our non-GAAP as redefined figures. Please refer to our earnings release for full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations.
For the quarter, we generated record Q4 GAAP revenues of $2.01 billion, $158 million above our November guidance and $661 million or 49% above Q4 last year. The net effect of deferred revenue was $438 million for the quarter. We generated GAAP EPS of $0.33. We generated an all-quarter record non-GAAP EPS of $0.65, $0.25 above guidance. The impact of deferrals on non-GAAP EPS was $0.27. The overperformance in the quarter versus guidance was driven primarily be Overwatch and World of Warcraft as well as favorable adjustments to our tax rate versus guidance. In Q4, you saw the power of our diverse portfolio and year-round engagement model where even with lower Call of Duty frontline sales, we were able to deliver growth and record results.
Turning to the full year. We generated record GAAP revenues of $6.61 billion, up 42% year-over-year and operating margin of 21% and EPS of $1.28. The impact of deferred revenue was negative $9 million for the year. On a non-GAAP basis, we generated record EPS of $2.18, up 68% year-over-year. The impact of deferrals on non-GAAP EPS was $0.02 in 2016.
The digital transition continues to be a nice tailwind for our business, and digital revenues in Q4 were an all-quarter record $1.5 billion, double last year's figure. For the year, we delivered record digital revenues of $4.9 billion, up 94% versus last year.
The primary driver for our digital momentum is the continued growth of in-game content. As Thomas mentioned, in-game purchases were close to $1 billion for the quarter and a record $3.8 billion for the year, more than double the $1.7 billion we had last year. We believe we still are in the early days of this important vector in our business with more opportunity ahead.
In terms of cash flow, our strong business performance had led to record cash flow generation. For the year, we delivered a record to $2.2 billion of operating cash flow, up 71% year-over-year. For the quarter, we generated operating cash flow of $859 million.
From a balance sheet perspective, we had a number of positive developments in 2016. The durability of our underlying business has driven continued credit rating improvement. During the year, S&P upgraded us to investment grade, and Moody's, who had updated us in 2015 concurrent with the King deal announcement, moved us up another notch.
In August, we restructured our term loans, which allowed us to realize interest rate savings, and in September, we issued new 5- and 10-year notes, which replaced our prior 2021 notes at a more cost-effective rate. So a very busy year on the capital structure front.
Regarding liquidity, we finished the year with approximately $3.3 billion in cash and investments on the balance sheet with almost $1.4 billion held domestically. Our strong balance sheet and cash flow have allowed us to return significant capital to our various stakeholders. Since 2010, we have repurchased $7.8 billion of our shares and paid out over $1.3 billion in dividends. In addition, since 2013, of the $7.1 billion of gross debt we have borrowed to fund the Vivendi buyback and the King transaction, we've already repaid $2.1 billion as of the end of 2016.
Continuing on this trend, our board has once again approved a balanced approach to capital allocation for 2017: increasing our dividend by 15% to $0.30 per share payable in May; authorizing debt paydown of $500 million this year, of which we've already paid down $139 million in February; and authorizing a $1 billion stock repurchase over the next 2 years.
Now let's turn and look forward to our outlook for 2017. In 2017, as expected, we have a lighter slate of full game releases. Given fewer major top launches this year, we expect to build on our strong momentum on year-round engagement and in-game player investment across our portfolio. A few other things to call out: While strategically important, emerging new revenue streams like team sales for the Overwatch League and the associated media rights are not embedded in our current guidance. In addition, as we have said previously, we expect advertising to begin to contribute in 2017 and have a more substantial impact in 2018 and beyond.
In terms of segments, we expect a more evenly weighted contribution from Activision, Blizzard and King in 2017 than in 2016. We expect Blizzard to have a lower 2017 performance given a lighter release slate. However, Blizzard has lots of exciting plans for live ops and additional in-game content for every franchise, including Overwatch, Hearthstone and World of Warcraft.
For Activision, we expect to have lower performance in the first half of the year given a smaller Call of Duty digital season compared with the record performance of Black Ops III in the first half of 2016. That said, we do expect a larger back half of the year as we release the Destiny sequel and a new Call of Duty title. We're enthusiastic about this year's Call of Duty release going back to its roots, and as such, we are guiding it up in Q4 versus last year's Q4 performance.
In addition, as Thomas mentioned, the Skylanders franchise will not have a full game console release this year, but we will continue to engage the community and drive player investment through new toys and digital content. For King, we expect to be modestly up year-over-year, mainly driven by a full year contribution from the business, the introduction of advertising and ongoing live ops across the portfolio.
Turning to the numbers. On a GAAP basis for 2017, we expect revenues of $6 billion, including GAAP deferrals of $300 million, with product cost of 22% and operating expenses of 64%. Our GAAP interest expense is expected to be $156 million, and our GAAP tax rate is expected to be 21%. We expect 765 million fully diluted shares, both for GAAP and non-GAAP, and GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.72.  Our GAAP numbers include a $0.03 net of taxes GAAP-only restructuring charge, which is related to our continued transition to digital.
For 2017, on a non-GAAP basis, we expect product cost of 22% and operating expenses of 47%. We expect non-GAAP interest expense of $149 million. We expect a return to the historical tax rate of 24% as 2016's tax rate was lower due to discrete items and stronger international mix due to Blizzard's overperformance. We expect non-GAAP EPS of $1.70, including a GAAP deferral of $0.15.
Please note that we expect more of a deferral impact in Q4 2017 than we had in Q4 2016 due to the larger expected launches of Destiny and Call of Duty in the second half of the year, part of which will be deferred into 2018. Also, just to remind everyone, if you would like to calculate non-GAAP metrics as we used to report them, you would add the impact of deferrals or $0.15 to our non-GAAP as redefined EPS of $1.70 to get to our full year 2017 number.
Now let's turn to our Q1 outlook. On a GAAP basis for Q1, we expect revenues of $1.55 billion, including GAAP deferrals of negative $500 million, product cost of 21% and operating expenses of 60%. Our GAAP interest expense is expected to be $43 million, and our GAAP tax rate is expected to be 21%. We expect 760 million fully diluted shares, both for GAAP and non-GAAP, and GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.25.
For Q1, on a non-GAAP basis, we expect product cost of 21% and operating expenses of 43%. We expect non-GAAP interest expense of $39 million, a tax rate of 24% and non-GAAP EPS of $0.51, including a GAAP deferral of negative $0.33.
So in summary, 2016's strong performance highlights the tremendous opportunity and potential we have in front of us. The combination of leading owned IP and franchises, a direct digital connection to our consumers, best-in-class content creation capabilities and geographic platform and business model diversity provides an incredibly powerful engine for sustained financial performance. So while in 2017, as expected, we will have a lighter release slate, our strong business platform combined with promising emerging opportunities like esports, advertising and consumer products provides us with a compelling opportunity for growth in 2018 and beyond.

It's Eric. So the first thing I will say is just that, I think, the most important thing is, remember, the Call of Duty ecosystem is strong, and we continue to see very strong MAUs and that this is the first time we'll have 3 active games with 3 different player communities at scale with Infinite Warfare, Modern Warfare Remastered and Black Ops III. And the plan is we're going to be driving engagements for all of those titles with great content throughout the year. As far as the second part of your question, as I've said many times before, with any long standing franchise like Call of Duty, there's a balancing act we need to strike between staying true to the things people love about the franchise and also the need to never become complacent and to keep pushing for innovations to keep the franchise fresh and vital. I would argue, over a period of many years now, we've managed that balance on Call of Duty better than just about any long standing franchise in any medium. Last year, I don't think we got that balance right. Infinite Warfare had a ton of great game play innovations that many of our fans appreciated and loved, but it also had a setting that didn't appeal to all of our fans. The good news is that I'm excited to say that, in 2017, we think we have this balance in perfect harmony with the game that our teams are incredibly passionate about with a lot of great innovations but that also has the traditional combat that we know our fans are going to love. The game is being made by Sledgehammer, and as Thomas mentioned, they're a proven team. They're passionate about this title. We greenlit it over 2 years ago now. And they've been hard at work at it ever since, and we can't wait to unveil it to the world soon. And without discussing too much about what else we've got in the Call of Duty pipeline, I can also tell you that we're confident our fans are going to love those games as well, and we've never been more excited, either creatively or commercially, about our 3-year Call of Duty slate."

We've seen very strong engagement and digital sales from these efforts last year. Looking into the future, we also see opportunities in areas like linear media and consumer product. We think that this will help it -- help deepen connections with the franchise and also expose Overwatch to new audiences. In addition, we want to create new ways for players to engage with the franchise through the Overwatch League. Esports is growing, but the ecosystem isn't always easy to navigate for players, viewers or teams. So with the Overwatch League, we're working very hard to address those challenges.

We'll have global city-based teams with a standardized annual schedule, creating professional high-quality content and guaranteed league slots for the teams. This is all built on a game that's easy to understand with short matches and great action. The core experience is very fun to watch, and there's already a sizable audience for it around the world. Based on this, we think that we'll see significant new business and engagement opportunities. We're going to start identifying team owners soon. That's our next step, and we're looking forward to holding our first combine and kicking off the league later this year. So with all that said, we're very excited about Overwatch's future."

It's a very engaged user base. So in the last earning call -- earnings call, I said that we are very careful and protective of the user experience. And so we've been testing and we are testing several ad formats. We've been testing with very high-quality consumer brands like Nestl√© or Fox in our key games. We've been testing in Candy. We've been testing in Candy Crush Soda Saga. And we are testing integrated ad formats, which are integrated in the game play and are supportive of the game play. And so far, the results have been very positive. They've been positive both for the players with an increasing game play and an increase in ad spend, and it's been positive for advertisers. So we have seen competition rates, which are above-industry benchmarks, and we define completion rates as when the player really starts a video ad and finishes the video ad. And further on, we have engaged third parties through third-party research to finalize the impact on players, and the result was that our ads stand out more when they are presented and shown on our platform, on our games than when they are shown on other platforms. So we are very pleased with the results so far. So we are continuing on our plan and the year -- and the plan for this year is, first of all, to continue to invest in building the technical infrastructure and to continue building out the team. Secondly, we will continue to test various ad formats, and as we do so we will also ramp up the inventory. So our expectation for this year is to have a positive contribution to the bottom line, and we expect to scale the impact on the bottom line in 2018."

Yes, digital tailwinds have obviously been a huge -- an important factor across all of our businesses and think we have the diversity of being across multiple platforms, so having huge success on mobile, which is almost all digital; on PC, which has, over time, become almost all digital. And then the last real holdout is really on console where full game download mix is still the minority of player purchases. In general, it varies based on title and region and audience type. So for a game in big and mass market as Call of Duty, you see a slightly lower percentage mix of digital just because it is so mass market, but it's now in the low to mid-20s. And that's up from 0, 3 or 4 years ago. And -- but in games like Destiny and Overwatch, we see in the mid-30s. So -- and that trend is continuing every year where we see 5-plus percentage points of mix moving every year in terms of overall business mix. So it should be a nice tailwind for us and for others in the industry over the next few years as well."

For anyone who either hasn't yet tried Destiny or hasn't played it in a while, we think we've made a game with the sequel that's going to have a lot for them to love, too. The cornerstone of that is a great cinematic story. That's been a real focus with a great cast of memorable, relatable characters coupled with some very nice ways to make the game more accessible to a casual play. Without losing anything that our core players love, we've made it more accessible to somebody who just wants to have a great more casual first-person action experience.

If you think about consumer products as they relate to the NFL or the NBA, these are billions of dollars of revenues for the leagues, and we think they'll be great opportunities for a league and team merchandise. That'll be important component of what we do in the Consumer Products business. I think, generally, we think creating more consumer touch points in a low-capital investment, high-return way adds tremendous value to the franchises.

Our performance in 2016 further strengthened our position as the world's leading stand-alone interactive entertainment company.

Our performance in 2016 further strengthened our position as the world's leading stand-alone interactive entertainment company. We achieved record results in 2016, delivering all-time high revenues of $6.6 billion and record non-GAAP EPS of $2.18, up 42% and 68%, respectively, over last year. We also delivered record non-GAAP operating margins of 35%.
We overperformed our plan for the quarter, delivering record revenues of $2 billion and record non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.65, up 49% and 160%, respectively, over last year. We also delivered our strongest annual operating cash flow in history at $2.2 billion, up 71% over last year.
Our success continues to be driven by our 2 greatest assets, our incredibly talented people and the devoted community of gamers we serve. We have roughly 450 million players in 196 countries, and they spent over 40 billion hours playing our games in 2016. And they watched a record 3 billion hours as spectators of our games. We continue to see opportunities to expand audiences, deepen engagement and increase player investment. In fact, prioritization of opportunity remains our greatest challenge, but we remain vigilant in ensuring that the right resources are connected with the right priorities.
We have a number of important successes in 2016 that we'd like to acknowledge. Blizzard's new franchise, Overwatch, has captured the imaginations of players all over the world, and we've only scratched the surface. The truly extraordinary Overwatch team launched the most successful new intellectual property in our company's history. We now have over 25 million registered players, and engagement has continued to grow.
The King team was very focused on continuously releasing fresh content with new levels and features as well as increasing live operations efforts with events and competitions. As a result, mobile bookings for the Candy Crush franchise grew in 2016.
King also made meaningful progress with its advertising initiatives. Last year's advertising tests had 2 primary goals: to design and build an outstanding ad platform that would actually enhance our users' in-game experience and to deliver significant value to advertisers. We're encouraged with the early results. In most tests, our users play more game rounds, spend more time in the game and have a self-reported better game experience with advertising.
Additionally, our platform delivers meaningful value to advertisers. We partnered with some of the world's top advertisers, including Nestl√©, Fox Entertainment and Visa, and our viewability, verifiability and completion metrics are all encouraging. Ads are perceived as more unique and interesting when shown on King inventory, and viewers are more likely to take action after seeing an ad in King games. The King team will continue to build on their efforts this year, and we believe advertising has the potential to be a growth driver in the years to come. 
We also nurtured emerging growth opportunities outside of our games, including esports, television and film and consumer products, and we enhanced the organizations that will support these initiatives. These new opportunities are consistent with and organic to our company's mission, and they have the potential to become important stand-alone businesses in pursuit of our goal to become the leading 21st century entertainment company.
We accelerated our esports efforts with integration of Major League Gaming, the formation of the Call of Duty World League and the announcement of the Overwatch League. Our ambition is to create nothing less than the esports equivalent of the world's established major professional leagues. To this end, in 2017, we plan to start the process of selling teams and commercializing media rights for the Overwatch League. We look forward to welcoming team owners with the expertise, skills and investment required to build the professional league together.
We plan to invest in these long-term growth pillars further in 2017 and expect them to have even greater impact in 2018 and beyond. I couldn't be more excited about our prospects for the future, and our team's dedication and enthusiasm reinforces my confidence that we will continue to achieve our ambitious plans.
Thomas and Dennis will now share with you the results of our record quarter and our record year."

We surpassed our initial revenue guidance by $0.5 billion and our initial non-GAAP EPS guidance by more than $0.40. And we also outperformed expectations for the holiday quarter.
In driving our record setting year and as we look ahead, we remain focused on our 3 strategic pillars: first, expanding our audiences; second, deepening engagement; and third, providing opportunities for more player investment.
Let's start with audience reach, which was 447 million monthly active users this quarter. Blizzard had record Q4 MAUs of 41 million; and for the year, Blizzard had its highest annual MAUs ever up 37% from 2015 and up 87% since 2014. This is a remarkable achievement demonstrating the strength of the Blizzard portfolio and capabilities.
Overwatch, released in May, set a record for the strongest launch year financial performance of any game in Blizzard's 26-year history. The game is critically acclaimed, receiving 55 Game of the Year awards and reached 25 million registered players faster than any franchise in Blizzard history, beating Diablo III's launch year unit sales record set in 2012, which for a new IP is an extraordinary accomplishment.
In Q4, MAUs rose to a new franchise high as existing players stayed engaged and new players joined the fun. Showcasing its continued global appeal, Overwatch has players all over the world, including great success in Korea and China.
It's always difficult for western companies to succeed there, and Overwatch's popularity is a testament to Blizzard's unique ability to create globally appealing games.
World of Warcraft: Legion expansion, which launched in late August, continues to reenergize the community. For the year, MAUs were up 10%; and for the quarter, MAUs were up over 20% versus year ago.
Hearthstone players enjoyed a tremendous amount of new content in 2016 with 1 adventure and 2 expansions, including Mean Streets of Gadgetzan, in the fourth quarter. For the year, Hearthstone had record MAUs up over 20% year-over-year, and for the quarter, MAUs were also up versus year ago.
Activision had Q4 MAUs of 51 million. On a full year basis, Activision had its highest annual MAUs ever, up 3% from 2015 and up 23% since 2014. Black Ops III's digital season led to record MAUs for Call of Duty in the year, and Destiny showed steady engagement in its third year. Call of Duty was the #1 franchise in North America for the eighth year in a row and the #1 console franchise globally and Mattel was held for 7 of the last 8 years.
Activision's November release, Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare, is a high-quality, innovative game that pairs with Modern Warfare Remastered, offers a tremendous amount of value and game play variety. However, sales underperformed our expectations, and it's clear that for a portion of our audience, the space setting just didn't resonate. We had a passionate, experienced studio, deeply committed to this direction, and despite the risks we saw, we believe it is important to consider the passions of our game teams in deciding what content to create. But it wasn't the success we planned. It allows us to protect the core tenets of our culture that Bobby discussed: empowering our talented teams to have the chance to pursue opportunities that they are passionate about.  Providing an environment that recommends passion is a critical component of our success, and the process to learn from our mistakes is what makes our company special. And it's why the most talented people in our industry are attracted to our company.
In 2017, Activision will take Call of Duty back to its roots, and traditional combat will once again take center stage. This is what our dedicated community of Call of Duty players and Sledgehammer Games, who has been developing this year's title, are the most excited about. The Call of Duty community remains strong, and Call of Duty is the most successful video game franchise of the last 20 years. Overall, franchise MAUs were stable in Q4 as players engaged on multiple titles. Life-to-date on current-gen consoles, Call of Duty alone has 3 of the top 10 games. This demonstrates the value of year-round engagement and life operations on both new releases and our highly engaging prior releases.
Activision also released Skylanders Imaginators during the fourth quarter, an innovative new game that allows players to create and play their very own Skylanders. The game has delighted kids around the world and has grown the franchise to become the 11th biggest console franchise of all time with more than 300 million toys sold. Based on this franchise strength, our film and TV division launched its first initiative, Skylanders Academy on Netflix in October, which has been very well received. The second season will be delivered later this year, and Netflix has already ordered a third season.
In 2017, rather than releasing a new console title, we will be supporting the award-winning Skylanders Imaginators with multiple adventure packs, new characters and new in-game content. We're also excited to bring Skylanders Imaginators to Nintendo Switch as a launch title next month, and we have a new Skylanders mobile game in development.
Now turning to our second strategic pillar, deepening engagement. Our compelling games, deep game play and consistent follow-on content drove not only large communities but also strong engagement with over 10 billion hours of play time in Q4. Our 43 billion hours of engagement in 2016 was on par with Netflix and 1.5x Snapchat. And importantly, we own our content.
Blizzard's Q4 play time set a new record, breaking the previous record set in Q3. During the fourth quarter, Overwatch had its second and third seasonal events, Halloween Terror and Winter Wonderland, showcasing the successful year-round event-based approach to content. Each successive event drove new engagement records, including the most recent Lunar New Year event. And Overwatch has more exciting contents coming.
Blizzard's increased investment in World of Warcraft development resources is paying off to a more regular content cadence for players with 2 patches released since Legion launched. This has resulted in higher engagement for the franchise with an increase in total play time for the quarter surpassing Legion's launch quarter and all non-launch quarters in the last 4 years. More content is coming later this year as the full Legion story unfolds.
King's player base continues to be highly engaged with time spent of 34 minutes per daily active user, an increase over last year and last quarter. This was due in part to our increased focus on life operation efforts. King also released a new franchise sequel at the start of this year, Bubble Witch Saga 3, which is off to a great start. Playing our games is just one way our players engage with our franchises. We recently announced our new Consumer Product division headed by Tim Kilpin, a veteran of Mattel and Disney. Elevating our nascent Consumer Products business to a more strategic level is a great opportunity to provide our communities with more high-quality products and collectibles based on our own intellectual properties.
Our audiences also connect with our franchises by viewing our games. In fact, Activision Blizzard accounted for 5 of the top 10 most viewed games on Twitch in 2016. Esports has become not only a catalyst for increased reach and engagement but also a stand-alone opportunity.
Our Major League Gaming division hit a number of milestones this year, including hosting tournaments for Call of Duty, Overwatch and World of Warcraft; launching the enhanced viewing experience; integrating the MLG.tv player into Call of Duty; growing video viewers on social platforms like Facebook and Instagram by 50% and increasing price play engagements by over 60% year-over-year.
Activision's launch of the Call of Duty World League sparked strong growth for Call of Duty esports. Activision doubled the 2016 price pool to over $3.5 million across 16 hosted events. Millions of fans were drawn to the action with the 2016 season delivering 120 million video views and more than twice the time spent viewing compared to last year's season. We look forward to placing more action in the months to come.
Last year, Blizzard held its 10th BlizzCon and celebrated its 25th anniversary. BlizzCon again sold out in minutes and drew a large global audience with over 25,000 in-person attendees and 10 million people from around the world tuning in. Blizzard also sold a record number of DIRECTV pay-per-view tickets to fans wanting the full BlizzCon virtual experience.
Blizzard announced the formation of the Overwatch League at BlizzCon. For fans, it will offer city-based teams around the world competing in annual seasons with standardized schedules, creating a consistent experience to build passion and allegiance. For team owners, guaranteed slots and clear rights will enable stability and transparency that they can invest in. For players, contracts, including benefits and the combine for player selection will open up the sort of career opportunities associated with traditional sports. The Overwatch League is being designed to bring a new era to esports with an epic entertainment experience for everyone involved.
Blizzard feels it has the community passion in place and the required structure established to commence the process of selling teams and media rights for the Overwatch League later this year. We'll have more exciting news to share in the months ahead.
In January, Blizzard kicked off its Heroes Global Championship and announced its upcoming 3rd annual collegiate esports competition, Heroes of the Dorm, which will be streamed exclusively via Facebook Live, ensuring broader global accessibility to esports audiences.
Turning next to the third pillar of our strategy, providing opportunities for more player investment. In-game purchases were yet again close to $1 billion in the quarter and a record $3.8 billion for the year, more than double last year's $1.7 billion. Even without the benefit of the addition of King to our portfolio, the company's in-game purchases would have grown 33% this year. World of Warcraft content and continued strength in Overwatch seasonal events delivered Blizzard's record levels of in-game revenues in the quarter and for the full year. Activision's record in-game revenues for 2016 were driven by a record setting Call of Duty: Black Ops III in-game content season, where, for the first time, add-on revenues were greater than DLC and Season Pass combined even with record Season Pass participation. 
Over the past several years, Activision has methodically and creatively evolved the Call of Duty business model, and this performance illustrates the impact those strategies have had in a relatively short period of time. It also showcases the virtuous cycle created when engaging content leads to more player investment. And this year is the first time we have 3 player communities at scale concurrently in Infinite Warfare, Modern Warfare Remastered and Black Ops III, and we will be supporting each of them with new content throughout the year.
Destiny continues to have a large and committed audience, which is eager for new content and adventures. Activision, along with their partners at Bungie plan to answer the call with the release of a full Destiny sequel later this year designed to thrill to our existing loyal fan base and bring many new players into the fold. We plan to support the release of the sequel with a great content plan post launch, setting the stage for growth with this year's sequel and the content season that will follow.
King continues to perform from a player investment perspective despite lower MAUs. Bookings per paying user has increased 6 quarters in a row to its highest level ever. Importantly, we saw stability in the Candy Crush franchise throughout the year with fourth quarter and full year mobile gross bookings increasing year-over-year for the franchise.
We have also invested in a mobile incubation pipeline with multiple games for a number of our core franchises across the company. We will rely on our own talented teams and partners and leverage King's mobile expertise. Some of these games have reached the prototype phase and we believe could drive growth in future years. We have more to share on our expanding mobile efforts down the road.
So in summary, despite many opportunities for improvement, 2016 was, by far, our best year ever for what we've accomplished and for the groundwork we laid to realize the significant growth opportunities that lie ahead.
Dennis will now review the numbers in more detail."

For the full year for the first time, we had over $1.5 billion in revenues on 3 different interactive platforms: console, PC and mobile, nearly $1 billion in Asia-Pacif",1807,"Great. Thanks, Thomas. Q4 was another great quarter capping off a record-setting year. For the full year for the first time, we had over $1.5 billion in revenues on 3 different interactive platforms: console, PC and mobile, nearly $1 billion in Asia-Pacific revenues and more digital revenues for the year than our prior record for total company revenues, all of which helped contribute to record non-GAAP operating margin of 35%, year-over-year EPS growth of 68% and nearly $2.2 billion of operating cash flow, up 71% year-over-year. These results highlight the powerful combination of owned IP, a direct and increasingly digital customer connection and global scale. We're obviously very encouraged by this and believe we're only in the early innings of realizing this multi-year opportunity.
Looking back, I'd like to first start with our segment results. As reminder, our segment results, unlike our consolidated results, are still presented excluding the impact of deferrals as they always have been. Blizzard had its strongest financial performance in history, including record revenue up more than 50% versus last year; a record $1 billion in segment operating income for the year, up 81% versus last year; and record Q4 revenue, up 46% versus last year. This historic performance underscores the significant progress Blizzard has made towards transforming into a multi-franchise, multi-platform and multi-geography company. In 2016, Blizzard had more than 60% of its revenues from non-World of Warcraft franchises, 20% of its revenues from non-PC platforms and more than 25% of its revenues in APAC.
Activision's Q4 had strong catalog and digital performance from Call of Duty: Black Ops III, which offset new release underperformance. Activision delivered record Q4 and full year in-game revenues. And the strong digital performance helped drive a record full year segment operating margin of 35%.
In 2016, King contributed more than the originally planned 30% accretion to our overall results. They continue to have 2 of the top 10 grossing games in the U.S. for the 13th quarter in a row, and importantly, the Candy Crush franchise showed continued stability with an increase in mobile bookings year-over-year.
Now let's turn to our consolidated results. Unless otherwise indicated, I will be referencing non-GAAP as redefined figures, which include the impact of deferrals. If you would like to calculate metrics as we used to report them, you would add the impact of deferrals to our non-GAAP as redefined figures. Please refer to our earnings release for full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations.
For the quarter, we generated record Q4 GAAP revenues of $2.01 billion, $158 million above our November guidance and $661 million or 49% above Q4 last year. The net effect of deferred revenue was $438 million for the quarter. We generated GAAP EPS of $0.33. We generated an all-quarter record non-GAAP EPS of $0.65, $0.25 above guidance. The impact of deferrals on non-GAAP EPS was $0.27. The overperformance in the quarter versus guidance was driven primarily by Overwatch and World of Warcraft as well as favorable adjustments to our tax rate versus guidance. In Q4, you saw the power of our diverse portfolio and year-round engagement model where even with lower Call of Duty frontline sales, we were able to deliver growth and record results.
Turning to the full year. We generated record GAAP revenues of $6.61 billion, up 42% year-over-year and operating margin of 21% and EPS of $1.28. The impact of deferred revenue was negative $9 million for the year. On a non-GAAP basis, we generated record EPS of $2.18, up 68% year-over-year. The impact of deferrals on non-GAAP EPS was $0.02 in 2016.
The digital transition continues to be a nice tailwind for our business, and digital revenues in Q4 were an all-quarter record $1.5 billion, double last year's figure. For the year, we delivered record digital revenues of $4.9 billion, up 94% versus last year.
The primary driver for our digital momentum is the continued growth of in-game content. As Thomas mentioned, in-game purchases were close to $1 billion for the quarter and a record $3.8 billion for the year, more than double the $1.7 billion we had last year. We believe we still are in the early days of this important vector in our business with more opportunity ahead.
In terms of cash flow, our strong business performance had led to record cash flow generation. For the year, we delivered a record to $2.2 billion of operating cash flow, up 71% year-over-year. For the quarter, we generated operating cash flow of $859 million.
From a balance sheet perspective, we had a number of positive developments in 2016. The durability of our underlying business has driven continued credit rating improvement. During the year, S&P upgraded us to investment grade, and Moody's, who had updated us in 2015 concurrent with the King deal announcement, moved us up another notch.
In August, we restructured our term loans, which allowed us to realize interest rate savings, and in September, we issued new 5- and 10-year notes, which replaced our prior 2021 notes at a more cost-effective rate. So a very busy year on the capital structure front.
Regarding liquidity, we finished the year with approximately $3.3 billion in cash and investments on the balance sheet with almost $1.4 billion held domestically. Our strong balance sheet and cash flow have allowed us to return significant capital to our various stakeholders. Since 2010, we have repurchased $7.8 billion of our shares and paid out over $1.3 billion in dividends. In addition, since 2013, of the $7.1 billion of gross debt we have borrowed to fund the Vivendi buyback and the King transaction, we've already repaid $2.1 billion as of the end of 2016.
Continuing on this trend, our board has once again approved a balanced approach to capital allocation for 2017: increasing our dividend by 15% to $0.30 per share payable in May; authorizing debt paydown of $500 million this year, of which we've already paid down $139 million in February; and authorizing a $1 billion stock repurchase over the next 2 years.
Now let's turn and look forward to our outlook for 2017. In 2017, as expected, we have a lighter slate of full game releases. Given fewer major top launches this year, we expect to build on our strong momentum on year-round engagement and in-game player investment across our portfolio. A few other things to call out: While strategically important, emerging new revenue streams like team sales for the Overwatch League and the associated media rights are not embedded in our current guidance. In addition, as we have said previously, we expect advertising to begin to contribute in 2017 and have a more substantial impact in 2018 and beyond.
In terms of segments, we expect a more evenly weighted contribution from Activision, Blizzard and King in 2017 than in 2016. We expect Blizzard to have a lower 2017 performance given a lighter release slate. However, Blizzard has lots of exciting plans for live ops and additional in-game content for every franchise, including Overwatch, Hearthstone and World of Warcraft.
For Activision, we expect to have lower performance in the first half of the year given a smaller Call of Duty digital season compared with the record performance of Black Ops III in the first half of 2016. That said, we do expect a larger back half of the year as we release the Destiny sequel and a new Call of Duty title. We're enthusiastic about this year's Call of Duty release going back to its roots, and as such, we are guiding it up in Q4 versus last year's Q4 performance.
In addition, as Thomas mentioned, the Skylanders franchise will not have a full game console release this year, but we will continue to engage the community and drive player investment through new toys and digital content. For King, we expect to be modestly up year-over-year, mainly driven by a full year contribution from the business, the introduction of advertising and ongoing live ops across the portfolio.
Turning to the numbers. On a GAAP basis for 2017, we expect revenues of $6 billion, including GAAP deferrals of $300 million, with product cost of 22% and operating expenses of 64%. Our GAAP interest expense is expected to be $156 million, and our GAAP tax rate is expected to be 21%. We expect 765 million fully diluted shares, both for GAAP and non-GAAP, and GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.72.  Our GAAP numbers include a $0.03 net of taxes GAAP-only restructuring charge, which is related to our continued transition to digital.
For 2017, on a non-GAAP basis, we expect product cost of 22% and operating expenses of 47%. We expect non-GAAP interest expense of $149 million. We expect a return to the historical tax rate of 24% as 2016's tax rate was lower due to discrete items and stronger international mix due to Blizzard's overperformance. We expect non-GAAP EPS of $1.70, including a GAAP deferral of $0.15.
Please note that we expect more of a deferral impact in Q4 2017 than we had in Q4 2016 due to the larger expected launches of Destiny and Call of Duty in the second half of the year, part of which will be deferred into 2018. Also, just to remind everyone, if you would like to calculate non-GAAP metrics as we used to report them, you would add the impact of deferrals or $0.15 to our non-GAAP as redefined EPS of $1.70 to get to our full year 2017 number.
Now let's turn to our Q1 outlook. On a GAAP basis for Q1, we expect revenues of $1.55 billion, including GAAP deferrals of negative $500 million, product cost of 21% and operating expenses of 60%. Our GAAP interest expense is expected to be $43 million, and our GAAP tax rate is expected to be 21%. We expect 760 million fully diluted shares, both for GAAP and non-GAAP, and GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.25.
For Q1, on a non-GAAP basis, we expect product cost of 21% and operating expenses of 43%. We expect non-GAAP interest expense of $39 million, a tax rate of 24% and non-GAAP EPS of $0.51, including a GAAP deferral of negative $0.33.
So in summary, 2016's strong performance highlights the tremendous opportunity and potential we have in front of us. The combination of leading owned IP and franchises, a direct digital connection to our consumers, best-in-class content creation capabilities and geographic platform and business model diversity provides an incredibly powerful engine for sustained financial performance. So while in 2017, as expected, we will have a lighter release slate, our strong business platform combined with promising emerging opportunities like esports, advertising and consumer products provides us with a compelling opportunity for growth in 2018 and beyond.

It's Eric. So the first thing I will say is just that, I think, the most important thing is, remember, the Call of Duty ecosystem is strong, and we continue to see very strong MAUs and that this is the first time we'll have 3 active games with 3 different player communities at scale with Infinite Warfare, Modern Warfare Remastered and Black Ops III. And the plan is we're going to be driving engagements for all of those titles with great content throughout the year. As far as the second part of your question, as I've said many times before, with any long standing franchise like Call of Duty, there's a balancing act we need to strike between staying true to the things people love about the franchise and also the need to never become complacent and to keep pushing for innovations to keep the franchise fresh and vital. I would argue, over a period of many years now, we've managed that balance on Call of Duty better than just about any long standing franchise in any medium. Last year, I don't think we got that balance right. Infinite Warfare had a ton of great game play innovations that many of our fans appreciated and loved, but it also had a setting that didn't appeal to all of our fans. The good news is that I'm excited to say that, in 2017, we think we have this balance in perfect harmony with the game that our teams are incredibly passionate about with a lot of great innovations but that also has the traditional combat that we know our fans are going to love. The game is being made by Sledgehammer, and as Thomas mentioned, they're a proven team. They're passionate about this title. We greenlit it over 2 years ago now. And they've been hard at work at it ever since, and we can't wait to unveil it to the world soon. And without discussing too much about what else we've got in the Call of Duty pipeline, I can also tell you that we're confident our fans are going to love those games as well, and we've never been more excited, either creatively or commercially, about our 3-year Call of Duty slate."

We've seen very strong engagement and digital sales from these efforts last year. Looking into the future, we also see opportunities in areas like linear media and consumer product. We think that this will help it -- help deepen connections with the franchise and also expose Overwatch to new audiences. In addition, we want to create new ways for players to engage with the franchise through the Overwatch League. Esports is growing, but the ecosystem isn't always easy to navigate for players, viewers or teams. So with the Overwatch League, we're working very hard to address those challenges. Our focus is on creating stability and participation for teams and owners and accessibility of the content for fans. We'll have global city-based teams with a standardized annual schedule, creating professional high-quality content and guaranteed league slots for the teams. This is all built on a game that's easy to understand with short matches and great action. The core experience is very fun to watch, and there's already a sizable audience for it around the world. Based on this, we think that we'll see significant new business and engagement opportunities. We're going to start identifying team owners soon. That's our next step, and we're looking forward to holding our first combine and kicking off the league later this year. So with all that said, we're very excited about Overwatch's future."

And so far, the results have been very positive. They've been positive both for the players with an increasing game play and an increase in ad spend, and it's been positive for advertisers. So we have seen competition rates, which are above-industry benchmarks, and we define completion rates as when the player really starts a video ad and finishes the video ad. And further on, we have engaged third parties through third-party research to finalize the impact on players, and the result was that our ads stand out more when they are presented and shown on our platform, on our games than when they are shown on other platforms. So we are very pleased with the results so far. So we are continuing on our plan and the year -- and the plan for this year is, first of all, to continue to invest in building the technical infrastructure and to continue building out the team. Secondly, we will continue to test various ad formats, and as we do so we will also ramp up the inventory. So our expectation for this year is to have a positive contribution to the bottom line, and we expect to scale the impact on the bottom line in 2018."

Hey, Brian, thanks. This is Dennis. Yes, digital tailwinds have obviously been a huge -- an important factor across all of our businesses and think we have the diversity of being across multiple platforms, so having huge success on mobile, which is almost all digital; on PC, which has, over time, become almost all digital. And then the last real holdout is really on console where full game download mix is still the minority of player purchases. In general, it varies based on title and region and audience type. So for a game in big and mass market as Call of Duty, you see a slightly lower percentage mix of digital just because it is so mass market, but it's now in the low to mid-20s. And that's up from 0, 3 or 4 years ago. And -- but in games like Destiny and Overwatch, we see in the mid-30s. So -- and that trend is continuing every year where we see 5-plus percentage points of mix moving every year in terms of overall business mix. So it should be a nice tailwind for us and for others in the industry over the next few years as well."

For anyone who either hasn't yet tried Destiny or hasn't played it in a while, we think we've made a game with the sequel that's going to have a lot for them to love, too. The cornerstone of that is a great cinematic story. That's been a real focus with a great cast of memorable, relatable characters coupled with some very nice ways to make the game more accessible to a casual play. Without losing anything that our core players love, we've made it more accessible to somebody who just wants to have a great more casual first-person action experience. We're also going to introduce Destiny to a number of new people by going to some international markets that we haven't been in before. So I'm going to leave the rest for the reveal, but we're very excited about the game. And it'll be coming this fall."

We have launched Bubble Witch 3, and we are extremely pleased not only with the quality of the game but also with the response from the players and acceptance from the players. And we're looking forward to scaling further this game in the year. We're also working on titles which -- with much higher level of innovation for the long-term growth of the franchise, and we believe innovation is key for the long-term success. We're also working for the future on additional IPs in new genres with franchise potential. And here, it's great to be part of the Activision Blizzard family, and we are very excited about the opportunities coming from working together on bringing established Activision Blizzard IP to mobile.

If you think about consumer products as they relate to the NFL or the NBA, these are billions of dollars of revenues for the leagues, and we think they'll be great opportunities for a league and team merchandise. That'll be important component of what we do in the Consumer Products business. I think, generally, we think creating more consumer touch points in a low-capital investment, high-return way adds tremendous value to the franchises.

This quarter, we achieved record revenues, earnings per share and cash flow, and overperformed our prior guidance. The size and encouragement of our community remained strong. We continue to invest in",631,"Thank you, Amrita, and thank you for joining us today. This quarter, we achieved record revenues, earnings per share and cash flow, and overperformed our prior guidance. The size and encouragement of our community remained strong. We continue to invest in both in-game growth opportunities as well as adjacent opportunities like Consumer Products, advertising, and esports. 
One of our big priorities is to unlock the full potential of professional eSports by opening the sale of teams and media rights of our leagues. Over the years, we've become a leader in creating world-class competitive experiences, sustainable franchises that engage hundreds of millions of people around the world through gameplay competition and connecting players and communities. This success is driven by our ability to tap into the timeless power of communities anchored through organized competition. 
Throughout histories, sports has helped bring communities together. City and country seeding loyalties form the basis for spectator enthusiasm, generations of engaged audiences, and traditions anchored in scheduled competitions. 
Until the 20th century though, sports like football, basketball and basketball were still hobbies for gifted amateurs, then professional leagues emerged like the Premier League, the NFL, or the NBA. The value of sport in our everyday lives has grown exponentially and so is the commercial opportunities that we see in sports. 
We actually believe the same opportunity to further professionalize eSports now exist. And we think the impact can be a significant as the traditional sports we know and love. These franchises we've built over the years delivered competitive experiences as enduring as traditional sports but with unique strength and value for brands. Our players are digital natives competing in almost every country in the world. The eSports audience include some of the hardest to reach and most sought-after demographics for marketers and advertisers with a share of millennials 2 to 3x higher than any of the big 4 U.S. sports. 
We're incredibly excited to launch the Overwatch League later this year. We believe by celebrating and rewarding our players and recognizing their accomplishments, our professional players would become the role model and inspire competitors of the 21st century. 
The competitions we're creating around the world will attract sponsors and advertisers resulting in broadcast revenues, licensing, sponsorship and ticket sales and most importantly, amazing spectator experiences. 
Through MLG, we're building the first dedicated global channel for eSports, the over-the-top ESPN of video games. To put the Overwatch League opportunity in context, around 240 million people today watch approximately 7 billion hours of NFL content annually. This drives $12 billion in revenues, including more than $6 billion in media rights revenues. The NBA today has roughly 175 million viewers watching around 2 billion hours total with more than $5 billion in revenues and $1.8 billion of those from media rights. With hundreds of millions of people already watching eSports and playing our games, over the long term, our goal is to create opportunities that we believe could be of a similar scale. 
We're also going to combine delivery of our spectator content with unique advertising opportunities that includes the ability for advertisers to have better targeting and analytics, much more so than what you would see in traditional forms of broadcast advertising today. And with over 40 million MAUs and extremely high levels of engagement, our potential to generate meaningful advertising revenue is substantial. In particular, we believe our initiatives for advertising in King mobile games is a large and untapped opportunity and we're continuing to make progress with our testing and development of our ads platform at King. 
Our results this past quarter demonstrate our ability to execute successfully against the many opportunities for shareholder value creation rehab and as you have done for 26 years. And now, Thomas will share the details on the quarter with you."

We delivered record Q1 revenues of $1.7 billion and record digital revenues of $1.4 billion. We grew year-over-year, overperformed our guidance for the quarter, and are raising for guidance for the year. Our results continued to be driven by focus and execution against our 3 strategic pillars: First, expanding our audiences; second, deepening engagement; and third, providing more opportunities for player investment. 
Let's start with audience reach, which was 431 million monthly active users this quarter. Blizzard had 41 million MAUs for the quarter, up 58% versus last year and relatively stable versus the prior quarter despite no new full game releases. Blizzard's fastest-growing new IP ever, Overwatch, continues to grow from an MAU perspective, setting another high watermark this quarter. In less than a year since launch, Overwatch has 30 million registered players and has become Activision's $8 billion franchise. 
Hearthstone continues to attract new players as well reaching 70 million registered players life to date. MAUs also grew year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter despite no new content in Q1. Activision had 48 million MAUs for the quarter, down year-over-year due to weakness in last holiday's Infinite Warfare release as discussed on our Q4 call. However, Call of Duty continues to have a large and active community of players across Infinite Warfare, Modern Warfare Remastered, and Black Ops III and we expect the community to grow with the next game in the series, Call of Duty World War II releasing November 3. 
When Activision dreamed of this more than 2.5 years, the team knew it was time to return to franchise to its roots and fans are already sharing their excitements for Call of Duty World War II. Activision revealed the game at a global live stream from London last week, which became the most-watched livestream in Call of Duty history, and the reveal trailer has gone on to become the most liked trailer in Call of Duty history and became the fastest video to reach 10 million views in Call of Duty history, which it did in 1 day. Additionally, though it's still very early, preorders are off to a very strong start. Call of Duty World War II will deliver the gritty, authentic, cinematic experience, which Call of Duty is known for. 
Activision, along its partner at Bungie, also recently revealed the much-anticipated Destiny 2, which is set for release on September 8. Destiny was the biggest new video game franchise launch of all time when it was release and early leading indicators, including preorders for Destiny 2, are very strong as well. The team is taking great care in designing the game to appeal to existing and new fans, including PC players for the first time. Activision is also localizing the game for more markets, which should enable us to reach new audiences. And at launch, we are offering an expansion pack for Destiny 2 containing 2 future expansions, along with a continuous calendar of other events. Encouragingly, the skills that contained the expansion pack have attracted the majority of preorders so far. 
We believe the combination of a great game, the new opportunity to reach PC players, and a robust content plan post launch highlights the opportunity ahead. We look forward to sharing more of our both Destiny 2 and Call of Duty World War II in the months ahead. 
Turning to our next strategic pillar. Our compelling games, deep game play, and consistent follow-on content drove not only large communities but also deep engagement with about 40 billion hours of gameplay over the past 12 months. Blizzard continues to see strong engagement from its players with time spent increasing by a double-digit percentage year-over-year to a new Q1 record. Overwatch again, had strong engagement this quarter, thanks in part to the Lunar New Year event, which like the 3 seasonal events before it drove record engagement in the game. Overwatch's latest seasonal event released on April 11. This event named Uprising, included a player-versus-environment game mode, which grew record hours of play engagement demonstrating that Overwatch can appeal to players beyond player-versus-player competition. 
In April, Blizzard also launched Heroes of the Stone 2.0 with a more powerful progression system, rewards pack, and new battleground and more compelling heroes, all of which bought players into the game. Blizzard's strategy to release content and feature more regularly in World of Warcraft has been paying off with time spent up year-over-year and with overall performance ahead of the prior expansion. At the end of the quarter, Blizzard released the game's second major patch since Legion came out with more content to come later this year. 
To round out the recent performance of Blizzard's gains, Hearthstone set a new all-time record in daily active users in April with the release of the new expansion, Journey to Un‚ÄôGoro. Kings' MAUs were down slightly versus prior quarter but community trends continue to set new highs with an increase in total playtime versus prior quarter. Time spent of daily active users is now a record 35 minutes. 
King also had the highest DAU-to-MAU ratio since 2013 with stability in DAUs versus the prior quarter. This performance shows that King's focus on live ops and new content for core franchises continues to keep our large and loyal audience engaged. And this bodes well for King's biggest growth opportunity, advertising. 
eSports is an important and growing engagement driver for our community and there are many highlights this quarter. Activision held Call of Duty World League events in Atlanta, Dallas, London, Paris, and Sydney and Blizzard kicked off the StarCraft 2 world championship series, Hearthstone championship tour, and Heroes of the Storm global championship with major international events, along with the third Heroes of the Dorm College tournament in Las Vegas. In addition, the Overwatch League completed its second season in Korea and this year's Overwatch World Cup was announced as part of the BZ year of Overwatch eSports as Blizzard gears up for the Overwatch League. 
And we have more to come down the road, including the recently announced CWL championship. This is Call of Duty's biggest competitive event of the year and will be held in August in Orlando with 32 teams from around the world competing for a price pool of $1.5 million as part of the largest CWL season date prize pool to date of $4 million. 
Turning next to the third pillar of our strategy, providing opportunities for more player investment. Blizzard saw an increase in total in-game purchases by almost 30% year-over-year primarily driven by Overwatch and World of Warcraft, highlighting once again, the virtuous cycle of engagement, leading to more player investment, all of which starts with great new content. 
Later this month, Activision's Call of Duty Black Ops III fans will be getting a new content offering called Zombies Chronicles, a remastered collection of the franchise's most beloved Zombies content. This is our most significant new content update yet in the second year following a Call of Duty release as we now have better player engagement opportunities than we've ever had with our catalog games. 
King not only increased engagement, but also increased player investment this quarter. Bookings per paying user rose for the seventh quarter in a row to a new record. King continue to have 2 of the top 10 grossing games in the U.S. for the 14th quarter in a row, and importantly, the Candy Crush franchise showed continued stability with mobile bookings growing versus prior quarter. King has a number of projects in development, including a promising new publishing partnership with PlayStudios in the Social Casino segment slated for later this year. This is an attractive mobile gaming genre and will allow us to provide great content for our existing player base as well as attract new players to the King network. 
As we discussed last quarter, we also have a number of mobile incubation projects underway across the company, many of which are based on our proven IP. Since King became part of the Activision Blizzard family last year, we've been looking at ways to work together to create even more great gaming experiences for our large player network. Last month, we announced that King and Activision are partnering on the creation of a Call of Duty mobile game and we're excited about the potential of bringing these 2 great teams together. 
In summary, we're off to a terrific start in 2017 with continued success keeping our large audiences engaged across a growing portfolio and on a variety of platforms. We're also pleased with the early momentum we are seeing for Destiny 2 and Call of Duty World War II and the continued progress on new growth opportunities like advertising, eSports and Consumer Products. We're excited about our prospects and stay tuned for further updates in the weeks and months ahead. 
Dennis will now review the numbers in more detail."
4222231,427449262,1190913,"Activision Blizzard, Inc., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, May 04, 2017",2017-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Thomas. Today, I will review our better-than-expected Q1 results, our outlook for Q2, and our raised outlook for the full year. Once again, we outperformed our guidance, thanks to the strength of our global portfolio of owned IP, which delivered r",1181,"Thanks, Thomas. Today, I will review our better-than-expected Q1 results, our outlook for Q2, and our raised outlook for the full year. Once again, we outperformed our guidance, thanks to the strength of our global portfolio of owned IP, which delivered record Q1 revenues, digital revenues, earnings per share, and cash flow. 
To review the quarter, I'd like to first start with our segment results. As a reminder, our segment results, unlike our consolidated results, are still presented excluding the impact of deferrals as they always have been. At an aggregate level, combined segment operating income was up 41% year-over-year on an as-reported basis. Operating income also grew on a pro forma basis when including a full quarter of King last year. This is despite expected Call of Duty headwinds and shows the strength and broad diversity of our portfolio. 
As anticipated, Activision publishing's Q1 results were down due to lower in-game digital sales. As mentioned on our Q4 call, we expect Activision to have a back-end loaded year with the 2 exciting releases in the second half of Destiny 2 and Call of Duty World War II. 
King's relatively stable daily player base and continued growth in per player engagement and player investment led to sequential revenue growth of 9% and an increase in operating income quarter-over-quarter. 
Blizzard's revenue grew 50% year-over-year, while operating income nearly doubled driven primarily by the success of Overwatch as well as strong continued engagement in World of Warcraft. So the strong 2016 tailwinds for the Blizzard's business continue into 2017. 
Now let's turn to our consolidated results. Unless otherwise indicated, I will be referencing non-GAAP as redefined figures, which include the impact of deferrals. If you would like to calculate metrics as we used to report them, you would add the impact of deferrals to our non-GAAP as redefined figures. Please refer to our earnings release for full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations. 
For the quarter, we generated record Q1 GAAP revenues of $1.73 billion, $176 million above our February guidance, and $271 million or 19% above Q1 last year. This includes the net recognition of deferred revenues $530 million for the quarter. We generated record GAAP EPS of $0.56 and record non-GAAP EPS of $0.72 in Q1, which was $0.21 above guidance. These figures include the net recognition of deferrals of $0.41. 
The overperformance in the quarter versus guidance was driven by a combination of business overperformance as well as timing of expenses. Our digital revenues once again grew to a Q1 record $1.4 billion, up 50% versus last year. The strong digital performance led not only to year-over-year operating margin expansion, but also strong cash flow generation. We delivered record Q1 operating cash flow of $411 million, up 22% year-over-year. 
From a balance sheet perspective, we paid down $500 million of debt in Q1, ending the quarter with $4.4 billion of aggregate debt outstanding. We finished the quarter with approximately $3.3 billion in cash and investments, with about $1.3 billion held domestically. And next week, on May 10, we plan to pay a cash dividend of $0.30 per common share, a 15% increase over 2016 to shareholders of record from the close of business on March 30, 2017. 
Now let's turn to our slate and outlook for Q2. Our Q2 slate includes one of Blizzard busiest stretches of in-game content releases, including momentum from the March 28th World of Warcraft content update, a new Hearthstone expansion, Journey to Un‚ÄôGoro, the Overwatch uprising event, and the Heroes of the Storm 2.0 launch with more content to come in the upcoming months. King will continue to drive live ops across its portfolio, albeit with some typical seasonality expected in Q2. Activision expects to raise Call of Duty second map pack as well as a free update in Destiny. In addition, we will launch new Zombies content for Black Ops III as well as new content and updates across the portfolio to keep players engaged, while at the same time, beginning to ramp in sales and marketing spend for our major releases later this year. 
For Q2 on a GAAP basis, we expect net revenues of $1.425 billion, including a net recognition of GAAP deferred revenues of $225 million, product cost of 23% and operating expenses of 64%. We expect GAAP interest expense of $37 million, a tax rate of 26%, GAAP and non-GAAP share count of 764 million and EPS of $0.15. For Q2 on a non-GAAP as redefined basis, we expect product costs of 23% and operating expenses of 48%. We expect non-GAAP interest expense of $36 million, tax rate of 24%, and non-GAAP EPS of $0.38, which includes the net recognition of GAAP deferrals of $0.11. 
Just to remind everyone, if you'd like to calculate non-GAAP metrics as we used to report them, you'd start with our non-GAAP as redefined EPS guidance of $0.38 and will move the net recognition of deferrals or $0.11.
Now to our 2017 full year outlook. Though its' still early in the year and we have a lot left to deliver, including our major launches in the second half of the year, we are raising our full year outlook. Also, as we mentioned on our last call, emerging new revenue streams like team sales for the Overwatch League and the associated media rights are not embedded in our current guidance. 
On a GAAP basis, we expect revenues of $6.1 billion, including GAAP deferrals of $230 million, product costs of 22%, and operating expenses of 62%. Our GAAP interest expense is expected to be $157 million and our GAAP tax rate is expected to be 17%. We expect 767 million fully diluted shares both for GAAP and non-GAAP redefined, and GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.88, up $0.16 versus our previous guidance. 
For 2017, on a non-GAAP basis as redefined, we expect product costs of 22% and operating expenses of 46%. We expect non-GAAP interest expense of $149 million, a tax rate of 24%, and non-GAAP EPS of $1.80, up $0.10 from our previous guidance, including a GAAP deferral of $0.08. If you would like to calculate non-GAAP metrics as we used to report them, you would start with our non-GAAP as redefined EPS of $1.80 and add the impact of deferrals or $0.08. 
So in summary, 2017 is off to a very strong start. Our record performance and cash flow generations speaks to the [long-year round trends in our core business. We have a lot left to deliver later this year but we are seeing some promising early data points on our 2 major launches ahead with Call of Duty and Destiny. Our strong owned IP portfolio, combined with promising emerging business opportunities like eSports, advertising and Consumer Products, provides us with a compelling opportunity for growth in 2018 and beyond. And as always, with so many great opportunities ahead of us, we remain focused on operational excellence, capital discipline, and long-term shareholder value creation.

Preorders, as Thomas said, are off to a very strong start, but we're also track a number of other softer measures to indicate strong positive interest in the game and go up to a great start with most of those as well. The reveal trailer has become the most liked video in Call of Duty history and also now had the most organic views of any Call of Duty reveal trailer we've ever made. We also set a new high watermark with the views of livestream, and as well as for Call of Duty and for Activision overall. And the live stream also was actually positively received with 95% like-to-dislike ratio. And then probably equally important as the positive indicators is that the negative social media sentiment, which you know we -- was an issue last year has virtually evaporated in the -- in about 0.2% at reveal. So I think we're going to have a great game and I think, we have the right game at the right time. Obviously, there's a lot of thirst from the community to go back to boots on the ground, but we didn't stopped there. We're also going to be bringing some real innovations to the game, which are obviously designed to keep it fresh and make it even more appealing for more different types of players, and those are going to be on display when we bring hands-on multiplayer to E3 next month, and that's only the second time in our history that we've done that and for context, the order time was Black Ops III. So obviously, we have a lot of confidence of what we're going to be showing. So early days, obviously but we're off to a strong start and while we're obviously only talking today about Call of Duty: World War II, I have the benefit of knowing what we have in the pipeline and I think that we -- I've got a lot of confidence that our fans are going to be decided to play all the games that we've got cooking up for them over the next several years."

So right now, we're heading towards Overwatch's launch anniversary later this month, and we're incredibly happy with the community that's developed around the game, how many people have already to tried the game and how they're staying with us nearly a year after the launch. Our first quarter MAUs were higher than we've seen all of last year, so that's great. We've new players come into the game when we released new types of gameplay through our seasonal events, and we have a lot of opportunities to continue doing that. We're also pleased with how successful Overwatch has been globally across the Americas, Europe, and Asia as well as our strong presence on both PC and console. Right, we're tapping into the biggest genre in the world, so we think there's still a lot of room for growth across both regions and platforms. We think the Overwatch IP is incredibly strong and has potential across a number of different mediums. Our out-of-game leaner media via comics and animated shorts has been really successful and feeling passion for the game's lure, and we think there's an ongoing opportunity there as well. Our existing eSports community is really strong, and it's growing. The Overwatch League is placed to accelerate that even more, so we're early in Overwatch's story with many growth opportunities still ahead. As far as the Overwatch League's timing, we are working to launch the league later this year. You'll hear more about that in the coming months, and I can turn over to Bobby to talk a little bit more about how the team sales process is going."

So great results. And it's also a great result with great engagements translates into how your monetization and we have seen here that bookings per player have gone up 27th consecutive quarter, so we have reached a new record level. Now what do we do to drive engagement? We do a few things. First of all, we release new fresh content in the live games, and we do -- we call it live operations, which basically means this content is temporary, limited in time, and only available for a specific time frame and this makes particularly attractive. And what we also do, we also released features which are permanent, so that's they are impacting the gameplay for the long-term. And both of those content releases are in the live games. What we also do is we then leverage the network of games we have by cross-promoting players from one game to the next game and by doing so, retaining and increasing the engagement not only in the single-game but at network level. And then, of course, we release new games and we have released Bubble Witch Saga 3 in January of this year and the launch went very well. We're very pleased with the results of the large and we're very pleased with the high quality of the game.

So as we said earlier this year in -- at our last earnings call in February, we expect to become profitable with this business line, with advertising this year, and to scale up the business in 2018."

So the most important thing for this franchise beyond delivering a great game, which Destiny 2 is definitely going to do, as we talk about the past, is getting the content pipeline right. Destiny's engagement has been the best in Activision's history, and we now have a lot of confidence that we're going to be able to keep with demand with that steady stream of great content to sort of keep pace with our players engagement post the release of Destiny 2. So as you know from our past comments and previous calls with Destiny 2's content, we're coupling Bungie's great leadership with multiple AAA developers that have a proven track record here at Activision to help us make sure that we have just one great piece of new content after another to keep the community engaged, and that's the most important answer to the second part of your question. We've shown that when we have great engagement, great business follows. So with respect to PC, which you asked about, we're committed to delivering meaningful features that are bespoke for the PC community and I'm really excited about what we have to show for them, but I'm going to leave the details of those for our gameplay premiere event, which is happening on May 18th and we'll have some additional obviously, exciting announcement on the game overall at that time as well.
All right. Thanks, Brian and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We'll look forward to seeing many of you at E3 or on our earnings call this summer. So thank you."

This quarter, we achieved record revenues, earnings per share and cash flow, and overperformed our prior guidance. The size and engagement in our community remains strong. We continue to invest in both in-game growth opportunities as well as adjacent opportunities like consumer products, advertising, and esports. 
One of our big priorities is to unlock the full potential of professional esports by opening the sale of teams and media rights of our leagues. Over the years, we've become a leader in creating world-class competitive experiences, sustainable franchises that engage hundreds of millions of people around the world through gameplay competition and connecting players and communities. This success is driven by our ability to tap into the timeless power of communities anchored through organized competition. 
Throughout history, sports has helped bring communities together. City and country loyalties form the basis for spectator enthusiasm, generations of engaged audiences, and traditions anchored in scheduled competitions. 
Until the 20th century though, sports like football, basketball and basketball were still hobbies for gifted amateurs. Then professional leagues emerged like the Premier League, the NFL, or the NBA. The value of sports in our everyday lives has grown exponentially, and so as the commercial opportunities that we see in sports. 
We actually believe the same opportunity to further professionalize esports now exist. And we think the impact can be as significant as the traditional sports we know and love. The franchises we've built over the years deliver competitive experiences as enduring as traditional sports, but with unique strength and value for brands. Our players are digital natives competing in almost every country in the world. The esports audience includes some of the hardest to reach and most sought-after demographics for marketers and advertisers with a share of millennials 2 to 3x higher than any of the big 4 U.S. sports. 
We're incredibly excited to launch the Overwatch League later this year. We believe by celebrating and rewarding our players and recognizing their accomplishments, our professional players will become the role model and inspire competitors of the 21st century. 
The competitions we're creating around the world will attract sponsors and advertisers resulting in broadcast revenues, licensing, sponsorship and ticket sales, and most importantly, amazing spectator experiences. 
Through MLG, we're building the first dedicated global channel for esports, the over-the-top ESPN of video games. 
To put the Overwatch League opportunity in context, around 240 million people today watch approximately 7 billion hours of NFL content annually. This drives $12 billion in revenues, including more than $6 billion in media rights revenues. The NBA today has roughly 175 million viewers watching around 2 billion hours total with more than $5 billion in revenues and $1.8 billion of those from media rights. With hundreds of millions of people already watching esports and playing our games, over the long term, our goal is to create opportunities that we believe could be of a similar scale. 
We're also going to combine delivery of our spectator content with unique advertising opportunities that includes the ability for advertisers to have better targeting and analytics, much more so than what you would see in traditional forms of broadcast advertising today. And with over 400 million MAUs and extremely high levels of engagement, our potential to generate meaningful advertising revenue is substantial. In particular, we believe our initiatives for advertising in King mobile games is a large and untapped opportunity and we're continuing to make progress with our testing and development of our ads platform at King. 
Our results this past quarter demonstrate our ability to execute successfully against the many opportunities for shareholder value creation we have and as we have done for 26 years. 
And now, Thomas will share the details on the quarter with you.  Thomas?"

We delivered record Q1 revenues of $1.7 billion and record digital revenues of $1.4 billion. We grew year-over-year, overperformed our guidance for the quarter, and are raising for guidance for the full year. Our results continue to be driven by focus and execution against our 3 strategic pillars: First, expanding our audiences; second, deepening engagement; and third, providing more opportunities for player investment. 
Let's start with audience reach, which was 431 million monthly active users this quarter. Blizzard had 41 million MAUs for the quarter, up 58% versus last year, and relatively stable versus the prior quarter despite no new full game releases. Blizzard's fastest-growing new IP ever, Overwatch, continues to grow from an MAU perspective, setting another high watermark this quarter. In less than a year since launch, Overwatch has 30 million registered players and has become Activision's $8 billion franchise. 
Hearthstone continues to attract new players as well, reaching 70 million registered players live to date. MAUs also grew year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter despite no new content in Q1. 
Activision had 48 million MAUs for the quarter, down year-over-year due to weakness in last holiday's Infinite Warfare release, as discussed on our Q4 call. However, Call of Duty continues to have a large and active community of players across Infinite Warfare, Modern Warfare Remastered, and Black Ops III, and we expect the community to grow with the next game in the series, Call of Duty: WWII releasing November 3. 
When Activision greenlit this game more than 2.5 years ago, the team knew it was time to return to franchise to its roots, and fans are already sharing their excitement for Call of Duty: WWII. Activision revealed the game at a global livestream from London last week, which became the most-watched livestream in Call of Duty history, and the reveal trailer has gone on to become the most liked trailer in Call of Duty history and became the fastest video to reach 10 million views in Call of Duty history, which it did in one day. Additionally, though it's still very early, preorders are off to a very strong start. Call of Duty:  WWII will deliver the gritty, authentic, cinematic experience, which Call of Duty is known for. 
Activision, along with its partners at  Bungie, also recently revealed the much-anticipated Destiny 2, which is set for release on September 8. Destiny was the biggest new video game franchise launch of all time when it was released, and early leading indicators, including preorders for Destiny 2, are very strong as well. The team is taking great care in designing the game to appeal to existing and new fans, including PC players for the first time. Activision is also localizing the game for more markets, which should enable us to reach new audiences. And at launch, we are offering an expansion pass for Destiny 2 containing 2 future expansions, along with a continuous calendar of other events. Encouragingly, the SKUs that contain the expansion pass have attracted the majority of preorders so far. 
We believe the combination of a great game, the new opportunity to reach PC players, and a robust content plan post launch highlights the opportunity ahead. We look forward to sharing more of our both, Destiny 2 and Call of Duty: WWII in the months ahead. 
Turning to our next strategic pillar. Our compelling games, deep gameplay, and consistent follow-on content drove not only large communities, but also deep engagement with about 40 billion hours of gameplay over the past 12 months. Blizzard continues to see strong engagement from its players with time spent increasing by a double-digit percentage year-over-year to a new Q1 record. Overwatch, again, had strong engagement this quarter, thanks in part to the Lunar New Year event, which like the 3 seasonal events before it, drove record engagement in the game. Overwatch's latest seasonal event released on April 11. This event named Uprising, included a player versus environment game mode which drew record hours of player engagement, demonstrating that Overwatch can appeal to players beyond player-versus-player competition. 
In April, Blizzard also launched Heroes of the Storm 2.0 with a more powerful progression system, rewards pack loots chest, a new battleground and more compelling heroes, all of which brought players into the game. 
Blizzard's strategy to release content and feature updates more regularly in World of Warcraft has been paying off with time spent up year-over-year and with overall performance ahead of the prior expansion. At the end of the quarter, Blizzard released the game's second major patch since Legion came out with more content to come later this year. 
To round out the terrific performance of Blizzard's games, Hearthstone set a new all-time record in daily active users in April with the release of the new expansion, Journey to Un‚ÄôGoro. 
Kings' MAUs were down slightly versus prior quarter, but community engagement trends continue to set new highs with an increase in total playtime versus prior quarter. Time spent by daily active users is now a record 35 minutes. 
King also had the highest DAU-to-MAU ratio since 2013 with stability in DAUs versus the prior quarter. This performance shows that King's focus on live ops and new content for core franchises continues to keep our large and loyal audience engaged. And this bodes well for King's biggest growth opportunity, advertising. 
esports is an important and growing engagement driver for our community and there were many highlights this quarter. Activision held Call of Duty World League events in Atlanta, Dallas, London, Paris, and Sydney, and Blizzard kicked off the StarCraft 2 World Championship series, Hearthstone championship tour, and Heroes of the Storm global championship with major international events, along with the third Heroes of the Dorm college tournament in Las Vegas. In addition, the Overwatch APEX league completed its second season in Korea and this year's Overwatch World Cup was announced as part of the busy year of Overwatch esports as Blizzard gears up for the Overwatch League. 
And we have more to come down the road, including the recently announced CWL championship. This is Call of Duty's biggest competitive event of the year and will be held in August in Orlando with 32 teams from around the world competing for a price pool of $1.5 million as part of the largest CWL season-long prize pool to date of $4 million. 
Turning next to the third pillar of our strategy, providing opportunities for more player investment. Blizzard saw an increase in total in-game purchases by almost 30% year-over-year, primarily driven by Overwatch and World of Warcraft, highlighting once again, the virtuous cycle of engagement, leading to more player investment, all of which starts with great, new content. 
Later this month, Activision's Call of Duty: Black Ops III fans will be getting a new content offering called Zombies Chronicles, a remastered collection of the franchise's most beloved Zombies content. This is our most significant new content update yet in the second year following a Call of Duty release as we now have better player engagement opportunities than we've ever had with our catalog games. 
King not only increased engagement, but also increased player investment this quarter. Bookings per paying user rose for the seventh quarter in a row to a new record. King continued to have 2 of the top 10 grossing games in the U.S. for the 14th quarter in a row, and importantly, the Candy Crush franchise show continued stability with mobile bookings growing versus prior quarter. King has a number of projects in development, including a promising new publishing partnership with Playstudios in the social casino segment slated for later this year. This is an attractive mobile gaming genre and will allow us to provide great content for our existing player base as well as attract new players to the King network. 
As we discussed last quarter, we also have a number of mobile incubation projects underway across the company, many of which are based on our proven IP. Since King became part of the Activision Blizzard family last year, we've been looking at ways to work together to create even more great gaming experiences for our large player network. Last month, we announced that King and Activision are partnering on the creation of a Call of Duty mobile game and we're excited about the potential of bringing these 2 great teams together. 
In summary, we are off to a terrific start in 2017 with continued success keeping our large audiences engaged across a growing portfolio and on a variety of platforms. We're also pleased with the early momentum we are seeing for Destiny 2 and Call of Duty: WWII and the continued progress on new growth opportunities like advertising, esports and consumer products. We're excited about our prospects and stay tuned for further updates in the weeks and months ahead. 
Dennis will now review the numbers in more detail."

Today, I will review our better-than-expected Q1 results, our outlook for Q2, and our raised outlook for the full year. 
Once again, we outperformed our guidance, thanks to the strength of our global portfolio of owned IP, which delivered record Q1 revenues, digital revenues, earnings per share, and cash flow. 
To review the quarter, I'd like to first start with our segment results. As a reminder, our segment results, unlike our consolidated results, are still presented excluding the impact of deferrals, as they always have been. At an aggregate level, combined segment operating income was up 41% year-over-year on an as-reported basis. Operating income also grew on a pro forma basis when including a full quarter of King last year. This is despite expected Call of Duty headwinds and shows the strength and broad diversity of our portfolio. 
As anticipated, Activision publishing's Q1 results were down due to lower in-game digital sales. As mentioned on our Q4 call, we expect Activision to have a back-end loaded year with the 2 exciting releases in the second half of Destiny 2 and Call of Duty: WWII. 
King's relatively stable daily player base and continued growth in per player engagement and player investment led to sequential revenue growth of 9% and an increase in operating income quarter-over-quarter. 
Blizzard's revenue grew 50% year-over-year, while operating income nearly doubled driven primarily by the success of Overwatch as well as strong continued engagement in World of Warcraft. So the strong 2016 tailwinds for the Blizzard's business continue into 2017. 
Now let's turn to our consolidated results. Unless otherwise indicated, I will be referencing non-GAAP as redefined figures, which include the impact of deferrals. If you would like to calculate metrics as we used to report them, you would add the impact of deferrals to our non-GAAP as redefined figures. Please refer to our earnings release for full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations. 
For the quarter, we generated record Q1 GAAP revenues of $1.73 billion, $176 million above our February guidance, and $271 million or 19% above Q1 last year. This includes the net recognition of deferred revenues of $530 million for the quarter. We generated record GAAP EPS of $0.56 and record non-GAAP EPS of $0.72 in Q1, which was $0.21 above guidance. These figures include the net recognition of deferrals of $0.41. 
The overperformance in the quarter versus guidance was driven by a combination of business overperformance as well as timing of expenses. Our digital revenues once again grew to a Q1 record $1.4 billion, up 50% versus last year. The strong digital performance led not only to year-over-year operating margin expansion, but also strong cash flow generation. We delivered record Q1 operating cash flow of $411 million, up 22% year-over-year. 
From a balance sheet perspective, we paid down $500 million of debt in Q1, ending the quarter with $4.4 billion of aggregate debt outstanding. We finished the quarter with approximately $3.3 billion in cash and investments, with about $1.3 billion held domestically. And next week, on May 10, we plan to pay a cash dividend of $0.30 per common share, a 15% increase over 2016, to shareholders of record from the close of business on March 30, 2017. 
Now let's turn to our slate and outlook for Q2. Our Q2 slate includes one of Blizzard's busiest stretches of in-game content releases, including Momentum from the March 28th World of Warcraft content update; a new Hearthstone expansion, Journey to Un‚ÄôGoro; the Overwatch Uprising event; and the Heroes of the Storm 2.0 launch, with more content to come in the upcoming months. King will continue to drive live ops across its portfolio, albeit with some typical seasonality expected in Q2. Activision expects to raise Call of Duty second map pack as well as a free update in Destiny. In addition, they will launch new Zombies content for Black Ops III as well as new content and updates across the portfolio to keep players engaged, while at the same time, beginning to ramp in sales and marketing spend for our major releases later this year. 
For Q2 on a GAAP basis, we expect net revenues of $1.425 billion, including the net recognition of GAAP deferred revenues of $225 million, product cost of 23% and operating expenses of 64%. We expect GAAP interest expense of $37 million, a tax rate of 26%, GAAP and non-GAAP share count of 764 million and EPS of $0.15. For Q2, on a non-GAAP as redefined basis, we expect product costs of 23% and operating expenses of 48%. We expect non-GAAP interest expense of $36 million, tax rate of 24%, and non-GAAP EPS of $0.38, which includes the net recognition of GAAP deferrals of $0.11. 
Just to remind everyone, if you would like to calculate non-GAAP metrics as we used to report them, you would start with our non-GAAP as redefined EPS guidance of $0.38 and remove the net recognition of deferrals or [ less events ].
Now to our 2017 full year outlook. Though it is still early in the year and we have a lot left to deliver, including our major launches in the second half of the year, we are raising our full year outlook. Also, as we mentioned on our last call, emerging new revenue streams like team sales for the Overwatch League and the associated media rights are not embedded in our current guidance. 
On a GAAP basis, we expect revenues of $6.1 billion, including GAAP deferrals of $230 million, product costs of 22%, and operating expenses of 62%. Our GAAP interest expense is expected to be $157 million and our GAAP tax rate is expected to be 17%. We expect 767 million fully diluted shares, both for GAAP and non-GAAP redefined; and GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.88, up $0.16 versus our previous guidance. 
For 2017, on a non-GAAP basis as redefined, we expect product costs of 22% and operating expenses of 46%. We expect non-GAAP interest expense of $149 million, a tax rate of 24%, and non-GAAP EPS of $1.80, up $0.10 from our previous guidance, including a GAAP deferral of $0.08. If you would like to calculate non-GAAP metrics as we used to report them, you would start with our non-GAAP as redefined EPS of $1.80 and add the impact of deferrals or $0.08. 
So in summary, 2017 is off to a very strong start. Our record performance and cash flow generation speaks to the long year-round trends in our core business. We have a lot left to deliver later this year but we are seeing some promising early data points on our 2 major launches ahead with Call of Duty and Destiny. Our strong owned IP portfolio, combined with promising emerging business opportunities like esports, advertising and Consumer Products, provides us with a compelling opportunity for growth in 2018 and beyond. And as always, with so many great opportunities ahead of us, we remain focused on operational excellence, capital discipline, and long-term shareholder value creation.

Maybe easiest way to answer the question is to go a little deeper into the data that Thomas started to share on our prepared remarks. Preorders, as Thomas said, are off to a very strong start, but we also track a number of other softer measures to indicate strong positive interest in the game, and we're off to a great start with most of those as well. The reveal trailer has become the most liked video in Call of Duty history and also now has the most organic views of any Call of Duty reveal trailer we've ever made. We also set a new high watermark with the views of the livestream. That's both for Call of Duty and for Activision overall. And the livestream also was actually positively received, with a 95% like-to-dislike ratio. And then probably equally important as the positive indicators is that the negative social media sentiment, which you know we -- was an issue last year, has virtually evaporated into the -- at about 0.2% at reveal. So I think we're going to have a great game and I think, we have the right game at the right time. Obviously, there's a lot of thirst from the community to go back to boots on the ground, but we didn't stopped there. We're also going to be bringing some real innovations to the game, which are obviously designed to keep it fresh and make it even more appealing for more different types of players, and those are going to be on display when we bring hands-on multiplayer to E3 next month, and that's only the second time in our history that we've done that for context. The other time was Black Ops III. So obviously, we have a lot of confidence on what we're going to be showing. So early days, obviously, but we're off to a strong start.

So right now, we're heading towards Overwatch's launch anniversary later this month, and we're incredibly happy with the community that's developed around the game, how many people have already to tried the game and how they're staying with us nearly a year after the launch. Our first quarter MAUs were higher than we've seen all of last year, so that's great. We've seen new players come into the game when we released new types of gameplay through our seasonal events, and we have a lot of opportunities to continue doing that. We're also pleased with how successful Overwatch has been globally across the Americas, Europe, and Asia, as well as our strong presence on both PC and console. But we're tapping into the biggest genre in the world, so we think there's still a lot of room for growth across both regions and platforms. We think the Overwatch IP is incredibly strong and has potential across a number of different mediums. Our out-of-game linear media via comics and animated shorts has been really successful and fueling passion for the game's lore, and we think there's an ongoing opportunity there as well. Our existing esports community is really strong, and it's growing. The Overwatch League is poised to accelerate that even more. So we're early in Overwatch's story with many growth opportunities still ahead. As far as the Overwatch League timing, we are working to launch the league later this year. You'll hear more about that in the coming months. And I can turn it over to Bobby to talk a little bit more about how the team sales process is doing."

So engagements has always been and continues to be a key priority for the company. And as you've seen from what Thomas was saying earlier, we have very positive trends and we're very happy about these positive trends. The average time played per player in the last quarter was around 35 minutes per day, and this has been an increase both towards the last quarter and also versus the same quarter of the previous year. So great results. And it's also a great result at great engagements, it translates into how your monetization. And we have seen here that bookings per player have gone up 27th consecutive quarter. So we have reached a new record level. Now what do we do to drive engagement? We do a few things. First of all, we release new, fresh content in the live games, and we do -- we call it live operations, which basically means this content is temporary, limited in time, and only available for a specific time frame, and this makes it particularly attractive. And what we also do, we also release features which are permanent so that they are impacting the gameplay for the long-term. And both those mini content releases are in the live games what we also do is we then leverage the network of games we have by cross-promoting players from one game to the next game, and by doing so, retaining and increasing the engagement, not only in the single game, but at network level. And then, of course, we release new games, and we have released Bubble Witch Saga 3 in January of this year, and the launch went very well. We are very pleased with the results of the launch and we're very pleased with the high quality of the game. And as you have heard earlier Thomas, we now have -- we are also entering a new genre of games with the partnership with Playstudios, which will go live towards the end of the year."

And after 4 weeks, Destiny 2 preorders are tracking amongst the top in Activision Publishing's history.

This quarter, we achieved record revenues, earnings per share and cash flow, and overperformed our prior guidance. The size and engagement in our community remains strong. We continue to invest in both in-game growth opportunities as well as adjacent opportunities like consumer products, advertising, and esports. 
One of our big priorities is to unlock the full potential of professional esports by opening the sale of teams and media rights of our leagues. Over the years, we've become a leader in creating world-class competitive experiences, sustainable franchises that engage hundreds of millions of people around the world through gameplay competition and connecting players and communities. This success is driven by our ability to tap into the timeless power of communities anchored through organized competition. 
Throughout history, sports has helped bring communities together. City and country loyalties form the basis for spectator enthusiasm, generations of engaged audiences, and traditions anchored in scheduled competitions. 
Until the 20th century though, sports like football, basketball and basketball were still hobbies for gifted amateurs. Then professional leagues emerged like the Premier League, the NFL, or the NBA. The value of sports in our everyday lives has grown exponentially, and so have the commercial opportunities that we see in sports. 
We actually believe the same opportunity to further professionalize esports now exists. And we think the impact can be as significant as the traditional sports we know and love. The franchises we've built over the years deliver competitive experiences as enduring as traditional sports, but with unique strength and value for brands. Our players are digital natives competing in almost every country in the world. The esports audience includes some of the hardest to reach and most sought-after demographics for marketers and advertisers with a share of millennials 2x to 3x higher than any of the big 4 U.S. sports. 
We're incredibly excited to launch the Overwatch League later this year. We believe by celebrating and rewarding our players and recognizing their accomplishments, our professional players will become the role model and inspire competitors of the 21st century. 
The competitions we're creating around the world will attract sponsors and advertisers resulting in broadcast revenues, licensing, sponsorship and ticket sales, and most importantly, amazing spectator experiences. 
Through MLG, we're building the first dedicated global channel for esports, the over-the-top ESPN of video games. 
To put the Overwatch League opportunity in context, around 240 million people today watch approximately 7 billion hours of NFL content annually. This drives $12 billion in revenues, including more than $6 billion in media rights revenues. The NBA today has roughly 175 million viewers watching around 2 billion hours total with more than $5 billion in revenues and $1.8 billion of those from media rights. With hundreds of millions of people already watching esports and playing our games, over the long term, our goal is to create opportunities that we believe could be of a similar scale. 
We're also going to combine delivery of our spectator content with unique advertising opportunities that includes the ability for advertisers to have better targeting and analytics, much more so than what you would see in traditional forms of broadcast advertising today. And with over 400 million MAUs and extremely high levels of engagement, our potential to generate meaningful advertising revenue is substantial. In particular, we believe our initiatives for advertising in King mobile games is a large and untapped opportunity and we're continuing to make progress with our testing and development of our ads platform at King. 
Our results this past quarter demonstrate our ability to execute successfully against the many opportunities for shareholder value creation we have and as we have done for 26 years. 
And now, Thomas will share the details on the quarter with you.  Thomas?"

We delivered record Q1 revenues of $1.7 billion and record digital revenues of $1.4 billion. We grew year-over-year, overperformed our guidance for the quarter, and are raising our guidance for the full year. Our results continue to be driven by focus and execution against our 3 strategic pillars: First, expanding our audiences; second, deepening engagement; and third, providing more opportunities for player investment. 
Let's start with audience reach, which was 431 million monthly active users this quarter. Blizzard had 41 million MAUs for the quarter, up 58% versus last year, and relatively stable versus the prior quarter despite no new full game releases. Blizzard's fastest-growing new IP ever, Overwatch, continues to grow from an MAU perspective, setting another high watermark this quarter. In less than a year since launch, Overwatch has 30 million registered players and has become Activision's $8 billion franchise. 
Hearthstone continues to attract new players as well, reaching 70 million registered players live to date. MAUs also grew year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter despite no new content in Q1. 
Activision had 48 million MAUs for the quarter, down year-over-year due to weakness in last holiday's Infinite Warfare release, as discussed on our Q4 call. However, Call of Duty continues to have a large and active community of players across Infinite Warfare, Modern Warfare Remastered, and Black Ops III, and we expect the community to grow with the next game in the series, Call of Duty: WWII releasing November 3. 
When Activision greenlit this game more than 2.5 years ago, the team knew it was time to return to franchise to its roots, and fans are already sharing their excitement for Call of Duty: WWII. Activision revealed the game at a global livestream from London last week, which became the most-watched livestream in Call of Duty history, and the reveal trailer has gone on to become the most liked trailer in Call of Duty history and became the fastest video to reach 10 million views in Call of Duty history, which it did in one day. Additionally, though it's still very early, preorders are off to a very strong start. Call of Duty:  WWII will deliver the gritty, authentic, cinematic experience, which Call of Duty is known for. 
Activision, along with its partners at  Bungie, also recently revealed the much-anticipated Destiny 2, which is set for release on September 8. Destiny was the biggest new video game franchise launch of all time when it was released, and early leading indicators, including preorders for Destiny 2, are very strong as well. The team is taking great care in designing the game to appeal to existing and new fans, including PC players for the first time. Activision is also localizing the game for more markets, which should enable us to reach new audiences. And at launch, we are offering an expansion pass for Destiny 2 containing 2 future expansions, along with a continuous calendar of other events. Encouragingly, the SKUs that contain the expansion pass have attracted the majority of preorders so far. 
We believe the combination of a great game, the new opportunity to reach PC players, and a robust content plan post launch highlights the opportunity ahead. We look forward to sharing more of our both, Destiny 2 and Call of Duty: WWII in the months ahead. 
Turning to our next strategic pillar. Our compelling games, deep gameplay, and consistent follow-on content drove not only large communities, but also deep engagement with about 40 billion hours of gameplay over the past 12 months. Blizzard continues to see strong engagement from its players with time spent increasing by a double-digit percentage year-over-year to a new Q1 record. Overwatch, again, had strong engagement this quarter, thanks in part to the Lunar New Year event, which like the 3 seasonal events before it, drove record engagement in the game. Overwatch's latest seasonal event released on April 11. This event named Uprising, included a player versus environment game mode which drew record hours of player engagement, demonstrating that Overwatch can appeal to players beyond player-versus-player competition. 
In April, Blizzard also launched Heroes of the Storm 2.0 with a more powerful progression system, rewards pack loots chest, a new battleground and more compelling heroes, all of which brought players back into the game. 
Blizzard's strategy to release content and feature updates more regularly in World of Warcraft has been paying off with time spent up year-over-year and with overall performance ahead of the prior expansion. At the end of the quarter, Blizzard released the game's second major patch since Legion came out with more content to come later this year. 
To round out the terrific performance of Blizzard's games, Hearthstone set a new all-time record in daily active users in April with the release of the new expansion, Journey to Un‚ÄôGoro. 
Kings' MAUs were down slightly versus prior quarter, but community engagement trends continue to set new highs with an increase in total playtime versus prior quarter. Time spent by daily active users is now a record 35 minutes. 
King also had the highest DAU-to-MAU ratio since 2013 with stability in DAUs versus the prior quarter. This performance shows that King's focus on live ops and new content for core franchises continues to keep our large and loyal audience engaged. And this bodes well for King's biggest growth opportunity, advertising. 
esports is an important and growing engagement driver for our community and there were many highlights this quarter. Activision held Call of Duty World League events in Atlanta, Dallas, London, Paris, and Sydney, and Blizzard kicked off the StarCraft 2 World Championship series, Hearthstone championship tour, and Heroes of the Storm global championship with major international events, along with the third Heroes of the Dorm college tournament in Las Vegas. In addition, the Overwatch APEX league completed its second season in Korea and this year's Overwatch World Cup was announced as part of the busy year of Overwatch esports as Blizzard gears up for the Overwatch League. 
And we have more to come down the road, including the recently announced CWL championship. This is Call of Duty's biggest competitive event of the year and will be held in August in Orlando with 32 teams from around the world competing for a price pool of $1.5 million as part of the largest CWL season-long prize pool to date of $4 million. 
Turning next to the third pillar of our strategy, providing opportunities for more player investment. Blizzard saw an increase in total in-game purchases by almost 30% year-over-year, primarily driven by Overwatch and World of Warcraft, highlighting once again, the virtuous cycle of engagement, leading to more player investment, all of which starts with great, new content. 
Later this month, Activision's Call of Duty: Black Ops III fans will be getting a new content offering called Zombies Chronicles, a remastered collection of the franchise's most beloved Zombies content. This is our most significant new content update yet in the second year following a Call of Duty release as we now have better player engagement opportunities than we've ever had with our catalog games. 
King not only increased engagement, but also increased player investment this quarter. Bookings per paying user rose for the seventh quarter in a row to a new record. King continued to have 2 of the top 10 grossing games in the U.S. for the 14th quarter in a row, and importantly, the Candy Crush franchise show continued stability with mobile bookings growing versus prior quarter. King has a number of projects in development, including a promising new publishing partnership with Playstudios in the social casino segment slated for later this year. This is an attractive mobile gaming genre and will allow us to provide great content for our existing player base as well as attract new players to the King network. 
As we discussed last quarter, we also have a number of mobile incubation projects underway across the company, many of which are based on our proven IP. Since King became part of the Activision Blizzard family last year, we've been looking at ways to work together to create even more great gaming experiences for our large player network. Last month, we announced that King and Activision are partnering on the creation of a Call of Duty mobile game and we're excited about the potential of bringing these 2 great teams together. 
In summary, we are off to a terrific start in 2017 with continued success keeping our large audiences engaged across a growing portfolio and on a variety of platforms. We're also pleased with the early momentum we are seeing for Destiny 2 and Call of Duty: WWII and the continued progress on new growth opportunities like advertising, esports and consumer products. We're excited about our prospects and stay tuned for further updates in the weeks and months ahead. 
Dennis will now review the numbers in more detail."
4222231,427449262,1191461,"Activision Blizzard, Inc., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, May 04, 2017",2017-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Thomas. Today, I will review our better-than-expected Q1 results, our outlook for Q2, and our raised outlook for the full year. Once again, we outperformed our guidance, thanks to the strength of our global portfolio of owned IP, which delivered",1182,"Thanks, Thomas. Today, I will review our better-than-expected Q1 results, our outlook for Q2, and our raised outlook for the full year. 
Once again, we outperformed our guidance, thanks to the strength of our global portfolio of owned IP, which delivered record Q1 revenues, digital revenues, earnings per share, and cash flow. 
To review the quarter, I'd like to first start with our segment results. As a reminder, our segment results, unlike our consolidated results, are still presented excluding the impact of deferrals, as they always have been. At an aggregate level, combined segment operating income was up 41% year-over-year on an as-reported basis. Operating income also grew on a pro forma basis when including a full quarter of King last year. This is despite expected Call of Duty headwinds and shows the strength and broad diversity of our portfolio. 
As anticipated, Activision publishing's Q1 results were down due to lower in-game digital sales. As mentioned on our Q4 call, we expect Activision to have a back-end loaded year with the 2 exciting releases in the second half of Destiny 2 and Call of Duty: WWII. 
King's relatively stable daily player base and continued growth in per player engagement and player investment led to sequential revenue growth of 9% and an increase in operating income quarter-over-quarter. 
Blizzard's revenue grew 50% year-over-year, while operating income nearly doubled driven primarily by the success of Overwatch as well as strong continued engagement in World of Warcraft. So the strong 2016 tailwinds for the Blizzard's business continue into 2017. 
Now let's turn to our consolidated results. Unless otherwise indicated, I will be referencing non-GAAP as redefined figures, which include the impact of deferrals. If you would like to calculate metrics as we used to report them, you would add the impact of deferrals to our non-GAAP as redefined figures. Please refer to our earnings release for full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations. 
For the quarter, we generated record Q1 GAAP revenues of $1.73 billion, $176 million above our February guidance, and $271 million or 19% above Q1 last year. This includes the net recognition of deferred revenues of $530 million for the quarter. We generated record GAAP EPS of $0.56 and record non-GAAP EPS of $0.72 in Q1, which was $0.21 above guidance. These figures include the net recognition of deferrals of $0.41. 
The overperformance in the quarter versus guidance was driven by a combination of business overperformance as well as timing of expenses. Our digital revenues once again grew to a Q1 record $1.4 billion, up 50% versus last year. The strong digital performance led not only to year-over-year operating margin expansion, but also strong cash flow generation. We delivered record Q1 operating cash flow of $411 million, up 22% year-over-year. 
From a balance sheet perspective, we paid down $500 million of debt in Q1, ending the quarter with $4.4 billion of aggregate debt outstanding. We finished the quarter with approximately $3.3 billion in cash and investments, with about $1.3 billion held domestically. And next week, on May 10, we plan to pay a cash dividend of $0.30 per common share, a 15% increase over 2016, to shareholders of record from the close of business on March 30, 2017. 
Now let's turn to our slate and outlook for Q2. Our Q2 slate includes one of Blizzard's busiest stretches of in-game content releases, including Momentum from the March 28th World of Warcraft content update; a new Hearthstone expansion, Journey to Un‚ÄôGoro; the Overwatch Uprising event; and the Heroes of the Storm 2.0 launch, with more content to come in the upcoming months. King will continue to drive live ops across its portfolio, albeit with some typical seasonality expected in Q2. Activision expects to raise Call of Duty second map pack as well as a free update in Destiny. In addition, they will launch new Zombies content for Black Ops III as well as new content and updates across the portfolio to keep players engaged, while at the same time, beginning to ramp in sales and marketing spend for our major releases later this year. 
For Q2 on a GAAP basis, we expect net revenues of $1.425 billion, including the net recognition of GAAP deferred revenues of $225 million, product cost of 23% and operating expenses of 64%. We expect GAAP interest expense of $37 million, a tax rate of 26%, GAAP and non-GAAP share count of 764 million and EPS of $0.15. For Q2, on a non-GAAP as redefined basis, we expect product costs of 23% and operating expenses of 48%. We expect non-GAAP interest expense of $36 million, tax rate of 24%, and non-GAAP EPS of $0.38, which includes the net recognition of GAAP deferrals of $0.11. 
Just to remind everyone, if you would like to calculate non-GAAP metrics as we used to report them, you would start with our non-GAAP as redefined EPS guidance of $0.38 and remove the net recognition of deferrals or $0.11.
Now to our 2017 full year outlook. Though it is still early in the year and we have a lot left to deliver, including our major launches in the second half of the year, we are raising our full year outlook. Also, as we mentioned on our last call, emerging new revenue streams like team sales for the Overwatch League and the associated media rights are not embedded in our current guidance. 
On a GAAP basis, we expect revenues of $6.1 billion, including GAAP deferrals of $230 million, product costs of 22%, and operating expenses of 62%. Our GAAP interest expense is expected to be $157 million and our GAAP tax rate is expected to be 17%. We expect 767 million fully diluted shares, both for GAAP and non-GAAP redefined; and GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.88, up $0.16 versus our previous guidance. 
For 2017, on a non-GAAP basis as redefined, we expect product costs of 22% and operating expenses of 46%. We expect non-GAAP interest expense of $149 million, a tax rate of 24%, and non-GAAP EPS of $1.80, up $0.10 from our previous guidance, including a GAAP deferral of $0.08. If you would like to calculate non-GAAP metrics as we used to report them, you would start with our non-GAAP as redefined EPS of $1.80 and add the impact of deferrals or $0.08. 
So in summary, 2017 is off to a very strong start. Our record performance and cash flow generation speaks to the strong year-round trends in our core business. We have a lot left to deliver later this year but we are seeing some promising early data points on our 2 major launches ahead with Call of Duty and Destiny. Our strong owned IP portfolio, combined with promising emerging business opportunities like esports, advertising and Consumer Products, provides us with a compelling opportunity for growth in 2018 and beyond. And as always, with so many great opportunities ahead of us, we remain focused on operational excellence, capital discipline, and long-term shareholder value creation.

Maybe easiest way to answer the question is to go a little deeper into the data that Thomas started to share on our prepared remarks. Preorders, as Thomas said, are off to a very strong start, but we also track a number of other softer measures to indicate strong positive interest in the game, and we're off to a great start with most of those as well. The reveal trailer has become the most liked video in Call of Duty history and also now has the most organic views of any Call of Duty reveal trailer we've ever made. We also set a new high watermark with the views of the livestream. That's both for Call of Duty and for Activision overall. And the livestream also was extremely positively received, with a 95% like-to-dislike ratio. And then probably equally important as the positive indicators is that the negative social media sentiment, which you know we -- was an issue last year, has virtually evaporated into the -- at about 0.2% at reveal. So I think we're going to have a great game and I think, we have the right game at the right time. Obviously, there's a lot of thirst from the community to go back to boots on the ground, but we didn't stop there. We're also going to be bringing some real innovations to the game, which are obviously designed to keep it fresh and make it even more appealing for more different types of players, and those are going to be on display when we bring hands-on multiplayer to E3 next month, and that's only the second time in our history that we've done that. And for context, the other time was Black Ops III. So obviously, we have a lot of confidence on what we're going to be showing. So early days, obviously, but we're off to a strong start. And while we're obviously only talking today about Call of Duty: WWII, I have the benefit of knowing what we have in the pipeline, and I think that we -- I've got a lot of confidence that our fans are going to be decided to play all the games that we've got cooking up for them over the next several years."

So right now, we're heading towards Overwatch's launch anniversary later this month, and we're incredibly happy with the community that's developed around the game, how many people have already to tried the game and how they're staying with us nearly a year after the launch. Our first quarter MAUs were higher than we've seen all of last year, so that's great. We've seen new players come into the game when we released new types of gameplay through our seasonal events, and we have a lot of opportunities to continue doing that. We're also pleased with how successful Overwatch has been globally across the Americas, Europe, and Asia, as well as our strong presence on both PC and console. But we're tapping into the biggest genre in the world, so we think there's still a lot of room for growth across both regions and platforms. We think the Overwatch IP is incredibly strong and has potential across a number of different mediums. Our out-of-game linear media via comics and animated shorts has been really successful and fueling passion for the game's lore, and we think there's an ongoing opportunity there as well. Our existing esports community is really strong, and it's growing. The Overwatch League is poised to accelerate that even more. So we're early in Overwatch's story with many growth opportunities still ahead. As far as the Overwatch League timing, we are working to launch the league later this year. You'll hear more about that in the coming months. And I can turn it over to Bobby to talk a little bit more about how the team sales process is going."

So engagements has always been and continues to be a key priority for the company. And as you've seen from what Thomas was saying earlier, we have very positive trends and we're very happy about these positive trends. The average time played per player in the last quarter was around 35 minutes per day, and this has been an increase both towards the last quarter and also versus the same quarter of the previous year. So great results. And it's also a great result at great engagements, it translates into how your monetization. And we have seen here that bookings per player have gone up 27th consecutive quarter. So we have reached a new record level. Now what do we do to drive engagement? We do a few things. First of all, we release new, fresh content in the live games, and we do -- we call it live operations, which basically means this content is temporary, limited in time, and only available for a specific time frame, and this makes it particularly attractive. And what we also do, we also release features which are permanent so that they are impacting the gameplay for the long-term. And both those mini content releases are in the live games what we also do is we then leverage the network of games we have by cross-promoting players from one game to the next game, and by doing so, retaining and increasing the engagement, not only in the single game, but at network level. And then, of course, we release new games, and we have released Bubble Witch Saga 3 in January of this year, and the launch went very well. We are very pleased with the results of the launch and we're very pleased with the high quality of the game. And as you have heard earlier Thomas, we now have -- we are also entering a new genre of games with the partnership with Playstudios, which will go live towards the end of the year."

And we're testing different ad formats to ensure that we have the best possible player experience and also to ensure that we have the best possible return for our advertisers. We are seeing that the -- in the market, there is incredible demand for high-quality mobile video [indiscernible] and we continue to be very excited about this opportunity because we think we are in a very strong position, both because of the size of the network, and as you've heard before, because of the engagement of our players. So as we said earlier this year in -- at our last earnings call in February, we expect to become profitable with this business line with advertising this year and to scale up the business in 2018."

And after 4 weeks, Destiny 2 preorders are tracking amongst the top in Activision Publishing's history. So the most important thing for this franchise beyond delivering a great game, which Destiny 2 is definitely going to do, as we've talked about in the past, is getting the content pipeline right. Destiny's engagement has been the best in Activision's history, and we now have a lot of confidence that we're going to be able to keep up with demand with that steady stream of great content to sort of keep pace with our players' engagement post the release of Destiny 2. So as you know from our past comments on previous calls, with Destiny 2's content, we're complementing Bungie's great visionary leadership with multiple AAA developers that have a proven track record here at Activision to help us make sure that we have just one great piece of new content after another to keep the community engaged. And that's the most important answer to the second part of your question, we've shown that when we have great engagement, great business follows. So with respect to PC, which you asked about, we're committed to delivering meaningful features that are bespoke for the PC community. And I'm really excited about what we have to show for them, but I'm going to leave the details of those for our gameplay premiere event, which is happening on May 18th, and we'll have some additional, obviously, exciting announcements on the game overall at that time as well.
All right. Thanks, Brian, and thanks everyone for joining us today. We look forward to seeing many of you at E3 or on our earnings call this summer. So thank you."

This quarter, we achieved record revenues, earnings per share and cash flow, and overperformed our prior guidance. The size and engagement in our community remains strong. We continue to invest in both in-game growth opportunities as well as adjacent opportunities like consumer products, advertising, and esports. 
One of our big priorities is to unlock the full potential of professional esports by opening the sale of teams and media rights of our leagues. Over the years, we've become a leader in creating world-class competitive experiences, sustainable franchises that engage hundreds of millions of people around the world through gameplay competition and connecting players and communities. This success is driven by our ability to tap into the timeless power of communities anchored through organized competition. 
Throughout history, sports has helped bring communities together. City and country loyalties form the basis for spectator enthusiasm, generations of engaged audiences, and traditions anchored in scheduled competitions. 
Until the 20th century though, sports like football, basketball and basketball were still hobbies for gifted amateurs. Then professional leagues emerged like the Premier League, the NFL, or the NBA. The value of sports in our everyday lives has grown exponentially, and so have the commercial opportunities that we see in sports. 
We actually believe the same opportunity to further professionalize esports now exists. And we think the impact can be as significant as the traditional sports we know and love. The franchises we've built over the years deliver competitive experiences as enduring as traditional sports, but with unique strength and value for brands. Our players are digital natives competing in almost every country in the world. The esports audience includes some of the hardest to reach and most sought-after demographics for marketers and advertisers with a share of millennials 2x to 3x higher than any of the big 4 U.S. sports. 
We're incredibly excited to launch the Overwatch League later this year. We believe by celebrating and rewarding our players and recognizing their accomplishments, our professional players will become the role model and inspire competitors of the 21st century. 
The competitions we're creating around the world will attract sponsors and advertisers resulting in broadcast revenues, licensing, sponsorship and ticket sales, and most importantly, amazing spectator experiences. 
Through MLG, we're building the first dedicated global channel for esports, the over-the-top ESPN of video games. 
To put the Overwatch League opportunity in context, around 240 million people today watch approximately 7 billion hours of NFL content annually. This drives $12 billion in revenues, including more than $6 billion in media rights revenues. The NBA today has roughly 175 million viewers watching around 2 billion hours total with more than $5 billion in revenues and $1.8 billion of those from media rights. With hundreds of millions of people already watching esports and playing our games, over the long term, our goal is to create opportunities that we believe could be of a similar scale. 
We're also going to combine delivery of our spectator content with unique advertising opportunities that includes the ability for advertisers to have better targeting and analytics, much more so than what you would see in traditional forms of broadcast advertising today. And with over 400 million MAUs and extremely high levels of engagement, our potential to generate meaningful advertising revenue is substantial. In particular, we believe our initiatives for advertising in King mobile games is a large and untapped opportunity and we're continuing to make progress with our testing and development of our ads platform at King. 
Our results this past quarter demonstrate our ability to execute successfully against the many opportunities for shareholder value creation we have and as we have done for 26 years. 
And now, Thomas will share the details on the quarter with you.  Thomas?"

We delivered record Q1 revenues of $1.7 billion and record digital revenues of $1.4 billion. We grew year-over-year, overperformed our guidance for the quarter, and are raising our guidance for the full year. Our results continue to be driven by focus and execution against our 3 strategic pillars: First, expanding our audiences; second, deepening engagement; and third, providing more opportunities for player investment. 
Let's start with audience reach, which was 431 million monthly active users this quarter. Blizzard had 41 million MAUs for the quarter, up 58% versus last year, and relatively stable versus the prior quarter despite no new full game releases. Blizzard's fastest-growing new IP ever, Overwatch, continues to grow from an MAU perspective, setting another high watermark this quarter. In less than a year since launch, Overwatch has 30 million registered players and has become Activision's $8 billion franchise. 
Hearthstone continues to attract new players as well, reaching 70 million registered players live to date. MAUs also grew year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter despite no new content in Q1. 
Activision had 48 million MAUs for the quarter, down year-over-year due to weakness in last holiday's Infinite Warfare release, as discussed on our Q4 call. However, Call of Duty continues to have a large and active community of players across Infinite Warfare, Modern Warfare Remastered, and Black Ops III, and we expect the community to grow with the next game in the series, Call of Duty: WWII releasing November 3. 
When Activision greenlit this game more than 2.5 years ago, the team knew it was time to return to franchise to its roots, and fans are already sharing their excitement for Call of Duty: WWII. Activision revealed the game at a global livestream from London last week, which became the most-watched livestream in Call of Duty history, and the reveal trailer has gone on to become the most liked trailer in Call of Duty history and became the fastest video to reach 10 million views in Call of Duty history, which it did in one day. Additionally, though it's still very early, preorders are off to a very strong start. Call of Duty:  WWII will deliver the gritty, authentic, cinematic experience, which Call of Duty is known for. 
Activision, along with its partners at  Bungie, also recently revealed the much-anticipated Destiny 2, which is set for release on September 8. Destiny was the biggest new video game franchise launch of all time when it was released, and early leading indicators, including preorders for Destiny 2, are very strong as well. The team is taking great care in designing the game to appeal to existing and new fans, including PC players for the first time. Activision is also localizing the game for more markets, which should enable us to reach new audiences. And at launch, we are offering an expansion pass for Destiny 2 containing 2 future expansions, along with a continuous calendar of other events. Encouragingly, the SKUs that contain the expansion pass have attracted the majority of preorders so far. 
We believe the combination of a great game, the new opportunity to reach PC players, and a robust content plan post launch highlights the opportunity ahead. We look forward to sharing more of our both, Destiny 2 and Call of Duty: WWII in the months ahead. 
Turning to our next strategic pillar. Our compelling games, deep gameplay, and consistent follow-on content drove not only large communities, but also deep engagement with about 40 billion hours of gameplay over the past 12 months. Blizzard continues to see strong engagement from its players with time spent increasing by a double-digit percentage year-over-year to a new Q1 record. Overwatch, again, had strong engagement this quarter, thanks in part to the Lunar New Year event, which like the 3 seasonal events before it, drove record engagement in the game. Overwatch's latest seasonal event released on April 11. This event named Uprising, included a player versus environment game mode which drew record hours of player engagement, demonstrating that Overwatch can appeal to players beyond player-versus-player competition. 
In April, Blizzard also launched Heroes of the Storm 2.0 with a more powerful progression system, rewards pack loots chest, a new battleground and more compelling heroes, all of which brought players back into the game. 
Blizzard's strategy to release content and feature updates more regularly in World of Warcraft has been paying off with time spent up year-over-year and with overall performance ahead of the prior expansion. At the end of the quarter, Blizzard released the game's second major patch since Legion came out with more content to come later this year. 
To round out the terrific performance of Blizzard's games, Hearthstone set a new all-time record in daily active users in April with the release of the new expansion, Journey to Un‚ÄôGoro. 
Kings' MAUs were down slightly versus prior quarter, but community engagement trends continue to set new highs with an increase in total playtime versus prior quarter. Time spent by daily active users is now a record 35 minutes. 
King also had the highest DAU-to-MAU ratio since 2013 with stability in DAUs versus the prior quarter. This performance shows that King's focus on live ops and new content for core franchises continues to keep our large and loyal audience engaged. And this bodes well for King's biggest growth opportunity, advertising. 
esports is an important and growing engagement driver for our community and there were many highlights this quarter. Activision held Call of Duty World League events in Atlanta, Dallas, London, Paris, and Sydney, and Blizzard kicked off the StarCraft 2 World Championship series, Hearthstone championship tour, and Heroes of the Storm global championship with major international events, along with the third Heroes of the Dorm college tournament in Las Vegas. In addition, the Overwatch APEX league completed its second season in Korea and this year's Overwatch World Cup was announced as part of the busy year of Overwatch esports as Blizzard gears up for the Overwatch League. 
And we have more to come down the road, including the recently announced CWL championship. This is Call of Duty's biggest competitive event of the year and will be held in August in Orlando with 32 teams from around the world competing for a price pool of $1.5 million as part of the largest CWL season-long prize pool to date of $4 million. 
Turning next to the third pillar of our strategy, providing opportunities for more player investment. Blizzard saw an increase in total in-game purchases by almost 30% year-over-year, primarily driven by Overwatch and World of Warcraft, highlighting once again, the virtuous cycle of engagement, leading to more player investment, all of which starts with great, new content. 
Later this month, Activision's Call of Duty: Black Ops III fans will be getting a new content offering called Zombies Chronicles, a remastered collection of the franchise's most beloved Zombies content. This is our most significant new content update yet in the second year following a Call of Duty release as we now have better player engagement opportunities than we've ever had with our catalog games. 
King not only increased engagement, but also increased player investment this quarter. Bookings per paying user rose for the seventh quarter in a row to a new record. King continued to have 2 of the top 10 grossing games in the U.S. for the 14th quarter in a row, and importantly, the Candy Crush franchise show continued stability with mobile bookings growing versus prior quarter. King has a number of projects in development, including a promising new publishing partnership with Playstudios in the social casino segment slated for later this year. This is an attractive mobile gaming genre and will allow us to provide great content for our existing player base as well as attract new players to the King network. 
As we discussed last quarter, we also have a number of mobile incubation projects underway across the company, many of which are based on our proven IP. Since King became part of the Activision Blizzard family last year, we've been looking at ways to work together to create even more great gaming experiences for our large player network. Last month, we announced that King and Activision are partnering on the creation of a Call of Duty mobile game and we're excited about the potential of bringing these 2 great teams together. 
In summary, we are off to a terrific start in 2017 with continued success keeping our large audiences engaged across a growing portfolio and on a variety of platforms. We're also pleased with the early momentum we are seeing for Destiny 2 and Call of Duty: WWII and the continued progress on new growth opportunities like advertising, esports and consumer products. We're excited about our prospects and stay tuned for further updates in the weeks and months ahead. 
Dennis will now review the numbers in more detail."

Today, I will review our better-than-expected Q1 results, our outlook for Q2, and our raised outlook for the full year. 
Once again, we outperformed our guidance, thanks to the strength of our global portfolio of owned IP, which delivered record Q1 revenues, digital revenues, earnings per share, and cash flow. 
To review the quarter, I'd like to first start with our segment results. As a reminder, our segment results, unlike our consolidated results, are still presented excluding the impact of deferrals, as they always have been. At an aggregate level, combined segment operating income was up 41% year-over-year on an as-reported basis. Operating income also grew on a pro forma basis when including a full quarter of King last year. This is despite expected Call of Duty headwinds and shows the strength and broad diversity of our portfolio. 
As anticipated, Activision publishing's Q1 results were down due to lower in-game digital sales. As mentioned on our Q4 call, we expect Activision to have a back-end loaded year with the 2 exciting releases in the second half of Destiny 2 and Call of Duty: WWII. 
King's relatively stable daily player base and continued growth in per player engagement and player investment led to sequential revenue growth of 9% and an increase in operating income quarter-over-quarter. 
Blizzard's revenue grew 50% year-over-year, while operating income nearly doubled driven primarily by the success of Overwatch as well as strong continued engagement in World of Warcraft. So the strong 2016 tailwinds for the Blizzard's business continue into 2017. 
Now let's turn to our consolidated results. Unless otherwise indicated, I will be referencing non-GAAP as redefined figures, which include the impact of deferrals. If you would like to calculate metrics as we used to report them, you would add the impact of deferrals to our non-GAAP as redefined figures. Please refer to our earnings release for full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations. 
For the quarter, we generated record Q1 GAAP revenues of $1.73 billion, $176 million above our February guidance, and $271 million or 19% above Q1 last year. This includes the net recognition of deferred revenues of $530 million for the quarter. We generated record GAAP EPS of $0.56 and record non-GAAP EPS of $0.72 in Q1, which was $0.21 above guidance. These figures include the net recognition of deferrals of $0.41. 
The overperformance in the quarter versus guidance was driven by a combination of business overperformance as well as timing of expenses. Our digital revenues once again grew to a Q1 record $1.4 billion, up 50% versus last year. The strong digital performance led not only to year-over-year operating margin expansion, but also strong cash flow generation. We delivered record Q1 operating cash flow of $411 million, up 22% year-over-year. 
From a balance sheet perspective, we paid down $500 million of debt in Q1, ending the quarter with $4.4 billion of aggregate debt outstanding. We finished the quarter with approximately $3.3 billion in cash and investments, with about $1.3 billion held domestically. And next week, on May 10, we plan to pay a cash dividend of $0.30 per common share, a 15% increase over 2016, to shareholders of record from the close of business on March 30, 2017. 
Now let's turn to our slate and outlook for Q2. Our Q2 slate includes one of Blizzard's busiest stretches of in-game content releases, including Momentum from the March 28th World of Warcraft content update; a new Hearthstone expansion, Journey to Un‚ÄôGoro; the Overwatch Uprising event; and the Heroes of the Storm 2.0 launch, with more content to come in the upcoming months. King will continue to drive live ops across its portfolio, albeit with some typical seasonality expected in Q2. Activision expects to raise Call of Duty second map pack as well as a free update in Destiny. In addition, they will launch new Zombies content for Black Ops III as well as new content and updates across the portfolio to keep players engaged, while at the same time, beginning to ramp in sales and marketing spend for our major releases later this year. 
For Q2 on a GAAP basis, we expect net revenues of $1.425 billion, including the net recognition of GAAP deferred revenues of $225 million, product cost of 23% and operating expenses of 64%. We expect GAAP interest expense of $37 million, a tax rate of 26%, GAAP and non-GAAP share count of 764 million and EPS of $0.15. For Q2, on a non-GAAP as redefined basis, we expect product costs of 23% and operating expenses of 48%. We expect non-GAAP interest expense of $36 million, tax rate of 24%, and non-GAAP EPS of $0.38, which includes the net recognition of GAAP deferrals of $0.11. 
Just to remind everyone, if you would like to calculate non-GAAP metrics as we used to report them, you would start with our non-GAAP as redefined EPS guidance of $0.38 and remove the net recognition of deferrals or $0.11.
Now to our 2017 full year outlook. Though it is still early in the year and we have a lot left to deliver, including our major launches in the second half of the year, we are raising our full year outlook. Also, as we mentioned on our last call, emerging new revenue streams like team sales for the Overwatch League and the associated media rights are not embedded in our current guidance. 
On a GAAP basis, we expect revenues of $6.1 billion, including GAAP deferrals of $230 million, product costs of 22%, and operating expenses of 62%. Our GAAP interest expense is expected to be $157 million and our GAAP tax rate is expected to be 17%. We expect 767 million fully diluted shares, both for GAAP and non-GAAP redefined; and GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.88, up $0.16 versus our previous guidance. 
For 2017, on a non-GAAP basis as redefined, we expect product costs of 22% and operating expenses of 46%. We expect non-GAAP interest expense of $149 million, a tax rate of 24%, and non-GAAP EPS of $1.80, up $0.10 from our previous guidance, including a GAAP deferral of $0.08. If you would like to calculate non-GAAP metrics as we used to report them, you would start with our non-GAAP as redefined EPS of $1.80 and add the impact of deferrals or $0.08. 
So in summary, 2017 is off to a very strong start. Our record performance and cash flow generation speaks to the strong year-round trends in our core business. We have a lot left to deliver later this year but we are seeing some promising early data points on our 2 major launches ahead with Call of Duty and Destiny. Our strong owned IP portfolio, combined with promising emerging business opportunities like esports, advertising and Consumer Products, provides us with a compelling opportunity for growth in 2018 and beyond. And as always, with so many great opportunities ahead of us, we remain focused on operational excellence, capital discipline, and long-term shareholder value creation.

Maybe easiest way to answer the question is to go a little deeper into the data that Thomas started to share on our prepared remarks. Preorders, as Thomas said, are off to a very strong start, but we also track a number of other softer measures to indicate strong positive interest in the game, and we're off to a great start with most of those as well. The reveal trailer has become the most liked video in Call of Duty history and also now has the most organic views of any Call of Duty reveal trailer we've ever made. We also set a new high watermark with the views of the livestream. That's both for Call of Duty and for Activision overall. And the livestream also was extremely positively received, with a 95% like-to-dislike ratio. And then probably equally important as the positive indicators is that the negative social media sentiment, which you know we -- was an issue last year, has virtually evaporated into the -- at about 0.2% at reveal. So I think we're going to have a great game and I think, we have the right game at the right time. Obviously, there's a lot of thirst from the community to go back to boots on the ground, but we didn't stop there. We're also going to be bringing some real innovations to the game, which are obviously designed to keep it fresh and make it even more appealing for more different types of players, and those are going to be on display when we bring hands-on multiplayer to E3 next month, and that's only the second time in our history that we've done that. And for context, the other time was Black Ops III. So obviously, we have a lot of confidence on what we're going to be showing. So early days, obviously, but we're off to a strong start. And while we're obviously only talking today about Call of Duty: WWII, I have the benefit of knowing what we have in the pipeline, and I think that we -- I've got a lot of confidence that our fans are going to be decided to play all the games that we've got cooking up for them over the next several years."

So right now, we're heading towards Overwatch's launch anniversary later this month, and we're incredibly happy with the community that's developed around the game, how many people have already to tried the game and how they're staying with us nearly a year after the launch. Our first quarter MAUs were higher than we've seen all of last year, so that's great. We've seen new players come into the game when we released new types of gameplay through our seasonal events, and we have a lot of opportunities to continue doing that. We're also pleased with how successful Overwatch has been globally across the Americas, Europe, and Asia, as well as our strong presence on both PC and console. But we're tapping into the biggest genre in the world, so we think there's still a lot of room for growth across both regions and platforms. We think the Overwatch IP is incredibly strong and has potential across a number of different mediums. Our out-of-game linear media via comics and animated shorts has been really successful and fueling passion for the game's lore, and we think there's an ongoing opportunity there as well. Our existing esports community is really strong, and it's growing. The Overwatch League is poised to accelerate that even more. So we're early in Overwatch's story with many growth opportunities still ahead. As far as the Overwatch League timing, we are working to launch the league later this year. You'll hear more about that in the coming months. And I can turn it over to Bobby to talk a little bit more about how the team sales process is going."

So engagements has always been and continues to be a key priority for the company. And as you've seen from what Thomas was saying earlier, we have very positive trends and we're very happy about these positive trends.

So great results. And it's also a great result at great engagements, it translates into how your monetization. And we have seen here that bookings per player have gone up 27th consecutive quarter. So we have reached a new record level. Now what do we do to drive engagement? We do a few things. First of all, we release new, fresh content in the live games, and we do -- we call it live operations, which basically means this content is temporary, limited in time, and only available for a specific time frame, and this makes it particularly attractive. And what we also do, we also release features which are permanent so that they are impacting the gameplay for the long-term. And both those mini content releases are in the live games what we also do is we then leverage the network of games we have by cross-promoting players from one game to the next game, and by doing so, retaining and increasing the engagement, not only in the single game, but at network level. And then, of course, we release new games, and we have released Bubble Witch Saga 3 in January of this year, and the launch went very well. We are very pleased with the results of the launch and we're very pleased with the high quality of the game. And as you have heard earlier Thomas, we now have -- we are also entering a new genre of games with the partnership with Playstudios, which will go live towards the end of the year."

We also announced the first team sales for the Overwatch League, the first major global city-based professional eSports league.

The joy of our work, what we do each day, is to support our teams and building out some of the world's best way creative environments and strongest commercial capabilities on behalf of this communities so that they can play, connect and engage as the deeply as possible. When we get that right, we have the ability to serve our hundreds of millions of audience members with an ongoing stream of content, features, events and products that they love. 
The business strategy underlying that work is based on the 3 pillars you heard from Bobby: We invest in creative and commercial excellence in order to expand reach, deepen engagement and provide more opportunity for player investment, which then allows for reinvestment in creative and commercial excellence and for the growth cycle to continue. We saw this strategy work especially well this quarter with our teams providing more regular content and feature updates across our franchises in our library, leading to our biggest first half of the year in company history its record revenues driven by digital growth. In Q2, our revenues exceeded our outlook by more than $200 million and earnings per share surpassed our expectations by $0.17. Given the size of over performance and confidence in our plans, we are raising out all the prettier. 
Let's start with audience reach, which was 407 million monthly active users this quarter. Blizzard did not full game releases this quarter yet a strong stream of content update across Blizzard franchises drove an all-time MAU record of 46 million, up 38% from last year and up 12% in the last quarter. Blizzard's community has now more than doubled the MAUs since early 2015 underscoring the ability to grow audience reach across the portfolio of platforms, regions, genres and business models. 
Now that with the leading Overwatch community continue to grow MAUs up each and every quarter since launch and in Q2, they had another all-time MAU record with the release of 2 seasonal events. And Hearthstone's MAUs increased to an all-time record for the franchise fueled by the new expansion Journey to Un‚ÄôGoro. Activision had 47 million MAUs for the quarter driven by Call of Duty, which continues to have a large and active player base across the number of its titles, many of which received updates during the quarter. In particular, the release of Zombies Chronicles, Activision's first large content drop to a community in year 2 after game launch help to grow Call of Duty: Black Ops III MAUs quarter-over-quarter. Activision expects to expand the Call of Duty community this fall with a highly anticipated release of Call of Duty: WWII on November 3. And we see great momentum for World War II not only for key indicators like preorders, purchase intent and hands on play feedback but also from more qualitative measures like media views, social sentiment and engagement, which are up year-over-year. We just did Call of Duty: WWII Zombies mode, which is now our most liked zombies trailer ever. And we can't wait for players to experience the game during our upcoming beta exclusively on PlayStation 4 on August 25 available for all those who preorder the game. 
Activision, along with partner Bungie, showcased the upcoming launch of Destiny 2 at multiple events this summer to great enthusiasm. We're excited that Destiny 2's PC version earned E3 game critics' PC game of show and even more excited that it'll be on Blizzard's Battle neck, making it the first non-Blizzard game ever on the platform. Publishing on own platform will provide an enhanced player experience, better insights and better economics.  With the PC beta still to come to Destiny 2 console beta had more players than the first Destiny Beta and preorder levels are now above the first Destiny at this same point in time prelaunch. Destiny 2 full game careers also have the highest digital mix in Activision's history. 
Finally, Activision's release of the remastered Crash Bandicoot for PS4 showed the powerful combination of our deep library of beloved IP and our team's ability to create great new content for our communities. The game is outperforming even our most optimistic expectations and with the #1 console title globally into June based on units. Notable given it was only available on one platform for 2 days in a month. 
Turning now to our second strategic pillar, engagement. Blizzard's focus on compelling in-game content led to all-time record DAUs in Q2 record playtime. In Overwatch, April's Uprising player-versus-environment game mode was well received with a record playtime and more recently, the May anniversary event drove strong engagement and record participation and customization items. 
Hearthstone's Journey to Un‚ÄôGoro was one of the best received expansions to date with record DAUs and World of Warcraft continues to benefit through more regular content update that Blizzard adds in between major expansion. Time spent in the game is up year-over-year. The Legion expansion continues to outperform the last expansion and Blizzard plans to release this quarter another large content drop with more details to be revealed at games to come. 
King's MAUs were down year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. Numerous efforts are now underway to grow audience size, but these will take time as the team experiments with rich-driving initiatives and continues to develop new creative content for the community. We have, however, seen good success with our live ops and new features which continue to drive strong engagement. As illustrated by the frequency with which players reengage each month that remains all-time high. To put this in perspective, the time spent per player per day inside King's franchises is 35 minutes, higher than that of Instagram or Snapchat. 
Our groundbreaking initiative needs drive engagement and celebrate our players and their achievement in new ways. We made strong progress this quarter on the Overwatch League as Bobby already mentioned. That progress was a meaningful milestone toward establishing a lead-based professional competition at the standalone business. We now have the sustainable structure, in which to invest for the long term with the very best partners from traditional sports and from eSports. 
Blizzard also recently announced a live streaming media rights partnership which showed the value of our broadcast content. Just as importantly though, the partnership carved out a number of future opportunities for media rights sales, including those related to the Overwatch League. Progress on Overwatch League also sets the stage for Activision's Call of Duty World League. With CWL, we'll wrap up a great season of competition with our upcoming championship event, and we are well positioned through upcoming season. 
Turning last to our third pillar, providing opportunity for player investment. In-game content continues to be a consistent driver for our business delivering another $1 billion quarter for in-game purchases. King was the biggest contributor with bookings per paying user rising for the eighth quarter in a row to a new record. Strong engagement and player investment led to an increase in mobile bookings both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. King continue to have 2 of the top 10 grossing games in the U.S. for the 15th quarter in a row and King continues to develop a strong pipeline with both new features across the live games portfolio, multiple new games ahead including a promising publishing partnership with Playstudios in the social casino segment slated for release later this fall. 
King also continues to build out its advertising business, which we believe, is an important long-term opportunity. We now have new industry proven leadership in place driving the advertising business. The team is focused on the creation of premium video ad products that can improve player experience, deliver value to advertisers and create meaningful new revenue streams. Given the growth as the overall mobile advertising ecosystem and the relative brand safety of our network, in particular, we think this is a meaningful opportunity for the future. 
This quarter King also entered a new partnership with Facebook audience network for static display add inventory. The partnership monetizes the portion of King's impression, while the team continues to work toward the long-term video ad opportunity. 
Both Activision and Blizzard also had a strong quarter for player investment. Call of Duty's Black Ops Zombies not only drove purchases of that specific piece of content at a recommended $30 price but also led to higher engagement, which in turn lets even more add-on purchases by our players. The strength of our strategy and providing great content wherever our fans engage can be seen in the fact that Call of Duty's in-game purchases were roughly in line with last year's record Q2 performance, all in the strength of great content provided across a number of Call of Duty titles. Blizzard experienced strong participation with in-game content for Overwatch and Hearthstone and also for the Diablo, as the [ Necromancer Class ] originally debuted in Diablo II was introduced in Diablo III and embraced by the player community. 
Stepping back, the success of our ongoing stream of content, features events and products to our communities, coupled with additional opportunities from our best library, highlights a really strong model both for our fans and their enjoyment and for the company as a high-margin business. We have the largest catalogs of own intellectual property's, including game titles that go back to their [indiscernible] and we have hundreds of millions of players in 196 countries, one of the largest digitally connected audiences in the world. This makes it an incredible time to be a part of Activision Blizzard. Our momentum, driven by our inspired teams enabling year-round engagement for our players, drives both near-term performance and future growth opportunities like eSports, ads, mobile and Consumer Products. 
Spence will now review the numbers in more detail."

I'm thrilled to be here with all of you today and to be part of the Activision Blizzard team. I come here with a deeper appreciation for the power of beloved global franchises that build enduring, emotional connections with the community.",1331,"Thanks, Scotty. I'm thrilled to be here with all of you today and to be part of the Activision Blizzard team. I come here with a deeper appreciation for the power of beloved global franchises that build enduring, emotional connections with the community. That's the foundation of Activision Blizzard, and it's why I believe we have such a bright future. Today, I'll review our better-than-expected Q2 results, which capped off a record first half. I'll also review our outlook for Q3 and our raised outlook for the full year. 
To review the quarter, I would like to start with our segment results. As a reminder, our segment results unlike our consolidated results are still presented, excluding the impact of deferrals as they always have been. Each of our segments contributed to our over performance this quarter. We outperformed our outlook due to the combined power of our franchise breadth, a steady stream of content serving our uniquely engaged community and our talented teams. At the aggregate level, we delivered combined segment operating income of $476 million, which as Bobby indicated, represents a record for our quarter without the new full game franchise release. Activision generated operating income of $87 million, roughly flat year-over-year with strong Call of Duty performance across the overall franchise offsetting expected lower performance on Infinite Warfare. Our strategy of providing content wherever our players engage drove this upside. As with improved performance across Activision catalog, including a very positive reception to Crash Bandicoot. Blizzard's $225 million of operating income was the largest segment earnings contributor in the quarter led by the strength of the Overwatch, World of Warcraft and Hearthstone franchises. Operating income was down year-over-year as expected given the comp to last year's significant Q2 Overwatch release. in King delivered $164 million of operating income in the quarter, which was slightly down year-over-year but relatively flat sequentially. Continued growth in per player engagement and player investment led to stable year-over-year revenues for the Candy crush franchise. 
Now let's turn to our consolidated results. Unless otherwise indicated, I'll be referencing non-GAAP as redefined figures, which include the impact of deferrals. If you'd like to calculate metrics as we used to report them, you would add the impact of deferrals to a non-GAAP as redefined figures. Please refer to our earnings release for full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations. 
For the quarter, we generated GAAP revenues of $1.63 billion, $206 million above our May guidance. This includes the net recognition of deferred revenues of $213 million for the quarter. We generated GAAP EPS of $0.32 and non-GAAP EPS of $0.55 in Q2, which was $0.17 above guidance. These figures include the net recognition of deferrals of $0.12. The over performance in the quarter versus guidance was driven largely by business over performance as well as some expense timing. From a capital perspective, we continued our positive rating agency momentum and received another upgrade from S&P to BBB. We also entered into a leverage neutral $1.2 billion refinancing to lock-in attractive long-term interest rates bringing our blended cost of debt to 3.6% and provided a better staggering of debt maturities. We delivered Q2 operating cash flow of $265 million, finishing the quarter with approximately $3.3 billion in cash and investments, about 1/3 of which is held domestically. And approximately $4.4 billion of aggregate debt outstanding for a net debt position of approximately $1.2 billion at quarter end. Lastly, we paid a cash dividend of $0.30 per common share, which was up 15% year-over-year for a total $226 million in aggregate to shareholders of record as of March 30, 2017. 
Now let's turn to our slate and outlook for Q3. Our Q3 slate continues our strategy of delivering a steady stream of content and services to our community including Blizzard's Hearthstone expansion, knight of the frozen throne, additional maps for Activision's Infinite Warfare and new features and live ops across team titles. In addition, Blizzard is launching a remastered version of the original StarCraft on August 14. This will offer new and veteran players the same classic StarCraft game play with 4k graphics, modern convenience like cloud saves, and connectivity to Blizzard's updated Battle Net ecosystem for an enhanced, social and competitive experience. And of course, Activision has 2 major releases in the back half of the year, the launch Destiny 2 on console on September 6 with the PC launch to follow-on October 24. We'll also continue the marketing ramp for the November 3 release of Call of Duty: WWII. 
For Q3 on a GAAP basis, we expect net revenues of $1.35 billion, including GAAP deferrals of $315 million, product cost of 23% and operating expenses of 67%. We expect GAAP interest expense of $41 million, a tax rate of 30%, GAAP and non-GAAP share count of $766 million and GAAP EPS of $0.09. For Q3, on a non-GAAP as redefined basis, we expect product costs of 23% and operating expenses of 49%. We expect non-GAAP interest expense of $40 million, a tax rate of 25% and non-GAAP EPS of $0.34, including a GAAP deferral of $0.11. And just to remind everyone, if you like to calculate non-GAAP metrics as we used to report them, you'd start with our non-GAAP as redefined EPS guidance of $0.34 and add the impact of deferrals for $0.11. 
Before I turn to our 2017 outlook, I'd like to provide some detail on the impact of the Overwatch League. With the recently announced sale of 7 teams, we do expect some revenue upside to Q4, but it will be modest given the recognition of team sale proceeds over multiple years. Further, from an operating income perspective, the revenue recognition of team sales will be partially offset by the investment required to launch the League, including inaugural season marketing. As we look ahead to the first season, we see a number of important upcoming milestones including standing up league operations, supporting teams development of player rosters, attracting sponsors, elevating the viewer experience, and securing media distribution. We're investing in this league for the long-term. Overtime we expect to recognize additional revenues related to both more team sales and multiple league revenue streams. We see this as a substantial long-term value driver for the business. 
Now turning to our raised 2017 full year outlook, which passes through business over performance from Q2 and now includes the Overwatch League's modest revenue contribution and roughly breakeven EPS contribution. On a GAAP basis, we expect revenues of $6.4 billion, including GAAP deferrals of $175 million; product cost of 22% and operating expenses of 60%. Our GAAP interest expense is expected to be $174 million. And our GAAP tax rate is expected to be 16%. We expect 767 million fully diluted shares both for GAAP and non-GAAP redefined and GAAP EPS is expected to be $1.05. For 2017, on a non-GAAP basis, as redefined, we expect product cost of 22% and operating expenses of 45%. We expect non-GAAP interest expense of $156 million, a tax rate of 24% and non-GAAP EPS of $1.94, including a GAAP deferral of $0.06. And if you'd like to calculate non-GAAP metrics as we used to report them, you would start with our non-GAAP as redefined EPS guidance at $1.94, you add the impact of deferrals for $0.06. 
In closing, I just want to echo Bobby and Kali's sentiment. This such an exciting time by delivering engaging content, features and services to our community, including in-game content, and remastered IP from unparalleled library we can increasingly generate digital, recurring, high-margin revenue opportunities. Our core games business has never been stronger and it's also powering future growth vectors eSports, advertising, Consumer Products, TV and film and mobile. We believe we have tremendous opportunities ahead of us and as always, we remain focused on rigorous prioritization, operational excellence, fiscal discipline and long-term shareholder value.

We've announced the first 7 and I think what you're going to see is that probably the most important milestones are as we get towards that latter part of the year and we start to kick off competition, when you see what you're doing in terms of broadcast rights and sponsorship opportunities, but from every perspective, I think we think we've organized the league in the best way that will allow us to celebrate our players and our fans. And if you think about over 30 million players today, this is a very large audience even if your spectators, were only coming from your player population, that is a very, very large audience to be able to have advertisers and sponsors and partners sports. So I'd say for off to a really great start, and you'll hear more about the future team sales over the balance of the year.

So the beta went great and there's a lot of excitement about Destiny 2 overall and a lot of positive signs pretty much anyway you look. First of all, we have a tremendous amount of confidence in the game as disclosed I think it's going to be a great game. And we received almost positive feedback from both the press and the fans after people got their hands on the beta. And I think it's also worth noting that Destiny won 45 awards at E3 and we're continuing to go strong. We also have very strong preorders and [ Koti ] broadly but the specifics are the #1 position on Nilsson on next choice purchase intent. And while no one of those data points is ever predicted in a vacuum, we found that when you have all 3 of those trending positively, it's usually a very good thing. And then also several first Destiny 2 the way we're going to market that are designed to bring to franchise to a broader audience starting with the fact that we've got a great PC game. Of those 45 awards, 1 of those will be official best of show for PC at E3. We've actually added a number of languages and localizations to make the game more appealing and accessible to more audiences around the world and of course, I think our watershed partnership with Blizzard is going to bring Destiny 2 the most passionate PC fans anywhere in the world, so it puts us in the possible stage. And finally, maybe most importantly with a game like this, Destiny's engagement with a follow-on content is almost as important if not as important as the main game and as I mentioned on earlier calls we've completed approach to tapping that by widening our stable of AAA developers so that we can keep up with the demand high-class problem, but we haven't been able to do that in the past, keep up the demand for more content and I think that fans agree with the importance of that which is evidenced by the fact that such overwhelmingly high percentage of that the orders thus far are for one of our elevated SKUs, which include the Season Pass and the following content. So lots of good science, delete this being just one of them and really excited and have greatly."

And this has resulted in an increase and continued increase of our player monetization. Candy Crush, which is a title, which is now 5 years old has recently hit again, the #1 grossing in the U.S. chart, and we also see great results in our other live games. In regards to audience reach, we think we have more work to do and will take some more time. But they are very focused on it. The audience reach, we know that they can -- the impact the audience reach with new titles. Here we have our teams focused on developing multiple new titles for the long-term, in particular, focusing strategically, first of all, on our casual genre for our existing audience. But we're also looking at extending into new genres, in particular, mid-core. Here, we have, of course, big opportunities within the company, the wider company, and we're exploring mobile opportunities for some of the company's existing powerhouse franchises like the partnership we have announced recently with Activision publishing for Call of Duty. In the near term we're also working on a social casino title in partnership with Playstudios, and we expect to release this title by the end of the year. In regards to audience reach, we also believe that there are opportunities to stabilize and grow the audience reach in the live games in the team so far has been focused on engagement and monetization features and it will continue to focus on engagement and monetization features where we've been successful.

We really deliberated structuring this business to attract the best owners and players in order to position the league, the Overwatch League for long-term success. And that starts with optimizing alignment between the league, which we own with the teams and our players. So I believe -- and at the league level we're establishing a pool of shared revenues composed of media rights and Consumer Products, league sponsorship and a portion of league-related digital and the merchandise. And then we'll net those league costs like marketing and production and league operations, against those revenue streams and share the resulting amount, 50-50 between the league and the teams. And then at the team level, we've got these fantastic entrepreneurial owners and want to be sure we develop the structure that enabled those owners to not only fund player and team operations but also create real incremental value at the local level. So in addition to their league participation, the teams have their local revenue streams, including the more traditional areas like ticket sales and concessions and local sponsorships and local merch sales but also have more unique opportunities such the ability to host certain nonprofessional Overwatch matches. And so -- and then lastly, when you think about the players, we established minimum salaries, benefits and bonuses for players sold we're providing a security and stability required to attract the best client talent on the planet. And as we step back we position the league and team owners to invest alongside one another to be value at both league and the local level leveraging the capabilities and infrastructure that we each bring to bare for the benefit of our players and our friends. So we've got plenty of work to do here and we're getting ready for the launch later this year we look forward to sharing more progress soon."

We had strong MAUs this quarter with audiences at a relevant scale across multiple titles and importantly despite the headwinds that we've talked about on IW, both MAUs and OI are both in line with our record-keeping Q2 performance from last year despite those headwinds. So our strategy of bringing content and adding content wherever our players just to play is really paying off. and I think that's what drove the positive performance by reference in the quarter. We had Infinite Warfare and Modern Warfare Remastered, we continue to see content that was scheduled for those. We also brought the Zombies Chronicles, which Coddy mentioned, which is we monitor some of the beloved content for the Black Ops Zombies and that also speaks to the strength of the catalog and our ability to continue to delight fans with new versions of that. So really speaks to the size and the strength and disability of the Call of Duty can do this across multiple titles, and I can't think of another franchise that can. On World War II specifically, probably most importantly we think we have the right game at the right time. And I can tell you that those who have played it, that didn't to boots on the ground, return to scale authentic military content and context for the franchises is a welcome change time and everything that sense of touch that by the way, it's a lot more than usual. We had multiplayer hands-on at E3 for only the second time in our history this year. Everything that consumers have put their hands on have gotten really positive response from fans as well as from critics. And there's a couple of data points, which showed that first of all, the reveal trailer was the most liked video in Call of Duty history and we got a pretty great history with the bad, and we have the most organic views of any trailer ever. The mall to really received in the Zombies trailer that we Comic-Con went to be in the most liked some this trailer ever with overwhelmingly positive sentiment as well. So the good news is of this our beta starts on August 25 and on PlayStation and I hope all of you are going to join us and play."

And in terms of update on the business itself, we put the player experience first, so our focus is, first of all, on creating a really compelling ad format, and we defined this as a ad format, which is well integrated into the game play, and that provides value for the player as well as the value for the advertiser. And currently, we are evaluating the results of this first ad format test. And we are continuing to work on creating more premium video ad products. We're also widening the variety of ad formats beyond video, as you heard before we signed a partnership with Facebook to offer product. And so we are introducing [indiscernible] and the format will allow us to monetize our global audience. So overall, we feel very excited about this opportunity. We think it's opportunity given the size and engagement of our network. And, so I will give you an update in a later date, for the progress."

This quarter is a great example of that approach. We delivered a consistent flow of updates and new content across all of our games. And that has driven record engagement even without a new game launch. We're also really excited about the future. In addition to supporting all of our live games, we're committed to incubating new initiatives. And we're also thinking about different platforms, especially mobile. In terms of new IP, our pipeline is in a better position than ever before in our history. Last year, [ Allen ] who cofounded Blizzard with me and Frank Pierce, return to the company to take on debt talks of coordinating our efforts in this regard. And this includes some great ideas that we already started to explore. So we now have multiple dedicated incubation teams that are being led by some of our most experienced game designers at the misery. I should say that creating new Blizzard quality games on any platform will take time and as we've shown in the past, we're not going to lose any game, so we don't feel it up to our expectations are those of our players.

And Sony reported this morning that Crash the most downloaded game on the PlayStation store in July. So as to your broader question, I think this is just another example of us really listening to our communities and our fans and offering them great content for the want to engage, one of our core strategy. So we think we have other great IP in our portfolio that we're considering, of course, but we've already -- decent you be there for us, we've already shown the power remastered last year with Zombies Chronicles that we talked about Crash Bandicoot is another great example. So this is strategy that we has clearly attention and will go no new announcements today, I think you can be confident that there'll be more activity like this in the future with more great IP. The other opportunity beyond remasters is to look at some of our classic IP and ask whether or not to be reborn on the new platform like what we're doing with Skylanders on mobile. So that our IP library is an asset that when done right can be very powerful."

We exceeded our prior outlook and delivered record first half revenues. The engagement of our communities remains strong, and we believe our momentum can continue through the rest of the year. 
Our success continues to be the result of our focus on our players and our audiences. Investing in creative and commercial excellence is framed by the 3 pillars we have shared with you before: one, expand our reach; two, deepen engagements; and three, provide more opportunity for player investment. 
Our teams worked tirelessly to deliver the most immersive and engaging experiences for our players. This content provides the connection between hundreds of millions of players around the world. 
We then enhance these connections with our franchises through initiatives like eSports, television and film and now consumer products. These additional touch points create more value for our shareholders like creating value and engagement for our audiences. 
Here are some of the ways we created value for our audiences this quarter. We released new updates across many of our leading franchises this quarter, driving engagement and delivering nearly $0.5 billion of segment operating income, the most we've achieved in a single quarter without new full game releases for any franchise. 
We also announced the first team sales for the Overwatch League, the first major global city-based professional eSports league. We have the very best teams with the very best resources dedicated to celebrating and rewarding the world's best professional Overwatch players. 
Overwatch, with more than 30 million players, has captured imaginations and driven strong global engagement. We organized our league around major cities, taking a proven model from competition in traditional sports. Our announced team owners and their locations, New England, New York, Los Angeles, Miami, Orlando, San Francisco, Shanghai and Seoul and the many more we expect to announce represents the very best in eSports and traditional sports. 
We continue to invest in improving our ability to execute and innovate across the company. This quarter we made some exciting additions to our management team to equip our company with the leadership we need to capitalize on the biggest opportunities we see ahead. Coddy Johnson rejoined the company as our new President and COO. Coddy proved himself as a transformational leader during the 8 years he previously spent with us, including as Chief Operating and Financial Officer of Activision Publishing, and we're excited that he's rejoining the company for this next growth phase of our business. 
Later you'll hear from Spencer Neumann in his new role as CFO, bringing a wealth of experience from a long career at The Walt Disney Company, most recently as Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President of Global Guest Experience of the Parks and Resorts division.
We're also joined by Thomas Tippl, our Vice Chairman; and Dennis Durkin, our Chief Corporate Officer, and all of our business unit heads. 
As always, our success is a result of the dedication of our players, fans, employees and partners, who we cannot thank enough for their enthusiasm and support. Coddy will now review the highlights of our operations for this quarter."

It's great to be back at Activision Blizzard at such an exciting time of growth and opportunity for the company. As Bobby mentioned, we have incredible communities of players and fans.

As Bobby mentioned, we have incredible communities of players and fans. The joy of our work, what we do each day, is to support our teams in building out some of the world's best creative environments and strongest commercial capabilities on behalf of these communities so that they can play, connect and engage as deeply as possible. When we get that right, we have the ability to serve our hundreds of millions of audience members with an ongoing stream of content, features, events and products that they love. 
The business strategy underlying that work is based on the 3 pillars you heard from Bobby. We invest in creative and commercial excellence in order to expand reach, deepen engagement and provide more opportunity for player investment, which then allows for reinvestment in creative and commercial excellence and for the growth cycle to continue. 
We saw this strategy work especially well this quarter, with our teams providing more regular content and feature updates across our franchises and our library, leading to our biggest first half of the year in company history with record revenues driven by digital growth. 
In Q2, our revenues exceeded our outlook by more than $200 million and earnings per share surpassed our expectations by $0.17. Given the size of our overperformance and confidence in our plans, we are raising our outlook for the year. 
Let's start with audience reach, which was 407 million monthly active users this quarter. Blizzard did not have any new full game releases this quarter, yet a strong stream of content updates across Blizzard franchises drove an all-time MAU record of 46 million, up 38% from last year and up 12% in the last quarter. Blizzard's community has now more than doubled in MAUs since early 2015, underscoring the ability to grow audience reach across the portfolio of platforms, regions, genres and business models. 
Notably, the Overwatch community continued to grow, with MAUs up each and every quarter since launch, and in Q2, they had another all-time MAU record with the release of 2 seasonal events. 
And Hearthstone's MAUs increased to an all-time record for the franchise, fueled by the new expansion Journey to Un‚ÄôGoro. 
Activision had 47 million MAUs for the quarter, driven by Call of Duty, which continues to have a large and active player base across the number of its titles, many of which received updates during the quarter. In particular, the release of Zombies Chronicles, Activision's first large content drop to a community in year 2 after game launch, helped to grow Call of Duty: Black Ops III MAUs quarter-over-quarter. 
Activision expects to expand the Call of Duty community this fall with the highly anticipated release of Call of Duty: WWII on November 3. And we see great momentum for WWII not only for key indicators like preorders, stated purchase intent and hands-on play feedback but also from more qualitative measures like video views, social sentiment and engagement, which are up year-over-year. 
We've just debuted Call of Duty: WWII Zombies mode, which is now our most liked zombies trailer ever. And we can't wait for players to experience the game during our upcoming Beta exclusively on PlayStation 4 on August 25 available for all those who preorder the game. 
Activision, along with partner Bungie, showcased the upcoming launch of Destiny 2 at multiple events this summer to great enthusiasm. We're excited that Destiny 2's PC version earned E3 Game Critics' PC Game of Show and even more excited that it will be on Blizzard's Battle.net, making it the first non-Blizzard game ever on their platform. Publishing on an owned platform will provide an enhanced player experience, better insights and better economics.  
With the PC Beta still to come, the Destiny 2 console Beta had more players than the first Destiny Beta and preorder levels are now above the first Destiny at this same point in time prelaunch. Destiny 2 full game preorders also have the highest digital mix in Activision's history. 
Finally, Activision's release of the remastered Crash Bandicoot for PS4 showed the powerful combination of our deep library of beloved IP and our team's ability to create great new content for our communities. The game is outperforming even our most optimistic expectations and was the #1 console title globally in June based on units. Notable given it was only available on one platform for 2 days in a month. 
Turning now to our second strategic pillar, engagement. Blizzard's focus on compelling in-game content led to all-time record DAUs in Q2 record playtime. In Overwatch, April's Uprising player-versus-environment game mode was well received with record playtime. And more recently, the May anniversary event drove strong engagement and record participation in customization items. 
Hearthstone's Journey to Un‚ÄôGoro was one of the best received expansions to date, with record DAUs. And World of Warcraft continues to benefit through more regular content updates that Blizzard adds in between major expansions. Time spent in the game is up year-over-year. The Legion expansion continues to outperform the last expansion, and Blizzard plans to release this quarter another large content drop, with more details to be revealed at Gamescom. 
King's MAUs were down year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. Numerous efforts are now underway to grow audience size, but these will take time as the team experiments with rich-driving initiatives and continues to develop new creative content for the community. 
We have, however, seen good success with our live ops and new features, which continue to drive strong engagement. As illustrated by the frequency with which players reengage each month, it remains at all-time high. To put this in perspective, the time spent per player per day inside King franchises is 35 minutes, higher than that of Instagram or Snapchat. 
Our groundbreaking initiatives in eSports drive engagement and celebrate our players and their achievement in new ways. We made strong progress this quarter on the Overwatch League, as Bobby already mentioned. That progress was a meaningful milestone toward establishing a lead-based professional competition at the standalone business. We now have the sustainable structure in which to invest for the long term, with the very best partners from traditional sports and from eSports. 
Blizzard also recently announced a live streaming media rights partnership which showed the value of our broadcast content. Just as importantly, though, the partnership carved out a number of future opportunities for media rights sales, including those related to the Overwatch League. 
Progress on Overwatch League also sets the stage for Activision's Call of Duty World League. With CWL, we'll wrap up a great season of competition with our upcoming championship event, and we are well positioned through upcoming seasons. 
Turning last to our third pillar, providing opportunity for player investment. In-game content continues to be a consistent driver for our business, delivering another $1 billion quarter for in-game purchases. King was the biggest contributor, with bookings per paying user rising for the eighth quarter in a row to a new record. Strong engagement and player investment led to an increase in mobile bookings both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. 
King continued to have 2 of the top 10 grossing games in the U.S. for the 15th quarter in a row, and King continues to develop a strong pipeline, with both new features across the live games portfolio, multiple new games ahead, including a promising publishing partnership with Playstudios in the social casino segment slated for release later this fall. 
King also continues to build out its advertising business, which we believe is an important long-term opportunity. We now have new industry-proven leadership in place driving the advertising business. The team is focused on the creation of premium video ad products that can improve player experience, deliver value to advertisers and create meaningful new revenue streams. 
Given the growth as the overall mobile advertising ecosystem and the relative brand safety of our network, in particular, we think this is a meaningful opportunity for the future. 
This quarter King also entered into a partnership with Facebook Audience Network for static display ad inventory. The partnership monetizes a portion of King's impression, while the team continues to work toward the long-term video ad opportunity. 
Both Activision and Blizzard also had a strong quarter for player investments. Call of Duty's Black Ops Zombies not only drove purchases of that specific piece of content at a recommended $30 price but also led to higher engagement, which in turn lets even more add-on purchases by our players. 
The strength of our strategy in providing great content wherever our fans engage can be seen in the fact that Call of Duty's in-game purchases were roughly in line with last year's record Q2 performance, all in the strength of great content provided across a number of Call of Duty titles. 
Blizzard experienced strong participation with in-game content for Overwatch and Hearthstone and also for the Diablo, as the Necromancer class, originally debuted in Diablo II, was introduced to Diablo III and embraced by the player community. 
Stepping back, the success of our ongoing stream of content, features, events and products to our communities, coupled with additional opportunities from our vast library, highlights a really strong model both for our fans and their enjoyment and for the company as a high-margin business. We have one of the largest catalogs of owned intellectual properties, including game titles that go back to their own [indiscernible]. And we have hundreds of millions of players in 196 countries, one of the largest digitally connected audiences in the world. This makes it an incredible time to be a part of Activision Blizzard. Our momentum, driven by our inspired teams enabling year-round engagement for our players, drives both near-term performance and future growth opportunities like eSports, ads, mobile and consumer products. 
Spence will now review our numbers in more detail."

I'm thrilled to be here with all of you today and to be part of the Activision Blizzard team. I come here with a deeper appreciation for the power of beloved global franchises that build enduring, emotional connections with the community. That's the foundation of Activision Blizzard, and it's why I believe we have such a bright future. 
Today I'll review our better-than-expected Q2 results, which capped off a record first half. I'll also review our outlook for Q3 and our raised outlook for the full year. 
To review the quarter, I would like to start with our segment results. As a reminder, our segment results, unlike our consolidated results, are still presented excluding the impact of deferrals, as they always have been. 
Each of our segments contributed to our overperformance this quarter. We outperformed our outlook due to the combined power of our franchise breadth, a steady stream of content serving our uniquely engaged community and our talented teams. 
At the aggregate level, we delivered combined segment operating income of $476 million, which as Bobby indicated, represents a record for a quarter without a new full game franchise release. 
Activision generated operating income of $87 million, roughly flat year-over-year, with strong Call of Duty performance across the overall franchise offsetting expected lower performance on Infinite Warfare. Our strategy of providing content wherever our players engage drove this upside. As with improved performance across Activision catalog, including a very positive reception to Crash Bandicoot. 
Blizzard's $225 million of operating income was the largest segment earnings contributor in the quarter, led by the strength of the Overwatch, World of Warcraft and Hearthstone franchises. Operating income was down year-over-year as expected, given the comp to last year's significant Q2 Overwatch release. 
And King delivered $164 million of operating income in the quarter, which was slightly down year-over-year but relatively flat sequentially. Continued growth in per player engagement and player investment led to stable year-over-year revenues for the Candy Crush franchise. 
Now let's turn to our consolidated results. Unless otherwise indicated, I'll be referencing non-GAAP as redefined figures, which include the impact of deferrals. If you'd like to calculate metrics as we used to report them, you would add the impact of deferrals to our non-GAAP as redefined figures. Please refer to our earnings release for full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations. 
For the quarter, we generated GAAP revenues of $1.63 billion, $206 million above our May guidance. This includes the net recognition of deferred revenues of $213 million for the quarter. 
We generated GAAP EPS of $0.32 and non-GAAP EPS of $0.55 in Q2, which was $0.17 above guidance. These figures include the net recognition of deferrals of $0.12. 
The overperformance in the quarter versus guidance was driven largely by business overperformance as well as some expense timing. 
From a capital structure perspective, we continued our positive rating agency momentum and received another upgrade from S&P to BBB. We also entered into a leverage-neutral $1.2 billion refinancing to lock in attractive long-term interest rates, bringing our blended cost of debt to 3.6% and provided a better staggering of debt maturities. 
We delivered Q2 operating cash flow of $265 million, finishing the quarter with approximately $3.3 billion in cash and investments, about 1/3 of which is held domestically. And approximately $4.4 billion of aggregate debt outstanding for a net debt position of approximately $1.2 billion at quarter end. 
Lastly, we paid a cash dividend of $0.30 per common share, which was up 15% year-over-year for a total $226 million in aggregate to shareholders of record as of March 30, 2017. 
Now let's turn to our slate and outlook for Q3. Our Q3 slate continues our strategy of delivering a steady stream of content and services to our community including Blizzard's Hearthstone expansion, Knights of the Frozen throne, additional maps for Activision's Infinite Warfare and new features and live ops across King titles. 
In addition, Blizzard is launching a remastered version of the original StarCraft on August 14. This will offer new and veteran players the same classic StarCraft game play with 4k graphics, modern conveniences like cloud saves, and connectivity to Blizzard's updated Battle.net ecosystem for an enhanced social and competitive experience. 
And of course, Activision has 2 major releases in the back half of the year, the launch of Destiny 2 on console on September 6 with the PC launch to follow on October 24. 
We'll also continue the marketing ramp for the November 3 release of Call of Duty: WWII. 
For Q3 on a GAAP basis, we expect net revenues of $1.385 billion, including GAAP deferrals of $315 million, product cost of 23% and operating expenses of 67%. We expect GAAP interest expense of $41 million, a tax rate of 30%, GAAP and non-GAAP share count of $766 million and GAAP EPS of $0.09. 
For Q3, on a non-GAAP as redefined basis, we expect product cost of 23% and operating expenses of 49%. We expect non-GAAP interest expense of $40 million, a tax rate of 25% and non-GAAP EPS of $0.34, including a GAAP deferral of $0.11. 
And just to remind everyone, if you'd like to calculate non-GAAP metrics as we used to report them, you'd start with our non-GAAP as redefined EPS guidance of $0.34 and add the impact of deferrals for $0.11. 
Before I turn to our 2017 outlook, I'd like to provide some detail on the impact of the Overwatch League. With the recently announced sale of 7 teams, we do expect some revenue upside to Q4, but it will be modest given the recognition of team sale proceeds over multiple years. 
Further, from an operating income perspective, the revenue recognition of team sales will be partially offset by the investment required to launch the league, including inaugural season marketing. 
As we look ahead to the first season, we see a number of important upcoming milestones, including standing up league operations, supporting teams  development of player rosters, attracting sponsors, elevating the viewer experience and securing media distribution. We're investing in this league for the long term. Overtime we expect to recognize additional revenues related to both more team sales and multiple league revenue streams. We see this as a substantial long-term value driver for the business. 
 
Now turning to our raised 2017 full year outlook, which passes through business overperformance from Q2 and now includes the Overwatch League's modest revenue contribution and roughly breakeven EPS contribution. 
On a GAAP basis, we expect revenues of $6.4 billion, including GAAP deferrals of $175 million; product cost of 22% and operating expenses of 60%. Our GAAP interest expense is expected to be $174 million. And our GAAP tax rate is expected to be 16%. We expect 767 million fully diluted shares both for GAAP and non-GAAP redefined, and GAAP EPS is expected to be $1.05. 
For 2017, on a non-GAAP basis, as redefined, we expect product cost of 22% and operating expenses of 45%. We expect non-GAAP interest expense of $156 million, a tax rate of 24% and non-GAAP EPS of $1.94, including a GAAP deferral of $0.06. 
And if you would like to calculate non-GAAP metrics as we used to report them, you would start with our non-GAAP as redefined EPS guidance at $1.94 and add the impact of deferrals or $0.06. 
In closing, I just want to echo Bobby and Coddy's sentiment. This is such an exciting time in Activision Blizzard. By delivering engaging content, features and services to our community, including in-game content and remastered IP from unparalleled library, we can increasingly generate digital, recurring, high-margin revenue opportunities. Our core games business has never been stronger and it's also powering future growth vectors eSports, advertising, consumer products, TV and film and mobile. We believe we have tremendous opportunities ahead of us, and as always, we remain focused on rigorous prioritization, operational excellence, fiscal discipline and long-term shareholder value. 
Now I welcome our business leaders, Eric, Mike, Riccardo, Dennis and Thomas as they join us for the Q&A portion of the call. Operator?"

And when you think about that we have planned in terms of the next round of team announcements, that will continue the momentum. That to me was the biggest milestone was getting that great blend of endemic teams and professionals, sports owners. And if you think about whether it's in tech or in eSports or in professional sports, we're assembling the very best owners for all these sports. We've announced the first 7. And I think what you're going to see is that probably the most important milestones are as we get towards the latter part of the year and we start to kick off competition, when you see what we're doing in terms of broadcast rights and sponsorship opportunities. But from every perspective, I think we think we've organized the league in the best way that will allow us to celebrate our players and our fans. And if you think about over 30 million players today, this is a very large audience even if your spectators, were only coming from your player population. That is a very, very large audience to be able to have advertisers and sponsors and partner support. So I'd say we're off to a really great start, and you'll hear more about future team sales over the balance of the year. But we couldn't be happier with the progress that we've made so far, and it's really exciting."

So the Beta went great, and there's a lot of excitement about Destiny 2 overall and a lot of positive signs pretty much anyway you look. First of all, we have a tremendous amount of confidence in the game. As disclosed, we think it's going to be a great game. And we received almost universally positive feedback from both the press and the fans after people got their hands on the Beta. And I think it's also worth noting that Destiny won 45 awards at E3, and we're continuing to close strong. We also have very strong preorders, and Coddy mentioned this broadly, but the specifics are the #1 position on Nielsen's unaided awareness and next choice purchase intent. And while no one of those data points is ever predicted in a vacuum, we found that when you have all 3 of those trending positively, it's usually a very good thing. And then there are also several first in Destiny 2, the way we're going to market that are designed to bring the franchise to a broader audience, starting with the fact that we've got a great PC game. Of those 45 awards, 1 of them was the official best of show for PC at E3. We've actually added a number of languages and localizations to make the game more appealing and accessible to more audiences around the world. And of course, I think our watershed partnership with Blizzard is going to bring Destiny 2 to the most passionate PC fans anywhere in the world, so it puts us on the best possible stage. And finally, maybe most importantly with a game like this, Destiny is so engaging that the follow-on content is almost as important, if not as important, as the main game. And as I mentioned on earlier calls we've completed changed our approach to tapping that by widening our stable of AAA developers so that we can keep up with the demand -- it's a high-class problem, but we haven't been able to do that in the past -- keep up the demand for more content. And I think that fans agree with the importance of that, which is evidenced by the fact that such an overwhelmingly high percentage of the preorders thus far are for one of our elevated SKUs, which include the Season Pass on the following content. So lots of good signs, the Beta being just one of them. And we're really excited and have confidence we have a great game."

So when we think about our network, we think primarily about audience reach and audience engagement and we're focused on increasing both. In the live games, we have been primarily focused on increasing the audience engagement, and we have done this through fresh content, new features and live operations. And we have seen great results, with the impact reflected in the high DAU and MAU ratio as well as in the retention of the most engaged players. And this has resulted in an increase and a continued increase of our player monetization. Candy Crush, which is a title, which is now 5 years old, has recently hit again the #1 grossing in the U.S. App Store charts. And we also see great results in our other live games. In regards to audience reach, we think we have more work to do. And this will take some more time, but they are very focused on it. The audience reach, we know that we can -- impact the impact the audience reach with new titles. Here we have our teams focused on developing multiple new titles for the long term, in particular, focusing strategically first of all on our casual genre for our existing audience. But we're also looking at expanding into new genres, in particular, mid-core. Here we have, of course, big opportunities within the company, the wider company, and we are exploring mobile opportunities for some of the company's existing powerhouse franchises like the partnership we have announced recently with Activision Publishing for Call of Duty. In the near term we're also working on a social casino title in partnership with Playstudios, and we expect to release this title by the end of the year. In regards to audience reach, we also believe that there are opportunities to stabilize and grow the audience reach in the live games. The teams so far have been focused on engagement and monetization features, and they will continue to focus on engagement and monetization features, where we've been successful. But we will also start focusing more on features that can impact reach as well."

So we're really deliberate in structuring this business to attract the best owners and players in order to position the league, the Overwatch League for long-term success. And that starts with optimizing alignment between the league, which we own, with the teams and our players. So at the league level, we're establishing a pool of shared league-wide revenues composed of media rights and consumer products, league-level sponsorship and a portion of league-related digital and game  merchandise. And then we'll net those league costs, like marketing and production and league operations, against those revenue streams and share the resulting amount, 50-50 between the league and the teams. And then at the team level, we've got these fantastic entrepreneurial owners, and we want to be sure we develop the structure that enable those owners to not only fund player and team operations but also create real incremental value at the local level. So in addition to their league participation, the teams have their own local revenue streams, including the more traditional areas like ticket sales and concessions and local sponsorships and local merch sales. But they will also have more unique opportunities such as the ability to host certain nonprofessional Overwatch matches. And so -- and then lastly, when we think about the players, we establish minimum salaries, benefits and bonuses for our players so that we're providing a security and stability required to attract the best talent on the planet. So I guess that we step back. We position the league and team owners to invest alongside one another, to build value at both league and the local level, leveraging the capabilities in infrastructure that we each bring to bear for the benefit of our players and our fans. So we've got plenty of work to do here, and we're getting ready for the launch later this year. We look forward to sharing more progress soon."

But I think it's also perhaps first, important to step back and look at the Call of Duty franchise overall, which remains incredibly strong. We had strong MAUs this quarter, with audiences at a relevant scale across multiple titles. And importantly, despite the headwinds that we've talked about on IW, both MAUs and OI are both in line with our record Q2 performance from last year despite those headwinds. So our strategy of bringing content and adding content wherever our players choose to play is really paying off. And I think that's what drove the positive performance referenced in the quarter. We had Infinite Warfare and Modern Warfare Remastered. We continue to [ see ] the content that was scheduled for those. We also brought the Zombies Chronicles, which Coddy mentioned, which is a remaster of some of our most beloved content from the Black Ops Zombies canon. And that also speaks to the strength of the catalog and our ability to continue to delight fans with new versions of that. So it really does speak to the size and strength and stability of Call of Duty, that we can do this across multiple titles. And I can't think of another franchise that can. On WWII specifically, probably most importantly, we think we have the right game at the right time. And I can tell you that those who have played it, the return to boots on the ground, the return to human scale, authentic military content and context for the franchises is a welcome change and very well timed. And everything that fans have touched, which that by the way, is a lot more than usual. We had multiplayer hands-on at E3 for only the second time in our history this year. Everything that consumers have put their hands on, we've have gotten really positive response from fans as well as from critics. And there's a couple of data points, which showed that. First of all, the reveal trailer was the most liked video in Call of Duty history, and we've got a pretty great history with that. And we have the most organic views of any COD reveal trailer ever. The hands-on multiplayer at E3 was well received in the Zombies trailer that revealed at Comic-Con went on to become our most liked Zombies trailer ever, with an overwhelmingly positive sentiment as well. So the good news is you don't have to take my word for any of these. Our Beta starts on August 25 on PlayStation, and I hope all of you are going to join us and play."

But we have no idea -- it's hard to tell whether that's a vocal minority or whether that's a real mass audience until you put something out there. And Crash just surpassed all of our expectations by a pretty wide margin. And a couple of stats that underscore that point were that it was the #1 selling console game in June based on units. You know it was only available for 2 days during that month. And Sony reported this morning -- well timed, I guess, for this call -- that Crash is the most downloaded game on the PlayStation store in July. So as to your broader question, I think this is just another example of us really listening to our communities and our fans and offering them great content where the want to engage, which is one of our core strategies. So we think we have other great IP in our portfolio that we're considering, of course, but we've already -- this isn't new behavior for us. We've already shown the power of this with Modern Warfare Remastered last year, with Zombies Chronicles that we talked about. Obviously, Crash Bandicoot is another great example. So this is a strategy that clearly has our attention, and while there are no new announcements today, I think you can be confident that there will be more activity like this in the future with more great IP. The other opportunity beyond remasters is to look at some of our classic IP and ask whether or not it could be reborn on a new platform like what we're doing with Skylanders on mobile. So that our IP library is an asset that when done right can be very powerful."

On this call and in the future, unless otherwise specified, we will continue to provide non-GAAP financial measures which exclude the impact of expenses related to stock-based compensation; the amortization of intangible assets; expenses, including legal fees, costs, expenses and accruals related to acquisitions, including the acquisition of King Digital Entertainment; expenses related to debt financings and refinancings; restructuring charges and the associated tax benefits.

We exceeded our prior outlook and delivered record first half revenues. The engagement of our communities remains strong, and we believe our momentum can continue through the rest of the year. 
Our success continues to be the result of our focus on our players and our audiences. Investing in creative and commercial excellence is framed by the 3 pillars we have shared with you before: one, expand our reach; two, deepen engagements; and three, provide more opportunity for player investment. 
Our teams work tirelessly to deliver the most immersive and engaging experiences for our players. This content provides the connection between hundreds of millions of players around the world. 
We then enhance these connections with our franchises through initiatives like eSports, television and film and now consumer products. These additional touch points create more value for our shareholders by creating value and engagement for our audiences. 
Here are some of the ways we created value for our audiences this quarter. We released new updates across many of our leading franchises this quarter, driving engagement and delivering nearly $0.5 billion of segment operating income, the most we've achieved in a single quarter without new full game releases for any franchise. 
We also announced the first team sales for the Overwatch League, the first major global city-based professional eSports league. We have the very best teams with the very best resources, dedicated to celebrating and rewarding the world's best professional Overwatch players. 
Overwatch, with more than 30 million players, has captured imaginations and driven strong global engagement. We organized our league around major cities, taking the proven model from competition in traditional sports. Our announced team owners and their locations, New England, New York, Los Angeles, Miami, Orlando, San Francisco, Shanghai and Seoul, and the many more we expect to announce, represent the very best in eSports and traditional sports. 
We continue to invest in improving our ability to execute and innovate across the company. This quarter, we made some exciting additions to our management team to equip our company with the leadership we need to capitalize on the biggest opportunities we see ahead. Coddy Johnson rejoined the company as our new President and COO. Coddy proved himself as a transformational leader during the 8 years he previously spent with us, including as Chief Operating and Financial Officer of Activision Publishing, and we're very excited that he's rejoined the company for this next growth phase of our business. 
Later you'll hear from Spencer Neumann in his new role as CFO, bringing a wealth of experience from a long career at The Walt Disney Company, most recently as Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President of Global Guest Experience of the Parks and Resorts division.
We're also joined by Thomas Tippl, our Vice Chairman; and Dennis Durkin, our Chief Corporate Officer, and all of our business unit heads. 
As always, our success is the result of the dedication of our players, fans, employees and partners, who we cannot thank enough for their enthusiasm and support. Coddy will now review the highlights of our operations for this quarter."
4222231,529779636,1267034,"Activision Blizzard, Inc., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2017",2017-08-03,"Earnings Calls","Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Bobby. It's great to be back at Activision Blizzard at such an exciting time of growth and opportunity for the company. As Bobby mentioned, we have incredible communities of players and fans.

As Bobby mentioned, we have incredible communities of players and fans. The joy of our work, what we do each day, is to support our teams in building out some of the world's best creative environments and strongest commercial capabilities on behalf of those communities so that they can play, connect and engage as deeply as possible. When we get that right, we have the ability to serve our hundreds of millions of audience members with an ongoing stream of content, features, events and products that they love. 
The business strategy underlying that work is based on the 3 pillars you heard from Bobby. We invest in creative and commercial excellence in order to expand reach, deepen engagement and provide more opportunity for player investment, which then allows for reinvestment in creative and commercial excellence and for the growth cycle to continue. 
We saw this strategy work especially well this quarter, with our teams providing more regular content and feature updates across our franchises and our library, leading to our biggest first half of the year in company history, with record revenues driven by digital growth. 
In Q2, our revenues exceeded our outlook by more than $200 million and earnings per share surpassed our expectations by $0.17. Given this sizeable overperformance and confidence in our plans, we are raising our outlook for the year. 
Let's start with audience reach, which was 407 million monthly active users this quarter. Blizzard did not have any new full game releases this quarter, yet a strong stream of content updates across Blizzard franchises drove an all-time MAU record of 46 million, up 38% from last year and up 12% from the last quarter. Blizzard's community has now more than doubled in MAUs since early 2015, underscoring the ability to grow audience reach across the portfolio of platforms, regions, genres and business models. 
Notably, the Overwatch community continued to grow, with MAUs up each and every quarter since launch, and in Q2, they had another all-time MAU record with the release of 2 seasonal events. 
And Hearthstone MAUs increased to an all-time record for the franchise, fueled by the new expansion Journey to Un‚ÄôGoro. 
Activision had 47 million MAUs for the quarter, driven by Call of Duty, which continues to have a large and active player base across a number of its titles, many of which received updates during the quarter. In particular, the release of Zombies Chronicles, Activision's first large content drop to a community in year 2 after game launch, helped to grow Call of Duty: Black Ops III MAUs quarter-over-quarter. 
Activision expects to expand the Call of Duty community this fall with the highly anticipated release of Call of Duty: WWII on November 3. And we see great momentum for WWII, not only from key indicators like preorders, stated purchase intent and hands-on player feedback, but also from more qualitative measures like video views, social sentiment and engagement, which are up year-over-year. 
We've just debuted Call of Duty: WWII Zombies mode, which is now our most-liked Zombies trailer ever. And we can't wait for players to experience the game during our upcoming beta exclusively on PlayStation 4 on August 25, available for all those who preorder the game. 
Activision, along with partner Bungie, showcased the upcoming launch of Destiny 2 at multiple events this summer to great enthusiasm. We're excited that Destiny 2's PC version earned E3 Game Critics' PC Game of Show and even more excited that it will be on Blizzard's Battle.net, making it the first non-Blizzard game ever on their platform. Publishing on an owned platform will provide an enhanced player experience, better insights and better economics.  
With the PC beta still to come, the Destiny 2 console beta had more players than the first Destiny beta and preorder levels are now above the first Destiny at this same point in time prelaunch. Destiny 2 full-game preorders also have the highest digital mix in Activision's history. 
Finally, Activision's release of the remastered Crash Bandicoot for PS4 showed the powerful combination of our deep library of beloved IP and our team's ability to create great new content for our communities. The game is outperforming even our most optimistic expectations and was the #1 console title globally in June based on units. Notable given it was only available on one platform for 2 days in the month. 
Turning now to our second strategic pillar, engagement. Blizzard's focus on compelling in-game content led to all-time record DAUs and Q2 record playtime. In Overwatch, April's Uprising player-versus-environment game mode was well received with record playtime. And more recently, the May anniversary event drove strong engagement and record participation in customization items. 
Hearthstone's Journey to Un‚ÄôGoro was one of the best received expansions to date, with record DAUs. And World of Warcraft continues to benefit from more regular content updates that Blizzard adds in between major expansions. Time spent in the game is up year-over-year. The Legion expansion continues to outperform the last expansion, and Blizzard plans to release this quarter another large content drop, with more details to be revealed at Gamescom. 
King's MAUs were down year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. Numerous efforts are now underway to grow audience size, but these will take time as the team experiments with reach-driving initiatives and continues to develop new creative content for the community. 
We have, however, seen good success with our live ops and new features, which continue to drive strong engagement, as illustrated by the frequency with which players reengage each month, which remains at an all-time high. To put this in perspective, the time spent per player per day inside King franchises is 35 minutes, higher than that of Instagram or Snapchat. 
Our groundbreaking initiatives in eSports drive engagement and celebrate our players and their achievement in new ways. We made strong progress this quarter on the Overwatch League, as Bobby already mentioned. That progress was a meaningful milestone toward establishing a league-based professional competition as a stand-alone business. We now have the sustainable structure in which to invest for the long term, with the very best partners from traditional sports and from eSports. 
Blizzard also recently announced a live streaming media rights partnership, which showed the value of our broadcast content. Just as importantly, though, the partnership carved out a number of future opportunities for media rights sales, including those related to the Overwatch League. 
Progress on the Overwatch League also sets the stage for Activision's Call of Duty World League. With CWL, we'll wrap up a great season of competition with our upcoming championship event, and we are well positioned through upcoming seasons. 
Turning last to our third pillar, providing opportunity for player investment. In-game content continues to be a consistent driver for our business, delivering another $1 billion quarter for in-game purchases. King was the biggest contributor, with bookings per paying user rising for the eighth quarter in a row to a new record. Strong engagement and player investment led to an increase in mobile bookings both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. 
King continued to have 2 of the top 10 grossing games in the U.S. for the 15th quarter in a row, and King continues to develop a strong pipeline, with both new features across their live games portfolio, multiple new games ahead, including a promising publishing partnership with Playstudios in the social casino segment slated for release later this fall. 
King also continues to build out its advertising business, which we believe is an important long-term opportunity. We now have new industry-proven leadership in place driving the advertising business. The team is focused on the creation of premium video ad products that can improve player experience, deliver value to advertisers and create meaningful new revenue streams. 
Given the growth of the overall mobile advertising ecosystem and the relative brand safety of our network, in particular, we think this is a meaningful opportunity for the future. 
This quarter, King also entered into a partnership with Facebook Audience Network for its static display ad inventory. The partnership monetizes a portion of King's impressions, while the team continues to work toward the long-term video ad opportunity. 
Both Activision and Blizzard also had a strong quarter for player investments. Call of Duty's Black Ops Zombies not only drove purchases of that specific piece of content at a recommended $30 price but also led to higher engagement, which in turn led to even more add-on purchases by our players. 
The strength of our strategy in providing great content wherever our fans engage can be seen in the fact that Call of Duty's in-game purchases were roughly in line with last year's record Q2 performance, all on the strength of great content provided across a number of Call of Duty titles. 
Blizzard experienced strong participation with in-game content for Overwatch and Hearthstone and also for Diablo, as the Necromancer class, originally debuted in Diablo II, was introduced to Diablo III and embraced by the player community. 
Stepping back, the success of our ongoing stream of content, features, events and products to our communities, coupled with additional opportunities from our vast library, highlights a really strong model, both for our fans and their enjoyment and for the company as a high-margin business. We have one of the largest catalogs of owned intellectual properties, including game titles that go back to the [indiscernible]. And we have hundreds of millions of players in 196 countries, one of the largest digitally connected audiences in the world. This makes it an incredible time to be a part of Activision Blizzard. Our momentum, driven by our inspired teams enabling year-round engagement for our players, drives both near-term performance and future growth opportunities like eSports, ads, mobile and consumer products. 
Spence will now review our numbers in more detail."

I'm thrilled to be here with all of you today and to be part of the Activision Blizzard team. I come here with a deep appreciation for the power of beloved global franchises that build enduring, emotional connections with the community. That's the foundation of Activision Blizzard, and it's why I believe we have such a bright future. 
Today I'll review our better-than-expected Q2 results, which capped off a record first half. I'll also review our outlook for Q3 and our raised outlook for the full year. 
To review the quarter, I would like to start with our segment results. As a reminder, our segment results, unlike our consolidated results, are still presented excluding the impact of deferrals, as they always have been. 
Each of our segments contributed to our overperformance this quarter. We outperformed our outlook due to the combined power of our franchise breadth, a steady stream of content serving our uniquely engaged community and our talented teams. 
At the aggregate level, we delivered combined segment operating income of $476 million, which as Bobby indicated, represents a record for a quarter without a new full game franchise release. 
Activision generated operating income of $87 million, roughly flat year-over-year, with strong Call of Duty performance across the overall franchise offsetting expected lower performance on Infinite Warfare. Our strategy of providing content wherever our players engage drove this upside, as did improved performance across Activision's catalog, including a very positive reception to Crash Bandicoot. 
Blizzard's $225 million of operating income was the largest segment earnings contributor in the quarter, led by the strength of the Overwatch, World of Warcraft and Hearthstone franchises. Operating income was down year-over-year as expected, given the comp to last year's significant Q2 Overwatch release. 
And King delivered $164 million of operating income in the quarter, which was slightly down year-over-year but relatively flat sequentially. Continued growth in per-player engagement and player investment led to stable year-over-year revenues for the Candy Crush franchise. 
Now let's turn to our consolidated results. Unless otherwise indicated, I'll be referencing non-GAAP as-redefined figures, which include the impact of deferrals. If you'd like to calculate metrics as we used to report them, you would add the impact of deferrals to our non-GAAP as-redefined figures. Please refer to our earnings release for full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations. 
For the quarter, we generated GAAP revenues of $1.63 billion, $206 million above our May guidance. This includes the net recognition of deferred revenues of $213 million for the quarter. 
We generated GAAP EPS of $0.32 and non-GAAP EPS of $0.55 in Q2, which was $0.17 above guidance. These figures include the net recognition of deferrals of $0.12. 
The overperformance in the quarter versus guidance was driven largely by business overperformance as well as some expense timing. 
From a capital structure perspective, we continued our positive rating agency momentum and received another upgrade from S&P to BBB. We also entered into a leverage-neutral $1.2 billion refinancing to lock in attractive long-term interest rates, bringing our blended cost of debt to 3.6% and provided a better staggering of debt maturities. 
We delivered Q2 operating cash flow of $265 million, finishing the quarter with approximately $3.3 billion in cash and investments, about 1/3 of which is held domestically; and approximately $4.4 billion of aggregate debt outstanding for a net debt position of approximately $1.2 billion at quarter-end. 
Lastly, we paid a cash dividend of $0.30 per common share, which was up 15% year-over-year, for a total $226 million in aggregate to shareholders of record as of March 30, 2017. 
Now let's turn to our slate and outlook for Q3. Our Q3 slate continues our strategy of delivering a steady stream of content and services to our community, including Blizzard's Hearthstone expansion, Knights of the Frozen Throne, additional maps for Activision's Infinite Warfare and new features and live ops across King titles. 
In addition, Blizzard is launching a remastered version of the original StarCraft on August 14. This will offer new and veteran players the same classic StarCraft game play with 4k graphics, modern conveniences like cloud saves, and connectivity to Blizzard's updated Battle.net ecosystem for an enhanced social and competitive experience. 
And of course, Activision has 2 major releases in the back half of the year: the launch of Destiny 2 on console on September 6 with the PC launch to follow on October 24. 
We'll also continue the marketing ramp for the November 3 release of Call of Duty: WWII. 
For Q3 on a GAAP basis, we expect net revenues of $1.385 billion, including GAAP deferrals of $315 million, product cost of 23% and operating expenses of 67%. We expect GAAP interest expense of $41 million, a tax rate of 30%, GAAP and non-GAAP share count of 766 million and GAAP EPS of $0.09. 
For Q3, on a non-GAAP as-redefined basis, we expect product cost of 23% and operating expenses of 49%. We expect non-GAAP interest expense of $40 million, a tax rate of 25% and non-GAAP EPS of $0.34, including a GAAP deferral of $0.11. 
And just to remind everyone, if you'd like to calculate non-GAAP metrics as we used to report them, you'd start with our non-GAAP as-redefined EPS guidance of $0.34 and add the impact of deferrals or $0.11. 
Before I turn to our 2017 outlook, I'd like to provide some detail on the impact of the Overwatch League. With the recently announced sale of 7 teams, we do expect some revenue upside to Q4, but it will be modest given the recognition of team sale proceeds over multiple years. 
Further, from an operating income perspective, the revenue recognition of team sales will be partially offset by the investment required to launch the league, including inaugural season marketing. 
As we look ahead to the first season, we see a number of important upcoming milestones, including standing up league operations, supporting teams development of player rosters, attracting sponsors, elevating the viewer experience and securing media distribution. We're investing in this league for the long term. Over time, we expect to recognize additional revenues related to both more team sales and multiple league revenue streams. We see this as a substantial long-term value driver for the business. 
 
Now turning to our raised 2017 full year outlook, which passes through business overperformance from Q2 and now includes the Overwatch League's modest revenue contribution and roughly breakeven EPS contribution. 
On a GAAP basis, we expect revenues of $6.4 billion, including GAAP deferrals of $175 million; product cost of 22% and operating expenses of 60%. Our GAAP interest expense is expected to be $174 million. And our GAAP tax rate is expected to be 16%. We expect 767 million fully diluted shares both for GAAP and non-GAAP redefined, and GAAP EPS is expected to be $1.05. 
For 2017, on a non-GAAP basis, as redefined, we expect product cost of 22% and operating expenses of 45%. We expect non-GAAP interest expense of $156 million, a tax rate of 24% and non-GAAP EPS of $1.94, including a GAAP deferral of $0.06. 
And if you would like to calculate non-GAAP metrics as we used to report them, you would start with our non-GAAP as-redefined guidance at $1.94 and add the impact of deferrals or $0.06. 
In closing, I just want to echo Bobby and Coddy's sentiment. This is such an exciting time at Activision Blizzard. By delivering engaging content, features and services to our community, including in-game content and remastered IP from our unparalleled library, we can increasingly generate digital, recurring, high-margin revenue opportunities. Our core games business has never been stronger and it's also powering future growth vectors like eSports, advertising, consumer products, TV and film and mobile. We believe we have tremendous opportunities ahead of us, and as always, we remain focused on rigorous prioritization, operational excellence, fiscal discipline and long-term shareholder value.

And if you think about whether it's in tech or in eSports or in professional sports, we're assembling the very best owners for all of eSports. We've announced the first 7.

But from every perspective, I think we think we've organized the league in the best way that will allow us to celebrate our players and our fans. And if you think about over 30 million players today, this is a very large audience. Even if your spectators were only coming from your player population, that is a very, very large audience to be able to have advertisers and sponsors and partners for.

First of all, we have a tremendous amount of confidence in the game. As it's closing, we think it's going to be a great game. And we received almost universally positive feedback from both the press and the fans after people got their hands on the beta. And I think it's also worth noting that Destiny won 45 awards at E3, and we're continuing to close strong. We also have very strong preorders, and Coddy mentioned this broadly, but the specifics are the #1 position on Nielsen's unaided awareness and next-choice purchase intent. And while no one of those data points is ever predictive in a vacuum, we found that when you have all 3 of those trending positively, it's usually a very good thing. And then there are also several firsts in Destiny 2, the way we're going to market, that are designed to bring the franchise to a broader audience, starting with the fact that we've got a great PC game. Of those 45 awards, 1 of them was the official Best of Show for PC at E3. We've actually added a number of languages and localizations to make the game more appealing and accessible to more audiences around the world. And of course, I think our watershed partnership with Blizzard is going to bring Destiny to the most passionate PC fans anywhere in the world, so it puts it on the best possible stage. And finally, maybe most importantly with a game like this, Destiny is so engaging that the follow-on content is almost as important, if not as important, as the main game. And as I mentioned on earlier calls, we've completely changed our approach to tapping that by widening our stable of AAA developers so that we can keep up with the demand -- it's a high-class problem, but we haven't been able to do that in the past -- keep up with the demand for more content. And I think that fans agree with the importance of that, which is evidenced by the fact that such an overwhelmingly high percentage of the preorders thus far are for one of our elevated SKUs, which include the Season Pass and the follow-on content. So lots of good signs, the beta being just one of them. And we're really excited and have confidence we have a great game."

So when we think about our network, we think primarily about audience reach and audience engagement, and we're focused on increasing both. In the live games, we have been primarily focused on increasing the audience engagement, and we have done this through fresh content, new features and live operations. And we have seen great results, with the impact reflected in the high DAU and MAU ratio as well as in the retention of the most engaged players. And this has resulted in an increase and a continued increase of our player monetization. Candy Crush, which is a title which is now 5 years old, has recently hit again the #1 grossing in the U.S. App Store charts. And we also see great results in our other live games. In regards to audience reach, we think we have more work to do. And this will take some more time, but they are very focused on it. The audience reach, we know that we can impact the audience reach with new titles. Here, we have our teams focused on developing multiple new titles for the long term, in particular, focusing strategically, first of all, on our casual genre for our existing audience. But we're also looking at expanding into new genres, in particular, [ mid-core ]. Here we have, of course, big opportunities within the company, the wider company, and we are exploring mobile opportunities for some of the company's existing powerhouse franchises like the partnership we have announced recently with Activision Publishing for Call of Duty. In the near term we're also working on a social casino title in partnership with Playstudios, and we expect to release this title by the end of the year. In regards to audience reach, we also believe that there are opportunities to stabilize and grow the audience reach in the live games. The teams so far have been focused on engagement and monetization features, and they will continue to focus on engagement and monetization features, where we've been successful. But we will also start focusing more on features that can impact reach as well."

So we were really deliberate in structuring this business to attract the best owners and players in order to position the league, the Overwatch League for long-term success. And that starts with optimizing alignment between the league, which we own, with the teams and our players. So at the league level, we're establishing a pool of shared league-wide revenues composed of media rights and consumer products, league-level sponsorship and a portion of league-related digital and game merchandise. And then we'll net those league costs, like marketing and production and league operations, against those revenue streams and share the resulting amount 50-50 between the league and the teams. And then at the team level, we've got these fantastic entrepreneurial owners, and we wanted to be sure we developed the structure that enabled those owners to not only fund player and team operations but also create real incremental value at the local level. So in addition to their league participation, the teams have their own local revenue streams, including the more traditional areas like ticket sales and concessions and local sponsorships and local merch sales. But they will also have more unique opportunities such as the ability to host certain nonprofessional Overwatch matches. And so -- and then lastly, when we think about the players, we established minimum salaries, benefits and bonuses for our players so that we're providing the security and stability required to attract the best talent on the planet. So I guess if we step back, we positioned the league and team owners to invest alongside one another, to build value at both the league and the local level, leveraging the capabilities and infrastructure that we each bring to bear for the benefit of our players and our fans. So we've got plenty of work to do here, and we're getting ready for the launch later this year. We look forward to sharing more progress soon."

But I think it's also perhaps, first, important to step back and look at the Call of Duty franchise overall, which remains incredibly strong. We had strong MAUs this quarter, with audiences at a relevant scale across multiple titles. And importantly, despite the headwinds that we've talked about on IW, both MAUs and OI are both in line with our record Q2 performance from last year despite those headwinds. So our strategy of bringing content and adding content wherever our players choose to play is really paying off. And I think that's what drove the positive performance you referenced in the quarter. We had Infinite Warfare and Modern Warfare Remastered. We continued [ to season ] the content that was scheduled for those. We also brought the Zombies Chronicles, which Coddy mentioned, which is a remaster of some of our most beloved content from the Black Ops Zombies canon. And that also speaks to the strength of that catalog and our ability to continue to delight fans with new versions of that. So it really does speak to the size and strength and stability of Call of Duty, that we can do this across multiple titles. And I can't think of another franchise that can. On WWII specifically, probably most importantly, we think we have the right game at the right time. And I can tell you that those who have played it, the return to boots on the ground, the return to human scale, authentic military content and context for the franchise is a welcome change and very well timed. And everything that fans have touched, which by the way, is a lot more than usual. We had multiplayer hands-on at E3 for only the second time in our history this year. Everything that consumers have put their hands on, we've have gotten really positive response from fans as well as from critics. And there's a couple of data points which show that. First of all, the reveal trailer was the most liked video in Call of Duty history, and we've got a pretty great history with that. And we had the most organic views of any COD reveal trailer ever. The hands-on multiplayer at E3 was well received and the Zombies trailer that we revealed at Comic-Con went on to become our most-liked Zombies trailer ever, with an overwhelmingly positive sentiment as well. So the good news is you don't have to take my word for any of this. Our beta starts on August 25 on PlayStation, and I hope all of you are going to join us and play."

In addition to supporting all of our live games, we're committed to incubating new initiatives. And we're also thinking about different platforms, especially mobile. In terms of new IP, our pipeline is in a better position than ever before in our history. Last year, Allen Adham, who cofounded Blizzard with me and Frank Pearce, returned to the company to take on the task of coordinating our efforts in this regard. And this includes some great ideas that we already started to explore. So we now have multiple dedicated incubation teams that are being led by some of our most experienced game designers at Blizzard. I should say that creating new Blizzard quality games on any platform will take time. And as we've shown in the past, we're not going to release any games that we don't feel live up to our expectations or those of our players.

So first, we knew that there was a passionate audience out there for Crash. Full disclosure, myself among them. But we had no idea -- it's hard to tell whether that's a vocal minority or whether that's a real mass audience until you put something out there. And Crash just surpassed all of our expectations by a pretty wide margin. And a couple of stats that underscore that point were that it was the #1 selling console game in June based on units, even though it was only available for 2 days during that month. And Sony reported this morning -- well timed, I guess, for this call -- that Crash was the most downloaded game on the PlayStation store in July. So as to your broader question, I think this is just another example of us really listening to our communities and our fans and offering them great content where the want to engage, which is one of our core strategies. So we think we have other great IP in our portfolio that we're considering, of course, but we've already -- this isn't new behavior for us. We've already shown the power of this with Modern Warfare Remastered last year, with Zombies Chronicles that we talked about. Obviously, Crash Bandicoot is another great example. So this is a strategy that clearly has our attention, and while there are no new announcements today, I think you can be confident that there will be more activity like this in the future with more great IP. The other opportunity beyond remasters is to look at some of our classic IP and ask whether or not it could be reborn on a new platform like what we're doing with Skylanders on mobile. So I think that our IP library is an asset that, when done right, can be very powerful."

We will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures during this call. However, as discussed on our July 29, 2016 conference call, due to updated compliance and disclosure interpretations issued by the SEC staff in May 2016, we are no longer able to present non-GAAP financial measures excluding the impact of deferrals. 
On this call and in the future, unless otherwise specified, we will continue to provide non-GAAP financial measures which exclude the impact of expenses related to stock-based compensation; the amortization of intangible assets; expenses, including legal fees, costs, expenses and accruals related to acquisitions, including the acquisition of King Digital Entertainment; expenses related to debt financings and refinancings; restructuring charges and the associated tax benefits. 
These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for, or superior to, our GAAP results. We encourage investors to consider all measures before making any investment decision. 
Please refer to our earnings release, which is posted on www.activisionblizzard.com for a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and further explanation with respect to our non-GAAP measures. 
There's also a PowerPoint overview, which you can access with the webcast and which will be posted to the website following the call.

We exceeded our prior outlook and delivered record first half revenues. The engagement of our communities remains strong, and we believe our momentum can continue through the rest of the year. 
Our success continues to be the result of our focus on our players and our audiences. Investing in creative and commercial excellence is framed by the 3 pillars we have shared with you before: one, expand our reach; two, deepen engagements; and three, provide more opportunity for player investment. 
Our teams work tirelessly to deliver the most immersive and engaging experiences for our players. This content provides the connection between hundreds of millions of players around the world. 
We then enhance these connections with our franchises through initiatives like eSports, television and film and now consumer products. These additional touch points create more value for our shareholders by creating value and engagement for our audiences. 
Here are some of the ways we created value for our audiences this quarter. We released new updates across many of our leading franchises this quarter, driving engagement and delivering nearly $0.5 billion of segment operating income, the most we've achieved in a single quarter without new full game releases for any franchise. 
We also announced the first team sales for the Overwatch League, the first major global city-based professional eSports league. We have the very best teams with the very best resources, dedicated to celebrating and rewarding the world's best professional Overwatch players. 
Overwatch, with more than 30 million players, has captured imaginations and driven strong global engagement. We organized our league around major cities, taking the proven model from competition in traditional sports. Our announced team owners and their locations, New England, New York, Los Angeles, Miami, Orlando, San Francisco, Shanghai and Seoul, and the many more we expect to announce, represent the very best in eSports and traditional sports. 
We continue to invest in improving our ability to execute and innovate across the company. This quarter, we made some exciting additions to our management team to equip our company with the leadership we need to capitalize on the biggest opportunities we see ahead. Coddy Johnson rejoined the company as our new President and COO. Coddy proved himself as a transformational leader during the 8 years he previously spent with us, including as Chief Operating and Financial Officer of Activision Publishing, and we're very excited that he's rejoined the company for this next growth phase of our business. 
Later you'll hear from Spencer Neumann in his new role as CFO, bringing a wealth of experience from a long career at The Walt Disney Company, most recently as Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President of Global Guest Experience of the Parks and Resorts division.
We're also joined by Thomas Tippl, our Vice Chairman; and Dennis Durkin, our Chief Corporate Officer, and all of our business unit heads. 
As always, our success is the result of the dedication of our players, fans, employees and partners, who we cannot thank enough for their enthusiasm and support. Coddy will now review the highlights of our operations for this quarter."

In Q2, our revenues exceeded our outlook by more than $200 million and earnings per share surpassed our expectations by $0.17. Given this sizeable overperformance and confidence in our plans, we are raising our outlook for the year. 
Let's start with audience reach, which was 407 million monthly active users this quarter. Blizzard did not have any new full game releases this quarter, yet a strong stream of content updates across Blizzard franchises drove an all-time MAU record of 46 million, up 38% from last year and up 12% from the last quarter. Blizzard's community has now more than doubled in MAUs since early 2015, underscoring the ability to grow audience reach across the portfolio of platforms, regions, genres and business models. 
Notably, the Overwatch community continued to grow, with MAUs up each and every quarter since launch, and in Q2, they had another all-time MAU record with the release of 2 seasonal events. 
And Hearthstone MAUs increased to an all-time record for the franchise, fueled by the new expansion Journey to Un‚ÄôGoro. 
Activision had 47 million MAUs for the quarter, driven by Call of Duty, which continues to have a large and active player base across a number of its titles, many of which received updates during the quarter. In particular, the release of Zombies Chronicles, Activision's first large content drop to a community in year 2 after game launch, helped to grow Call of Duty: Black Ops III MAUs quarter-over-quarter. 
Activision expects to expand the Call of Duty community this fall with the highly anticipated release of Call of Duty: WWII on November 3. And we see great momentum for WWII, not only from key indicators like preorders, stated purchase intent and hands-on player feedback, but also from more qualitative measures like video views, social sentiment and engagement, which are up year-over-year. 
We've just debuted Call of Duty: WWII Zombies mode, which is now our most-liked Zombies trailer ever. And we can't wait for players to experience the game during our upcoming beta exclusively on PlayStation 4 on August 25, available for all those who preorder the game. 
Activision, along with partner Bungie, showcased the upcoming launch of Destiny 2 at multiple events this summer to great enthusiasm. We're excited that Destiny 2's PC version earned E3 Game Critics' PC Game of Show and even more excited that it will be on Blizzard's Battle.net, making it the first non-Blizzard game ever on their platform. Publishing on an owned platform will provide an enhanced player experience, better insights and better economics.  
With the PC beta still to come, the Destiny 2 console beta had more players than the first Destiny beta and preorder levels are now above the first Destiny at this same point in time prelaunch. Destiny 2 full-game preorders also have the highest digital mix in Activision's history. 
Finally, Activision's release of the remastered Crash Bandicoot for PS4 showed the powerful combination of our deep library of beloved IP and our team's ability to create great new content for our communities. The game is outperforming even our most optimistic expectations and was the #1 console title globally in June based on units. Notable given it was only available on one platform for 2 days in the month. 
Turning now to our second strategic pillar, engagement. Blizzard's focus on compelling in-game content led to all-time record DAUs and Q2 record playtime. In Overwatch, April's Uprising player-versus-environment game mode was well received with record playtime. And more recently, the May anniversary event drove strong engagement and record participation in customization items. 
Hearthstone's Journey to Un‚ÄôGoro was one of the best received expansions to date, with record DAUs. And World of Warcraft continues to benefit from more regular content updates that Blizzard adds in between major expansions. Time spent in the game is up year-over-year. The Legion expansion continues to outperform the last expansion, and Blizzard plans to release this quarter another large content drop, with more details to be revealed at Gamescom. 
King's MAUs were down year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. Numerous efforts are now underway to grow audience size, but these will take time as the team experiments with reach-driving initiatives and continues to develop new creative content for the community. 
We have, however, seen good success with our live ops and new features, which continue to drive strong engagement, as illustrated by the frequency with which players reengage each month, which remains at an all-time high. To put this in perspective, the time spent per player per day inside King franchises is 35 minutes, higher than that of Instagram or Snapchat. 
Our groundbreaking initiatives in eSports drive engagement and celebrate our players and their achievement in new ways. We made strong progress this quarter on the Overwatch League, as Bobby already mentioned. That progress was a meaningful milestone toward establishing a league-based professional competition as a stand-alone business. We now have the sustainable structure in which to invest for the long term, with the very best partners from traditional sports and from eSports. 
Blizzard also recently announced a live streaming media rights partnership, which showed the value of our broadcast content. Just as importantly, though, the partnership carved out a number of future opportunities for media rights sales, including those related to the Overwatch League. 
Progress on the Overwatch League also sets the stage for Activision's Call of Duty World League. With CWL, we'll wrap up a great season of competition with our upcoming championship event, and we are well positioned through upcoming seasons. 
Turning last to our third pillar, providing opportunity for player investment. In-game content continues to be a consistent driver for our business, delivering another $1 billion quarter for in-game purchases. King was the biggest contributor, with bookings per paying user rising for the eighth quarter in a row to a new record. Strong engagement and player investment led to an increase in mobile bookings both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. 
King continued to have 2 of the top 10 grossing games in the U.S. for the 15th quarter in a row, and King continues to develop a strong pipeline, with both new features across their live games portfolio, multiple new games ahead, including a promising publishing partnership with Playstudios in the social casino segment slated for release later this fall. 
King also continues to build out its advertising business, which we believe is an important long-term opportunity. We now have new industry-proven leadership in place driving the advertising business. The team is focused on the creation of premium video ad products that can improve player experience, deliver value to advertisers and create meaningful new revenue streams. 
Given the growth of the overall mobile advertising ecosystem and the relative brand safety of our network, in particular, we think this is a meaningful opportunity for the future. 
This quarter, King also entered into a partnership with Facebook Audience Network for its static display ad inventory. The partnership monetizes a portion of King's impressions, while the team continues to work toward the long-term video ad opportunity. 
Both Activision and Blizzard also had a strong quarter for player investments. Call of Duty's Black Ops Zombies not only drove purchases of that specific piece of content at a recommended $30 price but also led to higher engagement, which in turn led to even more add-on purchases by our players. 
The strength of our strategy in providing great content wherever our fans engage can be seen in the fact that Call of Duty's in-game purchases were roughly in line with last year's record Q2 performance, all on the strength of great content provided across a number of Call of Duty titles. 
Blizzard experienced strong participation with in-game content for Overwatch and Hearthstone and also for Diablo, as the Necromancer class, originally debuted in Diablo II, was introduced to Diablo III and embraced by the player community. 
Stepping back, the success of our ongoing stream of content, features, events and products to our communities, coupled with additional opportunities from our vast library, highlights a really strong model, both for our fans and their enjoyment and for the company as a high-margin business. We have one of the largest catalogs of owned intellectual properties, including game titles that go back to the [indiscernible]. And we have hundreds of millions of players in 196 countries, one of the largest digitally connected audiences in the world. This makes it an incredible time to be a part of Activision Blizzard. Our momentum, driven by our inspired teams enabling year-round engagement for our players, drives both near-term performance and future growth opportunities like eSports, ads, mobile and consumer products. 
Spence will now review our numbers in more detail."

I'm thrilled to be here with all of you today and to be part of the Activision Blizzard team. I come here with a deep appreciation for the power of beloved global franchises that build enduring, emotional connections with the community. Tha",1331,"Thanks, Coddy. I'm thrilled to be here with all of you today and to be part of the Activision Blizzard team. I come here with a deep appreciation for the power of beloved global franchises that build enduring, emotional connections with the community. That's the foundation of Activision Blizzard, and it's why I believe we have such a bright future. 
Today I'll review our better-than-expected Q2 results, which capped off a record first half. I'll also review our outlook for Q3 and our raised outlook for the full year. 
To review the quarter, I would like to start with our segment results. As a reminder, our segment results, unlike our consolidated results, are still presented excluding the impact of deferrals, as they always have been. 
Each of our segments contributed to our overperformance this quarter. We outperformed our outlook due to the combined power of our franchise breadth, a steady stream of content serving our uniquely engaged community and our talented teams. 
At the aggregate level, we delivered combined segment operating income of $476 million, which as Bobby indicated, represents a record for a quarter without a new full game franchise release. 
Activision generated operating income of $87 million, roughly flat year-over-year, with strong Call of Duty performance across the overall franchise offsetting expected lower performance on Infinite Warfare. Our strategy of providing content wherever our players engage drove this upside, as did improved performance across Activision's catalog, including a very positive reception to Crash Bandicoot. 
Blizzard's $225 million of operating income was the largest segment earnings contributor in the quarter, led by the strength of the Overwatch, World of Warcraft and Hearthstone franchises. Operating income was down year-over-year as expected, given the comp to last year's significant Q2 Overwatch release. 
And King delivered $164 million of operating income in the quarter, which was slightly down year-over-year but relatively flat sequentially. Continued growth in per-player engagement and player investment led to stable year-over-year revenues for the Candy Crush franchise. 
Now let's turn to our consolidated results. Unless otherwise indicated, I'll be referencing non-GAAP as-redefined figures, which include the impact of deferrals. If you'd like to calculate metrics as we used to report them, you would add the impact of deferrals to our non-GAAP as-redefined figures. Please refer to our earnings release for full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations. 
For the quarter, we generated GAAP revenues of $1.63 billion, $206 million above our May guidance. This includes the net recognition of deferred revenues of $213 million for the quarter. 
We generated GAAP EPS of $0.32 and non-GAAP EPS of $0.55 in Q2, which was $0.17 above guidance. These figures include the net recognition of deferrals of $0.12. 
The overperformance in the quarter versus guidance was driven largely by business overperformance as well as some expense timing. 
From a capital structure perspective, we continued our positive rating agency momentum and received another upgrade from S&P to BBB. We also entered into a leverage-neutral $1.2 billion refinancing to lock in attractive long-term interest rates, bringing our blended cost of debt to 3.6% and provided a better staggering of debt maturities. 
We delivered Q2 operating cash flow of $265 million, finishing the quarter with approximately $3.3 billion in cash and investments, about 1/3 of which is held domestically; and approximately $4.4 billion of aggregate debt outstanding for a net debt position of approximately $1.2 billion at quarter-end. 
Lastly, we paid a cash dividend of $0.30 per common share, which was up 15% year-over-year, for a total $226 million in aggregate to shareholders of record as of March 30, 2017. 
Now let's turn to our slate and outlook for Q3. Our Q3 slate continues our strategy of delivering a steady stream of content and services to our community, including Blizzard's Hearthstone expansion, Knights of the Frozen Throne, additional maps for Activision's Infinite Warfare and new features and live ops across King titles. 
In addition, Blizzard is launching a remastered version of the original StarCraft on August 14. This will offer new and veteran players the same classic StarCraft game play with 4k graphics, modern conveniences like cloud saves, and connectivity to Blizzard's updated Battle.net ecosystem for an enhanced social and competitive experience. 
And of course, Activision has 2 major releases in the back half of the year: the launch of Destiny 2 on console on September 6 with the PC launch to follow on October 24. 
We'll also continue the marketing ramp for the November 3 release of Call of Duty: WWII. 
For Q3 on a GAAP basis, we expect net revenues of $1.385 billion, including GAAP deferrals of $315 million, product cost of 23% and operating expenses of 67%. We expect GAAP interest expense of $41 million, a tax rate of 30%, GAAP and non-GAAP share count of 766 million and GAAP EPS of $0.09. 
For Q3, on a non-GAAP as-redefined basis, we expect product cost of 23% and operating expenses of 49%. We expect non-GAAP interest expense of $40 million, a tax rate of 25% and non-GAAP EPS of $0.34, including a GAAP deferral of $0.11. 
And just to remind everyone, if you'd like to calculate non-GAAP metrics as we used to report them, you'd start with our non-GAAP as-redefined EPS guidance of $0.34 and add the impact of deferrals or $0.11. 
Before I turn to our 2017 outlook, I'd like to provide some detail on the impact of the Overwatch League. With the recently announced sale of 7 teams, we do expect some revenue upside to Q4, but it will be modest given the recognition of team sale proceeds over multiple years. 
Further, from an operating income perspective, the revenue recognition of team sales will be partially offset by the investment required to launch the league, including inaugural season marketing. 
As we look ahead to the first season, we see a number of important upcoming milestones, including standing up league operations, supporting teams development of player rosters, attracting sponsors, elevating the viewer experience and securing media distribution. We're investing in this league for the long term. Over time, we expect to recognize additional revenues related to both more team sales and multiple league revenue streams. We see this as a substantial long-term value driver for the business. 
 
Now turning to our raised 2017 full year outlook, which passes through business overperformance from Q2 and now includes the Overwatch League's modest revenue contribution and roughly breakeven EPS contribution. 
On a GAAP basis, we expect revenues of $6.4 billion, including GAAP deferrals of $175 million; product cost of 22% and operating expenses of 60%. Our GAAP interest expense is expected to be $174 million. And our GAAP tax rate is expected to be 16%. We expect 767 million fully diluted shares both for GAAP and non-GAAP redefined, and GAAP EPS is expected to be $1.05. 
For 2017, on a non-GAAP basis, as redefined, we expect product cost of 22% and operating expenses of 45%. We expect non-GAAP interest expense of $156 million, a tax rate of 24% and non-GAAP EPS of $1.94, including a GAAP deferral of $0.06. 
And if you would like to calculate non-GAAP metrics as we used to report them, you would start with our non-GAAP as-redefined EPS guidance at $1.94 and add the impact of deferrals or $0.06. 
In closing, I just want to echo Bobby and Coddy's sentiment. This is such an exciting time at Activision Blizzard. By delivering engaging content, features and services to our community, including in-game content and remastered IP from our unparalleled library, we can increasingly generate digital, recurring, high-margin revenue opportunities. Our core games business has never been stronger and it's also powering future growth vectors like eSports, advertising, consumer products, TV and film and mobile. We believe we have tremendous opportunities ahead of us, and as always, we remain focused on rigorous prioritization, operational excellence, fiscal discipline and long-term shareholder value. 
Now I welcome our business leaders, Eric, Mike, Riccardo, Dennis and Thomas, as they join us for the Q&A portion of the call. Operator?"

And if you think about whether it's in tech or in eSports or in professional sports, we're assembling the very best owners for all of eSports. We've announced the first 7. And I think what you're going to see is that probably the most important milestones are as we get towards the latter part of the year and we start to kick off competition, when you see what we're doing in terms of broadcast rights and sponsorship opportunities. But from every perspective, I think we think we've organized the league in the best way that will allow us to celebrate our players and our fans. And if you think about over 30 million players today, this is a very large audience. Even if your spectators were only coming from your player population, that is a very, very large audience to be able to have advertisers and sponsors and partners for. So I'd say we're off to a really great start, and you'll hear more about future team sales over the balance of the year.

First of all, we have a tremendous amount of confidence in the game. As it's closing, we think it's going to be a great game. And we received almost universally positive feedback from both the press and the fans after people got their hands on the beta. And I think it's also worth noting that Destiny won 45 awards at E3, and we're continuing to close strong. We also have very strong preorders, and Coddy mentioned this broadly, but the specifics are the #1 position on Nielsen's unaided awareness and next-choice purchase intent. And while no one of those data points is ever predictive in a vacuum, we found that when you have all 3 of those trending positively, it's usually a very good thing. And then there are also several firsts in Destiny 2, the way we're going to market, that are designed to bring the franchise to a broader audience, starting with the fact that we've got a great PC game. Of those 45 awards, 1 of them was the official Best of Show for PC at E3. We've actually added a number of languages and localizations to make the game more appealing and accessible to more audiences around the world. And of course, I think our watershed partnership with Blizzard is going to bring Destiny to the most passionate PC fans anywhere in the world, so it puts it on the best possible stage. And finally, maybe most importantly with a game like this, Destiny is so engaging that the follow-on content is almost as important, if not as important, as the main game. And as I mentioned on earlier calls, we've completely changed our approach to tapping that by widening our stable of AAA developers so that we can keep up with the demand -- it's a high-class problem, but we haven't been able to do that in the past -- keep up with the demand for more content. And I think that fans agree with the importance of that, which is evidenced by the fact that such an overwhelmingly high percentage of the preorders thus far are for one of our elevated SKUs, which include the Season Pass and the follow-on content. So lots of good signs, the beta being just one of them. And we're really excited and have confidence we have a great game."

So we were really deliberate in structuring this business to attract the best owners and players in order to position the league, the Overwatch League for long-term success. And that starts with optimizing alignment between the league, which we own, with the teams and our players. So at the league level, we're establishing a pool of shared league-wide revenues composed of media rights and consumer products, league-level sponsorship and a portion of league-related digital and game merchandise. And then we'll net those league costs, like marketing and production and league operations, against those revenue streams and share the resulting amount 50-50 between the league and the teams. And then at the team level, we've got these fantastic entrepreneurial owners, and we wanted to be sure we developed the structure that enabled those owners to not only fund player and team operations but also create real incremental value at the local level. So in addition to their league participation, the teams have their own local revenue streams, including the more traditional areas like ticket sales and concessions and local sponsorships and local merch sales. But they will also have more unique opportunities such as the ability to host certain nonprofessional Overwatch matches. And so -- and then lastly, when we think about the players, we established minimum salaries, benefits and bonuses for our players so that we're providing the security and stability required to attract the best talent on the planet. So I guess if we step back, we positioned the league and team owners to invest alongside one another, to build value at both the league and the local level, leveraging the capabilities and infrastructure that we each bring to bear for the benefit of our players and our fans. So we've got plenty of work to do here, and we're getting ready for the launch later this year. We look forward to sharing more progress soon."

We had strong MAUs this quarter, with audiences at a relevant scale across multiple titles. And importantly, despite the headwinds that we've talked about on IW, both MAUs and OI are both in line with our record Q2 performance from last year despite those headwinds. So our strategy of bringing content and adding content wherever our players choose to play is really paying off. And I think that's what drove the positive performance you referenced in the quarter. We had Infinite Warfare and Modern Warfare Remastered. We continued [ to season ] the content that was scheduled for those. We also brought the Zombies Chronicles, which Coddy mentioned, which is a remaster of some of our most beloved content from the Black Ops Zombies canon. And that also speaks to the strength of that catalog and our ability to continue to delight fans with new versions of that. So it really does speak to the size and strength and stability of Call of Duty, that we can do this across multiple titles. And I can't think of another franchise that can. On WWII specifically, probably most importantly, we think we have the right game at the right time. And I can tell you that those who have played it, the return to boots on the ground, the return to human scale, authentic military content and context for the franchise is a welcome change and very well timed. And everything that fans have touched, which by the way, is a lot more than usual. We had multiplayer hands-on at E3 for only the second time in our history this year. Everything that consumers have put their hands on, we've have gotten really positive response from fans as well as from critics. And there's a couple of data points which show that. First of all, the reveal trailer was the most liked video in Call of Duty history, and we've got a pretty great history with that. And we had the most organic views of any COD reveal trailer ever. The hands-on multiplayer at E3 was well received and the Zombies trailer that we revealed at Comic-Con went on to become our most-liked Zombies trailer ever, with an overwhelmingly positive sentiment as well. So the good news is you don't have to take my word for any of this. Our beta starts on August 25 on PlayStation, and I hope all of you are going to join us and play."

And we define this as an ad format which is well integrated into the game play and that provides value for the player as well as the value for the advertiser. And currently, we are evaluating the results of this first ad format test. And we are continuing the work on creating more premium video ad products. We're also widening the variety of ad formats beyond video. As you heard before, we signed a partnership with Facebook to offer the image ad product. And so we are introducing image ads, and this format will allow us to monetize our global audience. So overall, we feel very excited about this opportunity.

First and foremost, I'd just say that the bulk of our focus continues to be supporting our existing players and releasing high-quality content for our existing games. This quarter is a great example of that approach. We delivered a consistent flow of updates and new content across all of our games, and that has driven record engagement even without a new game launch. We're also really excited about the future. In addition to supporting all of our live games, we're committed to incubating new initiatives. And we're also thinking about different platforms, especially mobile. In terms of new IP, our pipeline is in a better position than ever before in our history. Last year, Allen Adham, who cofounded Blizzard with me and Frank Pearce, returned to the company to take on the task of coordinating our efforts in this regard. And this includes some great ideas that we already started to explore. So we now have multiple dedicated incubation teams that are being led by some of our most experienced game designers at Blizzard. I should say that creating new Blizzard quality games on any platform will take time. And as we've shown in the past, we're not going to release any games that we don't feel live up to our expectations or those of our players.

So first, we knew that there was a passionate audience out there for Crash. Full disclosure, myself among them. But we had no idea -- it's hard to tell whether that's a vocal minority or whether that's a real mass audience until you put something out there. And Crash just surpassed all of our expectations by a pretty wide margin. And a couple of stats that underscore that point were that it was the #1 selling console game in June based on units, even though it was only available for 2 days during that month. And Sony reported this morning -- well timed, I guess, for this call -- that Crash was the most downloaded game on the PlayStation store in July. So as to your broader question, I think this is just another example of us really listening to our communities and our fans and offering them great content where the want to engage, which is one of our core strategies. So we think we have other great IP in our portfolio that we're considering, of course, but we've already -- this isn't new behavior for us. We've already shown the power of this with Modern Warfare Remastered last year, with Zombies Chronicles that we talked about. Obviously, Crash Bandicoot is another great example. So this is a strategy that clearly has our attention, and while there are no new announcements today, I think you can be confident that there will be more activity like this in the future with more great IP. The other opportunity beyond remasters is to look at some of our classic IP and ask whether or not it could be reborn on a new platform like what we're doing with Skylanders on mobile. So I think that our IP library is an asset that, when done right, can be very powerful."

We exceeded our prior outlook and delivered record first half revenues. The engagement of our communities remains strong, and we believe our momentum can continue through the rest of the year. 
Our success continues to be the result of our focus on our players and our audiences. Investing in creative and commercial excellence is framed by the 3 pillars we have shared with you before: one, expand our reach; two, deepen engagements; and three, provide more opportunity for player investment. 
Our teams work tirelessly to deliver the most immersive and engaging experiences for our players. This content provides the connection between hundreds of millions of players around the world. 
We then enhance these connections with our franchises through initiatives like eSports, television and film and now consumer products. These additional touch points create more value for our shareholders by creating value and engagement for our audiences. 
Here are some of the ways we created value for our audiences this quarter. We released new updates across many of our leading franchises this quarter, driving engagement and delivering nearly $0.5 billion of segment operating income, the most we've achieved in a single quarter without new full game releases for any franchise. 
We also announced the first team sales for the Overwatch League, the first major global city-based professional eSports league. We have the very best teams with the very best resources, dedicated to celebrating and rewarding the world's best professional Overwatch players. 
Overwatch, with more than 30 million players, has captured imaginations and driven strong global engagement. We organized our league around major cities, taking the proven model from competition in traditional sports. Our announced team owners and their locations, New England, New York, Los Angeles, Miami, Orlando, San Francisco, Shanghai and Seoul, and the many more we expect to announce, represent the very best in eSports and traditional sports. 
We continue to invest in improving our ability to execute and innovate across the company. This quarter, we made some exciting additions to our management team to equip our company with the leadership we need to capitalize on the biggest opportunities we see ahead. Coddy Johnson rejoined the company as our new President and COO. Coddy proved himself as a transformational leader during the 8 years he previously spent with us, including as Chief Operating and Financial Officer of Activision Publishing, and we're very excited that he's rejoined the company for this next growth phase of our business. 
Later you'll hear from Spencer Neumann in his new role as CFO, bringing a wealth of experience from a long career at The Walt Disney Company, most recently as Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President of Global Guest Experience of the Parks and Resorts division.
We're also joined by Thomas Tippl, our Vice Chairman; and Dennis Durkin, our Chief Corporate Officer, and all of our business unit heads. 
As always, our success is the result of the dedication of our players, fans, employees and partners, who we cannot thank enough for their enthusiasm and support. Coddy will now review the highlights of our operations for this quarter."

As Bobby mentioned, we have incredible communities of players and fans. The joy of our work, what we do each day, is to support our teams in building out some of the world's best creative environments and strongest commercial capabilities on behalf of those communities so that they can play, connect and engage as deeply as possible. When we get that right, we have the ability to serve our hundreds of millions of audience members with an ongoing stream of content, features, events and products that they love. 
The business strategy underlying that work is based on the 3 pillars you heard from Bobby. We invest in creative and commercial excellence in order to expand reach, deepen engagement and provide more opportunity for player investment, which then allows for reinvestment in creative and commercial excellence and for the growth cycle to continue. 
We saw this strategy work especially well this quarter, with our teams providing more regular content and feature updates across our franchises and our library, leading to our biggest first half of the year in company history, with record revenues driven by digital growth. 
In Q2, our revenues exceeded our outlook by more than $200 million and earnings per share surpassed our expectations by $0.17. Given this sizeable overperformance and confidence in our plans, we are raising our outlook for the year. 
Let's start with audience reach, which was 407 million monthly active users this quarter. Blizzard did not have any new full game releases this quarter, yet a strong stream of content updates across Blizzard franchises drove an all-time MAU record of 46 million, up 38% from last year and up 12% from the last quarter. Blizzard's community has now more than doubled in MAUs since early 2015, underscoring the ability to grow audience reach across the portfolio of platforms, regions, genres and business models. 
Notably, the Overwatch community continued to grow, with MAUs up each and every quarter since launch, and in Q2, they had another all-time MAU record with the release of 2 seasonal events. 
And Hearthstone MAUs increased to an all-time record for the franchise, fueled by the new expansion Journey to Un‚ÄôGoro. 
Activision had 47 million MAUs for the quarter, driven by Call of Duty, which continues to have a large and active player base across a number of its titles, many of which received updates during the quarter. In particular, the release of Zombies Chronicles, Activision's first large content drop to a community in year 2 after game launch, helped to grow Call of Duty: Black Ops III MAUs quarter-over-quarter. 
Activision expects to expand the Call of Duty community this fall with the highly anticipated release of Call of Duty: WWII on November 3. And we see great momentum for WWII, not only from key indicators like preorders, stated purchase intent and hands-on player feedback, but also from more qualitative measures like video views, social sentiment and engagement, which are up year-over-year. 
We've just debuted Call of Duty: WWII Zombies mode, which is now our most-liked Zombies trailer ever. And we can't wait for players to experience the game during our upcoming beta exclusively on PlayStation 4 on August 25, available for all those who preorder the game. 
Activision, along with partner Bungie, showcased the upcoming launch of Destiny 2 at multiple events this summer to great enthusiasm. We're excited that Destiny 2's PC version earned E3 Game Critics' PC Game of Show and even more excited that it will be on Blizzard's Battle.net, making it the first non-Blizzard game ever on their platform. Publishing on an owned platform will provide an enhanced player experience, better insights and better economics.  
With the PC beta still to come, the Destiny 2 console beta had more players than the first Destiny beta and preorder levels are now above the first Destiny at this same point in time prelaunch. Destiny 2 full-game preorders also have the highest digital mix in Activision's history. 
Finally, Activision's release of the remastered Crash Bandicoot for PS4 showed the powerful combination of our deep library of beloved IP and our team's ability to create great new content for our communities. The game is outperforming even our most optimistic expectations and was the #1 console title globally in June based on units. Notable given it was only available on one platform for 2 days in the month. 
Turning now to our second strategic pillar, engagement. Blizzard's focus on compelling in-game content led to all-time record DAUs and Q2 record playtime. In Overwatch, April's Uprising player-versus-environment game mode was well received with record playtime. And more recently, the May anniversary event drove strong engagement and record participation in customization items. 
Hearthstone's Journey to Un‚ÄôGoro was one of the best received expansions to date, with record DAUs. And World of Warcraft continues to benefit from more regular content updates that Blizzard adds in between major expansions. Time spent in the game is up year-over-year. The Legion expansion continues to outperform the last expansion, and Blizzard plans to release this quarter another large content drop, with more details to be revealed at Gamescom. 
King's MAUs were down year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. Numerous efforts are now underway to grow audience size, but these will take time as the team experiments with reach-driving initiatives and continues to develop new creative content for the community. 
We have, however, seen good success with our live ops and new features, which continue to drive strong engagement, as illustrated by the frequency with which players reengage each month, which remains at an all-time high. To put this in perspective, the time spent per player per day inside King franchises is 35 minutes, higher than that of Instagram or Snapchat. 
Our groundbreaking initiatives in eSports drive engagement and celebrate our players and their achievement in new ways. We made strong progress this quarter on the Overwatch League, as Bobby already mentioned. That progress was a meaningful milestone toward establishing a league-based professional competition as a stand-alone business. We now have the sustainable structure in which to invest for the long term, with the very best partners from traditional sports and from eSports. 
Blizzard also recently announced a live streaming media rights partnership, which showed the value of our broadcast content. Just as importantly, though, the partnership carved out a number of future opportunities for media rights sales, including those related to the Overwatch League. 
Progress on the Overwatch League also sets the stage for Activision's Call of Duty World League. With CWL, we'll wrap up a great season of competition with our upcoming championship event, and we are well positioned through upcoming seasons. 
Turning last to our third pillar, providing opportunity for player investment. In-game content continues to be a consistent driver for our business, delivering another $1 billion quarter for in-game purchases. King was the biggest contributor, with bookings per paying user rising for the eighth quarter in a row to a new record. Strong engagement and player investment led to an increase in mobile bookings both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. 
King continued to have 2 of the top 10 grossing games in the U.S. for the 15th quarter in a row, and King continues to develop a strong pipeline, with both new features across their live games portfolio, multiple new games ahead, including a promising publishing partnership with Playstudios in the social casino segment slated for release later this fall. 
King also continues to build out its advertising business, which we believe is an important long-term opportunity. We now have new industry-proven leadership in place driving the advertising business. The team is focused on the creation of premium video ad products that can improve player experience, deliver value to advertisers and create meaningful new revenue streams. 
Given the growth of the overall mobile advertising ecosystem and the relative brand safety of our network, in particular, we think this is a meaningful opportunity for the future. 
This quarter, King also entered into a partnership with Facebook Audience Network for its static display ad inventory. The partnership monetizes a portion of King's impressions, while the team continues to work toward the long-term video ad opportunity. 
Both Activision and Blizzard also had a strong quarter for player investments. Call of Duty's Black Ops Zombies not only drove purchases of that specific piece of content at a recommended $30 price but also led to higher engagement, which in turn led to even more add-on purchases by our players. 
The strength of our strategy in providing great content wherever our fans engage can be seen in the fact that Call of Duty's in-game purchases were roughly in line with last year's record Q2 performance, all on the strength of great content provided across a number of Call of Duty titles. 
Blizzard experienced strong participation with in-game content for Overwatch and Hearthstone and also for Diablo, as the Necromancer class, originally debuted in Diablo II, was introduced to Diablo III and embraced by the player community. 
Stepping back, the success of our ongoing stream of content, features, events and products to our communities, coupled with additional opportunities from our vast library, highlights a really strong model, both for our fans and their enjoyment and for the company as a high-margin business. We have one of the largest catalogs of owned intellectual properties, including game titles that go back to the [indiscernible]. And we have hundreds of millions of players in 196 countries, one of the largest digitally connected audiences in the world. This makes it an incredible time to be a part of Activision Blizzard. Our momentum, driven by our inspired teams enabling year-round engagement for our players, drives both near-term performance and future growth opportunities like eSports, ads, mobile and consumer products. 
Spence will now review our numbers in more detail."

I come here with a deep appreciation for the power of beloved global franchises that build enduring, emotional connections with the community. That's the foundation of Activision Blizzard, and it's why I believe we have such a bright future. 
Today I'll review our better-than-expected Q2 results, which capped off a record first half. I'll also review our outlook for Q3 and our raised outlook for the full year. 
To review the quarter, I would like to start with our segment results. As a reminder, our segment results, unlike our consolidated results, are still presented excluding the impact of deferrals, as they always have been. 
Each of our segments contributed to our overperformance this quarter. We outperformed our outlook due to the combined power of our franchise breadth, a steady stream of content serving our uniquely engaged community and our talented teams. 
At the aggregate level, we delivered combined segment operating income of $476 million, which as Bobby indicated, represents a record for a quarter without a new full game franchise release. 
Activision generated operating income of $87 million, roughly flat year-over-year, with strong Call of Duty performance across the overall franchise offsetting expected lower performance on Infinite Warfare. Our strategy of providing content wherever our players engage drove this upside, as did improved performance across Activision's catalog, including a very positive reception to Crash Bandicoot. 
Blizzard's $225 million of operating income was the largest segment earnings contributor in the quarter, led by the strength of the Overwatch, World of Warcraft and Hearthstone franchises. Operating income was down year-over-year as expected, given the comp to last year's significant Q2 Overwatch release. 
And King delivered $164 million of operating income in the quarter, which was slightly down year-over-year but relatively flat sequentially. Continued growth in per-player engagement and player investment led to stable year-over-year revenues for the Candy Crush franchise. 
Now let's turn to our consolidated results. Unless otherwise indicated, I'll be referencing non-GAAP as-redefined figures, which include the impact of deferrals. If you'd like to calculate metrics as we used to report them, you would add the impact of deferrals to our non-GAAP as-redefined figures. Please refer to our earnings release for full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations. 
For the quarter, we generated GAAP revenues of $1.63 billion, $206 million above our May guidance. This includes the net recognition of deferred revenues of $213 million for the quarter. 
We generated GAAP EPS of $0.32 and non-GAAP EPS of $0.55 in Q2, which was $0.17 above guidance. These figures include the net recognition of deferrals of $0.12. 
The overperformance in the quarter versus guidance was driven largely by business overperformance as well as some expense timing. 
From a capital structure perspective, we continued our positive rating agency momentum and received another upgrade from S&P to BBB. We also entered into a leverage-neutral $1.2 billion refinancing to lock in attractive long-term interest rates, bringing our blended cost of debt to 3.6% and provided a better staggering of debt maturities. 
We delivered Q2 operating cash flow of $265 million, finishing the quarter with approximately $3.3 billion in cash and investments, about 1/3 of which is held domestically; and approximately $4.4 billion of aggregate debt outstanding for a net debt position of approximately $1.2 billion at quarter-end. 
Lastly, we paid a cash dividend of $0.30 per common share, which was up 15% year-over-year, for a total $226 million in aggregate to shareholders of record as of March 30, 2017. 
Now let's turn to our slate and outlook for Q3. Our Q3 slate continues our strategy of delivering a steady stream of content and services to our community, including Blizzard's Hearthstone expansion, Knights of the Frozen Throne, additional maps for Activision's Infinite Warfare and new features and live ops across King titles. 
In addition, Blizzard is launching a remastered version of the original StarCraft on August 14. This will offer new and veteran players the same classic StarCraft game play with 4k graphics, modern conveniences like cloud saves, and connectivity to Blizzard's updated Battle.net ecosystem for an enhanced social and competitive experience. 
And of course, Activision has 2 major releases in the back half of the year: the launch of Destiny 2 on console on September 6 with the PC launch to follow on October 24. 
We'll also continue the marketing ramp for the November 3 release of Call of Duty: WWII. 
For Q3 on a GAAP basis, we expect net revenues of $1.385 billion, including GAAP deferrals of $315 million, product cost of 23% and operating expenses of 67%. We expect GAAP interest expense of $41 million, a tax rate of 30%, GAAP and non-GAAP share count of 766 million and GAAP EPS of $0.09. 
For Q3, on a non-GAAP as-redefined basis, we expect product cost of 23% and operating expenses of 49%. We expect non-GAAP interest expense of $40 million, a tax rate of 25% and non-GAAP EPS of $0.34, including a GAAP deferral of $0.11. 
And just to remind everyone, if you'd like to calculate non-GAAP metrics as we used to report them, you'd start with our non-GAAP as-redefined EPS guidance of $0.34 and add the impact of deferrals or $0.11. 
Before I turn to our 2017 outlook, I'd like to provide some detail on the impact of the Overwatch League. With the recently announced sale of 7 teams, we do expect some revenue upside to Q4, but it will be modest given the recognition of team sale proceeds over multiple years. 
Further, from an operating income perspective, the revenue recognition of team sales will be partially offset by the investment required to launch the league, including inaugural season marketing. 
As we look ahead to the first season, we see a number of important upcoming milestones, including standing up league operations, supporting teams development of player rosters, attracting sponsors, elevating the viewer experience and securing media distribution. We're investing in this league for the long term. Over time, we expect to recognize additional revenues related to both more team sales and multiple league revenue streams. We see this as a substantial long-term value driver for the business. 
 
Now turning to our raised 2017 full year outlook, which passes through business overperformance from Q2 and now includes the Overwatch League's modest revenue contribution and roughly breakeven EPS contribution. 
On a GAAP basis, we expect revenues of $6.4 billion, including GAAP deferrals of $175 million; product cost of 22% and operating expenses of 60%. Our GAAP interest expense is expected to be $174 million. And our GAAP tax rate is expected to be 16%. We expect 767 million fully diluted shares both for GAAP and non-GAAP redefined, and GAAP EPS is expected to be $1.05. 
For 2017, on a non-GAAP basis, as redefined, we expect product cost of 22% and operating expenses of 45%. We expect non-GAAP interest expense of $156 million, a tax rate of 24% and non-GAAP EPS of $1.94, including a GAAP deferral of $0.06. 
And if you would like to calculate non-GAAP metrics as we used to report them, you would start with our non-GAAP as-redefined EPS guidance at $1.94 and add the impact of deferrals or $0.06. 
In closing, I just want to echo Bobby and Coddy's sentiment. This is such an exciting time at Activision Blizzard. By delivering engaging content, features and services to our community, including in-game content and remastered IP from our unparalleled library, we can increasingly generate digital, recurring, high-margin revenue opportunities. Our core games business has never been stronger and it's also powering future growth vectors like eSports, advertising, consumer products, TV and film and mobile. We believe we have tremendous opportunities ahead of us, and as always, we remain focused on rigorous prioritization, operational excellence, fiscal discipline and long-term shareholder value. 
Now I welcome our business leaders, Eric, Mike, Riccardo, Dennis and Thomas, as they join us for the Q&A portion of the call. Operator?"

That, to me, was the biggest milestone, was getting that great blend of endemic teams and professional sports owners. And if you think about whether it's in tech or in eSports or in professional sports, we're assembling the very best owners for all of eSports. We've announced the first 7. And I think what you're going to see is that probably the most important milestones are as we get towards the latter part of the year and we start to kick off competition, when you see what we're doing in terms of broadcast rights and sponsorship opportunities. But from every perspective, I think we think we've organized the league in the best way that will allow us to celebrate our players and our fans. And if you think about over 30 million players today, this is a very large audience. Even if your spectators were only coming from your player population, that is a very, very large audience to be able to have advertisers and sponsors and partners for. So I'd say we're off to a really great start, and you'll hear more about future team sales over the balance of the year. But we couldn't be happier with the progress that we've made so far, and it's really exciting."

First of all, we have a tremendous amount of confidence in the game. As it's closing, we think it's going to be a great game. And we received almost universally positive feedback from both the press and the fans after people got their hands on the beta. And I think it's also worth noting that Destiny won 45 awards at E3, and we're continuing to close strong. We also have very strong preorders, and Coddy mentioned this broadly, but the specifics are the #1 position on Nielsen's unaided awareness and next-choice purchase intent. And while no one of those data points is ever predictive in a vacuum, we found that when you have all 3 of those trending positively, it's usually a very good thing. And then there are also several firsts in Destiny 2, the way we're going to market, that are designed to bring the franchise to a broader audience, starting with the fact that we've got a great PC game. Of those 45 awards, 1 of them was the official Best of Show for PC at E3. We've actually added a number of languages and localizations to make the game more appealing and accessible to more audiences around the world. And of course, I think our watershed partnership with Blizzard is going to bring Destiny to the most passionate PC fans anywhere in the world, so it puts it on the best possible stage. And finally, maybe most importantly with a game like this, Destiny is so engaging that the follow-on content is almost as important, if not as important, as the main game. And as I mentioned on earlier calls, we've completely changed our approach to tapping that by widening our stable of AAA developers so that we can keep up with the demand -- it's a high-class problem, but we haven't been able to do that in the past -- keep up with the demand for more content. And I think that fans agree with the importance of that, which is evidenced by the fact that such an overwhelmingly high percentage of the preorders thus far are for one of our elevated SKUs, which include the Season Pass and the follow-on content. So lots of good signs, the beta being just one of them. And we're really excited and have confidence we have a great game."

And this has resulted in an increase and a continued increase of our player monetization. Candy Crush, which is a title which is now 5 years old, has recently hit again the #1 grossing in the U.S. App Store charts. And we also see great results in our other live games. In regards to audience reach, we think we have more work to do. And this will take some more time, but they are very focused on it. The audience reach, we know that we can impact the audience reach with new titles. Here, we have our teams focused on developing multiple new titles for the long term, in particular, focusing strategically, first of all, on our casual genre for our existing audience. But we're also looking at expanding into new genres, in particular, [ mid-core ]. Here we have, of course, big opportunities within the company, the wider company, and we are exploring mobile opportunities for some of the company's existing powerhouse franchises like the partnership we have announced recently with Activision Publishing for Call of Duty. In the near term we're also working on a social casino title in partnership with Playstudios, and we expect to release this title by the end of the year. In regards to audience reach, we also believe that there are opportunities to stabilize and grow the audience reach in the live games. The teams so far have been focused on engagement and monetization features, and they will continue to focus on engagement and monetization features, where we've been successful.

So we were really deliberate in structuring this business to attract the best owners and players in order to position the league, the Overwatch League for long-term success. And that starts with optimizing alignment between the league, which we own, with the teams and our players. So at the league level, we're establishing a pool of shared league-wide revenues composed of media rights and consumer products, league-level sponsorship and a portion of league-related digital and game merchandise. And then we'll net those league costs, like marketing and production and league operations, against those revenue streams and share the resulting amount 50-50 between the league and the teams. And then at the team level, we've got these fantastic entrepreneurial owners, and we wanted to be sure we developed the structure that enabled those owners to not only fund player and team operations but also create real incremental value at the local level. So in addition to their league participation, the teams have their own local revenue streams, including the more traditional areas like ticket sales and concessions and local sponsorships and local merch sales. But they will also have more unique opportunities such as the ability to host certain nonprofessional Overwatch matches. And so -- and then lastly, when we think about the players, we established minimum salaries, benefits and bonuses for our players so that we're providing the security and stability required to attract the best talent on the planet. So I guess if we step back, we positioned the league and team owners to invest alongside one another, to build value at both the league and the local level, leveraging the capabilities and infrastructure that we each bring to bear for the benefit of our players and our fans. So we've got plenty of work to do here, and we're getting ready for the launch later this year. We look forward to sharing more progress soon."

But I think it's also perhaps, first, important to step back and look at the Call of Duty franchise overall, which remains incredibly strong. We had strong MAUs this quarter, with audiences at a relevant scale across multiple titles. And importantly, despite the headwinds that we've talked about on IW, both MAUs and OI are both in line with our record Q2 performance from last year despite those headwinds. So our strategy of bringing content and adding content wherever our players choose to play is really paying off. And I think that's what drove the positive performance you referenced in the quarter. We had Infinite Warfare and Modern Warfare Remastered. We continued [ to season ] the content that was scheduled for those. We also brought the Zombies Chronicles, which Coddy mentioned, which is a remaster of some of our most beloved content from the Black Ops Zombies canon. And that also speaks to the strength of that catalog and our ability to continue to delight fans with new versions of that. So it really does speak to the size and strength and stability of Call of Duty, that we can do this across multiple titles. And I can't think of another franchise that can. On WWII specifically, probably most importantly, we think we have the right game at the right time. And I can tell you that those who have played it, the return to boots on the ground, the return to human scale, authentic military content and context for the franchise is a welcome change and very well timed. And everything that fans have touched, which by the way, is a lot more than usual. We had multiplayer hands-on at E3 for only the second time in our history this year. Everything that consumers have put their hands on, we've have gotten really positive response from fans as well as from critics. And there's a couple of data points which show that. First of all, the reveal trailer was the most liked video in Call of Duty history, and we've got a pretty great history with that. And we had the most organic views of any COD reveal trailer ever. The hands-on multiplayer at E3 was well received and the Zombies trailer that we revealed at Comic-Con went on to become our most-liked Zombies trailer ever, with an overwhelmingly positive sentiment as well. So the good news is you don't have to take my word for any of this. Our beta starts on August 25 on PlayStation, and I hope all of you are going to join us and play."

So first, we knew that there was a passionate audience out there for Crash. Full disclosure, myself among them. But we had no idea -- it's hard to tell whether that's a vocal minority or whether that's a real mass audience until you put something out there. And Crash just surpassed all of our expectations by a pretty wide margin. And a couple of stats that underscore that point were that it was the #1 selling console game in June based on units, even though it was only available for 2 days during that month. And Sony reported this morning -- well timed, I guess, for this call -- that Crash was the most downloaded game on the PlayStation store in July. So as to your broader question, I think this is just another example of us really listening to our communities and our fans and offering them great content where they want to engage, which is one of our core strategies. So we think we have other great IP in our portfolio that we're considering, of course, but we've already -- this isn't new behavior for us. We've already shown the power of this with Modern Warfare Remastered last year, with Zombies Chronicles that we talked about. Obviously, Crash Bandicoot is another great example. So this is a strategy that clearly has our attention, and while there are no new announcements today, I think you can be confident that there will be more activity like this in the future with more great IP. The other opportunity beyond remasters is to look at some of our classic IP and ask whether or not it could be reborn on a new platform like what we're doing with Skylanders on mobile. So I think that our IP library is an asset that, when done right, can be very powerful."

We've lined up additional releases of that kind of beloved fan favorite content going forward. Eric said no announcements today, but there's just a beloved IP out there that our communities love to engage in. And it's worth a further step back, which is we are really in a transition, a tailwind, strong transition to games-as-a-service model, where we have these passionate and deeply engaged, digitally connected communities to which we can provide an ongoing stream of services, features, events, content. And this is a really strong model, both for our fans and our players and their communities and a chance to really connect online with each other, but also for the company as a business. And you can expect us to continue to pursue this, to look for additional ways to engage our digitally connected audiences, hundreds of millions of fans and players, both on our large franchises, which we're doing and Eric mentioned, but as well as on our most popular and nostalgic intellectual properties and also new opportunities. And that powerful combination between the digitally connected audience that's ready to engage and our ability to have inspired teams deliver content of them, it's strong model and I think we're still in the early days of exploring it.

This was another strong quarter. We delivered record results and exceeded our prior outlook. Our audience is among the largest of any platform and this quarter, we achieved a new milestone for daily time spent per user of over 50 minutes, which is in line with some of the most engaging online connected platforms in the world. We remained focused on building enduring franchises over the long term and helping to grow strong and highly engaged communities around them. When we focus on serving our communities and investing in new ways to help people connect with our franchises and each other across many different types of content and platforms, we create opportunities for delivering growth across reach, engagement and player investment. 
A great example of this is BlizzCon. Tomorrow, the 11th celebration of the Blizzard community kicks off in Anaheim California. This is  one of the highlights of the year for the company as BlizzCon exemplifies our games brings people together from all walks of life and all parts of the world. Gaming through events like BlizzCon provides player with the true sense of belonging and the recognition that through our game, can help break down the barriers that seem to be dividing much of the world. 
Over the next couple of days, over 30,000 people will join us from around the globe with millions more joining virtually including via the live stream and our virtual ticket. The attendance and viewership are great examples of the incredible passion of the Blizzard community whether hosting eSports championships, and building epic cinematics, operant compelling new gameplay experiences and consumer products, or simply providing a space for players to connect. BlizzCon reflects the scale and diversity of the broader opportunities open to the company today. 
We remain excited about our growth prospects, many of which are progressing quickly. The launch of the Overwatch League begins with the regular season play on January 10, and we believe 2018 will be the year that eSports becomes even more broad in its appeal. 
This morning, we announced large Overwatch league sponsorship deals with both Hewlett-Packard and Intel. And these are 2 great examples of forward-thinking initiatives by 2 important companies that will help us deliver great experience for the community and invest in the future of the league. 
Our employees across Activision, Blizzard and King continue to be recognized for their commitments to excellent and execution. We were named to the Fortune 500, Fortune 100 Best Companies to Work For and Fortune's most admired companies. This quarter, we're proud to have been recognized in the top 10 of Fortune's first-ever Future 50 list, which recognize the world's most innovative and forward-looking companies. 
Narrowing vision and creativity with consistent execution over the long term has always been the blueprint for our success. And we're going to keep working hard to approach our future with the same discipline. We're very grateful to support all of our employees, our player communities, our partners and our stakeholders and shareholders in this effort.

We surpassed last year's [ hot water ] mark year-to-date revenues and earnings per share, we delivered record avenues in Q3 and outperformed our guidance by more than $200 million on revenue an",1584,"Thank you, Bobby. 2017 continues to be a record-setting year. We surpassed last year's [ hot water ] mark year-to-date revenues and earnings per share, we delivered record avenues in Q3 and outperformed our guidance by more than $200 million on revenue and by $0.13 on non-GAAP EPS. Given this overperformance and the confidence we have on our plans, we are raising our outlook again, for the year. 
Our performance is made possible by our incredible teams whose commitment to deliver creative and commercial excellence, engages our communities and enables our company to grow. I want to highlight, in particular, that in Q3, our teams demonstrated 2 important aspects of our strategy. First, the ability to serve our communities with a broad range of experiences, large and small across full games, expansions, content drops, features and services. And second, the ability to drive meaningful results from those investments. We saw this from Activision and Bungie with the launch of Destiny 2, a major new game for the franchise, which is now the biggest consul release for the year in the U.S. We saw also see this from Blizzard with Hearthstone's expansion [indiscernible] Iconic to which became a franchise's best-performing expansion to-date. And we saw this from King with Candy Crush where continuous ongoing feature and content updates allow this franchise to have its largest quarter since 2013 and return to the #1 position in the U.S. app store. 
King's Q3 performance is worth underscoring for a moment. They reclaimed their #1 mobile publishers spot in the U.S., they grew revenues for the third sequential quarter to the highest level seen in 10 quarters, and they achieved record mobile gross bookings. King did all of this by focusing on the player experience and the raw titles. And by increasing the pace and success with which they release content, services and future updates. 
Let's now dive deeper into our first strategic pillar, audience reach, which was 384 million Monthly Active Users this quarter. Activision MAUs were a Q3 record of 49 million driven by launch of Destiny 2 and continued strong performance by the Call of Duty franchise, which helped Activision achieved record Q3 segment revenue and record Q3 operating income. 
Destiny 2 is off to a strong start and after the PC launch, is now ahead of Destiny 1 on total consumer spend, on time spent per player, attach rate to the expansion packs and average revenue per user. Destiny 2 also achieved a high watermark in digital full game downloads at over 50% of console sell-through. 
And last week, we introduced Destiny to PC gamers for the first time opening up the franchise to new global audiences and future growth opportunities. 
We were thrilled to launch on Blizzard's BattleNet platform where we have an end-to-end connection with consumer and can drive enhanced player experiences, better insights and better company economics. 
The Call of Duty franchise had a record Q3 MAUs providing even more momentum around tomorrow's highly anticipated release of Call of Duty: WWII. We're enthusiastic about the return to the gritty, authentic, boots-on-the-ground gameplay that the franchises is known for and innovations like war mode and a brand-new take on Call of Duty Zombies. The game is great. Pre-orders have been strong with a higher digital mix than prior Call of Duty titles and sentiment is running high on the community. 
As we've said before, we think Activision has the right game at the right time and a complete package for gamers all over the world. 
Call of Duty has been the #1 console franchise worldwide for 7 of last 8 years. We expect to continue that streak this year. 
Blizzard also set a Q3 record for reach with 42 million MAUs driven by steady stream of content, feature and service updates. This is now the fourth quarter in a row that Blizzard achieved record quarterly MAUs with out-of-full game release. [ Hiding ] again the strategy of continuous year-round content and services to engage our audiences and bring in new players. 
Notably MAUs grew year-over-year for both Overwatch and Hearthstone and the Overwatch community now has over 35 million registered players. King's MAUs were down quarter-over-quarter to 293 million. As discussed on our last call, King has a number of initiatives underway to grow audience size but that these initiatives will take time as the team [indiscernible] community. 
I do want to highlight King's continued success around user engagement. Live updates released this quarter were at record highs both for the frequency, of which players return to play and the overall time spent per player per day. 
And this brings me to our second strategic pillar, engagement. As Bobby mentioned, the company set a new milestone for daily time per user at over 50 minutes, placing us on par with Facebook's time per day, which is over 50 minutes across Facebook, Instagram and Messenger. 
Blizzard driven engagement with compelling content updates across much of their portfolio. Overwatch introduced new content for seasonal events, including Summer Games in Q3 and Halloween Terror last month, driving participation and customization items. World of Warcraft released a large content update leading to stable MAUs versus prior quarter and strong participation in value-added services. And Hearthstone saw time spent rise by double-digit percentage year-over-year on the strength of the Knights of the Frozen Throne expansion. 
Blizzard also released a number of key updates on the BattleNet platform. As mentioned, BattleNet welcomed its first non-Blizzard game Destiny 2 on PC and ahead of that launch, the BattleNet team released a new mobile app and a strong collection of social features in a desktop app, enabling players to stay connected both inside and outside their games and across devices. 
Our groundbreaking efforts in eSports drive engagement as well by celebrating our players and recognizing their achievements in new ways. As Bobby mentioned, we continue to make great progress on the Overwatch League. The 12 inaugural teams have now been able their names and logos and fans will soon be able to celebrate their favorite team and players through both physical and digital merchandise. The Overwatch team is hard at work on refining the [indiscernible] unique experience to make the game even more fun to watch, including team jerseys for in-game heroes, and new camera angles to get a better view of gameplay. Preseason competition begins next month at the Blizzard Arena Los Angeles. I was recently at the facility and can say that the arena and overall spectator experience are awesome. 
Over the past week, Blizzard hosted opening week competitions across a number franchises for BlizzCon at the arena. We look forward to seeing some of you at the championship matches later this week in Anaheim. 
We have a number of other exciting eSports events in the pipeline, including the Call of Duty World League upcoming season, which features the largest prize pool in franchise history. 
But turning now to our third and final pillar, player investment. In-game services, features and contents continue to be a recurring driver for our business resulting in a Q3 record of over $1 billion for in-game purchases and record year-to-date performance. King was the biggest contributor. Bookings per paying user rose for the 9th quarter in a row to new record and the total number of paying players also rose for the first time since Q1 of 2016. King had 2 of the top 10 grossing games in the U.S., a level performance they have held for 4 consecutive years and as mentioned, Candy Crush returned to the #1 position on the iOS and Android app stores in the U.S. for the quarter, highlighting the durability of the franchise that is now separating its fifth anniversary. 
Candy Crush franchise's gross bookings were up 17% year-over-year and up 22% year-over-year bringing the franchise back to its strongest bookings since Q4 of 2013. 
King is making progress on their pipeline and new games as well. The social casino game in partnership with Playstudios is currently live testing and is now expected to launch globally in early part of next year and a strong pipeline of full game releases are in development for next year and beyond. 
In Advertising, King made progress this quarter in testing and product refinement. Prior test continue to show that advertising can improve the player experience and provide
[Audio Gap]
so these are around sales, serving and targeting. And during 2018, King expects to ramp inventory with a deliberate and methodical rollout of that product types, user cohorts and [indiscernible]. 
Both Activision and Blizzard also had strong quarter for player investment not only in live games but in reimagined and remastered experiences from the libraries including Blizzard's StarCraft: Remastered and Activision's Crash Bandicoot and Modern Warfare remastered. 
Just as importantly, Activision continued to introduce content and feature updates for Call of Duty: Black Ops III, which resulted in relatively stable quarter-over-quarter in-game purchases for that franchise. This approach of continuing to provide content and features for the community wherever they are playing even years after the initial launch opens up growth opportunities for years to come. 
In summary, our record performance in the quarter and our record performance year-to-date are the results of our team's passionate dedication to serve the growing communities across our franchises. That dedication is now extending into new growth levers like eSports, Consumer Products and advertising and we're excited about our gross prospects ahead.

Today, I'll our review our better-than-expected Q3 results as well as our outlook for Q4 and our raised outlook for the full year. I'll start with our Q3 segment results. We delivered record Q3 segment revenue and operating income of 16% and 10%, respectively, and record year-to-date performance. Importantly, we saw strength across all of our segments with each of Activision, Blizzard and King contributing to our overperformance for the quarter compared to guidance. 
By focusing on our strategic pillars of reach, engagement and player investment across our breadth of leading franchises, we were able to outperform our outlook, delivered strong results in the quarter and prudently invest in long-term growth initiatives. 
King had a great quarter. The business delivered segment revenues of $528 million, up 15% year-over-year; operating income of $208 million, up 51% year-over-year; and operating margin of 39% which was up 9 percentage points year-over-year and, all of which also meaningfully overperformed prior quarter. As Coddy mentioned, King's revenues have now grown for the third sequential quarter to the highest they've been since the first quarter of 2015 and mobile gross bookings grew to an all-time record. This is the result of really strong execution by the King team and their commitment to continuous community engagement, data-driven platform insight and capabilities and consistent delivery of new, impactful game features. Following that King acquisition earlier last year, King further prioritized resources on Candy Crush and live franchised tiles. We're seeing the benefits of this discipline and focus. 
Activision had a record third quarter including segment revenues of $759 million; operating income of $261 million; and operating margin of 34%, driven by the successful launch of Destiny 2, the ongoing engagement of Call of Duty community and continued contribution from our library with Crash Bandicoot. Activision doubled revenues and more than doubled operating income year-over-year leading to record Q3 and record year-to-date financial performance. 
Blizzard's $531 million in segment revenues and $168 million of operating income were driven by strength of the World of Warcraft, Hearthstone and Overwatch franchises. Performance was down year-over-year as expected given the difficult comp to last year's Q3, which featured both a World of Warcraft expansion and the first full quarter following Overwatch's release. 
Now let's turn to our consolidated results. Unless otherwise indicated, I'll be referencing non-GAAP figures, which include the impact of deferrals. Please refer to our earnings release for full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations. So for the quarter, we generated GAAP revenues of $1.62 billion, which was $233 million above our August guidance. This includes the net deferral of revenues of $284 million. We generated GAAP EPS of $0.25 and non-GAAP EPS of $0.47 in Q3, which were $0.16 and $0.13 above guidance, respectively. These figures include net deferrals of $0.13. 
For the year-to-date on a GAAP basis, we generated record revenues of $4.97 billion, up 8% year-over-year and EPS of $1.12, up 19% year-over-year. On a non-GAAP basis, we generated operating margin of 37% and record EPS of $1.73. 
Looking at cash flow and capital structure. We delivered Q3 operating cash flow of $379 million, finishing the quarter with approximately $3.7 billion in cash and investments, about 1/3 of which is held domestically. And we ended the quarter with approximately $4.4 billion of aggregate debt outstanding for a net debt position of roughly $800 million. 
So now let's turn to our Q4 outlook. In Q4, we'll continue our strategy of delivering of steady stream of content and services to our community, including updates for Blizzard's Hearthstone and Overwatch franchises and execution against a robust slate of features and live ops across King's titles. As you know, Activision released Destiny 2 on PC on October 24 and we have plans to release our first expansion and add-on content for that franchise on December 5. And of course, Activision released the much anticipated Call of Duty: WWII tomorrow. So lots happening this quarter. 
For Q4, on a GAAP basis, we expect net revenues of $1.7 billion with a GAAP deferral of $635 million. Product cost of 24%, operating expenses of 67%. We expect GAAP and non-GAAP interest expense of $41 million, a GAAP tax rate of 36% and GAAP to non-GAAP share count of 769 million shares with GAAP EPS of $0.10. For Q4, on a non-GAAP basis, we expect product cost of 24%, operating expenses of 52%, the tax rate of 27% and non-GAAP EPS of $0.36 with a GAAP deferral of $0.46. 
Now turning to our raised 2017 full year outlook, which passes through Q3 business overperformance and also raises Q4 outlook. On a GAAP basis, we expect revenues of $6.675 billion with a GAAP deferral of $175 million. Product cost of 23%, operating expenses at 58%. Our GAAP interest expense is expected to be $174 million and GAAP tax rate at 14%. We expect 767 million fully diluted shares with -- for both GAAP and non-GAAP and GAAP EPS is expected to be $1.22. For 2017 on a non-GAAP basis, we expect product cost of 23%, operating expenses of 43% and non-GAAP interest expense of $156 million with a tax rate of 24% and non-GAAP EPS of $2.08, and we have a GAAP deferral of $0.08. 
So with the robust Q4 product and feature slate, we're working really hard to finish the year strong. We plan to build on that momentum in 2018 and beyond with a franchise-driven strategy across our core interactive games and emerging opportunity areas. As always, we'll pursue these initiatives with fiscal discipline, intense prioritization and a focus on shareholder value.

Maybe before I answer your question I just want to highlight that 2017 has been a great year for gross booking growth. And this quarter has been the third quarter of sequential gross booking growth and Candy regains the #1 slot in the U.S. App Store, and we are now the leading developer in the U.S. And this ahs also been, as you heard before, the highest ever quarter in mobile gross bookings. So I think we're very proud of that. And I'm very proud of what the team has achieved. Now we have achieved these results by executing on our strategy. We used our proven system to deliver content and features that our players love, and we also focused more resources on live operations to increase the cadence of our updates. If you think of our network and of the size of our network and the experience over the years, we have a unique opportunity to better understand really what players like, what players want. And so we developed a portfolio of features and content and we test these features and content with our players. And when we get these right, we add to the player experience and this converts into higher player engagement and greater player investment. We can see the results of this virtuous loop in our Q3 results. However, I would like to point out that this quarter, our system delivered an exceptional heat rate, and this has led to a greater amortization growth than the usual. So over time, while we don't expect the same level of increase every quarter, we remain confident in our long-term ability to deliver innovation and growth with this rigorous process."

On the marketing side, the goal is to drive new installs and to regain less players. Here, we're focused on innovating how we market our live titles. So as an example of innovation is the partnership with CBS and Lionsgate in the U.S. for the Candy Crush TV show. On the product side, here we focus on the live games, and we're working on new content and new features to drive greater player retention. So the teams are now prioritizing this initiative alongside our monetization and engagement initiatives and that as you heard earlier, had been so successful in driving gross bookings. On top of these initiatives, we're also working on new game launches. New game launches have always been proven as driving reach and having a positive impact on reach. And our development teams are now working really hard on prototyping and developing new titles for the coming years. I would like to point out that reach is everyone's problem. We're all focused on reach and changing the reach trajectory, however, we will take time. We have the team, and we have the focus to do it."

In fact, today, we're having our first owners meeting for the Overwatch League, and we view that as a major growth initiative and a very sizable stand opportunity for the company. We're building the league for the long-term and in our view, the opportunity, rivals, what you see in professional sports for a lot of inspecting but starting with the demographics to the audience. The first season is really about building a solid foundation, delivering world-class viewing experience, distributing the content as broad as we can to our audiences around the world, making sure that we have that strong and growing global fan base and really building the league revenues in the key 3 areas that we've outlined in the past. And today was a great announcement in that regard in sponsorships, in the sale of broadcasting media rights and in licensing. And we've got a really great group of owners who I just came from. We've got some of the great entrepreneurs in sport and a great entrepreneurs of the endemic eSports businesses. And they are all focused on driving local marketing campaigns to build out their fan bases in the markets that they serve. I think we're off to a good start in the sponsorship front with announcement that we made today. And we'll continue to deliver new news and information as we get closer to our January 10 launch date. So it will clearly benefit the franchise from a marketing perspective, but it is a great business opportunity in and out of itself. Right now we are so focused on executing Overwatch League as best as we can but we're not really planning on announcing anything else right now. And look, I would say, that the greatest single benefit that we get from celebrating our professional players is that these are people who are making credible investments and commitment into our games and we have the opportunity to really celebrate and recognize and reward them in an exceptional way. And we think that, that has the most tremendous value to our players and the company."

With just a month of sales, it's already, as Coddy mentioned, the best selling console game year-to-date in the United States bug beyond that we've also improved on pretty much all the other important metrics that we look at. We're now ahead of Destiny 1 in total consumer spend, hours per player reached a new franchise record and average revenue per user was up as well. So we have -- we also have a very strong attach rate to the expansion patch, which we think is a great indication of our fans' ongoing commitment to engagement with the franchise. So we know our fans wanted a game with for the great engaging story with great characters and a more accessible experience overall, and we think we adapt to their high expectations onto those measures. And we also know that our fans are already hungry for more. And as I said on past calls, we now have not just Bungie but multiple AAA teams developing content for Destiny and we're planning on having more content than ever before to support Destiny 2 starting with the first expansion that's coming on December 5. And also, we launched Destiny on PC, which we expect to open up new geographies where we think Destiny is going to be really well received. So we've got events coming, we've got compelling in-game content coming, we've got a strong marketing and events planned through the holidays, so we've got good momentum there."

Let me first underscore that we got great retail partners. Retail is going to continue to be important for us on console for some time to come, but that said, this consumer trend that we're seeing and the shift to full game digital download it's real, it's a strong tailwind for our business, and it's a good thing. That digital connection that brings us closer to our consumer and it creates better economics. It's roughly $10 of direct profit improvement and then was also in direct savings and margin benefit and even some working capital benefits. But I guess, getting back to your question on the trends, I believe we mentioned last year that our historical digital mix was about 20% to 25% for Call of Duty and more than 30% to 40% range for Destiny and Overwatch on console. And historically we've been saying that digital mix increase at about 5 points a year. As you point out with Destiny 2 Digital at over 50% console sellthrough so far, we believe we're seeing some acceleration in that digital shift. And while the consumer level move, I'd be remiss if I don't point out for a moment that our team put together some really compelling digital premium packages and several other credit for creating packages that clearly resonated with Destiny's community and delivered a lot of value. So as we look to the kind of finish out the year and into the back half of Q4, we expect retail actually to gain some share as we reach a broader audience. But we do still expect to end the year well ahead of the original Destiny digital mix. I guess, I should point out that when you look at a franchise like Call of Duty, there's different dynamics there. So it's not like-for-like. Call of Duty, as you know, is a more mass-market gain and the more mass you get, the higher the retail share. So while we're seeing higher digital preorders as well on what we are to relative to any prior Call of Duty title, that digital mix is still well below what we're seeing for Destiny 2. So we may still also see that acceleration from the 5-point historical rate, but again, it's a consumer-led shift primarily, and we'll have to wait to see how the quarter ends. Overall, though this is a good news for our business a lot of grounder to go to expand that digital full game sales footprint and grow the connection with the players."

We've got preorders that are strong, awareness and purchase intent which, of course, we also track at the top of the scale. And anticipation amongst our community is at a fever pitch that we're very excited about. The other thing that sets us up well is the fact that we had our Monthly Active Users on the Call of Duty franchise at a record high in Q3, and it's always great for our new content launches when we have people hyper engaged with the franchise. So as Coddy mentioned, Call of Duty has been the #1 console franchises worldwide, 7 of the last 8 years. We expect to extend that streak this year. And obviously, our community is excited that we're returning to the sort of grittier, boots-on-the-ground authentic military setting that the franchise reach, but we didn't -- we didn't just do that. I think that's the headline, but we didn't rest on those laurels. We're also bringing a bunch of really cool innovations like an entire new way to play multiplayer called war moder which is more team-based and collaborative than any mode we've had before so that was a huge hit in the [indiscernible] as well as sledgehammers take on Call of Duty Zombies, which is literally sort of jump out of your seat scary, kind of really new experience there.

For example, entertainment, tech, banking and we're seeing traction in key markets, in the U.S. and in the U.K. As a result of this, the team has started increasing the volume of impressions.

We remain focused on building enduring franchises over the long term and helping to grow strong and highly engaged communities around them. When we focus on serving our communities and investing in new ways to help people connect with our franchises and each other across many different types of content and platforms, we create opportunities for delivering growth across reach, engagement and player investment. 
A great example of this is BlizzCon. Tomorrow, the 11th celebration of the Blizzard community kicks off in Anaheim, California. This is one of the highlights of the year for the company as BlizzCon exemplifies how our games bring people together from all walks of life and all parts of the world. Gaming, through events like BlizzCon, provides players with a true sense of belonging and a recognition that through our games, we can help break down the barriers that seem to be dividing much of the world. 
Over the next couple of days, over 30,000 people will join us from around the globe with millions more joining virtually, including via the live stream and our Virtual Ticket. The attendance and viewership are great examples of the incredible passion of the Blizzard community, whether hosting eSports championships, unveiling epic cinematics, offering compelling new gameplay experiences and consumer products, or simply providing a space for players to connect. BlizzCon reflects the scale and diversity of the broader opportunities open to the company today. 
We remain excited about our growth prospects, many of which are progressing quickly. The launch of the Overwatch League begins with the regular season play on January 10, and we believe 2018 will be the year that eSports becomes even more broad in its appeal. 
This morning, we announced large Overwatch League sponsorship deals with both Hewlett-Packard and Intel. And these are 2 great examples of forward-thinking initiatives by 2 important companies that will help us deliver a great experience for the community and invest in the future of the league. 
Our employees across Activision, Blizzard and King continue to be recognized for their commitments to excellence and execution. We were named to the Fortune 500, Fortune 100 Best Companies to Work For and Fortune's most admired companies. This quarter, we're proud to have been recognized in the top 10 of Fortune's first-ever Future 50 list, which recognize the world's most innovative and forward-looking companies. 
Marrying vision and creativity with consistent execution over the long term has always been the blueprint for our success. And we're going to keep working hard to approach our future with the same discipline. We're very grateful for the support of all of our employees, our player communities, our partners and our stakeholders and shareholders in this effort. 
And now, here's Coddy to review the highlights of our operations this quarter."
4222231,539748814,1331420,"Activision Blizzard, Inc., Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2017",2017-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Bobby. 2017 continues to be a record-setting year. We surpassed last year's high-water mark for year-to-date revenues and earnings per share, we delivered record avenues in Q3 and outperformed our guidance by more than $200 million on revenue a",1601,"Thank you, Bobby. 2017 continues to be a record-setting year. We surpassed last year's high-water mark for year-to-date revenues and earnings per share, we delivered record avenues in Q3 and outperformed our guidance by more than $200 million on revenue and by $0.13 on non-GAAP EPS. Given this overperformance and the confidence we have on our plans, we are raising our outlook again for the year. 
Our performance is made possible by our incredible teams, whose commitment to delivering creative and commercial excellence engages our communities and enables our company to grow. I want to highlight, in particular, that in Q3, our teams demonstrated 2 important aspects of our strategy: first, the ability to serve our communities with a broad range of experiences, large and small, across full games, expansions, content drops, features and services; and second, the ability to drive meaningful results from those investments. We saw this from Activision and Bungie with the launch of Destiny 2, a major new game for the franchise, which is now the biggest console release for the year in the U.S. We also saw this from Blizzard with Hearthstone's Knights of the Frozen Throne expansion, built upon iconic characters in the lore, which became the franchise's best-performing expansion to date. And we saw this from King with Candy Crush, where continuous ongoing feature and content updates allow this franchise to have its largest quarter since 2013 and return to the #1 position in the U.S. app store. 
King's Q3 performance is worth underscoring for a moment. They reclaimed their #1 mobile publisher spot in the U.S. They grew revenues for the third sequential quarter to the highest level seen in 10 quarters, and they achieved record mobile gross bookings. King did all this by focusing on the player experience in the live titles, and by increasing the pace and success with which they released content, services and future updates. 
Let's now dive deeper into our first strategic pillar, audience reach, which was 384 million Monthly Active Users this quarter. Activision MAUs were a Q3 record of 49 million, driven by launch of Destiny 2 and continued strong performance by the Call of Duty franchise, which helped Activision achieve record Q3 segment revenue and record Q3 operating income. 
Destiny 2 is off to a strong start, and after the PC launch, is now ahead of Destiny 1 on total consumer spend, on time spent per player, attach rate to the expansion packs and average revenue per user. Destiny 2 also achieved a new high-water mark in digital full game downloads at over 50% of console sell-through. 
Now last week, we introduced Destiny to PC gamers for the first time, opening up the franchise to new global audiences and future growth opportunities. We were thrilled to launch on Blizzard's Battle.net platform, where we have an end-to-end connection with the consumer and can drive enhanced player experiences, better insights and better company economics. 
The Call of Duty franchise had a record Q3 MAUs, providing even more momentum around tomorrow's highly anticipated release of Call of Duty: World War II. We're enthusiastic about the return to the gritty, authentic, boots-on-the-ground gameplay that the franchise is known for and innovations like war mode and a brand-new take on Call of Duty Zombies. The game is great. Pre-orders have been strong with a higher digital mix than prior Call of Duty titles. And sentiment is running high among the community. 
As we've said before, we think Activision has the right game at the right time and a complete package for gamers all over the world. Call of Duty has been the #1 console franchise worldwide for 7 of the last 8 years, and we expect to continue that streak this year. 
Blizzard also set a Q3 record for reach with 42 million MAUs, driven by a steady stream of content, feature and service updates. This is now the fourth quarter in a row that Blizzard achieved record quarterly MAUs without a full game release, [ biding ] again the strategy of continuous year-round content and services to engage our audiences and bring in new players. Notably MAUs grew year-over-year for both Overwatch and Hearthstone. And the Overwatch community now has over 35 million registered players. 
King's MAUs were down quarter-over-quarter to 293 million. As discussed on our last call, King has a number of initiatives underway to grow audience size. But these initiatives will take time as the team rolls them out to the community. 
I do want to highlight King's continued success around user engagement. Live updates released this quarter led to record highs, both for the frequency at which players return to play and the overall time spent per player per day. 
And this brings me to our second strategic pillar, engagement. As Bobby mentioned, the company set a new milestone for daily time spent per user at over 50 minutes, placing us on par with Facebook's time per day, which is over 50 minutes across Facebook, Instagram and Messenger. 
Blizzard drove engagement with compelling content updates across much of their portfolio. Overwatch introduced new content for seasonal events, including Summer Games in Q3 and Halloween Terror last month, driving participation in customization items. World of Warcraft released a large content update leading to stable MAUs versus prior quarter and strong participation in value-added services. And Hearthstone saw time spent rise by double-digit percentage year-over-year on the strength of the Knights of the Frozen Throne expansion. 
Blizzard also released a number of key updates on the Battle.net platform. As mentioned, Battle.net welcomed its first non-Blizzard game, Destiny 2 on PC. And ahead of that launch, the Battle.net team released a new mobile app and a strong collection of social features in a desktop app, enabling players to stay connected both inside and outside their games and across devices. 
Our groundbreaking efforts in eSports drive engagement as well by celebrating our players and recognizing their achievements in new ways. As Bobby mentioned, we continue to make great progress on the Overwatch League. The 12 inaugural teams have now unveiled their names and logos. And fans will soon be able to celebrate their favorite teams and players through both physical and digital merchandise. The Overwatch team is hard at work on refining the spectator viewing experience to make the game even more fun to watch, including team jerseys for in-game heroes, and new camera angles to get a better view of gameplay. Preseason competition begins next month at the Blizzard Arena Los Angeles. I was recently at the facility, and can say that the Arena and overall spectator experience are awesome. 
Over the past week, Blizzard hosted opening week competitions across a number franchises for BlizzCon at the Arena. We look forward to seeing some of you at the championship matches later this week in Anaheim. We have a number of other exciting eSports events in the pipeline, including the Call of Duty World League's upcoming season, which features the largest prize pool in franchise history. 
So turning now to our third and final pillar, player investment. In-game services, features and content continue to be a recurring driver for our business, resulting in a Q3 record of over $1 billion for in-game purchases and record year-to-date performance. King was the biggest contributor. Bookings per paying user rose for the 9th quarter in a row to new record, and the total number of paying players also rose for the first time since Q1 of 2016. King had 2 of the top-10 grossing games in the U.S., a level of performance they have held for 4 consecutive years. And as mentioned, Candy Crush returned to the #1 position on the iOS and Android app stores in the U.S. for the quarter, highlighting the durability of the franchise that is now celebrating its fifth anniversary. Candy Crush franchise gross bookings were up 17% quarter-over-quarter and up 22% year-over-year, bringing the franchise back to its strongest bookings since Q4 of 2013. 
King is making progress on their pipeline of new games as well. The social casino game, in partnership with Playstudios, is currently in live testing and is now expected to launch globally in the early part of next year. And a strong pipeline of full game releases are in development for next year and beyond. 
In advertising, King made progress this quarter in testing and product refinement. Player tests continue to show that advertising can improve the player experience and provide...
[Audio Gap]
Around sales, serving and targeting. And during 2018, King expects to ramp inventory with a deliberate and methodical rollout of ad product types, user cohorts and ad load.
Both Activision and Blizzard also had strong quarters for player investment, not only their live games but in reimagined and remastered experiences from their libraries including Blizzard's StarCraft: Remastered and Activision's Crash Bandicoot and Modern Warfare Remastered. Just as importantly, Activision continued to introduce content and feature updates for Call of Duty: Black Ops III, which resulted in relatively stable quarter-over-quarter in-game purchases for that franchise. This approach of continuing to provide content and features for the community wherever they are playing, even years after the initial launch, opens up growth opportunities for years to come. 
In summary, our record performance in the quarter and our record performance year-to-date are the result of our team's passionate dedication to serve the growing communities across our franchises. That dedication is now extending into new growth levers, like eSports, consumer products and advertising. And we're excited about our growth prospects ahead. 
Spencer will now review the Q3 and Q4 outlook in more detail. Spence?"
4222231,539748814,1331420,"Activision Blizzard, Inc., Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2017",2017-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Coddy.

Today, I'll our review our better-than-expected Q3 results as well as our outlook for Q4 and our raised outlook for the full year. I'll start with our Q3 segment results. We delivered record Q3 segment revenue and operating income of 16% and 10%, respectively, and record year-to-date performance. Importantly, we saw strength across all of our segments with each of Activision, Blizzard and King contributing to our overperformance for the quarter compared to guidance. By focusing on our strategic pillars of reach, engagement and player investment across our breadth of leading franchises, we were able to outperform our outlook, deliver strong results in the quarter and prudently invest in long-term growth initiatives. 
King had a great quarter. The business delivered segment revenues of $528 million, up 15% year-over-year; operating income of $208 million, up 51% year-over-year; and operating margin of 39% which was up 9 percentage points year-over-year and all of which also meaningfully overperformed prior quarter. As Coddy mentioned, King's revenues have now grown for the third sequential quarter to the highest they've been since the first quarter of 2015, and mobile gross bookings grew to an all-time record. This is the result of really strong execution by the King team and their commitment to continuous community engagement, data-driven platform insights and capabilities and consistent delivery of new, impactful game features. Following the King acquisition early last year, the team further prioritized resources on Candy Crush and live franchise tiles. We're seeing the benefits of this discipline and focus. 
Activision had a record third quarter, including segment revenues of $759 million; operating income of $261 million; and operating margin of 34%, driven by the successful launch of Destiny 2, the ongoing engagement of Call of Duty community and continued contribution from our library with Crash Bandicoot. Activision doubled revenues and more than doubled operating income year-over-year, leading to record Q3 and record year-to-date financial performance. 
Blizzard's $531 million in segment revenues and $168 million of operating income were driven by the strength of the World of Warcraft, Hearthstone and Overwatch franchises. Performance was down year-over-year as expected, given the difficult comp to last year's Q3, which featured both a World of Warcraft expansion and the first full quarter following Overwatch's release. 
So now let's turn to our consolidated results. Unless otherwise indicated, I'll be referencing non-GAAP figures, which include the impact of deferrals. Please refer to our earnings release for full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations. So for the quarter, we generated GAAP revenues of $1.62 billion, which was $233 million above our August guidance. This includes the net deferral of revenues of $284 million. We generated GAAP EPS of $0.25 and non-GAAP EPS of $0.47 in Q3, which were $0.16 and $0.13 above guidance, respectively. These figures include net deferrals of $0.13. 
For the year-to-date on a GAAP basis, we generated record revenues of $4.97 billion, up 8% year-over-year; and EPS of $1.12, up 19% year-over-year. On a non-GAAP basis, we generated operating margin of 37% and record EPS of $1.73. 
Looking at cash flow and capital structure. We delivered Q3 operating cash flow of $379 million, finishing the quarter with approximately $3.7 billion in cash and investments, about 1/3 of which is held domestically. And we ended the quarter with approximately $4.4 billion of aggregate debt outstanding for a net debt position of roughly $800 million. 
So now let's turn to our Q4 outlook. In Q4, we'll continue our strategy of delivering a steady stream of content and services to our community, including updates for Blizzard's Hearthstone and Overwatch franchises and execution against a robust slate of features and live ops across King's titles. As you know, Activision released Destiny 2 on PC on October 24, and we have plans to release our first expansion and add-on content for that franchise on December 5. And of course, Activision releases the much anticipated Call of Duty: WWII tomorrow. So lots happening this quarter. 
For Q4 on a GAAP basis, we expect net revenues of $1.7 billion with a GAAP deferral of $635 million, product cost of 24%, operating expenses of 67%. We expect GAAP and non-GAAP interest expense of $41 million, a GAAP tax rate of 36% and GAAP and non-GAAP share count of 769 million shares, with GAAP EPS of $0.10. For Q4 on a non-GAAP basis, we expect product cost of 24%, operating expenses of 52%, a tax rate of 27%, a non-GAAP EPS of $0.36 with a GAAP deferral of $0.46. 
Now turning to our raised 2017 full year outlook, which passes through Q3 business overperformance and also raises Q4 outlook. On a GAAP basis, we expect revenues of $6.675 billion with a GAAP deferral of $175 million, product cost of 23%, operating expenses at 58%. Our GAAP interest expense is expected to be $174 million and GAAP tax rate at 14%. We expect 767 million fully diluted shares with both -- for both GAAP and non-GAAP. And GAAP EPS is expected to be $1.22. For 2017 on a non-GAAP basis, we expect product cost of 23%, operating expenses of 43% and non-GAAP interest expense of $156 million with a tax rate of 24% and non-GAAP EPS of $2.08, and we have a GAAP deferral of $0.08. 
So with a robust Q4 product and feature slate, we're working really hard to finish the year strong. We plan to build on that momentum in 2018 and beyond with a franchise-driven strategy across our core interactive games and emerging opportunity areas. As always, we'll pursue these initiatives with fiscal discipline, intense prioritization and a focus on shareholder value.

And this quarter has been the third quarter of sequential gross booking growth. And Candy regains the #1 slot in the U.S. app store, and we are now the leading developer in the U.S. And this has also been, as you heard before, the highest-ever quarter in mobile gross bookings. So I think we're very proud of that, and I'm very proud of what the team has achieved. Now we have achieved these results by executing on our strategy. We used our proven system to deliver content and features that our players love, and we also focus more resources on live operations to increase the cadence of our updates. If you think of our network and of the size of our network and the experience over the years, we have a unique opportunity to better understand really what players like, what players want. And so we developed a portfolio of features and content, and we test these features and content with our players. And when we get this right, we add to the player experience. And this converts into higher player engagement and greater player investment. We can see the results of this virtuous loop in our Q3 results. However, I would like to point out that this quarter, our system delivered an exceptional hit rate, and this has led to a greater monetization growth than usual. So over time, while we don't expect the same level of increase every quarter, we remain confident in our long-term ability to deliver innovation and growth with this rigorous process."

So the teams are now prioritizing this initiative alongside our monetization and engagement initiatives and that, as you heard earlier, have been so successful in driving gross bookings.

In fact, today, we're having our first owners meeting for the Overwatch League, and we view that as a major growth initiative and a very sizable stand-on opportunity for the company. We're building the league for the long term. And in our view, the opportunity rivals what you see in professional sports from a lot of perspectives, but starting with the demographics of the audience. The first season is really about building a solid foundation, delivering world-class viewing experience, distributing the content as broadly as we can to our audiences around the world, making sure that we have that strong and growing global fan base and really building the league revenues in the key 3 areas that we've outlined in the past. And today was a great announcement in that regard in sponsorships, in the sale of broadcasting media rights and in licensing. And we've got a really great group of owners, who I just came from. They -- we've got some of the great entrepreneurs in sports and the great entrepreneurs of the endemic eSports businesses. And they are all focused on driving local marketing campaigns to build out their fan bases in the markets that they serve. We -- I think we're off to a very good start on the sponsorship front with the announcements that we made today. And we will continue to deliver new news and information as we get closer to our January 10 launch date. So it will clearly benefit the franchise from a marketing perspective, but it is a great business opportunity in and of itself. As far as other leagues, right now, we are so focused on executing Overwatch League as best as we can that we're not really planning on announcing anything else right now. And look, I would say that the greatest single benefit that we get from celebrating our professional players is that these are people who make an incredible investment and commitment into our games. And we have the opportunity to really celebrate and recognize and reward them in an exceptional way. And we think that, that has the most tremendous value to our players and to the company."

I'll take this one. Yes, let me first underscore that we've got great retail partners. Retail's going to continue to be important for us on console for some time to come. But that said, this consumer trend that we're see",438,"Okay, thanks, Tim. This is Spence. I'll take this one. Yes, let me first underscore that we've got great retail partners. Retail's going to continue to be important for us on console for some time to come. But that said, this consumer trend that we're seeing and the shift to full game digital download, it's real. It's a strong tailwind for our business, and it's a good thing, that digital connection that brings us closer to our consumer and it creates better economics. It's roughly $10 of direct profit improvement and then it's also indirect savings and margin benefit and even some working capital benefits. But I guess, getting back to your question on the trends, I believe we mentioned last year that our historical digital mix was about 20% to 25% for Call of Duty and in that more than 30% to 40% range for Destiny and Overwatch on console. And historically, we've been seeing that digital mix increase at about 5 points a year. So -- and as you point out, with Destiny 2 digital at over 50% console sell-through so far, we believe we're seeing some acceleration in that digital shift. And while that's a consumer-led move, I'd be remiss if I didn't point out just for a moment that our team put together some really compelling digital premium packages and deserve a lot of credit for creating packages that clearly resonated with Destiny's community and delivered a lot of value. So as we look to kind of finish out the year and into the back half of Q4, we expect retail actually to gain some share as we reach a broader audience. But we do still expect to end the year well ahead of the original Destiny digital mix. I guess, I should point out that when you look at a franchise like Call of Duty, there's different dynamics there. So it's not like-for-like. Call of Duty, as you know, is a more mass-market game. And the more mass you get, the higher the retail share. So while we're seeing higher digital preorders as well on World War II relative to any prior Call of Duty title, that digital mix is still well below what we're seeing for Destiny 2. So we may still also see that acceleration from the 5-point historical rate. But again, it's a consumer-led shift predominantly, and we'll have to wait and just see how the quarter lands. Overall, though, this is good news for our business. It's a nice trend. There's lots of runway to go to expand that digital full-game-sales footprint and grow that connection with our players."

We've got preorders that are strong, awareness and purchase intent which, of course, we also track, are at the top of the scale. And anticipation amongst our community is at a fever pitch that we're very excited about. The other thing that sets us up well is the fact that we had our Monthly Active Users on the Call of Duty franchise at a record high in Q3. And it's always great for our new content launches when we have people hyper engaged with the franchise. So as Coddy mentioned, Call of Duty's been the #1 console franchise worldwide 7 of the last 8 years. We expect to extend that streak this year. And obviously, our community's excited that we're returning to the sort of grittier, boots-on-the-ground, authentic military setting that's the franchise's roots. But we didn't -- it's also important that we didn't just do that. I think that's the headline, that we didn't rest on those laurels. We're also bringing a bunch of really cool innovations, like an entire new way to play multiplayer, called war mode, which is more team-based and collaborative than any mode we've had before. That was a huge hit in the [indiscernible] as well as Sledgehammer's take on Call of Duty Zombies, which is literally sort of jump out of your seat scary, so kind of a really new experience there. I guess, all in all, we just feel like everything's really come together with this game. Whether you're a current fan playing one of our past Call of Duty games or whether you're a fan who's maybe taking a break from the franchise, we feel like this is the game that's going to bring our entire community back together and bring new people in as well."

We've seen engagement up versus last year, when you look at time spent per player and also frequency of play. On the Hearthstone side, Hearthstone continue to do really well.

As you heard, it set a franchise record for expansion sales and also drove strong engagement with time spent, up double-digit percentage year-over-year.

So the advertising business, the first priority in the advertising business has been to build a strong [ F ] team, and we now have industry-proven leadership onboard. And we are making great progress in filling other key roles in the team as we grow the advertising organization. Our vision for the business is to deliver great experiences for the players that also drive results for the marketeers. And we have made progress on several dimensions. We have, first of all, been developing several ad formats with a particular focus on those that are supportive of the gameplay. So an example of such an ad format is rewarded video ads, where players receive an in-game benefit for initiating and for viewing an ad. And in this respect, I'm encouraged by what I'm seeing. We're steadily enabling more of our player cohorts to see ads as a consequence of that. We're also growing traction with advertisers from a range of industries, for example, entertainment, tech, banking. And we're seeing traction in key markets in the U.S. and in the U.K. As a result of this, the team has started increasing the volume of impressions. On the sales side, we're seeing traction in direct sales, and we're also continuing to make resource and partnership investments to build on this momentum we're seeing in programmatic buying. Looking forward, we will continue to develop the business with a focus on aligning the experience of our players with the delivery of key metrics for the advertisers. You heard Coddy earlier, and we expect to ramp up the advertising business during 2018.

We delivered record results and exceeded our prior outlook. Our audience is among the largest of any platform. And this quarter, we achieved a new milestone for daily time spent per user of over 50 minutes, which is in line with some of the most engaging online connected platforms in the world. 
We remain focused on building enduring franchises over the long term and helping to grow strong and highly engaged communities around them. When we focus on serving our communities and investing in new ways to help people connect with our franchises and each other across many different types of content and platforms, we create opportunities for delivering growth across reach, engagement and player investment. 
A great example of this is BlizzCon. Tomorrow, the 11th celebration of the Blizzard community kicks off in Anaheim, California. This is one of the highlights of the year for the company as BlizzCon exemplifies how our games bring people together from all walks of life and all parts of the world. Gaming, through events like BlizzCon, provides players with a true sense of belonging and a recognition that through our games, we can help break down the barriers that seem to be dividing much of the world. 
Over the next couple of days, over 30,000 people will join us from around the globe with millions more joining virtually, including via the live stream and our Virtual Ticket. The attendance and viewership are great examples of the incredible passion of the Blizzard community, whether hosting eSports championships, unveiling epic cinematics, offering compelling new gameplay experiences and consumer products, or simply providing a space for players to connect. BlizzCon reflects the scale and diversity of the broader opportunities open to the company today. 
We remain excited about our growth prospects, many of which are progressing quickly. The launch of the Overwatch League begins with the regular season play on January 10, and we believe 2018 will be the year that eSports becomes even more broad in its appeal. 
This morning, we announced large Overwatch League sponsorship deals with both Hewlett-Packard and Intel. And these are 2 great examples of forward-thinking initiatives by 2 important companies that will help us deliver a great experience for the community and invest in the future of the league. 
Our employees across Activision, Blizzard and King continue to be recognized for their commitments to excellence and execution. We were named to the Fortune 500, Fortune 100 Best Companies to Work For and Fortune's most admired companies. This quarter, we're proud to have been recognized in the top 10 of Fortune's first-ever Future 50 list, which recognize the world's most innovative and forward-looking companies. 
Marrying vision and creativity with consistent execution over the long term has always been the blueprint for our success. And we're going to keep working hard to approach our future with the same discipline. We're very grateful for the support of all of our employees, our player communities, our partners and our stakeholders and shareholders in this effort.

4222231,539748814,1331648,"Activision Blizzard, Inc., Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2017",2017-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Bobby. 2017 continues to be a record-setting year. We surpassed last year's high-water mark for year-to-date revenues and earnings per share, we delivered record avenues in Q3 and outperformed our guidance by more than $200 million on revenue a",1601,"Thank you, Bobby. 2017 continues to be a record-setting year. We surpassed last year's high-water mark for year-to-date revenues and earnings per share, we delivered record avenues in Q3 and outperformed our guidance by more than $200 million on revenue and by $0.13 on non-GAAP EPS. Given this overperformance and the confidence we have on our plans, we are raising our outlook again for the year. 
Our performance is made possible by our incredible teams, whose commitment to delivering creative and commercial excellence engages our communities and enables our company to grow. I want to highlight, in particular, that in Q3, our teams demonstrated 2 important aspects of our strategy: first, the ability to serve our communities with a broad range of experiences, large and small, across full games, expansions, content drops, features and services; and second, the ability to drive meaningful results from those investments. We saw this from Activision and Bungie with the launch of Destiny 2, a major new game for the franchise, which is now the biggest console release for the year in the U.S. We also saw this from Blizzard with Hearthstone's Knights of the Frozen Throne expansion, built upon iconic characters in the lore, which became the franchise's best-performing expansion to date. And we saw this from King with Candy Crush, where continuous ongoing feature and content updates allow this franchise to have its largest quarter since 2013 and return to the #1 position in the U.S. app store. 
King's Q3 performance is worth underscoring for a moment. They reclaimed their #1 mobile publisher spot in the U.S. They grew revenues for the third sequential quarter to the highest level seen in 10 quarters, and they achieved record mobile gross bookings. King did all this by focusing on the player experience in the live titles, and by increasing the pace and success with which they released content, services and future updates. 
Let's now dive deeper into our first strategic pillar, audience reach, which was 384 million Monthly Active Users this quarter. Activision MAUs were a Q3 record of 49 million, driven by launch of Destiny 2 and continued strong performance by the Call of Duty franchise, which helped Activision achieve record Q3 segment revenue and record Q3 operating income. 
Destiny 2 is off to a strong start, and after the PC launch, is now ahead of Destiny 1 on total consumer spend, on time spent per player, attach rate to the expansion packs and average revenue per user. Destiny 2 also achieved a new high-water mark in digital full game downloads at over 50% of console sell-through. 
Now last week, we introduced Destiny to PC gamers for the first time, opening up the franchise to new global audiences and future growth opportunities. We were thrilled to launch on Blizzard's Battle.net platform, where we have an end-to-end connection with the consumer and can drive enhanced player experiences, better insights and better company economics. 
The Call of Duty franchise had a record Q3 MAUs, providing even more momentum around tomorrow's highly anticipated release of Call of Duty: World War II. We're enthusiastic about the return to the gritty, authentic, boots-on-the-ground gameplay that the franchise is known for and innovations like war mode and a brand-new take on Call of Duty Zombies. The game is great. Pre-orders have been strong with a higher digital mix than prior Call of Duty titles. And sentiment is running high among the community. 
As we've said before, we think Activision has the right game at the right time and a complete package for gamers all over the world. Call of Duty has been the #1 console franchise worldwide for 7 of the last 8 years, and we expect to continue that streak this year. 
Blizzard also set a Q3 record for reach with 42 million MAUs, driven by a steady stream of content, feature and service updates. This is now the fourth quarter in a row that Blizzard achieved record quarterly MAUs without a full game release, [ biding ] again the strategy of continuous year-round content and services to engage our audiences and bring in new players. Notably MAUs grew year-over-year for both Overwatch and Hearthstone. And the Overwatch community now has over 35 million registered players. 
King's MAUs were down quarter-over-quarter to 293 million. As discussed on our last call, King has a number of initiatives underway to grow audience size. But these initiatives will take time as the team rolls them out to the community. 
I do want to highlight King's continued success around user engagement. Live updates released this quarter led to record highs, both for the frequency at which players return to play and the overall time spent per player per day. 
And this brings me to our second strategic pillar, engagement. As Bobby mentioned, the company set a new milestone for daily time spent per user at over 50 minutes, placing us on par with Facebook's time per day, which is over 50 minutes across Facebook, Instagram and Messenger. 
Blizzard drove engagement with compelling content updates across much of their portfolio. Overwatch introduced new content for seasonal events, including Summer Games in Q3 and Halloween Terror last month, driving participation in customization items. World of Warcraft released a large content update leading to stable MAUs versus prior quarter and strong participation in value-added services. And Hearthstone saw time spent rise by double-digit percentage year-over-year on the strength of the Knights of the Frozen Throne expansion. 
Blizzard also released a number of key updates on the Battle.net platform. As mentioned, Battle.net welcomed its first non-Blizzard game, Destiny 2 on PC. And ahead of that launch, the Battle.net team released a new mobile app and a strong collection of social features in a desktop app, enabling players to stay connected both inside and outside their games and across devices. 
Our groundbreaking efforts in eSports drive engagement as well by celebrating our players and recognizing their achievements in new ways. As Bobby mentioned, we continue to make great progress on the Overwatch League. The 12 inaugural teams have now unveiled their names and logos. And fans will soon be able to celebrate their favorite teams and players through both physical and digital merchandise. The Overwatch team is hard at work on refining the spectator viewing experience to make the game even more fun to watch, including team jerseys for in-game heroes, and new camera angles to get a better view of gameplay. Preseason competition begins next month at the Blizzard Arena Los Angeles. I was recently at the facility, and can say that the Arena and overall spectator experience are awesome. 
Over the past week, Blizzard hosted opening week competitions across a number franchises for BlizzCon at the Arena. We look forward to seeing some of you at the championship matches later this week in Anaheim. We have a number of other exciting eSports events in the pipeline, including the Call of Duty World League's upcoming season, which features the largest prize pool in franchise history. 
So turning now to our third and final pillar, player investment. In-game services, features and content continue to be a recurring driver for our business, resulting in a Q3 record of over $1 billion for in-game purchases and record year-to-date performance. King was the biggest contributor. Bookings per paying user rose for the 9th quarter in a row to new record, and the total number of paying players also rose for the first time since Q1 of 2016. King had 2 of the top-10 grossing games in the U.S., a level of performance they have held for 4 consecutive years. And as mentioned, Candy Crush returned to the #1 position on the iOS and Android app stores in the U.S. for the quarter, highlighting the durability of the franchise that is now celebrating its fifth anniversary. Candy Crush franchise gross bookings were up 17% quarter-over-quarter and up 22% year-over-year, bringing the franchise back to its strongest bookings since Q4 of 2013. 
King is making progress on their pipeline of new games as well. The social casino game, in partnership with Playstudios, is currently in live testing and is now expected to launch globally in the early part of next year. And a strong pipeline of full game releases are in development for next year and beyond. 
In advertising, King made progress this quarter in testing and product refinement. Player tests continue to show that advertising can improve the player experience and provide...
[Audio Gap]
Around sales, serving and targeting. And during 2018, King expects to ramp inventory with a deliberate and methodical rollout of ad product types, user cohorts and ad load.
Both Activision and Blizzard also had strong quarters for player investment, not only our live games but in reimagined and remastered experiences from their libraries including Blizzard's StarCraft: Remastered and Activision's Crash Bandicoot and Modern Warfare Remastered. Just as importantly, Activision continued to introduce content and feature updates for Call of Duty: Black Ops III, which resulted in relatively stable quarter-over-quarter in-game purchases for that franchise. This approach of continuing to provide content and features for the community wherever they are playing, even years after the initial launch, opens up growth opportunities for years to come. 
In summary, our record performance in the quarter and our record performance year-to-date are the result of our team's passionate dedication to serve the growing communities across our franchises. That dedication is now extending into new growth levers, like eSports, consumer products and advertising. And we're excited about our growth prospects ahead.

4222231,539748814,1331648,"Activision Blizzard, Inc., Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2017",2017-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Coddy.

We delivered record Q3 segment revenue and operating income of 16% an",955,"Thanks, Coddy. Today, I'll our review our better-than-expected Q3 results as well as our outlook for Q4 and our raised outlook for the full year. I'll start with our Q3 segment results. We delivered record Q3 segment revenue and operating income of 16% and 10%, respectively, and record year-to-date performance. Importantly, we saw strength across all of our segments with each of Activision, Blizzard and King contributing to our overperformance for the quarter compared to guidance. By focusing on our strategic pillars of reach, engagement and player investment across our breadth of leading franchises, we were able to outperform our outlook, deliver strong results in the quarter and prudently invest in long-term growth initiatives. 
King had a great quarter. The business delivered segment revenues of $528 million, up 15% year-over-year; operating income of $208 million, up 51% year-over-year; and operating margin of 39% which was up 9 percentage points year-over-year and all of which also meaningfully overperformed prior quarter. As Coddy mentioned, King's revenues have now grown for the third sequential quarter to the highest they've been since the first quarter of 2015, and mobile gross bookings grew to an all-time record. This is the result of really strong execution by the King team and their commitment to continuous community engagement, data-driven platform insights and capabilities and consistent delivery of new, impactful game features. Following the King acquisition early last year, the team further prioritized resources on Candy Crush and live franchise tiles. We're seeing the benefits of this discipline and focus. 
Activision had a record third quarter, including segment revenues of $759 million; operating income of $261 million; and operating margin of 34%, driven by the successful launch of Destiny 2, the ongoing engagement of Call of Duty community and continued contribution from our library with Crash Bandicoot. Activision doubled revenues and more than doubled operating income year-over-year, leading to record Q3 and record year-to-date financial performance. 
Blizzard's $531 million in segment revenues and $168 million of operating income were driven by the strength of the World of Warcraft, Hearthstone and Overwatch franchises. Performance was down year-over-year as expected, given the difficult comp to last year's Q3, which featured both a World of Warcraft expansion and the first full quarter following Overwatch's release. 
So now let's turn to our consolidated results. Unless otherwise indicated, I'll be referencing non-GAAP figures, which include the impact of deferrals. Please refer to our earnings release for full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations. So for the quarter, we generated GAAP revenues of $1.62 billion, which was $233 million above our August guidance. This includes the net deferral of revenues of $284 million. We generated GAAP EPS of $0.25 and non-GAAP EPS of $0.47 in Q3, which were $0.16 and $0.13 above guidance, respectively. These figures include net deferrals of $0.13. 
For the year-to-date on a GAAP basis, we generated record revenues of $4.97 billion, up 8% year-over-year; and EPS of $1.12, up 19% year-over-year. On a non-GAAP basis, we generated operating margin of 37% and record EPS of $1.73. 
Looking at cash flow and capital structure. We delivered Q3 operating cash flow of $379 million, finishing the quarter with approximately $3.7 billion in cash and investments, about 1/3 of which is held domestically. And we ended the quarter with approximately $4.4 billion of aggregate debt outstanding for a net debt position of roughly $800 million. 
So now let's turn to our Q4 outlook. In Q4, we'll continue our strategy of delivering a steady stream of content and services to our community, including updates for Blizzard's Hearthstone and Overwatch franchises and execution against a robust slate of features and live ops across King's titles. As you know, Activision released Destiny 2 on PC on October 24, and we have plans to release our first expansion and add-on content for that franchise on December 5. And of course, Activision releases the much anticipated Call of Duty: WWII tomorrow. So lots happening this quarter. 
For Q4 on a GAAP basis, we expect net revenues of $1.7 billion with a GAAP deferral of $635 million, product cost of 24%, operating expenses of 67%. We expect GAAP and non-GAAP interest expense of $41 million, a GAAP tax rate of 36% and GAAP and non-GAAP share count of 769 million shares, with GAAP EPS of $0.10. For Q4 on a non-GAAP basis, we expect product cost of 24%, operating expenses of 52%, a tax rate of 27%, a non-GAAP EPS of $0.36 with a GAAP deferral of $0.46. 
Now turning to our raised 2017 full year outlook, which passes through Q3 business overperformance and also raises Q4 outlook. On a GAAP basis, we expect revenues of $6.675 billion with a GAAP deferral of $175 million, product cost of 23%, operating expenses at 58%. Our GAAP interest expense is expected to be $174 million and GAAP tax rate at 14%. We expect 767 million fully diluted shares with both -- for both GAAP and non-GAAP. And GAAP EPS is expected to be $1.22. For 2017 on a non-GAAP basis, we expect product cost of 23%, operating expenses of 43% and non-GAAP interest expense of $156 million with a tax rate of 24% and non-GAAP EPS of $2.08, and we have a GAAP deferral of $0.08. 
So with a robust Q4 product and feature slate, we're working really hard to finish the year strong. We plan to build on that momentum in 2018 and beyond with a franchise-driven strategy across our core interactive games and emerging opportunity areas. As always, we'll pursue these initiatives with fiscal discipline, intense prioritization and a focus on shareholder value.

And this quarter has been the third quarter of sequential gross booking growth. And Candy regains the #1 slot in the U.S. app store, and we are now the leading developer in the U.S. And this has also been, as you heard before, the highest-ever quarter in mobile gross bookings. So I think we're very proud of that, and I'm very proud of what the team has achieved. Now we have achieved these results by executing on our strategy. We used our proven system to deliver content and features that our players love, and we also focus more resources on live operations to increase the cadence of our updates. If you think of our network and of the size of our network and the experience over the years, we have a unique opportunity to better understand really what players like, what players want. And so we developed a portfolio of features and content, and we test these features and content with our players. And when we get this right, we add to the player experience. And this converts into higher player engagement and greater player investment. We can see the results of this virtuous loop in our Q3 results. However, I would like to point out that this quarter, our system delivered an exceptional hit rate, and this has led to a greater monetization growth than usual. So over time, while we don't expect the same level of increase every quarter, we remain confident in our long-term ability to deliver innovation and growth with this rigorous process."

It's -- we're focusing on marketing, and we're focusing on product. On the marketing side, the goal is to drive new installs and to regain left players. Here, we're focused on innovating how we market our live titles. So as an example of innovation is the partnership with CBS and Lionsgate in the U.S. for the Candy Crush TV show. On the product side, here we focus on the live games. And we're working on new content and new features to drive greater player retention. So the teams are now prioritizing this initiative alongside our monetization and engagement initiatives that, as you heard earlier, have been so successful in driving gross bookings. On top of these initiatives, we're also working on new game launches. New game launches have always been proven as driving reach and having a positive impact on reach. And our development teams are now working really hard on prototyping and developing new titles for the coming years. I would like to point out that reach is everyone's problem. We're always -- we're all focused on reach, and changing the reach trajectory, however, will take time. We have the team, and we have the focus to do it."

In fact, today, we're having our first owners meeting for the Overwatch League, and we view that as a major growth initiative and a very sizable stand-on opportunity for the company. We're building the league for the long term. And in our view, the opportunity rivals what you see in professional sports from a lot of perspectives, but starting with the demographics of the audience. The first season is really about building a solid foundation, delivering world-class viewing experience, distributing the content as broadly as we can to our audiences around the world, making sure that we have that strong and growing global fan base and really building the league revenues in the key 3 areas that we've outlined in the past. And today was a great announcement in that regard in sponsorships, in the sale of broadcasting media rights and in licensing. And we've got a really great group of owners, who I just came from. They -- we've got some of the great entrepreneurs in sports and the great entrepreneurs of the endemic eSports businesses. And they are all focused on driving local marketing campaigns to build out their fan bases in the markets that they serve. We -- I think we're off to a very good start on the sponsorship front with the announcements that we made today. And we will continue to deliver new news and information as we get closer to our January 10 launch date. So it will clearly benefit the franchise from a marketing perspective, but it is a great business opportunity in and of itself. As far as other leagues, right now, we are so focused on executing Overwatch League as best as we can that we're not really planning on announcing anything else right now. And look, I would say that the greatest single benefit that we get from celebrating our professional players is that these are people who make an incredible investment and commitment into our games. And we have the opportunity to really celebrate and recognize and reward them in an exceptional way. And we think that, that has the most tremendous value to our players and to the company."

With just a month of sales, it's already, as Coddy mentioned, the best-selling console game in the year-to-date in the United States.

Hours per player reached a new franchise record. And average revenue per user was up as well. So we have -- we also have a very strong attach rate to the expansion patch, which we think is a great indication of our fans' ongoing commitment to engagement with the franchise. So we know our fans wanted a game with a great, engaging story with great characters and a more accessible experience overall. And we think we lived up to their high expectations on those measures. And we also know that our fans are already hungry for more. And as I've said on past calls, we now have not just Bungie but multiple AAA teams developing content for Destiny, and we're planning on having more content than ever before to support Destiny 2, starting with the first expansion that's coming on December 5. And also, we launched Destiny on PC, which we expect to open up new geographies where we think Destiny is going to be really well received. So we've got events coming.

Retail's going to continue to be important for us on console for some time to come. But that said, this consumer trend that we're seeing and the shift to full game digital download, it's real. It's a strong tailwind for our business, and it's a good thing, that digital connection that brings us closer to our consumer and it creates better economics. It's roughly $10 of direct profit improvement and then it's also indirect savings and margin benefit and even some working capital benefits. But I guess, getting back to your question on the trends, I believe we mentioned last year that our historical digital mix was about 20% to 25% for Call of Duty and in that more than 30% to 40% range for Destiny and Overwatch on console. And historically, we've been seeing that digital mix increase at about 5 points a year. So -- and as you point out, with Destiny 2 digital at over 50% console sell-through so far, we believe we're seeing some acceleration in that digital shift. And while that's a consumer-led move, I'd be remiss if I didn't point out just for a moment that our team put together some really compelling digital premium packages and deserve a lot of credit for creating packages that clearly resonated with Destiny's community and delivered a lot of value. So as we look to kind of finish out the year and into the back half of Q4, we expect retail actually to gain some share as we reach a broader audience. But we do still expect to end the year well ahead of the original Destiny digital mix. I guess, I should point out that when you look at a franchise like Call of Duty, there's different dynamics there. So it's not like-for-like. Call of Duty, as you know, is a more mass-market game. And the more mass you get, the higher the retail share. So while we're seeing higher digital preorders as well on World War II relative to any prior Call of Duty title, that digital mix is still well below what we're seeing for Destiny 2. So we may still also see that acceleration from the 5-point historical rate. But again, it's a consumer-led shift predominantly, and we'll have to wait and just see how the quarter lands. Overall, though, this is good news for our business. It's a nice trend. There's lots of runway to go to expand that digital full-game-sales footprint and grow that connection with our players."

The other thing that sets us up well is the fact that we had our Monthly Active Users on the Call of Duty franchise at a record high in Q3. And it's always great for our new content launches when we have people hyper engaged with the franchise. So as Coddy mentioned, Call of Duty's been the #1 console franchise worldwide 7 of the last 8 years. We expect to extend that streak this year. And obviously, our community's excited that we're returning to the sort of grittier, boots-on-the-ground, authentic military setting that's the franchise's roots. But we didn't -- it's also important that we didn't just do that. I think that's the headline, that we didn't rest on those laurels. We're also bringing a bunch of really cool innovations, like an entire new way to play multiplayer, called war mode, which is more team-based and collaborative than any mode we've had before. That was a huge hit in the [indiscernible] as well as Sledgehammer's take on Call of Duty Zombies, which is literally sort of jump out of your seat scary, so kind of a really new experience there.

So the advertising business, the first priority in the advertising business has been to build a strong [ S ] team, and we now have industry-proven leadership onboard. And we are making great progress in filling other key roles in the team as we grow the advertising organization. Our vision for the business is to deliver great experiences for the players that also drive results for the marketeers. And we have made progress on several dimensions. We have, first of all, been developing several ad formats with a particular focus on those that are supportive of the gameplay. So an example of such an ad format is rewarded video ads, where players receive an in-game benefit for initiating and for viewing an ad. And in this respect, I'm encouraged by what I'm seeing. We're steadily enabling more of our player cohorts to see ads as a consequence of that. We're also growing traction with advertisers from a range of industries, for example, entertainment, tech, banking. And we're seeing traction in key markets in the U.S. and in the U.K. As a result of this, the team has started increasing the volume of impressions. On the sales side, we're seeing traction in direct sales, and we're also continuing to make resource and partnership investments to build on this momentum we're seeing in programmatic buying. Looking forward, we will continue to develop the business with a focus on aligning the experience of our players with the delivery of key metrics for the advertisers. You heard Coddy earlier, and we expect to ramp up the advertising business during 2018. So if I have to summarize, in short, I'm very excited about the opportunity that advertising provides for King, for our players and for advertisers."

We delivered record results and exceeded our prior outlook. Our audience is among the largest of any platform. And this quarter, we achieved a new milestone for daily time spent per user of over 50 minutes, which is in line with some of the most engaging online connected platforms in the world. 
We remain focused on building enduring franchises over the long term and helping to grow strong and highly engaged communities around them. When we focus on serving our communities and investing in new ways to help people connect with our franchises and each other across many different types of content and platforms, we create opportunities for delivering growth across reach, engagement and player investment. 
A great example of this is BlizzCon. Tomorrow, the 11th celebration of the Blizzard community kicks off in Anaheim, California. This is one of the highlights of the year for the company as BlizzCon exemplifies how our games bring people together from all walks of life and all parts of the world. Gaming, through events like BlizzCon, provides players with a true sense of belonging and a recognition that through our games, we can help break down the barriers that seem to be dividing much of the world. 
Over the next couple of days, over 30,000 people will join us from around the globe with millions more joining virtually, including via the live stream and our Virtual Ticket. The attendance and viewership are great examples of the incredible passion of the Blizzard community, whether hosting eSports championships, unveiling epic cinematics, offering compelling new gameplay experiences and consumer products, or simply providing a space for players to connect. BlizzCon reflects the scale and diversity of the broader opportunities open to the company today. 
We remain excited about our growth prospects, many of which are progressing quickly. The launch of the Overwatch League begins with the regular season play on January 10, and we believe 2018 will be the year that eSports becomes even more broad in its appeal. 
This morning, we announced large Overwatch League sponsorship deals with both Hewlett-Packard and Intel. And these are 2 great examples of forward-thinking initiatives by 2 important companies that will help us deliver a great experience for the community and invest in the future of the league. 
Our employees across Activision, Blizzard and King continue to be recognized for their commitments to excellence and execution. We were named to the Fortune 500, Fortune 100 Best Companies to Work For and Fortune's most admired companies. This quarter, we're proud to have been recognized in the top 10 of Fortune's first-ever Future 50 list, which recognize the world's most innovative and forward-looking companies. 
Marrying vision and creativity with consistent execution over the long term has always been the blueprint for our success. And we're going to keep working hard to approach our future with the same discipline. We're very grateful for the support of all of our employees, our player communities, our partners and our stakeholders and shareholders in this effort. 
And now, here's Coddy to review the highlights of our operations this quarter."

We surpassed last year's high-water mark for year-to-date revenues and earnings per share, we delivered record avenues in Q3 and outperformed our guidance by more than $200 million on revenue a",1601,"Thank you, Bobby. 2017 continues to be a record-setting year. We surpassed last year's high-water mark for year-to-date revenues and earnings per share, we delivered record avenues in Q3 and outperformed our guidance by more than $200 million on revenue and by $0.13 on non-GAAP EPS. Given this overperformance and the confidence we have on our plans, we are raising our outlook again for the year. 
Our performance is made possible by our incredible teams, whose commitment to delivering creative and commercial excellence engages our communities and enables our company to grow. I want to highlight, in particular, that in Q3, our teams demonstrated 2 important aspects of our strategy: first, the ability to serve our communities with a broad range of experiences, large and small, across full games, expansions, content drops, features and services; and second, the ability to drive meaningful results from those investments. We saw this from Activision and Bungie with the launch of Destiny 2, a major new game for the franchise, which is now the biggest console release for the year in the U.S. We also saw this from Blizzard with Hearthstone's Knights of the Frozen Throne expansion, built upon iconic characters in the lore, which became the franchise's best-performing expansion to date. And we saw this from King with Candy Crush, where continuous ongoing feature and content updates allow this franchise to have its largest quarter since 2013 and return to the #1 position in the U.S. app store. 
King's Q3 performance is worth underscoring for a moment. They reclaimed their #1 mobile publisher spot in the U.S. They grew revenues for the third sequential quarter to the highest level seen in 10 quarters, and they achieved record mobile gross bookings. King did all this by focusing on the player experience in the live titles, and by increasing the pace and success with which they released content, services and future updates. 
Let's now dive deeper into our first strategic pillar, audience reach, which was 384 million Monthly Active Users this quarter. Activision MAUs were a Q3 record of 49 million, driven by launch of Destiny 2 and continued strong performance by the Call of Duty franchise, which helped Activision achieve record Q3 segment revenue and record Q3 operating income. 
Destiny 2 is off to a strong start, and after the PC launch, is now ahead of Destiny 1 on total consumer spend, on time spent per player, attach rate to the expansion packs and average revenue per user. Destiny 2 also achieved a new high-water mark in digital full game downloads at over 50% of console sell-through. 
Now last week, we introduced Destiny to PC gamers for the first time, opening up the franchise to new global audiences and future growth opportunities. We were thrilled to launch on Blizzard's Battle.net platform, where we have an end-to-end connection with the consumer and can drive enhanced player experiences, better insights and better company economics. 
The Call of Duty franchise had a record Q3 MAUs, providing even more momentum around tomorrow's highly anticipated release of Call of Duty: World War II. We're enthusiastic about the return to the gritty, authentic, boots-on-the-ground gameplay that the franchise is known for and innovations like war mode and a brand-new take on Call of Duty Zombies. The game is great. Pre-orders have been strong with a higher digital mix than prior Call of Duty titles. And sentiment is running high among the community. 
As we've said before, we think Activision has the right game at the right time and a complete package for gamers all over the world. Call of Duty has been the #1 console franchise worldwide for 7 of the last 8 years, and we expect to continue that streak this year. 
Blizzard also set a Q3 record for reach with 42 million MAUs, driven by a steady stream of content, feature and service updates. This is now the fourth quarter in a row that Blizzard achieved record quarterly MAUs without a full game release, [ biding ] again the strategy of continuous year-round content and services to engage our audiences and bring in new players. Notably MAUs grew year-over-year for both Overwatch and Hearthstone. And the Overwatch community now has over 35 million registered players. 
King's MAUs were down quarter-over-quarter to 293 million. As discussed on our last call, King has a number of initiatives underway to grow audience size. But these initiatives will take time as the team rolls them out to the community. 
I do want to highlight King's continued success around user engagement. Live updates released this quarter led to record highs, both for the frequency at which players return to play and the overall time spent per player per day. 
And this brings me to our second strategic pillar, engagement. As Bobby mentioned, the company set a new milestone for daily time spent per user at over 50 minutes, placing us on par with Facebook's time per day, which is over 50 minutes across Facebook, Instagram and Messenger. 
Blizzard drove engagement with compelling content updates across much of their portfolio. Overwatch introduced new content for seasonal events, including Summer Games in Q3 and Halloween Terror last month, driving participation in customization items. World of Warcraft released a large content update leading to stable MAUs versus prior quarter and strong participation in value-added services. And Hearthstone saw time spent rise by double-digit percentage year-over-year on the strength of the Knights of the Frozen Throne expansion. 
Blizzard also released a number of key updates on the Battle.net platform. As mentioned, Battle.net welcomed its first non-Blizzard game, Destiny 2 on PC. And ahead of that launch, the Battle.net team released a new mobile app and a strong collection of social features in a desktop app, enabling players to stay connected both inside and outside their games and across devices. 
Our groundbreaking efforts in eSports drive engagement as well by celebrating our players and recognizing their achievements in new ways. As Bobby mentioned, we continue to make great progress on the Overwatch League. The 12 inaugural teams have now unveiled their names and logos. And fans will soon be able to celebrate their favorite teams and players through both physical and digital merchandise. The Overwatch team is hard at work on refining the spectator viewing experience to make the game even more fun to watch, including team jerseys for in-game heroes, and new camera angles to get a better view of gameplay. Preseason competition begins next month at the Blizzard Arena Los Angeles. I was recently at the facility, and can say that the Arena and overall spectator experience are awesome. 
Over the past week, Blizzard hosted opening week competitions across a number franchises for BlizzCon at the Arena. We look forward to seeing some of you at the championship matches later this week in Anaheim. We have a number of other exciting eSports events in the pipeline, including the Call of Duty World League's upcoming season, which features the largest prize pool in franchise history. 
So turning now to our third and final pillar, player investment. In-game services, features and content continue to be a recurring driver for our business, resulting in a Q3 record of over $1 billion for in-game purchases and record year-to-date performance. King was the biggest contributor. Bookings per paying user rose for the 9th quarter in a row to new record, and the total number of paying players also rose for the first time since Q1 of 2016. King had 2 of the top-10 grossing games in the U.S., a level of performance they have held for 4 consecutive years. And as mentioned, Candy Crush returned to the #1 position on the iOS and Android app stores in the U.S. for the quarter, highlighting the durability of the franchise that is now celebrating its fifth anniversary. Candy Crush franchise gross bookings were up 17% quarter-over-quarter and up 22% year-over-year, bringing the franchise back to its strongest bookings since Q4 of 2013. 
King is making progress on their pipeline of new games as well. The social casino game, in partnership with Playstudios, is currently in live testing and is now expected to launch globally in the early part of next year. And a strong pipeline of full game releases are in development for next year and beyond. 
In advertising, King made progress this quarter in testing and product refinement. Player tests continue to show that advertising can improve the player experience and provide...
[Audio Gap]
Around sales, serving and targeting. And during 2018, King expects to ramp inventory with a deliberate and methodical rollout of ad product types, user cohorts and ad load.
Both Activision and Blizzard also had strong quarters for player investment, not only our live games but in reimagined and remastered experiences from their libraries including Blizzard's StarCraft: Remastered and Activision's Crash Bandicoot and Modern Warfare Remastered. Just as importantly, Activision continued to introduce content and feature updates for Call of Duty: Black Ops III, which resulted in relatively stable quarter-over-quarter in-game purchases for that franchise. This approach of continuing to provide content and features for the community wherever they are playing, even years after the initial launch, opens up growth opportunities for years to come. 
In summary, our record performance in the quarter and our record performance year-to-date are the result of our team's passionate dedication to serve the growing communities across our franchises. That dedication is now extending into new growth levers, like eSports, consumer products and advertising. And we're excited about our growth prospects ahead.

Today, I'll our review our better-than-expected Q3 results as well as our outlook for Q4 and our raised outlook for the full year. I'll start with our Q3 segment results. We delivered record Q3 segment revenue and operating income of 16% and 10%, respectively, and record year-to-date performance. Importantly, we saw strength across all of our segments with each of Activision, Blizzard and King contributing to our overperformance for the quarter compared to guidance. By focusing on our strategic pillars of reach, engagement and player investment across our breadth of leading franchises, we were able to outperform our outlook, deliver strong results in the quarter and prudently invest in long-term growth initiatives. 
King had a great quarter. The business delivered segment revenues of $528 million, up 15% year-over-year; operating income of $208 million, up 51% year-over-year; and operating margin of 39% which was up 9 percentage points year-over-year and all of which also meaningfully overperformed prior quarter. As Coddy mentioned, King's revenues have now grown for the third sequential quarter to the highest they've been since the first quarter of 2015, and mobile gross bookings grew to an all-time record. This is the result of really strong execution by the King team and their commitment to continuous community engagement, data-driven platform insights and capabilities and consistent delivery of new, impactful game features. Following the King acquisition early last year, the team further prioritized resources on Candy Crush and live franchise tiles. We're seeing the benefits of this discipline and focus. 
Activision had a record third quarter, including segment revenues of $759 million; operating income of $261 million; and operating margin of 34%, driven by the successful launch of Destiny 2, the ongoing engagement of Call of Duty community and continued contribution from our library with Crash Bandicoot. Activision doubled revenues and more than doubled operating income year-over-year, leading to record Q3 and record year-to-date financial performance. 
Blizzard's $531 million in segment revenues and $168 million of operating income were driven by the strength of the World of Warcraft, Hearthstone and Overwatch franchises. Performance was down year-over-year as expected, given the difficult comp to last year's Q3, which featured both a World of Warcraft expansion and the first full quarter following Overwatch's release. 
So now let's turn to our consolidated results. Unless otherwise indicated, I'll be referencing non-GAAP figures, which include the impact of deferrals. Please refer to our earnings release for full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations. So for the quarter, we generated GAAP revenues of $1.62 billion, which was $233 million above our August guidance. This includes the net deferral of revenues of $284 million. We generated GAAP EPS of $0.25 and non-GAAP EPS of $0.47 in Q3, which were $0.16 and $0.13 above guidance, respectively. These figures include net deferrals of $0.13. 
For the year-to-date on a GAAP basis, we generated record revenues of $4.97 billion, up 8% year-over-year; and EPS of $1.12, up 19% year-over-year. On a non-GAAP basis, we generated operating margin of 37% and record EPS of $1.73. 
Looking at cash flow and capital structure. We delivered Q3 operating cash flow of $379 million, finishing the quarter with approximately $3.7 billion in cash and investments, about 1/3 of which is held domestically. And we ended the quarter with approximately $4.4 billion of aggregate debt outstanding for a net debt position of roughly $800 million. 
So now let's turn to our Q4 outlook. In Q4, we'll continue our strategy of delivering a steady stream of content and services to our community, including updates for Blizzard's Hearthstone and Overwatch franchises and execution against a robust slate of features and live ops across King's titles. As you know, Activision released Destiny 2 on PC on October 24, and we have plans to release our first expansion and add-on content for that franchise on December 5. And of course, Activision releases the much anticipated Call of Duty: WWII tomorrow. So lots happening this quarter. 
For Q4 on a GAAP basis, we expect net revenues of $1.7 billion with a GAAP deferral of $635 million, product cost of 24%, operating expenses of 67%. We expect GAAP and non-GAAP interest expense of $41 million, a GAAP tax rate of 36% and GAAP and non-GAAP share count of 769 million shares, with GAAP EPS of $0.10. For Q4 on a non-GAAP basis, we expect product cost of 24%, operating expenses of 52%, a tax rate of 27%, a non-GAAP EPS of $0.36 with a GAAP deferral of $0.46. 
Now turning to our raised 2017 full year outlook, which passes through Q3 business overperformance and also raises Q4 outlook. On a GAAP basis, we expect revenues of $6.675 billion with a GAAP deferral of $175 million, product cost of 23%, operating expenses at 58%. Our GAAP interest expense is expected to be $174 million and GAAP tax rate at 14%. We expect 767 million fully diluted shares with both -- for both GAAP and non-GAAP. And GAAP EPS is expected to be $1.22. For 2017 on a non-GAAP basis, we expect product cost of 23%, operating expenses of 43% and non-GAAP interest expense of $156 million with a tax rate of 24% and non-GAAP EPS of $2.08, and we have a GAAP deferral of $0.08. 
So with a robust Q4 product and feature slate, we're working really hard to finish the year strong. We plan to build on that momentum in 2018 and beyond with a franchise-driven strategy across our core interactive games and emerging opportunity areas. As always, we'll pursue these initiatives with fiscal discipline, intense prioritization and a focus on shareholder value.

So I think we're very proud of that, and I'm very proud of what the team has achieved. Now we have achieved these results by executing on our strategy. We used our proven system to deliver content and features that our players love, and we also focus more resources on live operations to increase the cadence of our updates. If you think of our network and of the size of our network and the experience over the years, we have a unique opportunity to better understand really what players like, what players want. And so we developed a portfolio of features and content, and we test these features and content with our players. And when we get this right, we add to the player experience. And this converts into higher player engagement and greater player investment. We can see the results of this virtuous loop in our Q3 results. However, I would like to point out that this quarter, our system delivered an exceptional hit rate, and this has led to a greater monetization growth than usual. So over time, while we don't expect the same level of increase every quarter, we remain confident in our long-term ability to deliver innovation and growth with this rigorous process."

It's -- we're focusing on marketing, and we're focusing on product. On the marketing side, the goal is to drive new installs and to regain left players. Here, we're focused on innovating how we market our live titles. So as an example of innovation is the partnership with CBS and Lionsgate in the U.S. for the Candy Crush TV show. On the product side, here we focus on the live games. And we're working on new content and new features to drive greater player retention. So the teams are now prioritizing this initiative alongside our monetization and engagement initiatives that, as you heard earlier, have been so successful in driving gross bookings. On top of these initiatives, we're also working on new game launches. New game launches have always been proven as driving reach and having a positive impact on reach. And our development teams are now working really hard on prototyping and developing new titles for the coming years. I would like to point out that reach is everyone's problem. We're always -- we're all focused on reach, and changing the reach trajectory, however, will take time. We have the team, and we have the focus to do it."

In fact, today, we're having our first owners meeting for the Overwatch League, and we view that as a major growth initiative and a very sizable stand-on opportunity for the company. We're building the league for the long term. And in our view, the opportunity rivals what you see in professional sports from a lot of perspectives, but starting with the demographics of the audience. The first season is really about building a solid foundation, delivering world-class viewing experience, distributing the content as broadly as we can to our audiences around the world, making sure that we have that strong and growing global fan base and really building the league revenues in the key 3 areas that we've outlined in the past. And today was a great announcement in that regard in sponsorships, in the sale of broadcasting media rights and in licensing. And we've got a really great group of owners, who I just came from. They -- we've got some of the great entrepreneurs in sports and the great entrepreneurs of the endemic eSports businesses. And they are all focused on driving local marketing campaigns to build out their fan bases in the markets that they serve. We -- I think we're off to a very good start on the sponsorship front with the announcements that we made today. And we will continue to deliver new news and information as we get closer to our January 10 launch date. So it will clearly benefit the franchise from a marketing perspective, but it is a great business opportunity in and of itself. As far as other leagues, right now, we are so focused on executing Overwatch League as best as we can that we're not really planning on announcing anything else right now. And look, I would say that the greatest single benefit that we get from celebrating our professional players is that these are people who make an incredible investment and commitment into our games. And we have the opportunity to really celebrate and recognize and reward them in an exceptional way. And we think that, that has the most tremendous value to our players and to the company."

With just a month of sales, it's already, as Coddy mentioned, the best-selling console game in the year-to-date in the United States. But beyond that, we've also improved on pretty much all the other important metrics that we look at. We're now ahead of Destiny 1 in total consumer spend. Hours per player reached a new franchise record. And average revenue per user was up as well. So we have -- we also have a very strong attach rate to the expansion patch, which we think is a great indication of our fans' ongoing commitment to engagement with the franchise. So we know our fans wanted a game with a great, engaging story with great characters and a more accessible experience overall. And we think we lived up to their high expectations on those measures. And we also know that our fans are already hungry for more. And as I've said on past calls, we now have not just Bungie but multiple AAA teams developing content for Destiny, and we're planning on having more content than ever before to support Destiny 2, starting with the first expansion that's coming on December 5. And also, we launched Destiny on PC, which we expect to open up new geographies where we think Destiny is going to be really well received. So we've got events coming. We've got compelling in-game content coming. We've got strong marketing and events planned through the holidays, so we've got good momentum there."

Retail's going to continue to be important for us on console for some time to come. But that said, this consumer trend that we're seeing and the shift to full game digital download, it's real. It's a strong tailwind for our business, and it's a good thing, that digital connection that brings us closer to our consumer and it creates better economics. It's roughly $10 of direct profit improvement and then it's also indirect savings and margin benefit and even some working capital benefits. But I guess, getting back to your question on the trends, I believe we mentioned last year that our historical digital mix was about 20% to 25% for Call of Duty and in that more than 30% to 40% range for Destiny and Overwatch on console. And historically, we've been seeing that digital mix increase at about 5 points a year. So -- and as you point out, with Destiny 2 digital at over 50% console sell-through so far, we believe we're seeing some acceleration in that digital shift. And while that's a consumer-led move, I'd be remiss if I didn't point out just for a moment that our team put together some really compelling digital premium packages and deserve a lot of credit for creating packages that clearly resonated with Destiny's community and delivered a lot of value. So as we look to kind of finish out the year and into the back half of Q4, we expect retail actually to gain some share as we reach a broader audience. But we do still expect to end the year well ahead of the original Destiny digital mix. I guess, I should point out that when you look at a franchise like Call of Duty, there's different dynamics there. So it's not like-for-like. Call of Duty, as you know, is a more mass-market game. And the more mass you get, the higher the retail share. So while we're seeing higher digital preorders as well on World War II relative to any prior Call of Duty title, that digital mix is still well below what we're seeing for Destiny 2. So we may still also see that acceleration from the 5-point historical rate. But again, it's a consumer-led shift predominantly, and we'll have to wait and just see how the quarter lands. Overall, though, this is good news for our business. It's a nice trend. There's lots of runway to go to expand that digital full-game-sales footprint and grow that connection with our players."

We've got preorders that are strong, awareness and purchase intent which, of course, we also track, are at the top of the scale. And anticipation amongst our community is at a fever pitch that we're very excited about. The other thing that sets us up well is the fact that we had our Monthly Active Users on the Call of Duty franchise at a record high in Q3. And it's always great for our new content launches when we have people hyper engaged with the franchise. So as Coddy mentioned, Call of Duty's been the #1 console franchise worldwide 7 of the last 8 years. We expect to extend that streak this year. And obviously, our community's excited that we're returning to the sort of grittier, boots-on-the-ground, authentic military setting that's the franchise's roots. But we didn't -- it's also important that we didn't just do that. I think that's the headline, that we didn't rest on those laurels. We're also bringing a bunch of really cool innovations, like an entire new way to play multiplayer, called war mode, which is more team-based and collaborative than any mode we've had before. That was a huge hit in the [indiscernible] as well as Sledgehammer's take on Call of Duty Zombies, which is literally sort of jump out of your seat scary, so kind of a really new experience there. I guess, all in all, we just feel like everything's really come together with this game.

Our vision for the business is to deliver great experiences for the players that also drive results for the marketeers. And we have made progress on several dimensions. We have, first of all, been developing several ad formats with a particular focus on those that are supportive of the gameplay. So an example of such an ad format is rewarded video ads, where players receive an in-game benefit for initiating and for viewing an ad. And in this respect, I'm encouraged by what I'm seeing. We're steadily enabling more of our player cohorts to see ads as a consequence of that. We're also growing traction with advertisers from a range of industries, for example, entertainment, tech, banking. And we're seeing traction in key markets in the U.S. and in the U.K. As a result of this, the team has started increasing the volume of impressions.
