Thank you for joining us today as we review our results for the year. I want to start by introducing the members of our team who are here with me today: Scott Lauber, who's our Chief Financial Officer; Jim Schubilske, our Treasur",1736,"Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today as we review our results for the year. I want to start by introducing the members of our team who are here with me today: Scott Lauber, who's our Chief Financial Officer; Jim Schubilske, our Treasurer; Susan Martin, our General Counsel; Bill Guc, our Controller; and finally, Beth Straka, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations.
Now as you saw this morning, we reported full 2016 adjusted earnings per share of $2.97, ahead of our guidance range of $2.88 to $2.94. Our adjusted earnings exclude merger-related costs of $0.01 per share. Scott will provide a more detailed review in a moment.
Now we expect long-term earnings per share growth for WEC Energy Group to be in the range of 5% to 7%, off a 2015 standalone Wisconsin energy base of $2.72 per share. Our guidance for 2017 is in the range of $3.06 per share to $3.12 per share. And this is in line with our previously disclosed earnings per share growth expectations. 
In addition to our full year results, we have 2 other positive developments to share with you today. On January 20, we signed an agreement to acquire Bluewater Gas Holding, which owns an underground natural gas storage facility in Michigan. This facility can provide approximately 1/3 of the storage needs of our natural gas distribution companies in Wisconsin. The total acquisition price is $230 million. Bluewater will have a long-term service agreement with each of our 3 natural gas distribution companies in Wisconsin. The earnings from this investment are expected to be the same as if the storage was owned by our local gas distribution companies.
We plan to file a request with the Wisconsin Commission in the coming days for a declaratory ruling. In this request, we will ask the commission to confirm that it's reasonable for our Wisconsin gas utilities to enter into these transactions. The service agreements were expected to provide for a utility return on capital. I believe this investment will bring very meaningful customer benefits. 
We chose this service agreement structure for 2 reasons. First, we don't want to put the Wisconsin Commission on the position of being asked to approve an out-of-state acquisition by our Wisconsin distribution companies. Second, this avoids directly involving our state-regulated companies in an interstate natural gas business. 
The second positive development relates to our proposed generation solution in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. On Monday, we filed the required construction-related authorizations related to our generation plan there. This filing was made on behalf of the Upper Michigan Energy Resources Corporation, or UMERC for short. UMERC began operation on January 1 of this year, following its approval by the Michigan Commission. We are proposing a $275 million investment and about 180 megawatts of natural gas-fired reciprocating internal combustion engines. This will provide a reliable, cost-effective, long-term generation solution for our customers in the Upper Peninsula, including the mine owned by Cliffs Resources. We are targeting commercial operation in 2019.
At that time or soon after, we expect to be in a position to retire our coal-fired Presque Isle Power Plant. This should give significant savings in operations and maintenance expenses as well as reduced carbon emissions.
Turning now to the regulatory front. Last year, we only had 1 rate case. Now this case was actually filed in 2015 but was decided in 2016. We received a final decision from the Minnesota Commission in October for our natural gas LDC, authorizing a 9.11% return on equity. The revenue increase was approximately 3% or an estimated $6.8 million, in line with our expectation.
I also expect we will have another quiet year on the rate case front. We do not plan to file a case in Illinois this year, and we'll know more about Wisconsin in the coming months. Our strong preference would be to keep rates flat while managing our costs and returning additional benefits to our customers through the earnings sharing mechanisms that were put in place at Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas by the Wisconsin Commission after the Integrys acquisition. These mechanisms delivered $24 million of benefits to customers in 2016. 
Turning to our ATC investment. On September 28, FERC affirmed a prior ALJ recommendation of a 10.32% base return on equity in response to the first MISO return-on-equity complaint. ATC qualifies for a 50-basis point adder for being a MISO member, thus increasing their return on equity to 10.82%. And we are currently recognizing income at this 10.82% level. Although the recent commissioner resignation at FERC injects some additional uncertainty, we still expect an order by the end of June in the second MISO complaint case. In that case, the ALJ recommended a base return on equity of 9.7%. Again, ATC qualifies for the 50-basis point adder, which would bring their return on equity to 10.2%.  When the final order is received, we anticipate transitioning to the 10.2% return on equity. We factor this return into our long-term financial plan.
Now a reminder on our dividend. On January 19, our board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.52 per share, which is an increase of $0.025 or 5.1% over the previous quarterly dividend level. This represents a compound annual growth rate of 6.6% from the 2015 fourth quarter level. Our annual dividend rate stands at $2.08 per share. We continue to target a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings. Given that we are right in this range now, I expect our dividend growth will continue to be in line with our earnings per share growth.
I would now like to provide you with an update on our 5-year capital forecast. Our 5-year plan now reflects $9.7 billion versus the last 5-year plan, which was $9.2 billion. I would note that the $9.7 billion plan includes the natural gas storage as well as the UP generation investment that I just discussed. These figures do not include our share of projected capital investments at ATC, which is $1.4 billion for investments inside the traditional ATC footprint and approximately $300 million in projected capital outside the footprint.
We do have some news regarding ATC. On January 30, ATC announced that it has entered into a joint operating agreement with the Arizona Electric Power Cooperative. The partnership, known as ATC Southwest, will develop needed transmission projects in Arizona and the Southwest United States.
Finally, I'd like to take some time to address potential implications of tax reform. Both the Trump administration and the House Republicans have floated some tax reform ideas that could impact our business. Although the details have yet to be finalized, the current proposals have 3 common elements: reducing the corporate tax rate; 100% expensing of capital for tax purposes; and eliminating interest expense as a deduction.
These elements would have different impacts on customers and shareholders, depending on whether we look at the utilities, We Power or the holding company. I would like to address these in conceptual terms first and then summarize the potential impacts for shareholders. In addition, we have included a chart in the earnings packet that lays out the potential impacts to customers and shareholders for each segment.
First, let's look at the regulated utilities. Because of the traditional ratemaking approach, reducing the corporate tax rate directly benefits customers by lowering the provision for income taxes and rates. The lower tax rate also creates an excess deferred tax position that would benefit customers over time. From a shareholder perspective, this change would be neutral to slightly positive as the regulatory liability related to the reduction in deferred tax liabilities is amortized. The second element, 100% expensing in capital, would reduce rate base in the short term. However, a lower tax rate would help to offset this impact.
The third element, elimination of the interest tax deduction, would increase the cost of capital for customers. I view this as a large negative for customers. However, this would be neutral for shareholders. For We Power, the facility leases between We Power and We Energies, would flow the benefit of the tax rate change through to customers. Any one-time excess deferred tax balance created would remain at We Power and benefit shareholders. 100% expensing of capital would have little impact because of We Power's low projected capital spending levels going forward. The elimination of the interest expense deduction would be detrimental to We Power if the change affects interest on existing debt. It is unknown that this change would affect only interest on new debt or all interest expense.  In addition, the House plan mentions taking into consideration an offset to interest income and the possibility of exempting banks for leasing entities. 
From the shareholder perspective, there are 3 key issues: the deductibility of interest, the impact on utility rate base and deferred taxes at We Power. Deductibility of interest has the largest potential impact. If existing interest is not deductible, the estimated impact would be $0.14 per share at the holding company and $0.05 per share at We Power. However, if interest on existing debt is allowed to be deducted at a lower effective tax rate of 20%, the net effect would only be approximately $0.05 per share in total. Of less significance is the rate base effect at the utility level. The cumulative effect of all these changes, 20% effective tax rate, 100% expensing of capital for tax purposes and nondeductibility of interest, would reduce rate base by approximately $300 million over a 5-year period.
On a positive note, with an assumed change in the deferred tax rate to 20%, we would expect the We Power deferred taxes to have a one-time reduction of approximately $270 million, which would reduce future tax payments. 
Finally, both plans would reduce dividend and capital gains tax rates to the benefit of our shareholders. Although this would not have an impact on the earnings of the company, it could potentially impact sector valuation. As I mentioned earlier, much of the details on this still need to be worked out by Congress and the new administration. Obviously, we will be paying very close attention to tax reform as it take shape. But we wanted to share our current understanding of the implications of the plans that are now being discussed.
So now with details in our 2016 results and our financial outlook, here is Scott Lauber, our Chief Financial Officer."
315117,417530323,1121447,"WEC Energy Group, Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 01, 2017",2017-02-01,"Earnings Calls","WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Allen. In 2016, our GAAP earnings grew $2.96 per share from $2.34 per share in 2015. Our 2016 results include a full year's impact of the Integrys acquisition.

Our 2016 results include a full year's impact of the Integrys acquisition. Recall that 2015 results only include 2 quarters of Integrys' earnings. Excluding acquisition costs, adjusted earnings per share increased $0.33 from $2.64 per share in 2015 to $2.97 per share in 2016. For purposes of comparing 2016 and 2015 earnings on a consistent basis, the calculation of adjusted earnings per share for 2015 now includes Integrys earnings, all interest expense related to the acquisition financing and all shares issued in conjunction with the acquisition.
The earnings packet placed on our website this morning includes the results of the Integrys companies and has full GAAP to adjusted reconciliation. 
For 2016 results, I'll first focus on adjusted operating income by segment and then discuss other income, interest expense and income taxes. Integrys' results for the first 2 quarters of 2016 are separated for comparability purposes. 
Referring to Page 11 of the earnings packet, our consolidated operating income for 2016, adjusted for costs related to the acquisition of Integrys, was $1,685.6 million as compared to $1,358.1 million in 2015, an increase of $327.5 million. Starting with Wisconsin segment, operating income totaled $1,027 million for 2016, an increase of $128.6 million from 2015 adjusted operating income. We realized a $128.4 million contribution from the Wisconsin Public Service during the first 2 quarters of 2016 with the remaining increase related to favorable weather, positive fuel recoveries and rate increases at Wisconsin Gas and Wisconsin Public Service, offset by an increase in operation and maintenance expense.
Operation and maintenance expense in 2016 include a $24.4 million of expense related to the earnings sharing mechanism in place at Wisconsin Electric Power Company and Wisconsin Gas, which were effective January 1, 2016, and will last for 3 years.
Under the earnings sharing mechanism, if either company earns above its authorized return, 50% of the first 50 basis points of additional utility earnings will be shared with customers. All earnings above the initial 50 basis points will benefit customers.
In 2016, our Illinois segment recognized operating income of $239.6 million, an increase of $160.2 million compared to the $79.4 million of adjusted operating income recognized during the 2015. We recognized $159.6 million of operating income during the first 3 [ph] quarters of 2016 and the remaining increase was driven primarily by continued investment in the gas system modernization program.
In 2016, our Others States segment recognized operating income of $49.9 million, an increase of $43.8 million compared to the $6.1 million of adjusted operating income recognized during 2015. We recognized $34.1 million during the first 2 quarters of 2016. The remaining $9.7 million increase was mainly due to the rate increases at Minnesota Energy Resource Corporation and Michigan gas utilities as well as comparatively colder weather in the fourth quarter of 2016.
Operating income at the We Power segment was up $2.2 million when compared to 2015. This increase reflected additional investment at our Power the Future plants. Our corporate and other segment, realized an adjusted operating loss of $6.5 million in 2016 compared to an adjusted operating income at $800,000 in 2015. Lower operating income was driven in part by $1.4 million loss recognized by the Integrys companies during the first 2 quarters of 2016.
Taking the changes for these segments together, we arrive at $327.5 million increase on adjusted operating income. During 2016, earnings from our investment in American Transmission Company totaled $146.5 million, an increase of $50.4 million from last year. Integrys results for the first 2 quarters of 2016 drove $39.6 million of the increase, leading a comparable year-over-year increase of $10.8 million. Lower equity earnings in 2015 were driven by an administrative law judge initial decision in December 2015 related to the ATC ROE reviews, which was later affirmed by FERC order in 2016. Our other income net increased $21.9 million. The Integrys Companies contributed $38.1 million of other income during the first 2 quarters of 2016. The offsetting $16.2 million decrease related to excise tax credits recognized by Integrys transportation fuels in the fourth quarter of 2015 and lower AFUDC primarily related to timing of the capital expenditures. As you recall, Integrys transportation fuel was solved in the first quarter of 2016.
Our net interest expense increased $71.3 million driven by $68.5 million of interest expense recognized by the Integrys during the first 2 quarters of 2016. The remaining $2.8 million increase was driven by interest on the $1.5 billion of debt issued in June 2015 to complete the acquisition. This was offset in part by the repurchase of a portion of the Integrys 6.11% junior notes in February 2016. Those notes were replaced with lower interest rate short-term debt.
Earnings from the Integrys companies during the first 2 quarters of 2016 drove $108.7 million increase in our adjusted consolidated income tax expense. Looking forward, we expect our effective income tax rate to be between 37% and 38%. Combining all of these items brings us to an adjusted earnings of $941.1 million or $2.97 per share for 2016 compared to $720.7 million or $2.64 per share for 2015.
Net cash provided by operating activities increased $809.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily driven by $655 million of net cash flows from the operating activities of Integrys for the year ended December 31, 2016. The remaining increase was driven by a decrease in contributions to employee benefit plans. We contributed $100 million to our qualified pension trust in 2015 and we did not make a contribution in 2016. In January 2017, we contributed $100 million to our qualified pension trust. Our capital expenditures totaled $1.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016, a $157.5 million increase compared to 2015. The largest increase was related to inclusion of a full year capital investments at the Integrys Companies.
Our adjusted debt-to-capital ratio was 51.9% at the end of December, a decrease from the 53.1% adjusted debt-to-capital ratio at the end of last year. Our calculation continues to treat half of the WEC Energy Group 2007 [ph] Series A junior subordinate notes as common equity. We're using cash to satisfy any shares required for 401(k) plans, options and other programs. Going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares. We also paid $624.9 million in common dividends during the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $169.5 million over the same period last year. Higher dividends were driven by the increase in the shares outstanding related to the Integrys acquisition and an increase in the dividend rate compared to 2015. Moving to sales. We see continued customer growth across our system. At the end of December, our Wisconsin utilities were serving about 7,000 more electric customers and 12,000 more natural gas customers compared to a year ago. Our natural gas utilities in Illinois, Michigan and Minnesota were serving approximately 16,000 more customers compared to a year ago.
Now let's discuss delivered sales volumes year-over-year. For comparative purposes, 2015 electric sales information reflects results for both Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Public Service. Weather-normalized sales are adjusted to factor out the effects of leap year. Retail, electricity deliveries, excluding the iron ore mines, increased 2%. On a weather-normalized basis, retail deliveries of electricity increased 2/10 of 1% compared to 2015.
Looking at the individual customer segments. Natural residential deliveries rose 4.1% while weather-normalized residential deliveries increased 4/10 of 1%. Across our small commercial and industrial group, actual deliveries increased 2.3% [ph] while weather-normalized deliveries increased 9/10 of 1%. In the large commercial and industrial segment, deliveries for 2016 decreased 1.1%. Excluding the iron ore mines, large commercial and industrial deliveries were flat year-over-year.
Now an update on our natural gas deliveries. As you may recall, our Illinois segment has a decoupling mechanism and its margins are less affected by weather. Looking at Wisconsin, our largest segment, retail gas deliveries, excluding gas used for power generation, increased 1.6%. On a weather-normalized basis, retail gas deliveries, excluding gas used for power generation, were up 3.7% compared to 2015. Overall, our normalized results for gas and electric sales for 2016 are slightly above our expectations.
For 2017, we'll focus, forecast and discuss delivered results for the state of Wisconsin, our largest segment. In Wisconsin, we're forecasting modest increase of 2/10 of 1% in weather-normalized retail electric deliveries excluding the iron ore mines.
Looking at 2017 by individual customer segment, we expect residential deliveries to decline 2/10 of 1% impacted by continued modest growth in housing starts but offset by conservation. In the small commercial and industrial segment, we are projecting sales to increase 5/10 of 1%. In the large commercial industrial group, excluding the mine, we are projecting an increase of 3/10 of 1%. We project 2017 Wisconsin weather-normalized retail gas deliveries, excluding gas used for power generation, to increase 5/10 of 1%.
Next, I'd like to remind you about earnings guidance for 2017. As Allen mentioned, we expect long-term earnings per share growth for WEC Energy Group to be in the range of 5% to 7% off a 2015 standalone Wisconsin Energy base of $2.72 per share. Our guidance for 2017 is in the range of $3.06 per share to $3.12 per share. This is in line with our previously disclosed earnings per share growth expectation. This guidance assumes normal weather. Again, our guidance for 2017 is $3.06 per share to $3.12 per share.
Finally, let's look at the quarterly guidance. In the first quarter of 2016, we earned $1.09 per share. And as you may recall, the first quarter of 2016 had warmer than normal weather, which is offset by fuel recoveries. In addition, there was a force pickup in the first quarter as a result of the repurchase a portion of the Integrys 6.11% junior notes. Taking these into account in a mild January weather and the timing of fuel recoveries, we project first quarter earnings to be in the range of $1.02 per share to $1.06 per share. That assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter. Once again, first quarter guidance for WEC Energy group is $1.02 to $1.06.
With the that, I'll turn things back to Allen."

And then what you need to do in order to kind of move up in that range, I'd say, most likely would be to make some significant investment outside the footprint, the traditional footprint at ATC. But the capital plan that I've described in the prepared remarks, very supportive of something kind of near that low end of the range."

So when we lay this out in our declaratory ruling request, literally in a matter of days, so we'll include in there the service agreements as we would propose them. In terms of tenor, Julien, we would actually propose 60-year agreements. So very long tenor agreements. And effectively, what the agreement would provide for is a return on and off capital that's been invested including the initial investment and then as you have O&M, which we expect you would have O&M, of course, and I think it would be modest capital as you have some additional capital that would be required at the field, that would also be recovered kind of through that return on and on mechanism. So we'll lay all that out in the declaratory ruling and there'll be attachments to that the service agreements will be attached to that ruling request. Getting kind of to the second question that you asked, additional opportunities. I believe in terms of working gas, this field has like 23.2 Bcf in terms of working gas. That's about 1/3 of our requirements. I do believe you could do some additional expansion at the field. And you could add some working gas at the field. If you did that, that would also be covered by that service agreement sort of structure that I mentioned. I think other than that, for the Wisconsin utilities, there really aren't any other gas infrastructure things that we're looking at. So hopefully that would answer your questions."

On the interest deductibility front, if you take 1 extreme where it's still deductible but at a 20% level, well, that's $0.05 a share on the base of, say, circa [ph] $3.

And let me just give you one example in particular. Bridge back to the conversation or the prepared remarks when I was talking about the new gas-fired generation in UP. Well, once we have that new generation online and we are able to retire the Presque Isle Power Plant, the run rate of O&M at Presque Isle is about $40 million a year, which is very, very significant both for Wisconsin Electric as well as the consolidated entity. So I do believe there'll be additional opportunities but the real big opportunity in terms of O&M reduction are going to come more from the generation side. There will be more modest, none on important, but modest opportunities let's say we implement our new ERP system.

In terms of percentage growth, we're going to see much greater or expect to see much greater percentage growth in earnings in the natural gas business than we would in electric.

Thank you for joining us today as we review our results for the year. I want to start by introducing the members of our team who are here with me today: Scott Lauber, who's our Chief Financial Officer; Jim Schubilske, our Treasur",1736,"Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today as we review our results for the year. I want to start by introducing the members of our team who are here with me today: Scott Lauber, who's our Chief Financial Officer; Jim Schubilske, our Treasurer; Susan Martin, our General Counsel; Bill Guc, our Controller; and finally, Beth Straka, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations.
Now as you saw this morning, we reported full 2016 adjusted earnings per share of $2.97, ahead of our guidance range of $2.88 to $2.94. Our adjusted earnings exclude merger-related costs of $0.01 per share. Scott will provide a more detailed review in a moment.
Now we expect long-term earnings per share growth for WEC Energy Group to be in the range of 5% to 7%, off a 2015 standalone Wisconsin energy base of $2.72 per share. Our guidance for 2017 is in the range of $3.06 per share to $3.12 per share. And this is in line with our previously disclosed earnings per share growth expectations. 
In addition to our full year results, we have 2 other positive developments to share with you today. On January 20, we signed an agreement to acquire Bluewater Gas Holding, which owns an underground natural gas storage facility in Michigan. This facility can provide approximately 1/3 of the storage needs of our natural gas distribution companies in Wisconsin. The total acquisition price is $230 million. Bluewater will have a long-term service agreement with each of our 3 natural gas distribution companies in Wisconsin. The earnings from this investment are expected to be the same as if the storage was owned by our local gas distribution companies.
We plan to file a request with the Wisconsin Commission in the coming days for a declaratory ruling. In this request, we will ask the commission to confirm that it's reasonable for our Wisconsin gas utilities to enter into these transactions. The service agreements were expected to provide for a utility return on capital. I believe this investment will bring very meaningful customer benefits. 
We chose this service agreement structure for 2 reasons. First, we don't want to put the Wisconsin Commission on the position of being asked to approve an out-of-state acquisition by our Wisconsin distribution companies. Second, this avoids directly involving our state-regulated companies in an interstate natural gas business. 
The second positive development relates to our proposed generation solution in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. On Monday, we filed the required construction-related authorizations related to our generation plan there. This filing was made on behalf of the Upper Michigan Energy Resources Corporation, or UMERC for short. UMERC began operation on January 1 of this year, following its approval by the Michigan Commission. We are proposing a $275 million investment and about 180 megawatts of natural gas-fired reciprocating internal combustion engines. This will provide a reliable, cost-effective, long-term generation solution for our customers in the Upper Peninsula, including the mine owned by Cliffs Resources. We are targeting commercial operation in 2019.
At that time or soon after, we expect to be in a position to retire our coal-fired Presque Isle Power Plant. This should give significant savings in operations and maintenance expenses as well as reduced carbon emissions.
Turning now to the regulatory front. Last year, we only had 1 rate case. Now this case was actually filed in 2015 but was decided in 2016. We received a final decision from the Minnesota Commission in October for our natural gas LDC, authorizing a 9.11% return on equity. The revenue increase was approximately 3% or an estimated $6.8 million, in line with our expectation.
I also expect we will have another quiet year on the rate case front. We do not plan to file a case in Illinois this year, and we'll know more about Wisconsin in the coming months. Our strong preference would be to keep rates flat while managing our costs and returning additional benefits to our customers through the earnings sharing mechanisms that were put in place at Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas by the Wisconsin Commission after the Integrys acquisition. These mechanisms delivered $24 million of benefits to customers in 2016. 
Turning to our ATC investment. On September 28, FERC affirmed a prior ALJ recommendation of a 10.32% base return on equity in response to the first MISO return-on-equity complaint. ATC qualifies for a 50-basis point adder for being a MISO member, thus increasing their return on equity to 10.82%. And we are currently recognizing income at this 10.82% level. Although the recent commissioner resignation at FERC injects some additional uncertainty, we still expect an order by the end of June in the second MISO complaint case. In that case, the ALJ recommended a base return on equity of 9.7%. Again, ATC qualifies for the 50-basis point adder, which would bring their return on equity to 10.2%.  When the final order is received, we anticipate transitioning to the 10.2% return on equity. We factor this return into our long-term financial plan.
Now a reminder on our dividend. On January 19, our board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.52 per share, which is an increase of $0.025 or 5.1% over the previous quarterly dividend level. This represents a compound annual growth rate of 6.6% from the 2015 fourth quarter level. Our annual dividend rate stands at $2.08 per share. We continue to target a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings. Given that we are right in this range now, I expect our dividend growth will continue to be in line with our earnings per share growth.
I would now like to provide you with an update on our 5-year capital forecast. Our 5-year plan now reflects $9.7 billion versus the last 5-year plan, which was $9.2 billion. I would note that the $9.7 billion plan includes the natural gas storage as well as the UP generation investment that I just discussed. These figures do not include our share of projected capital investments at ATC, which is $1.4 billion for investments inside the traditional ATC footprint and approximately $300 million in projected capital outside the footprint.
We do have some news regarding ATC. On January 30, ATC announced that it has entered into a joint operating agreement with the Arizona Electric Power Cooperative. The partnership, known as ATC Southwest, will develop needed transmission projects in Arizona and the Southwest United States.
Finally, I'd like to take some time to address potential implications of tax reform. Both the Trump administration and the House Republicans have floated some tax reform ideas that could impact our business. Although the details have yet to be finalized, the current proposals have 3 common elements: reducing the corporate tax rate; 100% expensing of capital for tax purposes; and eliminating interest expense as a deduction.
These elements would have different impacts on customers and shareholders, depending on whether we look at the utilities, We Power or the holding company. I would like to address these in conceptual terms first and then summarize the potential impacts for shareholders. In addition, we have included a chart in the earnings packet that lays out the potential impacts to customers and shareholders for each segment.
First, let's look at the regulated utilities. Because of the traditional ratemaking approach, reducing the corporate tax rate directly benefits customers by lowering the provision for income taxes and rates. The lower tax rate also creates an excess deferred tax position that would benefit customers over time. From a shareholder perspective, this change would be neutral to slightly positive as the regulatory liability related to the reduction in deferred tax liabilities is amortized. The second element, 100% expensing in capital, would reduce rate base in the short term. However, a lower tax rate would help to offset this impact.
The third element, elimination of the interest tax deduction, would increase the cost of capital for customers. I view this as a large negative for customers. However, this would be neutral for shareholders. For We Power, the facility leases between We Power and We Energies, would flow the benefit of the tax rate change through to customers. Any one-time excess deferred tax balance created would remain at We Power and benefit shareholders. 100% expensing of capital would have little impact because of We Power's low projected capital spending levels going forward. The elimination of the interest expense deduction would be detrimental to We Power if the change affects interest on existing debt. It is unknown that this change would affect only interest on new debt or all interest expense.  In addition, the House plan mentions taking into consideration an offset to interest income and the possibility of exempting banks for leasing entities. 
From the shareholder perspective, there are 3 key issues: the deductibility of interest, the impact on utility rate base and deferred taxes at We Power. Deductibility of interest has the largest potential impact. If existing interest is not deductible, the estimated impact would be $0.14 per share at the holding company and $0.05 per share at We Power. However, if interest on existing debt is allowed to be deducted at a lower effective tax rate of 20%, the net effect would only be approximately $0.05 per share in total. Of less significance is the rate base effect at the utility level. The cumulative effect of all these changes, 20% effective tax rate, 100% expensing of capital for tax purposes and nondeductibility of interest, would reduce rate base by approximately $300 million over a 5-year period.
On a positive note, with an assumed change in the deferred tax rate to 20%, we would expect the We Power deferred taxes to have a one-time reduction of approximately $270 million, which would reduce future tax payments. 
Finally, both plans would reduce dividend and capital gains tax rates to the benefit of our shareholders. Although this would not have an impact on the earnings of the company, it could potentially impact sector valuation. As I mentioned earlier, much of the details on this still need to be worked out by Congress and the new administration. Obviously, we will be paying very close attention to tax reform as it take shape. But we wanted to share our current understanding of the implications of the plans that are now being discussed.
So now with details in our 2016 results and our financial outlook, here is Scott Lauber, our Chief Financial Officer."
315117,417530323,1121586,"WEC Energy Group, Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 01, 2017",2017-02-01,"Earnings Calls","WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Allen.

Our 2016 results include a full year's impact of the Integrys acquisition. Recall that 2015 results only include 2 quarters of Integrys' earnings. Excluding acquisition costs, adjusted earnings per share increased $0.33 from $2.64 per share in 2015 to $2.97 per share in 2016. For purposes of comparing 2016 and 2015 earnings on a consistent basis, the calculation of adjusted earnings per share for 2015 now includes Integrys earnings, all interest expense related to the acquisition financing and all shares issued in conjunction with the acquisition.
The earnings packet placed on our website this morning includes the results of the Integrys companies and has full GAAP to adjusted reconciliation. 
For 2016 results, I'll first focus on adjusted operating income by segment and then discuss other income, interest expense and income taxes. Integrys' results for the first 2 quarters of 2016 are separated for comparability purposes. 
Referring to Page 11 of the earnings packet, our consolidated operating income for 2016, adjusted for costs related to the acquisition of Integrys, was $1,685.6 million as compared to $1,358.1 million in 2015, an increase of $327.5 million. Starting with the Wisconsin segment, operating income totaled $1,027 million for 2016, an increase of $128.6 million from 2015 adjusted operating income. We realized a $128.4 million contribution from the Wisconsin Public Service during the first 2 quarters of 2016, with the remaining increase related to favorable weather, positive fuel recoveries and rate increases at Wisconsin Gas and Wisconsin Public Service, offset by an increase in operation and maintenance expense.
Operation and maintenance expense in 2016 include a $24.4 million of expense related to the earnings sharing mechanism in place at Wisconsin Electric Power Company and Wisconsin Gas, which were effective January 1, 2016, and will last for 3 years.
Under the earnings sharing mechanism, if either company earns above its authorized return, 50% of the first 50 basis points of additional utility earnings will be shared with customers. All earnings above the initial 50 basis points will benefit customers.
In 2016, our Illinois segment recognized operating income of $239.6 million, an increase of $160.2 million, compared to the $79.4 million of adjusted operating income recognized during 2015. We recognized $159.6 million of operating income during the first 2 quarters of 2016, and the remaining increase was driven primarily by continued investment in the gas system modernization program.
In 2016, our Other States segment recognized operating income of $49.9 million, an increase of $43.8 million, compared to the $6.1 million of adjusted operating income recognized during 2015. We recognized $34.1 million during the first 2 quarters of 2016. The remaining $9.7 million increase was mainly due to the rate increases at Minnesota Energy Resource Corporation and Michigan gas utilities as well as comparatively colder weather in the fourth quarter of 2016.
Operating income at the We Power segment was up $2.2 million when compared to 2015. This increase reflects additional investment at our Power the Future plants. Our corporate and other segment realized an adjusted operating loss of $6.5 million in 2016 compared to an adjusted operating income at $800,000 in 2015. Lower operating income was driven in part by a $1.4 million loss recognized by the Integrys companies during the first 2 quarters of 2016.  Taking the changes for these segments together, we arrive at $327.5 million increase on adjusted operating income. 
During 2016, earnings from our investment in American Transmission Company totaled $146.5 million, an increase of $50.4 million from last year. Integrys results for the first 2 quarters of 2016 drove $39.6 million of the increase, leading a comparable year-over-year increase of $10.8 million. Lower equity earnings in 2015 were driven by an administrative law judge initial decision in December 2015 related to the ATC ROE reviews, which was later affirmed by FERC order in 2016. Our other income net increased $21.9 million. The Integrys companies contribute $38.1 million of other income during the first 2 quarters of 2016. The offsetting $16.2 million decrease related to excise tax credits recognized by Integrys Transportation Fuels in the fourth quarter of 2015 and lower AFUDC primarily related to timing of the capital expenditures. As you recall, Integrys Transportation Fuels was sold in the first quarter of 2016.
Our net interest expense increased $71.3 million driven by $68.5 million of interest expense recognized by the Integrys during the first 2 quarters of 2016. The remaining $2.8 million increase was driven by interest on the $1.5 billion of debt issued in June 2015 to complete the acquisition. This was offset in part by the repurchase of a portion of the Integrys 6.11% junior notes in February 2016. Those notes were replaced with lower interest rate short-term debt.
Earnings from the Integrys companies during the first 2 quarters of 2016 drove $108.7 million increase in our adjusted consolidated income tax expense. Looking forward, we expect our effective income tax rate to be between 37% and 38%. Combining all of these items brings us to an adjusted earnings of $941.1 million or $2.97 per share for 2016 compared to $720.7 million or $2.64 per share for 2015.
Net cash provided by operating activities increased $809.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily driven by $655 million of net cash flows from the operating activities of Integrys for the year ended December 31, 2016. The remaining increase was driven by a decrease in contributions to employee benefit plans. We contributed $100 million to our qualified pension trust in 2015, and we did not make a contribution in 2016. In January 2017, we contributed $100 million to our qualified pension trust. 
Our capital expenditures totaled $1.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016, a $157.5 million increase compared to 2015. The largest increase was related to inclusion of a full year of capital investments at the Integrys companies.
Our adjusted debt-to-capital ratio was 51.9% at the end of December, a decrease from the 53.1% adjusted debt-to-capital ratio at the end of last year. Our calculation continues to treat half of the WEC Energy Group 2007 Series A Junior Subordinate Notes as common equity. We are using cash to satisfy any shares required for 401(k) plans, options and other programs. Going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares. 
We also paid $624.9 million in common dividends during the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $169.5 million over the same period last year. Higher dividends were driven by the increase in the shares outstanding related to the Integrys acquisition and an increase in the dividend rate compared to 2015. 
Moving to sales. We see continued customer growth across our system. At the end of December, our Wisconsin utilities were serving about 7,000 more electric customers and 12,000 more natural gas customers compared to a year ago. Our natural gas utilities in Illinois, Michigan and Minnesota were serving approximately 16,000 more customers compared to a year ago.
Now let's discuss delivered sales volumes year-over-year. For comparative purposes, 2015 electric sales information reflects results for both Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Public Service. Weather-normalized sales are adjusted to factor out the effects of leap year. Retail, electricity deliveries, excluding the iron ore mines, increased 2%. On a weather-normalized basis, retail deliveries of electricity increased 0.2% compared to 2015.
Looking at the individual customer segments. Actual residential deliveries rose 4.1% while weather-normalized residential deliveries increased 0.4%. Across a small commercial and industrial group, actual deliveries increased 2.3% while weather-normalized deliveries increased 0.9%. In the large commercial and industrial segment, deliveries for 2016 decreased 1.1%. Excluding the iron ore mines, large commercial and industrial deliveries were flat year-over-year.
Now an update on our natural gas deliveries. As you may recall, our Illinois segment has a decoupling mechanism and its margins are less affected by weather. Looking at Wisconsin, our largest segment, retail gas deliveries, excluding gas used for power generation, increased 1.6%. On a weather-normalized basis, retail gas deliveries, excluding gas used for power generation, were up 3.7% compared to 2015. Overall, our normalized results for gas and electric sales for 2016 are slightly above our expectations.
For 2017, we'll focus -- forecast and discuss delivered results for the state of Wisconsin, our largest segment. In Wisconsin, we're forecasting modest increase of 0.2% in weather-normalized retail electric deliveries, excluding the iron ore mines.
Looking at 2017 by individual customer segment, we expect residential deliveries to decline 0.2% impacted by continued modest growth in housing starts but offset by conservation. In the small commercial and industrial segment, we are projecting sales to increase 0.5%. In the large commercial and industrial group, excluding the mine, we are projecting an increase of 0.3%. We project 2017 Wisconsin weather-normalized retail gas deliveries, excluding gas used for power generation, to increase 0.5%.
Next, I'd like to remind you about earnings guidance for 2017. As Allen mentioned, we expect long-term earnings per share growth for WEC Energy Group to be in the range of 5% to 7%, off a 2015 standalone Wisconsin Energy base of $2.72 per share. Our guidance for 2017 is in the range of $3.06 per share to $3.12 per share. This is in line with our previously disclosed earnings per share growth expectation. This guidance assumes normal weather. Again, our guidance for 2017 is $3.06 per share to $3.12 per share.
Finally, let's look at the quarterly guidance. In the first quarter of 2016, we earned $1.09 per share. As you may recall, the first quarter of 2016 had warmer than normal weather, which is offset by fuel recoveries. In addition, there was a $0.04 pickup in the first quarter as a result of the repurchase a portion of the Integrys 6.11% junior notes. Taking these into account in a mild January weather and the timing of fuel recoveries, we project first quarter earnings to be in the range of $1.02 per share to $1.06 per share. That assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter. Once again, first quarter guidance for WEC Energy Group is $1.02 to $1.06.
With the that, I'll turn things back to Allen."

And what are the factors there, sort of the puts and takes that gets you into a sort of confidence range around a normal weather, meaning you can earn your authorize return?"

Now in addition to that, Greg, as we have always done in previous years, weather is obviously uncertain. It could be better or worse than normal. So we certainly have levers, if you will, above and below that 3% level so that we can adjust our operations as we see weather that's either favorable or unfavorable. But the base plan would call for a 3% reduction in the level of O&M."

And then as you have O&M, which we expect you would have O&M, of course, and I think it would be modest capital, but as they add some additional capital that would be required at the field, that would also be recovered kind of through that return of and on mechanism. So we'll lay all that out in the declaratory ruling, and there'll be attachments to that. The service agreements will be attached to that ruling request. Getting kind of to the second question that you asked, additional opportunities. I believe, in terms of working gas, this field has like 23.2 Bcf in terms of working gas. That's about 1/3 of our requirements. I do believe you could do some additional expansion at the field. And you could add some working gas at the field.

On the interest deductibility front, if you take one extreme where it's still deductible but at a 20% level, well, that's $0.05 a share on the base of, say, circa $3.

But I would say, as you look out, say, the 2018, 2019, 2020, which I think is kind of where you're going, the larger reductions on O&M are most likely going to be centered around our generation portfolio as we restructure that generation portfolio. And let me just give you one example in particular. Bridge back to the conversation or the prepared remarks when I was talking about the new gas-fired generation in UP. Well, once we have that new generation online and we're able to retire the Presque Isle Power Plant, the run rate of O&M at Presque Isle is about $40 million a year, which is very, very significant, both for Wisconsin Electric as well as the consolidated entity. So I do believe there'll be additional opportunities, but the really big opportunities in terms of O&M reduction are going to come more from the generation side. There will be more modest, not unimportant, but more modest opportunities and say we implement our new ERP system. So now we're going through efforts where we're trying to get all of our utilities on common systems. So as we implement our new ERP system in this year and in 2018, I would see more savings opportunities there. But that's a little more modest."

Thank you for joining us today as we review our results for the year.

Thank you for joining us today as we review our results for the year. I want to start by introducing the members of our team who are here with me today: Scott Lauber, who's our Chief Financial Officer; Jim Schubilske, our Treasurer; Susan Martin, our General Counsel; Bill Guc, our Controller; and finally, Beth Straka, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations.
Now as you saw this morning, we reported full 2016 adjusted earnings per share of $2.97, ahead of our guidance range of $2.88 to $2.94. Our adjusted earnings exclude merger-related costs of $0.01 per share. Scott will provide a more detailed review in a moment.
Now we expect long-term earnings per share growth for WEC Energy Group to be in the range of 5% to 7%, off a 2015 standalone Wisconsin energy base of $2.72 per share. Our guidance for 2017 is in the range of $3.06 per share to $3.12 per share. And this is in line with our previously disclosed earnings per share growth expectations. 
In addition to our full year results, we have 2 other positive developments to share with you today. On January 20, we signed an agreement to acquire Bluewater Gas Holding, which owns an underground natural gas storage facility in Michigan. This facility can provide approximately 1/3 of the storage needs of our natural gas distribution companies in Wisconsin. The total acquisition price is $230 million. Bluewater will have a long-term service agreement with each of our 3 natural gas distribution companies in Wisconsin. The earnings from this investment are expected to be the same as if the storage was owned by our local gas distribution companies.
We plan to file a request with the Wisconsin Commission in the coming days for a declaratory ruling. In this request, we will ask the commission to confirm that it's reasonable for our Wisconsin gas utilities to enter into these transactions. The service agreements were expected to provide for a utility return on capital. I believe this investment will bring very meaningful customer benefits. 
We chose this service agreement structure for 2 reasons. First, we don't want to put the Wisconsin Commission on the position of being asked to approve an out-of-state acquisition by our Wisconsin distribution companies. Second, this avoids directly involving our state-regulated companies in an interstate natural gas business. 
The second positive development relates to our proposed generation solution in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. On Monday, we filed the required construction-related authorizations related to our generation plan there. This filing was made on behalf of the Upper Michigan Energy Resources Corporation, or UMERC for short. UMERC began operation on January 1 of this year, following its approval by the Michigan Commission. We are proposing a $275 million investment and about 180 megawatts of natural gas-fired reciprocating internal combustion engines. This will provide a reliable, cost-effective, long-term generation solution for our customers in the Upper Peninsula, including the mine owned by Cliffs Resources. We are targeting commercial operation in 2019.
At that time or soon after, we expect to be in a position to retire our coal-fired Presque Isle Power Plant. This should give significant savings in operations and maintenance expenses as well as reduced carbon emissions.
Turning now to the regulatory front. Last year, we only had 1 rate case. Now this case was actually filed in 2015 but was decided in 2016. We received a final decision from the Minnesota Commission in October for our natural gas LDC, authorizing a 9.11% return on equity. The revenue increase was approximately 3% or an estimated $6.8 million, in line with our expectation.
I also expect we will have another quiet year on the rate case front. We do not plan to file a case in Illinois this year, and we'll know more about Wisconsin in the coming months. Our strong preference would be to keep rates flat while managing our costs and returning additional benefits to our customers through the earnings sharing mechanisms that were put in place at Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas by the Wisconsin Commission after the Integrys acquisition. These mechanisms delivered $24 million of benefits to customers in 2016. 
Turning to our ATC investment. On September 28, FERC affirmed a prior ALJ recommendation of a 10.32% base return on equity in response to the first MISO return-on-equity complaint. ATC qualifies for a 50-basis point adder for being a MISO member, thus increasing their return on equity to 10.82%. And we are currently recognizing income at this 10.82% level. Although the recent commissioner resignation at FERC injects some additional uncertainty, we still expect an order by the end of June in the second MISO complaint case. In that case, the ALJ recommended a base return on equity of 9.7%. Again, ATC qualifies for the 50-basis point adder, which would bring their return on equity to 10.2%.  When the final order is received, we anticipate transitioning to the 10.2% return on equity. We factor this return into our long-term financial plan.
Now a reminder on our dividend. On January 19, our board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.52 per share, which is an increase of $0.025 or 5.1% over the previous quarterly dividend level. This represents a compound annual growth rate of 6.6% from the 2015 fourth quarter level. Our annual dividend rate stands at $2.08 per share. We continue to target a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings. Given that we are right in this range now, I expect our dividend growth will continue to be in line with our earnings per share growth.
I would now like to provide you with an update on our 5-year capital forecast. Our 5-year plan now reflects $9.7 billion versus the last 5-year plan, which was $9.2 billion. I would note that the $9.7 billion plan includes the natural gas storage as well as the UP generation investment that I just discussed. These figures do not include our share of projected capital investments at ATC, which is $1.4 billion for investments inside the traditional ATC footprint and approximately $300 million in projected capital outside the footprint.
We do have some news regarding ATC. On January 30, ATC announced that it has entered into a joint operating agreement with the Arizona Electric Power Cooperative. The partnership, known as ATC Southwest, will develop needed transmission projects in Arizona and the Southwest United States.
Finally, I'd like to take some time to address potential implications of tax reform. Both the Trump administration and the House Republicans have floated some tax reform ideas that could impact our business. Although the details have yet to be finalized, the current proposals have 3 common elements: reducing the corporate tax rate; 100% expensing of capital for tax purposes; and eliminating interest expense as a deduction.
These elements would have different impacts on customers and shareholders, depending on whether we look at the utilities, We Power or the holding company. I would like to address these in conceptual terms first and then summarize the potential impacts for shareholders. In addition, we have included a chart in the earnings packet that lays out the potential impacts to customers and shareholders for each segment.
First, let's look at the regulated utilities. Because of the traditional ratemaking approach, reducing the corporate tax rate directly benefits customers by lowering the provision for income taxes and rates. The lower tax rate also creates an excess deferred tax position that would benefit customers over time. From a shareholder perspective, this change would be neutral to slightly positive as the regulatory liability related to the reduction in deferred tax liabilities is amortized. The second element, 100% expensing of capital, would reduce rate base in the short term. However, a lower tax rate would help to offset this impact.
The third element, elimination of the interest tax deduction, would increase the cost of capital for customers. I view this as a large negative for customers. However, this would be neutral for shareholders. For We Power, the facility leases between We Power and We Energies, would flow the benefit of the tax rate change through to customers. Any one-time excess deferred tax balance created would remain at We Power and benefit shareholders. 100% expensing of capital would have little impact because of We Power's low projected capital spending levels going forward. The elimination of the interest expense deduction would be detrimental to We Power if the change affects interest on existing debt. It is unknown that this change would affect only interest on new debt or all interest expense.  In addition, the House plan mentions taking into consideration an offset to interest income and the possibility of exempting banks or leasing entities. 
From the shareholder perspective, there are 3 key issues: the deductibility of interest, the impact on utility rate base and deferred taxes at We Power. Deductibility of interest has the largest potential impact. If existing interest is not deductible, the estimated impact would be $0.14 per share at the holding company and $0.05 per share at We Power. However, if interest on existing debt is allowed to be deducted at a lower effective tax rate of 20%, the net effect would only be approximately $0.05 per share in total. Of less significance is the rate base effect at the utility level. The cumulative effect of all these changes, 20% effective tax rate, 100% expensing of capital for tax purposes and nondeductibility of interest, would reduce rate base by approximately $300 million over a 5-year period.
On a positive note, with an assumed change in the deferred tax rate to 20%, we would expect the We Power deferred taxes to have a one-time reduction of approximately $270 million, which would reduce future tax payments. 
Finally, both plans would reduce dividend and capital gains tax rates to the benefit of our shareholders. Although this would not have an impact on the earnings of the company, it could potentially impact sector valuation. As I mentioned earlier, much of the details on this still need to be worked out by Congress and the new administration. Obviously, we will be paying very close attention to tax reform as it take shape. But we wanted to share our current understanding of the implications of the plans that are now being discussed.
So now with details in our 2016 results and our financial outlook, here is Scott Lauber, our Chief Financial Officer."
315117,417530323,1121779,"WEC Energy Group, Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 01, 2017",2017-02-01,"Earnings Calls","WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Allen.

Our 2016 results include a full year's impact of the Integrys acquisition. Recall that 2015 results only include 2 quarters of Integrys' earnings. Excluding acquisition costs, adjusted earnings per share increased $0.33 from $2.64 per share in 2015 to $2.97 per share in 2016. For purposes of comparing 2016 and 2015 earnings on a consistent basis, the calculation of adjusted earnings per share for 2015 now includes Integrys earnings, all interest expense related to the acquisition financing and all shares issued in conjunction with the acquisition.
The earnings packet placed on our website this morning includes the results of the Integrys companies and has full GAAP to adjusted reconciliation. 
For 2016 results, I'll first focus on adjusted operating income by segment and then discuss other income, interest expense and income taxes. Integrys' results for the first 2 quarters of 2016 are separated for comparability purposes. 
Referring to Page 11 of the earnings packet, our consolidated operating income for 2016, adjusted for costs related to the acquisition of Integrys, was $1,685.6 million as compared to $1,358.1 million in 2015, an increase of $327.5 million. Starting with the Wisconsin segment, operating income totaled $1,027 million for 2016, an increase of $128.6 million from 2015 adjusted operating income. We realized a $128.4 million contribution from the Wisconsin Public Service during the first 2 quarters of 2016, with the remaining increase related to favorable weather, positive fuel recoveries and rate increases at Wisconsin Gas and Wisconsin Public Service, offset by an increase in operation and maintenance expense.
Operation and maintenance expense in 2016 include a $24.4 million of expense related to the earnings sharing mechanism in place at Wisconsin Electric Power Company and Wisconsin Gas, which were effective January 1, 2016, and will last for 3 years.
Under the earnings sharing mechanism, if either company earns above its authorized return, 50% of the first 50 basis points of additional utility earnings will be shared with customers. All earnings above the initial 50 basis points will benefit customers.
In 2016, our Illinois segment recognized operating income of $239.6 million, an increase of $160.2 million, compared to the $79.4 million of adjusted operating income recognized during 2015. We recognized $159.6 million of operating income during the first 2 quarters of 2016, and the remaining increase was driven primarily by continued investment in the gas system modernization program.
In 2016, our Other States segment recognized operating income of $49.9 million, an increase of $43.8 million, compared to the $6.1 million of adjusted operating income recognized during 2015. We recognized $34.1 million during the first 2 quarters of 2016. The remaining $9.7 million increase was mainly due to the rate increases at Minnesota Energy Resource Corporation and Michigan gas utilities as well as comparatively colder weather in the fourth quarter of 2016.
Operating income at the We Power segment was up $2.2 million when compared to 2015. This increase reflects additional investment at our Power the Future plants. Our corporate and other segment realized an adjusted operating loss of $6.5 million in 2016 compared to an adjusted operating income at $800,000 in 2015. Lower operating income was driven in part by a $1.4 million loss recognized by the Integrys companies during the first 2 quarters of 2016.  Taking the changes for these segments together, we arrive at $327.5 million increase on adjusted operating income. 
During 2016, earnings from our investment in American Transmission Company totaled $146.5 million, an increase of $50.4 million from last year. Integrys results for the first 2 quarters of 2016 drove $39.6 million of the increase, leaving a comparable year-over-year increase of $10.8 million. Lower equity earnings in 2015 were driven by an administrative law judge initial decision in December 2015 related to the ATC ROE reviews, which was later affirmed by FERC order in 2016. Our other income net increased $21.9 million. The Integrys companies contribute $38.1 million of other income during the first 2 quarters of 2016. The offsetting $16.2 million decrease related to excise tax credits recognized by Integrys Transportation Fuels in the fourth quarter of 2015 and lower AFUDC primarily related to timing of the capital expenditures. As you recall, Integrys Transportation Fuels was sold in the first quarter of 2016.
Our net interest expense increased $71.3 million, driven by $68.5 million of interest expense recognized by the Integrys during the first 2 quarters of 2016. The remaining $2.8 million increase was driven by interest on the $1.5 billion of debt issued in June 2015 to complete the acquisition. This was offset in part by the repurchase of a portion of the Integrys 6.11% junior notes in February 2016. Those notes were replaced with lower interest rate short-term debt.
Earnings from the Integrys companies during the first 2 quarters of 2016 drove $108.7 million increase in our adjusted consolidated income tax expense. Looking forward, we expect our effective income tax rate to be between 37% and 38%. Combining all of these items brings us to an adjusted earnings of $941.1 million or $2.97 per share for 2016 compared to $720.7 million or $2.64 per share for 2015.
Net cash provided by operating activities increased $809.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily driven by $655 million of net cash flows from the operating activities of Integrys for the year ended December 31, 2016. The remaining increase was driven by a decrease in contributions to employee benefit plans. We contributed $100 million to our qualified pension trust in 2015, and we did not make a contribution in 2016. In January 2017, we contributed $100 million to our qualified pension trust. 
Our capital expenditures totaled $1.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016, a $157.5 million increase compared to 2015. The largest increase was related to inclusion of a full year of capital investments at the Integrys companies.
Our adjusted debt-to-capital ratio was 51.9% at the end of December, a decrease from the 53.1% adjusted debt-to-capital ratio at the end of last year. Our calculation continues to treat half of the WEC Energy Group 2007 Series A Junior Subordinate Notes as common equity. We are using cash to satisfy any shares required for our 401(k) plans, options and other programs. Going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares. 
We also paid $624.9 million in common dividends during the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $169.5 million over the same period last year. Higher dividends were driven by the increase in the shares outstanding related to the Integrys acquisition and an increase in the dividend rate compared to 2015. 
Moving to sales. We see continued customer growth across our system. At the end of December, our Wisconsin utilities were serving about 7,000 more electric customers and 12,000 more natural gas customers compared to a year ago. Our natural gas utilities in Illinois, Michigan and Minnesota were serving approximately 16,000 more customers compared to a year ago.
Now let's discuss delivered sales volumes year-over-year. For comparative purposes, 2015 electric sales information reflects results for both Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Public Service. Weather-normalized sales are adjusted to factor out the effects of leap year. Retail, electricity deliveries, excluding the iron ore mines, increased 2%. On a weather-normalized basis, retail deliveries of electricity increased 0.2% compared to 2015.
Looking at the individual customer segments. Actual residential deliveries rose 4.1% while weather-normalized residential deliveries increased 0.4%. Across a small commercial and industrial group, actual deliveries increased 2.3% while weather-normalized deliveries increased 0.9%. In the large commercial and industrial segment, deliveries for 2016 decreased 1.1%. Excluding the iron ore mines, large commercial and industrial deliveries were flat year-over-year.
Now an update on our natural gas deliveries. As you may recall, our Illinois segment has a decoupling mechanism and its margins are less affected by weather. Looking at Wisconsin, our largest segment, retail gas deliveries, excluding gas used for power generation, increased 1.6%. On a weather-normalized basis, retail gas deliveries, excluding gas used for power generation, were up 3.7% compared to 2015. Overall, our normalized results for gas and electric sales for 2016 are slightly above our expectations.
For 2017, we'll focus -- forecast and discuss delivered results for the state of Wisconsin, our largest segment. In Wisconsin, we're forecasting modest increase of 0.2% in weather-normalized retail electric deliveries, excluding the iron ore mines.
Looking at 2017 by individual customer segment, we expect residential deliveries to decline 0.2% impacted by continued modest growth in housing starts but offset by conservation. In the small commercial and industrial segment, we are projecting sales to increase 0.5%. In the large commercial and industrial group, excluding the mine, we are projecting an increase of 0.3%. We project 2017 Wisconsin weather-normalized retail gas deliveries, excluding gas used for power generation, to increase 0.5%.
Next, I'd like to remind you about earnings guidance for 2017. As Allen mentioned, we expect long-term earnings per share growth for WEC Energy Group to be in the range of 5% to 7%, off a 2015 standalone Wisconsin Energy base of $2.72 per share. Our guidance for 2017 is in the range of $3.06 per share to $3.12 per share. This is in line with our previously disclosed earnings per share growth expectation. This guidance assumes normal weather. Again, our guidance for 2017 is $3.06 per share to $3.12 per share.
Finally, let's look at the quarterly guidance. In the first quarter of 2016, we earned $1.09 per share. As you may recall, the first quarter of 2016 had warmer than normal weather, which is offset by fuel recoveries. In addition, there was a $0.04 pickup in the first quarter as a result of the repurchase a portion of the Integrys 6.11% junior notes. Taking these into account in a mild January weather and the timing of fuel recoveries, we project first quarter earnings to be in the range of $1.02 per share to $1.06 per share. That assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter. Once again, first quarter guidance for WEC Energy Group is $1.02 to $1.06.
With the that, I'll turn things back to Allen."

And effectively, what the agreement would provide for is a return on and of capital that's been invested, including the initial investment. And then as you have O&M, which we expect you would have O&M, of course, and I think it would be modest capital, but as they add some additional capital that would be required at the field, that would also be recovered kind of through that return of and on mechanism. So we'll lay all that out in the declaratory ruling, and there'll be attachments to that. The service agreements will be attached to that ruling request. Getting kind of to the second question that you asked, additional opportunities. I believe, in terms of working gas, this field has like 23.2 Bcf in terms of working gas. That's about 1/3 of our requirements. I do believe you could do some additional expansion at the field. And you could add some more working gas at the field. If you did that, that would be also covered by that service agreement sort of structure that I mentioned. I think other than that, for the Wisconsin utilities, there really aren't any other gas infrastructure things that we're looking at. So hopefully that would answer your questions."

And let me just give you one example in particular. Bridge back to the conversation or the prepared remarks when I was talking about the new gas-fired generation in UP. Well, once we have that new generation online and we're able to retire the Presque Isle Power Plant, the run rate of O&M at Presque Isle is about $40 million a year, which is very, very significant, both for Wisconsin Electric as well as the consolidated entity. So I do believe there'll be additional opportunities, but the really big opportunities in terms of O&M reduction are going to come more from the generation side. There will be more modest, not unimportant, but more modest opportunities and say we implement our new ERP system. So now we're going through efforts where we're trying to get all of our utilities on common systems. So as we implement our new ERP system in this year and in 2018, I would see more savings opportunities there. But that's a little more modest."

Thank you for joining us today as we review our results for the year. I want to start by introducing the members of our team who are here with me today: Scott Lauber, who's our Chief Financial Officer; Jim Schubilske, our Treasur",1736,"Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today as we review our results for the year. I want to start by introducing the members of our team who are here with me today: Scott Lauber, who's our Chief Financial Officer; Jim Schubilske, our Treasurer; Susan Martin, our General Counsel; Bill Guc, our Controller; and finally, Beth Straka, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations.
Now as you saw this morning, we reported full 2016 adjusted earnings per share of $2.97, ahead of our guidance range of $2.88 to $2.94. Our adjusted earnings exclude merger-related costs of $0.01 per share. Scott will provide a more detailed review in a moment.
Now we expect long-term earnings per share growth for WEC Energy Group to be in the range of 5% to 7%, off a 2015 standalone Wisconsin energy base of $2.72 per share. Our guidance for 2017 is in the range of $3.06 per share to $3.12 per share. And this is in line with our previously disclosed earnings per share growth expectations. 
In addition to our full year results, we have 2 other positive developments to share with you today. On January 20, we signed an agreement to acquire Bluewater Gas Holding, which owns an underground natural gas storage facility in Michigan. This facility can provide approximately 1/3 of the storage needs of our natural gas distribution companies in Wisconsin. The total acquisition price is $230 million. Bluewater will have a long-term service agreement with each of our 3 natural gas distribution companies in Wisconsin. The earnings from this investment are expected to be the same as if the storage was owned by our local gas distribution companies.
We plan to file a request with the Wisconsin Commission in the coming days for a declaratory ruling. In this request, we will ask the commission to confirm that it's reasonable for our Wisconsin gas utilities to enter into these transactions. The service agreements were expected to provide for a utility return on capital. I believe this investment will bring very meaningful customer benefits. 
We chose this service agreement structure for 2 reasons. First, we don't want to put the Wisconsin Commission on the position of being asked to approve an out-of-state acquisition by our Wisconsin distribution companies. Second, this avoids directly involving our state-regulated companies in an interstate natural gas business. 
The second positive development relates to our proposed generation solution in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. On Monday, we filed the required construction-related authorizations related to our generation plan there. This filing was made on behalf of the Upper Michigan Energy Resources Corporation, or UMERC for short. UMERC began operation on January 1 of this year, following its approval by the Michigan Commission. We are proposing a $275 million investment and about 180 megawatts of natural gas-fired reciprocating internal combustion engines. This will provide a reliable, cost-effective, long-term generation solution for our customers in the Upper Peninsula, including the mine owned by Cliffs Resources. We are targeting commercial operation in 2019.
At that time or soon after, we expect to be in a position to retire our coal-fired Presque Isle Power Plant. This should give significant savings in operations and maintenance expenses as well as reduced carbon emissions.
Turning now to the regulatory front. Last year, we only had 1 rate case. Now this case was actually filed in 2015 but was decided in 2016. We received a final decision from the Minnesota Commission in October for our natural gas LDC, authorizing a 9.11% return on equity. The revenue increase was approximately 3% or an estimated $6.8 million, in line with our expectation.
I also expect we will have another quiet year on the rate case front. We do not plan to file a case in Illinois this year, and we'll know more about Wisconsin in the coming months. Our strong preference would be to keep rates flat while managing our costs and returning additional benefits to our customers through the earnings sharing mechanisms that were put in place at Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas by the Wisconsin Commission after the Integrys acquisition. These mechanisms delivered $24 million of benefits to customers in 2016. 
Turning to our ATC investment. On September 28, FERC affirmed a prior ALJ recommendation of a 10.32% base return on equity in response to the first MISO return-on-equity complaint. ATC qualifies for a 50-basis point adder for being a MISO member, thus increasing their return on equity to 10.82%. And we are currently recognizing income at this 10.82% level. Although the recent commissioner resignation at FERC injects some additional uncertainty, we still expect an order by the end of June in the second MISO complaint case. In that case, the ALJ recommended a base return on equity of 9.7%. Again, ATC qualifies for the 50-basis point adder, which would bring their return on equity to 10.2%.  When the final order is received, we anticipate transitioning to the 10.2% return on equity. We factor this return into our long-term financial plan.
Now a reminder on our dividend. On January 19, our board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.52 per share, which is an increase of $0.025 or 5.1% over the previous quarterly dividend level. This represents a compound annual growth rate of 6.6% from the 2015 fourth quarter level. Our annual dividend rate stands at $2.08 per share. We continue to target a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings. Given that we are right in this range now, I expect our dividend growth will continue to be in line with our earnings per share growth.
I would now like to provide you with an update on our 5-year capital forecast. Our 5-year plan now reflects $9.7 billion versus the last 5-year plan, which was $9.2 billion. I would note that the $9.7 billion plan includes the natural gas storage as well as the UP generation investment that I just discussed. These figures do not include our share of projected capital investments at ATC, which is $1.4 billion for investments inside the traditional ATC footprint and approximately $300 million in projected capital outside the footprint.
We do have some news regarding ATC. On January 30, ATC announced that it has entered into a joint operating agreement with the Arizona Electric Power Cooperative. The partnership, known as ATC Southwest, will develop needed transmission projects in Arizona and the Southwest United States.
Finally, I'd like to take some time to address potential implications of tax reform. Both the Trump administration and the House Republicans have floated some tax reform ideas that could impact our business. Although the details have yet to be finalized, the current proposals have 3 common elements: reducing the corporate tax rate; 100% expensing of capital for tax purposes; and eliminating interest expense as a deduction.
These elements would have different impacts on customers and shareholders, depending on whether we look at the utilities, We Power or the holding company. I would like to address these in conceptual terms first and then summarize the potential impacts for shareholders. In addition, we have included a chart in the earnings packet that lays out the potential impacts to customers and shareholders for each segment.
First, let's look at the regulated utilities. Because of the traditional ratemaking approach, reducing the corporate tax rate directly benefits customers by lowering the provision for income taxes and rates. The lower tax rate also creates an excess deferred tax position that would benefit customers over time. From a shareholder perspective, this change would be neutral to slightly positive as the regulatory liability related to the reduction in deferred tax liabilities is amortized. The second element, 100% expensing of capital, would reduce rate base in the short term. However, a lower tax rate would help to offset this impact.
The third element, elimination of the interest tax deduction, would increase the cost of capital for customers. I view this as a large negative for customers. However, this would be neutral for shareholders. For We Power, the facility leases between We Power and We Energies, would flow the benefit of the tax rate change through to customers. Any one-time excess deferred tax balance created would remain at We Power and benefit shareholders. 100% expensing of capital would have little impact because of We Power's low projected capital spending levels going forward. The elimination of the interest expense deduction would be detrimental to We Power if the change affects interest on existing debt. It is unknown that this change would affect only interest on new debt or all interest expense.  In addition, the House plan mentions taking into consideration an offset to interest income and the possibility of exempting banks or leasing entities. 
From the shareholder perspective, there are 3 key issues: the deductibility of interest, the impact on utility rate base and deferred taxes at We Power. Deductibility of interest has the largest potential impact. If existing interest is not deductible, the estimated impact would be $0.14 per share at the holding company and $0.05 per share at We Power. However, if interest on existing debt is allowed to be deducted at a lower effective tax rate of 20%, the net effect would only be approximately $0.05 per share in total. Of less significance is the rate base effect at the utility level. The cumulative effect of all these changes, 20% effective tax rate, 100% expensing of capital for tax purposes and nondeductibility of interest, would reduce rate base by approximately $300 million over a 5-year period.
On a positive note, with an assumed change in the deferred tax rate to 20%, we would expect the We Power deferred taxes to have a one-time reduction of approximately $270 million, which would reduce future tax payments. 
Finally, both plans would reduce dividend and capital gains tax rates to the benefit of our shareholders. Although this would not have an impact on the earnings of the company, it could potentially impact sector valuation. As I mentioned earlier, much of the details on this still need to be worked out by Congress and the new administration. Obviously, we will be paying very close attention to tax reform as it take shape. But we wanted to share our current understanding of the implications of the plans that are now being discussed.
So now with details in our 2016 results and our financial outlook, here is Scott Lauber, our Chief Financial Officer."
315117,417530323,1122016,"WEC Energy Group, Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 01, 2017",2017-02-01,"Earnings Calls","WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Allen. In 2016, our GAAP earnings grew $2.96 per share from $2.34 per share in 2015. Our 2016 results include a full year's impact of the Integrys acquisition. Recall that 2015 results only include 2 quarters of Integrys' earnings. Excluding ac",1698,"Thank you, Allen. In 2016, our GAAP earnings grew $2.96 per share from $2.34 per share in 2015. Our 2016 results include a full year's impact of the Integrys acquisition. Recall that 2015 results only include 2 quarters of Integrys' earnings. Excluding acquisition costs, adjusted earnings per share increased $0.33 from $2.64 per share in 2015 to $2.97 per share in 2016. For purposes of comparing 2016 and 2015 earnings on a consistent basis, the calculation of adjusted earnings per share for 2015 now includes Integrys earnings, all interest expense related to the acquisition financing and all shares issued in conjunction with the acquisition.
The earnings packet placed on our website this morning includes the results of the Integrys companies and has full GAAP to adjusted reconciliation. 
For 2016 results, I'll first focus on adjusted operating income by segment and then discuss other income, interest expense and income taxes. Integrys' results for the first 2 quarters of 2016 are separated for comparability purposes. 
Referring to Page 11 of the earnings packet, our consolidated operating income for 2016, adjusted for costs related to the acquisition of Integrys, was $1,685.6 million as compared to $1,358.1 million in 2015, an increase of $327.5 million. Starting with the Wisconsin segment, operating income totaled $1,027 million for 2016, an increase of $128.6 million from 2015 adjusted operating income. We realized a $128.4 million contribution from the Wisconsin Public Service during the first 2 quarters of 2016, with the remaining increase related to favorable weather, positive fuel recoveries and rate increases at Wisconsin Gas and Wisconsin Public Service, offset by an increase in operation and maintenance expense.
Operation and maintenance expense in 2016 include a $24.4 million of expense related to the earnings sharing mechanism in place at Wisconsin Electric Power Company and Wisconsin Gas, which were effective January 1, 2016, and will last for 3 years.
Under the earnings sharing mechanism, if either company earns above its authorized return, 50% of the first 50 basis points of additional utility earnings will be shared with customers. All earnings above the initial 50 basis points will benefit customers.
In 2016, our Illinois segment recognized operating income of $239.6 million, an increase of $160.2 million, compared to the $79.4 million of adjusted operating income recognized during 2015. We recognized $159.6 million of operating income during the first 2 quarters of 2016, and the remaining increase was driven primarily by continued investment in the gas system modernization program.
In 2016, our Other States segment recognized operating income of $49.9 million, an increase of $43.8 million, compared to the $6.1 million of adjusted operating income recognized during 2015. We recognized $34.1 million during the first 2 quarters of 2016. The remaining $9.7 million increase was mainly due to the rate increases at Minnesota Energy Resource Corporation and Michigan gas utilities as well as comparatively colder weather in the fourth quarter of 2016.
Operating income at the We Power segment was up $2.2 million when compared to 2015. This increase reflects additional investment at our Power the Future plants. Our corporate and other segment realized an adjusted operating loss of $6.5 million in 2016 compared to an adjusted operating income at $800,000 in 2015. Lower operating income was driven in part by a $1.4 million loss recognized by the Integrys companies during the first 2 quarters of 2016.  Taking the changes for these segments together, we arrive at $327.5 million increase on adjusted operating income. 
During 2016, earnings from our investment in American Transmission Company totaled $146.5 million, an increase of $50.4 million from last year. Integrys results for the first 2 quarters of 2016 drove $39.6 million of the increase, leaving a comparable year-over-year increase of $10.8 million. Lower equity earnings in 2015 were driven by an administrative law judge initial decision in December 2015 related to the ATC ROE reviews, which was later affirmed by FERC order in 2016. Our other income net increased $21.9 million. The Integrys companies contribute $38.1 million of other income during the first 2 quarters of 2016. The offsetting $16.2 million decrease related to excise tax credits recognized by Integrys Transportation Fuels in the fourth quarter of 2015 and lower AFUDC primarily related to timing of the capital expenditures. As you recall, Integrys Transportation Fuels was sold in the first quarter of 2016.
Our net interest expense increased $71.3 million, driven by $68.5 million of interest expense recognized by the Integrys during the first 2 quarters of 2016. The remaining $2.8 million increase was driven by interest on the $1.5 billion of debt issued in June 2015 to complete the acquisition. This was offset in part by the repurchase of a portion of the Integrys 6.11% junior notes in February 2016. Those notes were replaced with lower interest rate short-term debt.
Earnings from the Integrys companies during the first 2 quarters of 2016 drove $108.7 million increase in our adjusted consolidated income tax expense. Looking forward, we expect our effective income tax rate to be between 37% and 38%. Combining all of these items brings us to an adjusted earnings of $941.1 million or $2.97 per share for 2016 compared to $720.7 million or $2.64 per share for 2015.
Net cash provided by operating activities increased $809.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily driven by $655 million of net cash flows from the operating activities of Integrys for the year ended December 31, 2016. The remaining increase was driven by a decrease in contributions to employee benefit plans. We contributed $100 million to our qualified pension trust in 2015, and we did not make a contribution in 2016. In January 2017, we contributed $100 million to our qualified pension trust. 
Our capital expenditures totaled $1.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016, a $157.5 million increase compared to 2015. The largest increase was related to inclusion of a full year of capital investments at the Integrys companies.
Our adjusted debt-to-capital ratio was 51.9% at the end of December, a decrease from the 53.1% adjusted debt-to-capital ratio at the end of last year. Our calculation continues to treat half of the WEC Energy Group 2007 Series A Junior Subordinate Notes as common equity. We are using cash to satisfy any shares required for our 401(k) plans, options and other programs. Going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares. 
We also paid $624.9 million in common dividends during the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $169.5 million over the same period last year. Higher dividends were driven by the increase in the shares outstanding related to the Integrys acquisition and an increase in the dividend rate compared to 2015. 
Moving to sales. We see continued customer growth across our system. At the end of December, our Wisconsin utilities were serving about 7,000 more electric customers and 12,000 more natural gas customers compared to a year ago. Our natural gas utilities in Illinois, Michigan and Minnesota were serving approximately 16,000 more customers compared to a year ago.
Now let's discuss delivered sales volumes year-over-year. For comparative purposes, 2015 electric sales information reflects results for both Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Public Service. Weather-normalized sales are adjusted to factor out the effects of leap year. Retail, electricity deliveries, excluding the iron ore mines, increased 2%. On a weather-normalized basis, retail deliveries of electricity increased 0.2% compared to 2015.
Looking at the individual customer segments. Actual residential deliveries rose 4.1% while weather-normalized residential deliveries increased 0.4%. Across a small commercial and industrial group, actual deliveries increased 2.3% while weather-normalized deliveries increased 0.9%. In the large commercial and industrial segment, deliveries for 2016 decreased 1.1%. Excluding the iron ore mines, large commercial and industrial deliveries were flat year-over-year.
Now an update on our natural gas deliveries. As you may recall, our Illinois segment has a decoupling mechanism and its margins are less affected by weather. Looking at Wisconsin, our largest segment, retail gas deliveries, excluding gas used for power generation, increased 1.6%. On a weather-normalized basis, retail gas deliveries, excluding gas used for power generation, were up 3.7% compared to 2015. Overall, our normalized results for gas and electric sales for 2016 are slightly above our expectations.
For 2017, we'll focus -- forecast and discuss delivered results for the state of Wisconsin, our largest segment. In Wisconsin, we're forecasting modest increase of 0.2% in weather-normalized retail electric deliveries, excluding the iron ore mines.
Looking at 2017 by individual customer segment, we expect residential deliveries to decline 0.2% impacted by continued modest growth in housing starts but offset by conservation. In the small commercial and industrial segment, we are projecting sales to increase 0.5%. In the large commercial and industrial group, excluding the mine, we are projecting an increase of 0.3%. We project 2017 Wisconsin weather-normalized retail gas deliveries, excluding gas used for power generation, to increase 0.5%.
Next, I'd like to remind you about earnings guidance for 2017. As Allen mentioned, we expect long-term earnings per share growth for WEC Energy Group to be in the range of 5% to 7%, off a 2015 standalone Wisconsin Energy base of $2.72 per share. Our guidance for 2017 is in the range of $3.06 per share to $3.12 per share. This is in line with our previously disclosed earnings per share growth expectation. This guidance assumes normal weather. Again, our guidance for 2017 is $3.06 per share to $3.12 per share.
Finally, let's look at the quarterly guidance. In the first quarter of 2016, we earned $1.09 per share. As you may recall, the first quarter of 2016 had warmer than normal weather, which is offset by fuel recoveries. In addition, there was a $0.04 pickup in the first quarter as a result of the repurchase a portion of the Integrys 6.11% junior notes. Taking these into account in a mild January weather and the timing of fuel recoveries, we project first quarter earnings to be in the range of $1.02 per share to $1.06 per share. That assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter. Once again, first quarter guidance for WEC Energy Group is $1.02 to $1.06.
With the that, I'll turn things back to Allen."

And effectively, what the agreement would provide for is a return on and of capital that's been invested, including the initial investment. And then as you have O&M, which we expect you would have O&M, of course, and I think it would be modest capital, but as they add some additional capital that would be required at the field, that would also be recovered kind of through that return of and on mechanism. So we'll lay all that out in the declaratory ruling, and there'll be attachments to that. The service agreements will be attached to that ruling request. Getting kind of to the second question that you asked, additional opportunities. I believe, in terms of working gas, this field has like 23.2 Bcf in terms of working gas. That's about 1/3 of our requirements. I do believe you could do some additional expansion at the field. And you could add some more working gas at the field. If you did that, that would be also covered by that service agreement sort of structure that I mentioned. I think other than that, for the Wisconsin utilities, there really aren't any other gas infrastructure things that we're looking at. So hopefully that would answer your questions."

And that kind of leaves interest deductibility. And I think I would just stress that to you, Jonathan, and everybody on the call, all this that we put into the earnings deck, it's a bit of a speculative enterprise. I mean, we're just trying to give people a sense for the impacts. On the interest deductibility front, if you take one extreme where it's still deductible but at a 20% level, well, that's $0.05 a share on a base of, say, circa $3. So that'd be fairly small, and I would expect that that's probably manageable. As you start getting to things more like $0.15, that'd be tougher for us to manage.

But I would say, as you look out, say, the 2018, 2019, 2020, which I think is kind of where you're going, the larger reductions on O&M are most likely going to be centered around our generation portfolio as we restructure that generation portfolio. And let me just give you one example in particular. Bridge back to the conversation or the prepared remarks when I was talking about the new gas-fired generation in UP. Well, once we have that new generation online and we're able to retire the Presque Isle Power Plant, the run rate of O&M at Presque Isle is about $40 million a year, which is very, very significant, both for Wisconsin Electric as well as the consolidated entity. So I do believe there'll be additional opportunities, but the really big opportunities in terms of O&M reduction are going to come more from the generation side. There will be more modest, not unimportant, but more modest opportunities and say we implement our new ERP system. So now we're going through efforts where we're trying to get all of our utilities on common systems.

After the presentation, the conference will be open to analysts for questions and answers. In conjunction with this call, a package of detailed financial information is posted at wecenergygroup.com. A replay will be available approximately 2 hours after the conclusion of this call.
And now it is now my pleasure to introduce Allen Leverett, President and Chief Executive Officer of WEC Energy Group."

Thank you for joining us today as we review our results for the first quarter. I want to start by introducing the members of our team who are here with me today: Scott Lauber, our Chief Financial Officer; Jim Schubilske, our Trea",1103,"Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today as we review our results for the first quarter. I want to start by introducing the members of our team who are here with me today: Scott Lauber, our Chief Financial Officer; Jim Schubilske, our Treasurer; Susan Martin, General Counsel; Bill Guc, Controller; and finally, Beth Straka, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations.
Now as you saw this morning, we reported first quarter earnings per share of $1.12, which is ahead of our guidance. Effective cost controls, better-than-forecasted electric fuel recoveries and the decoupling mechanisms at our Illinois and Minnesota gas utilities help to more than offset the very warm weather in the first quarter.
Scott will provide more detail in a moment. We are affirming our guidance for 2017 in the range of $3.06 per share to $3.12 per share. And this is in line with our expected long-term earnings per share growth of 5% to 7%.
Now I would like to update you on several developments on the regulatory front. On April 4, we filed the proposed settlement agreement with the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin. Under the terms of this settlement, the currently approved base rates for all of our Wisconsin utilities would be frozen for 2018 as well as 2019. This will make for a total of 4 years the base rates will be flat. This would essentially give our customers price certainty through 2019 and require us to continue to manage our costs aggressively. Under the proposed agreement, the current earnings sharing mechanisms would be extended through 2019 at Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas. In addition, a similar mechanism would be put in place in 2018 at Wisconsin Public Service for 2 years. Similar to Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas, this mechanism would provide for equal sharing between shareholders and customers of the first 50 basis points of earnings above Wisconsin Public Services allowed return on equity of 10%. All earnings above 10.5% will go back to benefit customers.
We have the support of a broad cross-section of our industrial and commercial customers. Currently, 24 customers, including 3 of our largest customers, have signed the settlement agreement. We've also briefed legislative leaders and they have been supported. As part of the agreement, we are looking to expand and make permanent some electric pricing options for our large electric customers. These options had helped many of our customers reducing their energy costs, grow their businesses and create more than 2,000 jobs.
These changes will allow us to retain an effective economic development tool and avoid a price increase for customers whose current pricing options would expire under the current terms. The commission formally began consideration of the proposed settlement on April 20. Now settlements are uncommon in Wisconsin but at this point, I expect the process to move expeditiously.
I also want to note that our proposed $230 million investment in natural gas storage for our Wisconsin Utilities is progressing through the regulatory process. In March, the Wisconsin Commission agreed to consider the merits of our petition for declaratory ruling on the reasonableness and prudence of this investment. Under the schedule set by the administrative law judge, the matter will be ready for the commission to consider and decide on June 1.
Our acquisition of Bluewater Natural Gas Holding will provide approximately 1/3 of the current storage needs of our Wisconsin natural gas distribution companies. Bluewater will have a long-term service agreement with each of our 3 natural gas distribution companies in Wisconsin.
The earnings from this investment, as well as its risk profile, are expected to be the same as if the storage was [indiscernible] by local gas distribution companies. I believe this investment will bring very meaningful benefits to our customer. In Michigan, our proceeding to obtain regulatory approval for the construction of new gas-fired generation in the Upper Peninsula is also progressing well. We are on track to conclude that process within the 270-day statutory deadline, which ends on October 27. No substantive issues or concerns have been raised and we anticipate receiving Michigan Commission approval for the project later this year. In addition, we have received all local approvals needed to accommodate the project if approved by the Michigan Commission.
As you may recall, our last several major proceedings in Michigan have resulted in settlements, which the commission approved. We would welcome a similar outcome in this case. Turning now on Illinois. We continue to make progress on the Peoples Gas system modernization program. I expect we will invest approximately $300 million this year in this program, all of which I expect will make our gas distribution system in Chicago safer, more reliable and less expensive to maintain. Although the program continues as planned, the Illinois Commission is still completing its review of the preferred approach to the program. The commission has requested that the record and the proceeding be developed further before making a final decision, and I expect an order in the fourth quarter.
Finally, on the federal regulatory front, you will recall that on September 28, 2016, FERC affirmed a prior ALJ recommendation of a 10.32% base return on equity in response to the first MISO return on equity complaint.
ATC qualifies for a 50 basis point adder for being a member of miso, thus, increasing its return on equity to 10.82%. We are currently recognizing income at this 10.82% levels. However, in the second MISO return on equity complaint case, the ALJ recommended a base return on equity of 9.7%. Again, ATC qualifies for the 50 basis point adder, which will bring its return to equity to 10.2%. When the final order is received, we anticipate transitioning to the 10.2% return on equity. We have factored this lower return into our long-term financial plan.
We are monitoring the appeals of the New England cases for developments that could impact ATC's allowed returns.
Now just a reminder on our dividend, on January 19, our board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.52 per share, which is an increase of $0.025 or 5.1% over the previous quarterly dividend level. This represents a compound annual growth rate of 6.6% from the 2015 quarter level. Our annualized dividend level stands at $2.08 per share.
We continue to target a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings. Given that we arrive in this range now, I expect our dividend growth will continue to be in line with our earnings per share growth.
Now with some additional details on our first quarter results and financial outlook, here's Scott Lauber, who's our Chief Financial Officer."

Our 2017 first quarter earnings grew to $1.12 per share from $1.09 per share in the first quarter of 2016. Our earnings were driven by effective cost control that more than offset the warmer than normal weather. The weather impact in the",936,"Thank you, Allen. Our 2017 first quarter earnings grew to $1.12 per share from $1.09 per share in the first quarter of 2016. Our earnings were driven by effective cost control that more than offset the warmer than normal weather. The weather impact in the quarter is estimated to be approximately $0.04 a share less compared to normal weather. As you recall, our guidance in the first quarter was $1.02 to $1.06 per share. Our guidance already reflected about a $0.02 per share decrease related to the warm January weather.
The continued warm weather in February and normal weather in March was offset by better-than-expected electric fuel recoveries in the quarter due to lower natural gas prices. With the warmer weather, we saw less maintenance in our field operations that allowed us to allocate resources to capital work. In addition, we aggressively managed cost with the continuation of warmer weather. The earnings packet placed on our website this morning includes a comparison of first quarter 2017 and first quarter 2016 results. Our first focus on operating income by segment and then discuss other income, interest expense and income taxes.
Referring to Page 6 of the earnings packet, our consolidated operating income for the first quarter of 2017 was $617.3 million as compared to $589.3 million in the first quarter of 2016, an increase of $28 million.
Starting with the Wisconsin segment, operating income in the first quarter increased $4.8 million from the first quarter of 2016. On the favorable side, operations and maintenance expense was $28.4 million lower. This was mostly offset by the mild winter temperatures. In the first quarter of 2017, our Illinois segment recognized an operating increase of $18.4 million compared to the first quarter of 2016. The increase was primarily driven by reduced operations and maintenance expense, and to a lesser extent, continued investment in the gas system modernization program.
The mild weather did not have a significant of an impact on our Illinois margins due to decoupling in the jurisdiction. Operating income in our Other States segment improved $1.6 million, due in part to lower operations and maintenance expense resulting from cost control measures and decoupling at our Minnesota operations.
Operating income at the We Power segment was up $4.1 million when compared to the first quarter of 2016. This increase reflects the additional investment at our Power the Future plant since the first quarter of 2016. The operating loss at our corporate and other segment increased $900,000.
Taking the changes of these segments together, we arrived at $28 million increase in operating income.
During the first quarter of 2017, earnings from our equity investment in American transmission company totaled $41.9 million, an increase of $3.4 million compared to the first quarter of last year. Other income net decreased by $17 million quarter-over-quarter. Recall that in the first quarter of 2016, we repurchased approximately $155 million of Integrys 6.11% junior subordinated notes at a discount, which contributed approximately $0.04 per share.
Interest expense increased $3.8 million quarter-over-quarter. This was primarily due to lower capitalized interest and higher short-term rates.
Our consolidated income tax is relatively flat compared to last year. As a reminder, we expect our effective income tax rate to be between 37% and 38% for 2017. Net cash provided by operating activities increased $18.7 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. A reduction in working capital was partially offset by $100 million contribution to the pension plan in January 2017.
Looking at the cash flow statement on Page 5 of the earnings package. Our capital expenditures totaled $329.7 million in the first quarter, a $17.7 million increase compared to the first quarter of 2016 as we continue to invest in our core infrastructure.
Our adjusted debt-to-capital ratio was 50.8% at the end of March, a decrease from the 51.9% adjusted debt-to-capital ratio at the end of last year. Our calculation continues to treat half of the WEC Energy Group 2017 Series A Junior subordinated notes as common equity. We are using cash to satisfy any shares required for our 401(k) plans, options and other programs. Going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares.
We also paid $104.1 million in common dividends during the first quarter of 2017, an increase of $7.9 million over the first quarter of last year.
Higher dividends were driven by the 5.1% increase as dividend rate compared to the first quarter of 2016.
Moving to sales. We see continued customer growth across our system. At the end of March, our utilities were serving approximately 8,000 more electric and 23,000 more natural gas customers than it did the same time a year ago.
Sales volume quarter-over-quarter are shown on the earnings package on Page 8. Weather-normalized sales are adjusted back to factor out the effects of leap year in 2016. Overall, our normalized results for gas and electric sales in 2017 were slightly above our expectations.
Turning now to our earnings forecasts. We are affirming our 2017 earnings guidance of $3.06 a share to $3.12 a share. This projection assumes normal weather for the remainder of the year. We are off to a strong start, however, it is early in the year and we have a lot of weather ahead of us.
Finally, we'd like to address the second quarter earnings per share guidance. We expect our second quarter 2017 earnings per share to be in the range of $0.56 to $0.60. That assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter. Again, the second quarter earnings guidance is $0.56 to $0.60 per share.
With that, I'll turn things back to Allen."

Thank you for joining us today as we review our results for the first quarter. I want to start by introducing the members of our team who are here with me today: Scott Lauber, our Chief Financial Officer; Jim Schubilske, our Trea",1103,"Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today as we review our results for the first quarter. I want to start by introducing the members of our team who are here with me today: Scott Lauber, our Chief Financial Officer; Jim Schubilske, our Treasurer; Susan Martin, General Counsel; Bill Guc, Controller; and finally, Beth Straka, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations.
Now as you saw this morning, we reported first quarter earnings per share of $1.12, which is ahead of our guidance. Effective cost controls, better-than-forecasted electric fuel recoveries and the decoupling mechanisms at our Illinois and Minnesota gas utilities help to more than offset the very warm weather in the first quarter.
Scott will provide more detail in a moment. We are affirming our guidance for 2017 in the range of $3.06 per share to $3.12 per share. And this is in line with our expected long-term earnings per share growth of 5% to 7%.
Now I would like to update you on several developments on the regulatory front. On April 4, we filed the proposed settlement agreement with the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin. Under the terms of this settlement, the currently approved base rates for all of our Wisconsin utilities would be frozen for 2018 as well as 2019. This will make for a total of 4 years the base rates will be flat. This would essentially give our customers price certainty through 2019 and require us to continue to manage our costs aggressively. Under the proposed agreement, the current earnings sharing mechanisms would be extended through 2019 at Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas. In addition, a similar mechanism would be put in place in 2018 at Wisconsin Public Service for 2 years. Similar to Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas, this mechanism would provide for equal sharing between shareholders and customers of the first 50 basis points of earnings above Wisconsin Public Services allowed return on equity of 10%. All earnings above 10.5% will go back to benefit customers.
We have the support of a broad cross-section of our industrial and commercial customers. Currently, 24 customers, including 3 of our largest customers, have signed the settlement agreement. We've also briefed legislative leaders and they have been supported. As part of the agreement, we are looking to expand and make permanent some electric pricing options for our large electric customers. These options have helped many of our customers reduce their energy costs, grow their businesses and create more than 2,000 jobs.
These changes will allow us to retain an effective economic development tool and avoid a price increase for customers whose current pricing options would expire under the current terms. The commission formally began consideration of the proposed settlement on April 20. Now settlements are uncommon in Wisconsin but at this point, I expect the process to move expeditiously.
I also want to note that our proposed $230 million investment in natural gas storage for our Wisconsin utilities is progressing through the regulatory process. In March, the Wisconsin Commission agreed to consider the merits of our petition for declaratory ruling on the reasonableness and prudence of this investment. Under the schedule set by the administrative law judge, the matter will be ready for the commission to consider and decide on June 1.
Our acquisition of Bluewater Natural Gas Holding will provide approximately 1/3 of the current storage needs of our Wisconsin natural gas distribution companies. Bluewater will have a long-term service agreement with each of our 3 natural gas distribution companies in Wisconsin.
The earnings from this investment, as well as its risk profile, are expected to be the same as if the storage was owned by local gas distribution companies. I believe this investment will bring very meaningful benefits to our customers. In Michigan, our proceeding to obtain regulatory approval for the construction of new gas-fired generation in the Upper Peninsula is also progressing well. We are on track to conclude that process within the 270-day statutory deadline, which ends on October 27. No substantive issues or concerns have been raised and we anticipate receiving Michigan Commission approval for the project later this year. In addition, we have received all local approvals needed to accommodate the project if approved by the Michigan Commission.
As you may recall, our last several major proceedings in Michigan have resulted in settlements, which the commission approved. We would welcome a similar outcome in this case. Turning now to Illinois. We continue to make progress on the Peoples Gas system modernization program. I expect we will invest approximately $300 million this year in this program, all of which I expect will make our gas distribution system in Chicago safer, more reliable and less expensive to maintain. Although the program continues as planned, the Illinois Commission is still completing its review of the preferred approach to the program. The commission has requested that the record and the proceeding be developed further before making a final decision, and I expect an order in the fourth quarter.
Finally, on the federal regulatory front, you will recall that on September 28, 2016, FERC affirmed a prior ALJ recommendation of a 10.32% base return on equity in response to the first MISO return on equity complaint.
ATC qualifies for a 50 basis point adder for being a member of MISO, thus, increasing its return on equity to 10.82%. We are currently recognizing income at this 10.82% level. However, in the second MISO return on equity complaint case, the ALJ recommended a base return on equity of 9.7%. Again, ATC qualifies for the 50 basis point adder, which will bring its return on equity to 10.2%. When the final order is received, we anticipate transitioning to the 10.2% return on equity. We have factored this lower return into our long-term financial plan.
We are monitoring the appeals of the New England cases for developments that could impact ATC's allowed returns.
Now just a reminder on our dividend, on January 19, our board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.52 per share, which is an increase of $0.025 or 5.1% over the previous quarterly dividend level. This represents a compound annual growth rate of 6.6% from the 2015 quarter level. Our annualized dividend level stands at $2.08 per share.
We continue to target a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings. Given that we arrive in this range now, I expect our dividend growth will continue to be in line with our earnings per share growth.
Now with some additional details on our first quarter results and financial outlook, here's Scott Lauber, who's our Chief Financial Officer."
315117,428077831,1185909,"WEC Energy Group, Inc., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, May 02, 2017",2017-05-02,"Earnings Calls","WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Allen. Our 2017 first quarter earnings grew to $1.12 per share from $1.09 per share in the first quarter of 2016. Our earnings were driven by effective cost control that more than offset the warmer-than-normal weather. The weather impact in the",934,"Thank you, Allen. Our 2017 first quarter earnings grew to $1.12 per share from $1.09 per share in the first quarter of 2016. Our earnings were driven by effective cost control that more than offset the warmer-than-normal weather. The weather impact in the quarter is estimated to be approximately $0.04 a share less compared to normal weather. As you recall, our guidance in the first quarter was $1.02 to $1.06 per share. Our guidance already reflected about a $0.02 per share decrease related to the warm January weather.
The continued warm weather in February and normal weather in March was offset by better-than-expected electric fuel recoveries in the quarter due to lower natural gas prices. With the warmer weather, we saw less maintenance in our field operations that allowed us to allocate resources to capital work. In addition, we aggressively managed costs with the continuation of warmer weather. The earnings packet placed on our website this morning includes a comparison of first quarter 2017 and first quarter 2016 results. Our first focus on operating income by segment and then discuss other income, interest expense and income taxes.
Referring to Page 6 of the earnings packet, our consolidated operating income for the first quarter of 2017 was $617.3 million as compared to $589.3 million in the first quarter of 2016, an increase of $28 million.
Starting with the Wisconsin segment, operating income in the first quarter increased $4.8 million from the first quarter of 2016. On the favorable side, operations and maintenance expense was $28.4 million lower. This was mostly offset by the mild winter temperatures. In the first quarter of 2017, our Illinois segment recognized an operating increase of $18.4 million compared to the first quarter of 2016. The increase was primarily driven by reduced operations and maintenance expense, and to a lesser extent, continued investment in the gas system modernization program.
The mild weather did not have a significant of an impact on our Illinois margins due to decoupling in the jurisdiction. Operating income in our Other States segment improved $1.6 million, due in part to lower operations and maintenance expense resulting from cost control measures and decoupling at our Minnesota operations.
Operating income at the We Power segment was up $4.1 million when compared to the first quarter of 2016. This increase reflects the additional investment at our Power the Future plant since the first quarter of 2016. The operating loss at our corporate and other segment increased $900,000.
Taking the changes of these segments together, we arrived at $28 million increase in operating income.
During the first quarter of 2017, earnings from our equity investment in American Transmission Company totaled $41.9 million, an increase of $3.4 million compared to the first quarter of last year. Other income net decreased by $17 million quarter-over-quarter. Recall that in the first quarter of 2016, we repurchased approximately $155 million of Integrys' 6.11% junior subordinated notes at a discount, which contributed approximately $0.04 per share.
Interest expense increased $3.8 million quarter-over-quarter. This was primarily due to lower capitalized interest and higher short-term rates.
Our consolidated income tax is relatively flat compared to last year. As a reminder, we expect our effective income tax rate to be between 37% and 38% for 2017. Net cash provided by operating activities increased $18.7 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. A reduction in working capital was partially offset by $100 million contribution to the pension plan in January 2017.
Looking at the cash flow statement on Page 5 of the earnings package. Our capital expenditures totaled $329.7 million in the first quarter, a $17.7 million increase compared to the first quarter of 2016 as we continue to invest in our core infrastructure.
Our adjusted debt-to-capital ratio was 50.8% at the end of March, a decrease from the 51.9% adjusted debt-to-capital ratio at the end of last year. Our calculation continues to treat half of the WEC Energy Group 2007 Series A Junior Subordinated Notes as common equity. We are using cash to satisfy any shares required for our 401(k) plans, options and other programs. Going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares.
We also paid $104.1 million in common dividends during the first quarter of 2017, an increase of $7.9 million over the first quarter of last year. Higher dividends were driven by the 5.1% increase of dividend rate compared to the first quarter of 2016.
Moving to sales. We see continued customer growth across our system. At the end of March, our utilities were serving approximately 8,000 more electric and 23,000 more natural gas customers than it did the same time a year ago.
Sales volume quarter-over-quarter are shown on the earnings package on Page 8. Weather-normalized sales are adjusted back to factor out the effects of leap year in 2016. Overall, our normalized results for gas and electric sales in 2017 were slightly above our expectations.
Turning now to our earnings forecasts. We are affirming our 2017 earnings guidance of $3.06 a share to $3.12 a share. This projection assumes normal weather for the remainder of the year. We are off to a strong start, however, it is early in the year and we have a lot of weather ahead of us.
Finally, we'd like to address the second quarter earnings per share guidance. We expect our second quarter 2017 earnings per share to be in the range of $0.56 to $0.60. That assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter. Again, the second quarter earnings guidance is $0.56 to $0.60 per share.
With that, I'll turn things back to Allen."

Now as you saw this morning, we reported first quarter earnings per share of $1.12, which is ahead of our guidance. Effective cost controls, better-than-forecasted electric fuel recoveries and the decoupling mechanisms at our Illinois and Minnesota gas utilities helped to more than offset the very warm weather in the first quarter.
Scott will provide more detail in a moment. We are affirming our guidance for 2017 in the range of $3.06 per share to $3.12 per share. And this is in line with our expected long-term earnings per share growth of 5% to 7%.
Now I would like to update you on several developments on the regulatory front. On April 4, we filed the proposed settlement agreement with the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin. Under the terms of this settlement, the currently approved base rates for all of our Wisconsin utilities would be frozen for 2018 as well as 2019. This will make for a total of 4 years that base rates will be flat. This would essentially give our customers price certainty through 2019 and require us to continue to manage our costs aggressively. Under the proposed agreement, the current earnings sharing mechanisms would be extended through 2019 at Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas. In addition, a similar mechanism would be put in place in 2018 at Wisconsin Public Service for 2 years. Similar to Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas, this mechanism would provide for equal sharing between shareholders and customers of the first 50 basis points of earnings above Wisconsin Public Services allowed return on equity of 10%. All earnings above 10.5% will go back to benefit customers.
We have the support of a broad cross-section of our industrial and commercial customers. Currently, 24 customers, including 3 of our largest customers, have signed the settlement agreement. We've also briefed legislative leaders and they have been supportive. As part of the agreement, we are looking to expand and make permanent some electric pricing options for our large electric customers. These options have helped many of our customers reduce their energy costs, grow their businesses and create more than 2,000 jobs.
These changes will allow us to retain an effective economic development tool and avoid a price increase for customers whose current pricing options would expire under the current terms. The commission formally began consideration of the proposed settlement on April 20. Now settlements are uncommon in Wisconsin but at this point, I expect the process to move expeditiously.
I also want to note that our proposed $230 million investment in natural gas storage for our Wisconsin utilities is progressing through the regulatory process. In March, the Wisconsin Commission agreed to consider the merits of our petition for declaratory ruling on the reasonableness and prudence of this investment. Under the schedule set by the administrative law judge, the matter will be ready for the commission to consider and decide on June 1.
Our acquisition of Bluewater Natural Gas Holding will provide approximately 1/3 of the current storage needs of our Wisconsin natural gas distribution companies. Bluewater will have a long-term service agreement with each of our 3 natural gas distribution companies in Wisconsin.
The earnings from this investment, as well as its risk profile, are expected to be the same as if the storage was owned by our local gas distribution companies. I believe this investment will bring very meaningful benefits to our customers. In Michigan, our proceeding to obtain regulatory approval for the construction of new gas-fired generation in the Upper Peninsula is also progressing well. We are on track to conclude that process within the 270-day statutory deadline, which ends on October 27. No substantive issues or concerns have been raised and we anticipate receiving Michigan Commission approval for the project later this year. In addition, we have received all local approvals needed to accommodate the project if approved by the Michigan Commission.
As you may recall, our last several major proceedings in Michigan have resulted in settlements, which the commission approved. We would welcome a similar outcome in this case. Turning now to Illinois. We continue to make progress on the Peoples Gas system modernization program. I expect we will invest approximately $300 million this year in this program, all of which I expect will make our gas distribution system in Chicago safer, more reliable and less expensive to maintain. Although the program continues as planned, the Illinois Commission is still completing its review of the preferred approach to the program. The commission has requested that the record and the proceeding be developed further before making a final decision, and I expect an order in the fourth quarter.
Finally, on the federal regulatory front, you will recall that on September 28, 2016, FERC affirmed a prior ALJ recommendation of a 10.32% base return on equity in response to the first MISO return on equity complaint.
ATC qualifies for a 50 basis point adder for being a member of MISO, thus, increasing its return on equity to 10.82%. We are currently recognizing income at this 10.82% level. However, in the second MISO return on equity complaint case, the ALJ recommended a base return on equity of 9.7%. Again, ATC qualifies for the 50 basis point adder, which will bring its return on equity to 10.2%. When the final order is received, we anticipate transitioning to the 10.2% return on equity. We have factored this lower return into our long-term financial plan.
We are monitoring the appeals of the New England cases for developments that could impact ATC's allowed returns.
Now just a reminder on our dividend, on January 19, our board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.52 per share, which is an increase of $0.025 or 5.1% over the previous quarterly dividend level. This represents a compound annual growth rate of 6.6% from the 2015 quarter level. Our annualized dividend level stands at $2.08 per share.
We continue to target a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings. Given that we arrive in this range now, I expect our dividend growth will continue to be in line with our earnings per share growth.
Now with some additional details on our first quarter results and financial outlook, here's Scott Lauber, who's our Chief Financial Officer."

Our 2017 first quarter earnings grew to $1.12 per share from $1.09 per share in the first quarter of 2016. Our earnings were driven by effective cost control that more than offset the warmer-than-normal weather. The weather impact in the",934,"Thank you, Allen. Our 2017 first quarter earnings grew to $1.12 per share from $1.09 per share in the first quarter of 2016. Our earnings were driven by effective cost control that more than offset the warmer-than-normal weather. The weather impact in the quarter is estimated to be approximately $0.04 a share less compared to normal weather. As you recall, our guidance in the first quarter was $1.02 to $1.06 per share. Our guidance already reflected about a $0.02 per share decrease related to the warm January weather.
The continued warm weather in February and normal weather in March was offset by better-than-expected electric fuel recoveries in the quarter due to lower natural gas prices. With the warmer weather, we saw less maintenance in our field operations that allowed us to allocate resources to capital work. In addition, we aggressively managed costs with the continuation of warmer weather. The earnings packet placed on our website this morning includes a comparison of first quarter 2017 and first quarter 2016 results. Our first focus on operating income by segment and then discuss other income, interest expense and income taxes.
Referring to Page 6 of the earnings packet, our consolidated operating income for the first quarter of 2017 was $617.3 million as compared to $589.3 million in the first quarter of 2016, an increase of $28 million.
Starting with the Wisconsin segment, operating income in the first quarter increased $4.8 million from the first quarter of 2016. On the favorable side, operations and maintenance expense was $28.4 million lower. This was mostly offset by the mild winter temperatures. In the first quarter of 2017, our Illinois segment recognized an operating increase of $18.4 million compared to the first quarter of 2016. The increase was primarily driven by reduced operations and maintenance expense, and to a lesser extent, continued investment in the gas system modernization program.
The mild weather did not have a significant of an impact on our Illinois margins due to decoupling in the jurisdiction. Operating income in our Other States segment improved $1.6 million, due in part to lower operations and maintenance expense resulting from cost control measures and decoupling at our Minnesota operations.
Operating income at the We Power segment was up $4.1 million when compared to the first quarter of 2016. This increase reflects the additional investment at our Power the Future plant since the first quarter of 2016. The operating loss at our corporate and other segment increased $900,000.
Taking the changes of these segments together, we arrived at $28 million increase in operating income.
During the first quarter of 2017, earnings from our equity investment in American Transmission Company totaled $41.9 million, an increase of $3.4 million compared to the first quarter of last year. Other income net decreased by $17 million quarter-over-quarter. Recall that in the first quarter of 2016, we repurchased approximately $155 million of Integrys' 6.11% junior subordinated notes at a discount, which contributed approximately $0.04 per share.
Interest expense increased $3.8 million quarter-over-quarter. This was primarily due to lower capitalized interest and higher short-term rates.
Our consolidated income tax is relatively flat compared to last year. As a reminder, we expect our effective income tax rate to be between 37% and 38% for 2017. Net cash provided by operating activities increased $18.7 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. A reduction in working capital was partially offset by $100 million contribution to the pension plan in January 2017.
Looking at the cash flow statement on Page 5 of the earnings package. Our capital expenditures totaled $329.7 million in the first quarter, a $17.7 million increase compared to the first quarter of 2016 as we continue to invest in our core infrastructure.
Our adjusted debt-to-capital ratio was 50.8% at the end of March, a decrease from the 51.9% adjusted debt-to-capital ratio at the end of last year. Our calculation continues to treat half of the WEC Energy Group 2007 Series A Junior Subordinated Notes as common equity. We are using cash to satisfy any shares required for our 401(k) plans, options and other programs. Going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares.
We also paid $104.1 million in common dividends during the first quarter of 2017, an increase of $7.9 million over the first quarter of last year. Higher dividends were driven by the 5.1% increase of dividend rate compared to the first quarter of 2016.
Moving to sales. We see continued customer growth across our system. At the end of March, our utilities were serving approximately 8,000 more electric and 23,000 more natural gas customers than they did the same time a year ago.
Sales volume quarter-over-quarter are shown on the earnings package on Page 8. Weather-normalized sales are adjusted back to factor out the effects of leap year in 2016. Overall, our normalized results for gas and electric sales in 2017 were slightly above our expectations.
Turning now to our earnings forecasts. We are affirming our 2017 earnings guidance of $3.06 a share to $3.12 a share. This projection assumes normal weather for the remainder of the year. We are off to a strong start, however, it is early in the year and we have a lot of weather ahead of us.
Finally, we'd like to address the second quarter earnings per share guidance. We expect our second quarter 2017 earnings per share to be in the range of $0.56 to $0.60. That assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter. Again, the second quarter earnings guidance is $0.56 to $0.60 per share.
With that, I'll turn things back to Allen."

Thank you for joining us today as we review our results for the first quarter. I want to start by introducing the members of our team who are here with me today: Scott Lauber, our Chief Financial Officer; Jim Schubilske, our Trea",1104,"Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today as we review our results for the first quarter. I want to start by introducing the members of our team who are here with me today: Scott Lauber, our Chief Financial Officer; Jim Schubilske, our Treasurer; Susan Martin, General Counsel; Bill Guc, Controller; and finally, Beth Straka, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations.
Now as you saw this morning, we reported first quarter earnings per share of $1.12, which is ahead of our guidance. Effective cost controls, better-than-forecasted electric fuel recoveries and the decoupling mechanisms at our Illinois and Minnesota gas utilities helped to more than offset the very warm weather in the first quarter.
Scott will provide more detail in a moment. We are affirming our guidance for 2017 in the range of $3.06 per share to $3.12 per share. And this is in line with our expected long-term earnings per share growth of 5% to 7%.
Now I would like to update you on several developments on the regulatory front. On April 4, we filed the proposed settlement agreement with the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin. Under the terms of this settlement, the currently approved base rates for all of our Wisconsin utilities would be frozen for 2018 as well as 2019. This will make for a total of 4 years that base rates will be flat. This would essentially give our customers price certainty through 2019 and require us to continue to manage our costs aggressively. Under the proposed agreement, the current earnings sharing mechanisms would be extended through 2019 at Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas. In addition, a similar mechanism would be put in place in 2018 at Wisconsin Public Service for 2 years. Similar to Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas, this mechanism would provide for equal sharing between shareholders and customers of the first 50 basis points of earnings above Wisconsin Public Services allowed return on equity of 10%. All earnings above 10.5% will go back to benefit customers.
We have the support of a broad cross-section of our industrial and commercial customers. Currently, 24 customers, including 3 of our largest customers, have signed the settlement agreement. We've also briefed legislative leaders and they have been supportive. As part of the agreement, we are looking to expand and make permanent some electric pricing options for our large electric customers. These options have helped many of our customers reduce their energy costs, grow their businesses and create more than 2,000 jobs.
These changes will allow us to retain an effective economic development tool and avoid a price increase for customers whose current pricing options would expire under the current terms. The commission formally began consideration of the proposed settlement on April 20. Now settlements are uncommon in Wisconsin but at this point, I expect the process to move expeditiously.
I also want to note that our proposed $230 million investment in natural gas storage for our Wisconsin utilities is progressing through the regulatory process. In March, the Wisconsin Commission agreed to consider the merits of our petition for declaratory ruling on the reasonableness and prudence of this investment. Under the schedule set by the administrative law judge, the matter will be ready for the commission to consider and decide on June 1.
Our acquisition of Bluewater Natural Gas Holding will provide approximately 1/3 of the current storage needs of our Wisconsin natural gas distribution companies. Bluewater will have a long-term service agreement with each of our 3 natural gas distribution companies in Wisconsin.
The earnings from this investment, as well as its risk profile, are expected to be the same as if the storage was owned by our local gas distribution companies. I believe this investment will bring very meaningful benefits to our customers. In Michigan, our proceeding to obtain regulatory approval for the construction of new gas-fired generation in the Upper Peninsula is also progressing well. We are on track to conclude that process within the 270-day statutory deadline, which ends on October 27. No substantive issues or concerns have been raised and we anticipate receiving Michigan Commission approval for the project later this year. In addition, we have received all local approvals needed to accommodate the project if approved by the Michigan Commission.
As you may recall, our last several major proceedings in Michigan have resulted in settlements, which the commission approved. We would welcome a similar outcome in this case. Turning now to Illinois. We continue to make progress on the Peoples Gas system modernization program. I expect we will invest approximately $300 million this year in this program, all of which I expect will make our gas distribution system in Chicago safer, more reliable and less expensive to maintain. Although the program continues as planned, the Illinois Commission is still completing its review of the preferred approach to the program. The commission has requested that the record and the proceeding be developed further before making a final decision, and I expect an order in the fourth quarter.
Finally, on the federal regulatory front, you will recall that on September 28, 2016, FERC affirmed a prior ALJ recommendation of a 10.32% base return on equity in response to the first MISO return on equity complaint.
ATC qualifies for a 50 basis point adder for being a member of MISO, thus, increasing its return on equity to 10.82%. We are currently recognizing income at this 10.82% level. However, in the second MISO return on equity complaint case, the ALJ recommended a base return on equity of 9.7%. Again, ATC qualifies for the 50 basis point adder, which will bring its return on equity to 10.2%. When the final order is received, we anticipate transitioning to the 10.2% return on equity. We have factored this lower return into our long-term financial plan.
We are monitoring the appeals of the New England cases for developments that could impact ATC's allowed returns.
Now just a reminder on our dividend, on January 19, our board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.52 per share, which is an increase of $0.025 or 5.1% over the previous quarterly dividend level. This represents a compound annual growth rate of 6.6% from the 2015 quarter level. Our annualized dividend level stands at $2.08 per share.
We continue to target a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings. Given that we arrive in this range now, I expect our dividend growth will continue to be in line with our earnings per share growth.
Now with some additional details on our first quarter results and financial outlook, here's Scott Lauber, who's our Chief Financial Officer."
315117,428077831,1189448,"WEC Energy Group, Inc., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, May 02, 2017",2017-05-02,"Earnings Calls","WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Allen. Our 2017 first quarter earnings grew to $1.12 per share from $1.09 per share in the first quarter of 2016. Our earnings were driven by effective cost control that more than offset the warmer-than-normal weather. The weather impact in the",934,"Thank you, Allen. Our 2017 first quarter earnings grew to $1.12 per share from $1.09 per share in the first quarter of 2016. Our earnings were driven by effective cost control that more than offset the warmer-than-normal weather. The weather impact in the quarter is estimated to be approximately $0.04 a share less compared to normal weather. As you recall, our guidance in the first quarter was $1.02 to $1.06 per share. Our guidance already reflected about a $0.02 per share decrease related to the warm January weather.
The continued warm weather in February and normal weather in March was offset by better-than-expected electric fuel recoveries in the quarter due to lower natural gas prices. With the warmer weather, we saw less maintenance in our field operations that allowed us to allocate resources to capital work. In addition, we aggressively managed costs with the continuation of warmer weather. The earnings packet placed on our website this morning includes a comparison of first quarter 2017 and first quarter 2016 results. Our first focus on operating income by segment and then discuss other income, interest expense and income taxes.
Referring to Page 6 of the earnings packet, our consolidated operating income for the first quarter of 2017 was $617.3 million as compared to $589.3 million in the first quarter of 2016, an increase of $28 million.
Starting with the Wisconsin segment, operating income in the first quarter increased $4.8 million from the first quarter of 2016. On the favorable side, operations and maintenance expense was $28.4 million lower. This was mostly offset by the mild winter temperatures. In the first quarter of 2017, our Illinois segment recognized an operating increase of $18.4 million compared to the first quarter of 2016. The increase was primarily driven by reduced operations and maintenance expense, and to a lesser extent, continued investment in the gas system modernization program.
The mild weather did not have a significant of an impact on our Illinois margins due to decoupling in the jurisdiction. Operating income in our Other States segment improved $1.6 million, due in part to lower operations and maintenance expense resulting from cost control measures and decoupling at our Minnesota operations.
Operating income at the We Power segment was up $4.1 million when compared to the first quarter of 2016. This increase reflects the additional investment at our Power the Future plant since the first quarter of 2016. The operating loss at our corporate and other segment increased $900,000.
Taking the changes of these segments together, we arrived at $28 million increase in operating income.
During the first quarter of 2017, earnings from our equity investment in American Transmission Company totaled $41.9 million, an increase of $3.4 million compared to the first quarter of last year. Other income net decreased by $17 million quarter-over-quarter. Recall that in the first quarter of 2016, we repurchased approximately $155 million of Integrys' 6.11% junior subordinated notes at a discount, which contributed approximately $0.04 per share.
Interest expense increased $3.8 million quarter-over-quarter. This was primarily due to lower capitalized interest and higher short-term rates.
Our consolidated income tax is relatively flat compared to last year. As a reminder, we expect our effective income tax rate to be between 37% and 38% for 2017. Net cash provided by operating activities increased $18.7 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. A reduction in working capital was partially offset by $100 million contribution to the pension plan in January 2017.
Looking at the cash flow statement on Page 5 of the earnings package. Our capital expenditures totaled $329.7 million in the first quarter, a $17.7 million increase compared to the first quarter of 2016 as we continue to invest in our core infrastructure.
Our adjusted debt-to-capital ratio was 50.8% at the end of March, a decrease from the 51.9% adjusted debt-to-capital ratio at the end of last year. Our calculation continues to treat half of the WEC Energy Group 2007 Series A Junior Subordinated Notes as common equity. We are using cash to satisfy any shares required for our 401(k) plans, options and other programs. Going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares.
We also paid $104.1 million in common dividends during the first quarter of 2017, an increase of $7.9 million over the first quarter of last year. Higher dividends were driven by the 5.1% increase of dividend rate compared to the first quarter of 2016.
Moving to sales. We see continued customer growth across our system. At the end of March, our utilities were serving approximately 8,000 more electric and 23,000 more natural gas customers than they did the same time a year ago.
Sales volume quarter-over-quarter are shown on the earnings package on Page 8. Weather-normalized sales are adjusted back to factor out the effects of leap year in 2016. Overall, our normalized results for gas and electric sales in 2017 were slightly above our expectations.
Turning now to our earnings forecasts. We are affirming our 2017 earnings guidance of $3.06 a share to $3.12 a share. This projection assumes normal weather for the remainder of the year. We are off to a strong start, however, it is early in the year and we have a lot of weather ahead of us.
Finally, we'd like to address the second quarter earnings per share guidance. We expect our second quarter 2017 earnings per share to be in the range of $0.56 to $0.60. That assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter. Again, the second quarter earnings guidance is $0.56 to $0.60 per share.
With that, I'll turn things back to Allen."

Now, like we talked about the quarter, it was extremely warm this quarter so normalization in this sector, in all sectors, is pretty tricky, especially when you're talking commercial, there's a variety of commercial operations there. So the class has always been a little stronger for us. In our long-term forecasts, we have about 0.5% here for next year, for this coming year. So it was a good quarter but once again it was only 1 quarter. I'd still look at overall being about 0.5% in that small C&I class."

Thank you for joining us today as we review our results for the second quarter. I want to start by introducing the members of our team who are here with me today: Scott Lauber, our Chief Financial Officer; Jim Schubilske, our Treasurer; Susan Martin, General Counsel; Bill Guc, Controller; and finally, Beth Straka, our Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations.
Now As you saw this morning, we reported second quarter 2017 earnings per share of $0.63. Effective cost controls and warm weather than normal June weather contributed to a solid second quarter. Scott will provide more detail in a moment. 
We are affirming our current 2017 guidance of $3.06 per share to $3.12 per share, with an expectation of being in the upper end of the range. This is in line with our expected long-term earnings per share growth of 5% to 7%.
Now I would like to update you on our major investments and several developments on the regulatory front. On June 30, we closed the acquisition of Bluewater Natural Gas Holding after the Wisconsin Public Service Commission approved the investment. This $230 million investment in natural gas storage will provide approximately 1/3 of the current storage needs of our Wisconsin natural gas distribution companies. Bluewater will add a long-term service agreement with each of these 3 companies. The earnings and risk profile from this investment are expected to be essentially the same as if the storage was owned by our local gas distribution addition companies. I believe this investment will bring very meaningful benefits to our customers. You may recall on April 4, we filed the proposed settlement agreement with the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin. 
Now under the terms of this settlement, the currently approved base rates for all of our Wisconsin utilities would be frozen for 2018 and 2019. This would make a total of 4 years that base rates will be flat and essentially gives our customers price certainty through 2019. The settlement also requires that we continue to manage our costs aggressively. Under the proposed agreement, the current earnings sharing mechanisms would be extended through 2019 at Wisconsin Electric and at Wisconsin Gas. In addition, a similar mechanism would be put in place for 2018 and 2019 at Wisconsin Public Service. There would be equal sharing between customers and shareholders of the first 50 basis points of earnings above Wisconsin Public Service's allowed return on equity of 10%. All earnings above 10.5% will go back to benefit customers. 
As part of the agreement, we are looking to expand and make permanent some electric pricing options for our large electric customers. These options have helped many of our customers reduce their energy costs, grow their businesses and create more than 2,000 jobs. These changes will allow us to retain an effective economic development tool and avoid a price increase for customers whose current pricing options would expire under existing terms. The settlement has the support and with broad cross-section of our industrial and commercial customers. In addition, state legislative leaders are supporting. The commission began consideration of the proposal on April 20. Then on May 25, Wisconsin Commission staff issued a schedule outlining the key dates. On July 19, the Wisconsin Commission staff issued a memorandum in response to our proposed rate freeze settlement. Staff's review confirmed an electric revenue deficiency and, thus, in my view, demonstrated that the settlement we arrived at with our customers remains in the best interest of all of our customers. However, the staff proposed a wide to range of conditions to the settlement. Unfortunately, none of these conditions are acceptable to us. 
Looking forward from today, comments to the staff memo are due on August 2. Reply comments are due on August 8. We expect the commission to make a decision on the proposed settlement in the late August to September time frame. Should the commission reject the proposed settlement, I expect we will file a traditional rate case. 
In Michigan, our proceeding to obtain regulatory approval for the construction of new gas-fired generation in the Upper Peninsula is progressing well. We anticipate receiving Michigan Commission approval within the 270-day statutory deadline, which ends on October 27. In addition, we have received all local approvals needed to accommodate the project. If approved by the Michigan Commission, we expect this to be a $265 million investment. 
Turning to Illinois. We continue to make progress on the People's Gas System Modernization program. This program is designed to make our gas distribution system in Chicago safer, more reliable and less expensive to maintain. Consistent with our plan, we expect to invest $300 million in the program this year. 
Now a reminder on our dividend. On January 19, our board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.52 per share, which is an increase of $2.5 or 5.1% over the previous quarterly dividend level. This represents a compound annual growth rate of 6.6% from the 2015 fourth quarter level. Our annualized dividend levels stands at $2.08 per share. We continue to target a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings. And given that we arrive in this range now, I expect our dividend growth will continue to be in line with our earnings per share growth. 
Finally, here in Wisconsin, we're seeing some promising economic activity. The state's per capita real GDP has grown faster than the U.S. average. Wisconsin's unemployment rate fell to 3.1% in May, the lowest it has been since 1999, and well below the U.S. average of 4.3%. In Southeastern Wisconsin in particular, there are a number of active ongoing projects. Now with some additional details on our first quarter results and the financial outlook, here's Scott Lauber, our Chief Financial Officer."

We exceeded our guidance for the second quarter, wh",1086,"Thank you, Allen. Our 2017 second quarter earnings increased to $0.63 per share from $0.57 per share in the second quarter of 2016. Effective cost controls continue to have a positive impact on earnings. We exceeded our guidance for the second quarter, which, as you recall, was $0.56 to $0.60 per share. Lower-than-expected costs at our Illinois utilities and warmer than normal June weather contributed to these results. The earnings package placed on our website this morning includes a comparison of second quarter and year-to-date 2017 and 2016 results. My focus will be on the quarter, beginning with operating income by segment and then other income, interest expense and income taxes.
Referring to Page 7 of the earnings packet, our consolidated operating income for the second quarter of 2017 was $362.2 million as compared to $332.1 million in the second quarter of 2016, an increase of $30.1 million. Starting with the Wisconsin segment, operating income in the second quarter increased $8.9 million in the second quarter of 2016. On the favorable side, operation and maintenance expense was $29.1 million lower. This was largely offset by lower customer usage related to mild weather conditions in April and May. In the second quarter of 2017, our Illinois segment recognized operating income increase of $18.8 million compared to the second quarter of 2016. The increase was primarily driven by reduced operations and maintenance expense and continued investment in the gas system modernization program. 
Operating income and Other States segment improved $2.4 million related to lower operations and maintenance expense resulting from cost control measures.
Following last month's acquisition of Bluewater Natural Gas Holding, our We Power segment was renamed the Non-Utility Energy segment. For the second quarter, operating income at the Non-Utility Energy segment was up $4.6 million. This increase reflects the additional investment at our Power of The Future plant since in the second quarter of 2016. Beginning in the third quarter of 2017, this segment also will include the results of Bluewater. 
The operating loss at our corporate and other segment was $6.2 million for the second quarter of 2017, an increase of $4.6 million compared to the second quarter of last year. Taking the changes of these segments together, we arrived at $30.1 million increase in operating income.
During the second quarter of 2017, earnings from our equity investment in American Transmission Company totaled $41.8 million, an increase of $10.9 million compared to the same period of the prior year. Recall that in the second quarter of 2016, we recognized lower earnings from ATC as a result of the ALJ recommendation related to the FERC ROE reviews. 
Other income net decreased by $19.3 million quarter-over-quarter. Driving the decrease was a $19.6 million gain recognized in the second quarter of 2016 from the sale of the [ Childwater ] Generation and Distribution assets of [indiscernible]. Interest expense increased $1.8 million quarter-over-quarter, driven by lower capitalized interest.
Turning now to consolidated income taxes. We still expect tax rate will be between 37% and 38% this year. However, our effective tax rate in the second quarter was down 1.8% when compared to the same period last year, due largely to the settlement of several items. Combining all of these items brings us to earnings of $199.1 million or $0.63 per share  the second quarter of 2017 compared to $181.4 million or $0.57 per share for the second quarter of 2016.
Net cash provided by operating activities increased $43.10 million during the 6 months ended June 30, 2017, compared to the same period in the prior year. A reduction in the working capital and higher operating income were partially offset by $100 million contribution to the pension plan in January 2017.
Looking at the cash flow statement on Page 6 of the earnings package. Our capital expenditures totaled $790 million in the first half of 2017, a $171.3 million increase compared to the first half of 2016 as we continue to invest in our core infrastructure. I want to remind you, we also invested $230 million through our acquisition of Bluewater, however, this investment is identified as a separate line on the cash flow statement.
Our adjusted debt-to-capital ratio was 51.5% at the end of June, a decrease from the 51.9% adjusted debt-to-capital ratio at the end of last year. Our calculation continues to be half the WEC Energy Group 2007 Series A Junior Subordinated Notes common equity. We're using cash to satisfy any shares required for 401(k) plans, options and other programs. Going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares.
We've paid $3283 million in common dividends during the first 6 months of 2017, an increase of $15.9 million over the same period last year. Higher dividends were driven by the 5.1% increase in the dividend rate compared to the first half of 2016.
Moving to sales. We've continued to see customer growth across our system. At the end of June, our utilities were serving approximately 9,000 more electric and 13,000 more natural gas customers than they did the same time a year ago.
Retail, electric and natural gas sales volumes are shown on a comparative basis on Page 11 and 12 of the earnings package, respectively. On a year-to-date basis, weather-normalized sales are adjusted to factor out the effects of leap year 2016. Overall normalized sales results for natural gas were above our expectations and retail and electric sales were slightly below our expectations. 
Turning now to our earnings forecasts. As Allen mentioned, we are affirming our 2017 earnings guidance of $3.06 a share to $3.12 a share with an expectation of being in the upper end of the range. This projection assumes normal weather for the remainder of the year. Finally, I'd like to address the third quarter earnings per share guidance. As a reminder, during last year's third quarter, we earned $0.68 per share. This included $0.01 of acquisition costs to arrive at an adjusted earnings of $0.69 per share. Earnings at quarter were primarily driven by weather that was 43% warmer than normal in South Eastern Wisconsin and related positive fuel recoveries that were partially offset by the Wisconsin sharing mechanisms. These items add approximately $0.07 to the quarter of 2016 to arrive at a base of $0.62 per share. Taking this into account, we expect our third quarter 2017 earnings per share to be in the range of $0.63 to $0.67 per share. This assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter.
With that, I'll turn things back to Allen."

So Scott, do you want to give Paul some additional color on that?"

But I guess, they also sort of talking about the ROE and how can that maybe change a few things if that was changed. And then they also discussed the concern that they apparently have about rate increases in the future because of the deferrals. And based on what I'm hearing from what you're saying, it looks like unless the commission is okay with these deferrals growing, that you probably have to go in for rate case, is that right?"

So we've sort of delevel '19 year end versus '17 year end. So we wouldn't have any additional accumulation of balances and the hope that we have is this with tax reform, that then he would start having some uplift, if you will, or a cost reduction effectively that he could use to start managing those balances down. But if you look at during the pendency of the rate freeze period that we proposed in the settlement, it wouldn't be any growth at all in those balances."

Thank you for joining us today as we review our results for the second quarter.

Thank you for joining us today as we review our results for the second quarter. I want to start by introducing the members of our team who are here with me today: Scott Lauber, our Chief Financial Officer; Jim Schubilske, our Treasurer; Susan Martin, General Counsel; Bill Guc, Controller; and finally, Beth Straka, our Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations.
Now As you saw this morning, we reported second quarter 2017 earnings per share of $0.63. Effective cost controls and warmer than normal June weather contributed to a solid second quarter. Scott will provide more detail in a moment. We are affirming our current 2017 guidance of $3.06 per share to $3.12 per share with an expectation of being in the upper end of the range. This is in line with our expected long-term earnings per share growth of 5% to 7%.
Now I would like to update you on our major investments and several developments on the regulatory front. On June 30, we closed the acquisition of Bluewater Natural Gas Holding after the Wisconsin Public Service Commission approved the investment. This $230 million investment in natural gas storage will provide approximately 1/3 of the current storage needs of our Wisconsin natural gas distribution companies. Bluewater will have a long-term service agreement with each of these 3 companies. The earnings and risk profile from this investment are expected to be essentially the same as if the storage was owned by our local gas distribution companies. I believe this investment will bring very meaningful benefits to our customers. 
You may recall on April 4, we filed a proposed settlement agreement with the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin. Now under the terms of this settlement, the currently approved base rates for all of our Wisconsin utilities would be frozen for 2018 and 2019. This would make a total of 4 years that base rates will be flat and essentially gives our customers price certainty through 2019. The settlement also requires that we continue to manage our costs aggressively. 
Under the proposed agreement, the current earning sharing mechanisms would be extended through 2019 at Wisconsin Electric and at Wisconsin Gas. In addition, a similar mechanism would be put in place for 2018 and 2019 at Wisconsin Public Service. There would be equal sharing between customers and shareholders of the first 50 basis points of earnings above Wisconsin Public Service's allowed return on equity of 10%. All earnings above 10.5% would go back to benefit customers. 
As part of the agreement, we are looking to expand and make permanent some electric pricing options for our large electric customers. These options have helped many of our customers reduce their energy costs, grow their businesses and create more than 2,000 jobs. These changes will allow us to retain an effective economic development tool and avoid a price increase for customers whose current pricing options would expire under existing terms. The settlement has the support of a broad cross-section of our industrial and commercial customers. In addition, state legislative leaders are supportive. 
The commission began consideration of the proposed settlement on April 20. Then on May 25, Wisconsin Commission staff issued a schedule outlining the key dates. On July 19th, the Wisconsin Commission staff issued a memorandum in response to our proposed rate freeze settlement. Staff's review confirmed an electric revenue deficiency, and thus in my view, demonstrated that the settlement we arrived at with our customers remains in the best interest of all of our customers. However, the staff proposed a wide range of conditions to the settlement. Unfortunately, none of these conditions are acceptable to us. 
Looking forward from today, comments to the staff memo are due on August 2. Reply comments are due on August 8. We expect the commission to make a decision on the proposed settlement in the late August to September time frame. Should the commission reject the proposed settlement, I expect we will file a traditional rate case. 
In Michigan, our proceeding to obtain regulatory approval for the construction of new gas-fired generation in the Upper Peninsula is progressing well. We anticipate receiving Michigan Commission approval within the 270-day statutory deadline which ends on October 27. In addition, we have received all local approvals needed to accommodate the project. If approved by the Michigan Commission, we expect this to be a $265 million investment. 
Turning to Illinois. We continue to make progress on the Peoples Gas system modernization program. This program is designed to make our gas distribution system in Chicago safer, more reliable and less expensive to maintain. Consistent with our plan, we expect to invest $300 million in the program this year. 
Now a reminder on our dividend. On January 19, our board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.52 per share, which is an increase of $0.025 or 5.1% over the previous quarterly dividend level. This represents a compound annual growth rate of 6.6% from the 2015 fourth quarter level. Our annualized dividend level stands at $2.08 per share. We continue to target a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings. And given that we arrive in this range now, I expect our dividend growth will continue to be in line with our earnings per share growth. 
Finally, here in Wisconsin, we're seeing some promising economic activity. The state's per capita real GDP has grown faster than the U.S. average. Wisconsin's unemployment rate fell to 3.1% in May, the lowest it has been since 1999, and well below the U.S. average of 4.3%. In Southeastern Wisconsin in particular, there are a number of active ongoing projects. 
Now with some additional details on our first quarter results and the financial outlook, here's Scott Lauber, our Chief Financial Officer."

Effective cost controls continue to have a positive impact on earnings. We exceeded our guidance for the second quarter, which, as you recall, was $0.56 to $0.60 per share. Lower-than-expected costs at our Illinois utilities and warmer-than-normal June weather contributed to these results. 
The earnings package placed on our website this morning includes a comparison of second quarter and year-to-date 2017 and 2016 results. My focus will be on the quarter, beginning with operating income by segment and then other income, interest expense and income taxes.
Referring to Page 7 of the earnings packet, our consolidated operating income for the second quarter of 2017 was $362.2 million as compared to $332.1 million in the second quarter of 2016, an increase of $30.1 million. 
Starting with the Wisconsin segment, operating income in the second quarter increased $8.9 million from the second quarter of 2016. On the favorable side, operation and maintenance expense was $29.1 million lower. This was largely offset by lower customer usage related to mild weather conditions in April and May. 
In the second quarter of 2017, our Illinois segment recognized operating income increase of $18.8 million compared to the second quarter of 2016. The increase was primarily driven by reduced operations and maintenance expense and continued investment in the gas system modernization program. 
Operating income in our Other States segment improved $2.4 million related to lower operations and maintenance expense resulting from cost control measures.
Following last month's acquisition of Bluewater Natural Gas Holding, our We Power segment was renamed the non-utility energy segment. For the second quarter, operating income at the non-utility energy segment was up $4.6 million. This increase reflects the additional investment in our Power the Future plant since in the second quarter of 2016. Beginning in the third quarter of 2017, this segment also will include the results of Bluewater. The operating loss at our corporate and other segment was $6.2 million for the second quarter of 2017, an increase of $4.6 million compared to the second quarter of last year. Taking the changes of these segments together, we arrive at $30.1 million increase in operating income.
During the second quarter of 2017, earnings from our equity investment in American Transmission Company totaled $41.8 million, an increase of $10.9 million compared to the same period of the prior year. Recall that in the second quarter of 2016, we recognized lower earnings from ATC as a result of the ALJ recommendation related to the FERC ROE reviews. 
Other income net decreased by $19.3 million quarter-over-quarter. Driving the decrease was a $19.6 million gain recognized in the second quarter of 2016 from the sale of the chilled water generation and distribution assets of Wisvest. Interest expense increased $1.8 million quarter-over-quarter, driven by lower capitalized interest.
Turning now to consolidated income taxes. We still expect [indiscernible] tax rate will be between 37% and 38% this year. However, our effective tax rate in the second quarter was down 1.8% when compared to the same period last year, due largely to the settlement of several items. 
Combining all of these items brings us to earnings of $199.1 million or $0.63 per share for the second quarter of 2017 compared to $181.4 million or $0.57 per share for the second quarter of 2016.
Net cash provided by operating activities increased $43.10 million during the 6 months ended June 30, 2017, compared to the same period in the prior year. A reduction in the working capital and higher operating income were partially offset by $100 million contribution to the pension plan in January 2017.
Looking at the cash flow statement on Page 6 of the earnings package. Our capital expenditures totaled $790 million in the first half of 2017, a $171.3 million increase compared to the first half of 2016 as we continue to invest in our core infrastructure. I want to remind you, we also invested $230 million through our acquisition of Bluewater, however, this investment is identified as a separate line in the cash flow statement.
Our adjusted debt-to-capital ratio was 51.5% at the end of June, a decrease from the 51.9% adjusted debt-to-capital ratio at the end of last year. Our calculation continues to treat half the WEC Energy Group 2007 series A junior subordinate notes as common equities. We are using cash to satisfy any shares required for our 401(k) plans, options and other programs. Going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares.
We've paid $328.3 million in common dividends during the first 6 months of 2017, an increase of $15.9 million over the same period last year. Higher dividends were driven by the 5.1% increase in the dividend rate compared to the first half of 2016.
Moving to sales. We continue to see customer growth across our system. At the end of June, our utilities were serving approximately 9,000 more electric and 13,000 more natural gas customers than they did the same time a year ago. Retail, electric and natural gas sales volumes are shown on a comparative basis on Page 11 and 12 of the earnings package, respectively. 
On a year-to-date basis, weather-normalized sales are adjusted to factor out the effects of leap year in 2016. Overall normalized sales results for natural gas were above our expectation and retail electric sales were slightly below our expectations. 
Turning now to our earnings forecast. As Allen mentioned, we are affirming our 2017 earnings guidance of $3.06 a share to $3.12 a share with an expectation of being in the upper end of the range. This projection assumes normal weather for the remainder of the year. 
Finally, I'd like to address the third quarter earnings per share guidance. As a reminder, during last year's third quarter, we earned $0.68 per share. This included $0.01 of acquisition costs to arrive at adjusted earnings of $0.69 per share. Earnings that quarter were primarily driven by weather that was 43% warmer than normal in Southeastern Wisconsin and related positive fuel recoveries that were partially offset by the Wisconsin sharing mechanisms. These items add approximately $0.07 to the quarter of 2016 to arrive at a base of $0.62 per share. Taking these into account, we expect our third quarter 2017 earnings per share to be in the range of $0.63 to $0.67 per share. This assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter.
With that, I'll turn things back to Allen."

So if it's not accepted in whole, well, the settlement basically falls away unless we and the other parties who came up with the settlement, unless we all agree to a different set of conditions. So we wouldn't be compelled, Greg, in the scenario you lay out, to accept that modified settlement, if you will.

We don't know if it'll be a the second half of the year. But currently, we're booking at the 10.82%. So the main driver, the swing between quarters there was the entry last year to get down to the first reserve needed. And it's maybe a little bit higher, too, because we're booking at a 10.82%.

Thank you for joining us today as we review our results for the second quarter.

Thank you for joining us today as we review our results for the second quarter. I want to start by introducing the members of our team who are here with me today: Scott Lauber, our Chief Financial Officer; Jim Schubilske, our Treasurer; Susan Martin, General Counsel; Bill Guc, Controller; and finally, Beth Straka, our Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations.
Now As you saw this morning, we reported second quarter 2017 earnings per share of $0.63. Effective cost controls and warmer than normal June weather contributed to a solid second quarter. Scott will provide more detail in a moment. We are affirming our current 2017 guidance of $3.06 per share to $3.12 per share with an expectation of being in the upper end of the range. This is in line with our expected long-term earnings per share growth of 5% to 7%.
Now I would like to update you on our major investments and several developments on the regulatory front. On June 30, we closed the acquisition of Bluewater Natural Gas Holding after the Wisconsin Public Service Commission approved the investment. This $230 million investment in natural gas storage will provide approximately 1/3 of the current storage needs of our Wisconsin natural gas distribution companies. Bluewater will have a long-term service agreement with each of these 3 companies. The earnings and risk profile from this investment are expected to be essentially the same as if the storage was owned by our local gas distribution companies. I believe this investment will bring very meaningful benefits to our customers. 
You may recall on April 4, we filed a proposed settlement agreement with the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin. Now under the terms of this settlement, the currently approved base rates for all of our Wisconsin utilities would be frozen for 2018 and 2019. This would make a total of 4 years that base rates will be flat and essentially gives our customers price certainty through 2019. The settlement also requires that we continue to manage our costs aggressively. 
Under the proposed agreement, the current earning sharing mechanisms would be extended through 2019 at Wisconsin Electric and at Wisconsin Gas. In addition, a similar mechanism would be put in place for 2018 and 2019 at Wisconsin Public Service. There would be equal sharing between customers and shareholders of the first 50 basis points of earnings above Wisconsin Public Service's allowed return on equity of 10%. All earnings above 10.5% would go back to benefit customers. 
As part of the agreement, we are looking to expand and make permanent some electric pricing options for our large electric customers. These options have helped many of our customers reduce their energy costs, grow their businesses and create more than 2,000 jobs. These changes will allow us to retain an effective economic development tool and avoid a price increase for customers whose current pricing options would expire under existing terms. The settlement has the support of a broad cross-section of our industrial and commercial customers. In addition, state legislative leaders are supportive. 
The commission began consideration of the proposed settlement on April 20. Then on May 25, Wisconsin Commission staff issued a schedule outlining the key dates. On July 19th, the Wisconsin Commission staff issued a memorandum in response to our proposed rate freeze settlement. Staff's review confirmed an electric revenue deficiency, and thus in my view, demonstrated that the settlement we arrived at with our customers remains in the best interest of all of our customers. However, the staff proposed a wide range of conditions to the settlement. Unfortunately, none of these conditions are acceptable to us. 
Looking forward from today, comments to the staff memo are due on August 2. Reply comments are due on August 8. We expect the commission to make a decision on the proposed settlement in the late August to September time frame. Should the commission reject the proposed settlement, I expect we will file a traditional rate case. 
In Michigan, our proceeding to obtain regulatory approval for the construction of new gas-fired generation in the Upper Peninsula is progressing well. We anticipate receiving Michigan Commission approval within the 270-day statutory deadline which ends on October 27. In addition, we have received all local approvals needed to accommodate the project. If approved by the Michigan Commission, we expect this to be a $265 million investment. 
Turning to Illinois. We continue to make progress on the Peoples Gas system modernization program. This program is designed to make our gas distribution system in Chicago safer, more reliable and less expensive to maintain. Consistent with our plan, we expect to invest $300 million in the program this year. 
Now a reminder on our dividend. On January 19, our board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.52 per share, which is an increase of $0.025 or 5.1% over the previous quarterly dividend level. This represents a compound annual growth rate of 6.6% from the 2015 fourth quarter level. Our annualized dividend level stands at $2.08 per share. We continue to target a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings. And given that we arrive in this range now, I expect our dividend growth will continue to be in line with our earnings per share growth. 
Finally, here in Wisconsin, we're seeing some promising economic activity. The state's per capita real GDP has grown faster than the U.S. average. Wisconsin's unemployment rate fell to 3.1% in May, the lowest it has been since 1999, and well below the U.S. average of 4.3%. In Southeastern Wisconsin in particular, there are a number of active ongoing projects. 
Now with some additional details on our first quarter results and the financial outlook, here's Scott Lauber, our Chief Financial Officer."

Effective cost controls continue to have a positive impact on earnings. We exceeded our guidance for the second quarter, which, as you recall, was $0.56 to $0.60 per share. Lower-than-expected costs at our Illinois utilities and warmer-than-normal June weather contributed to these results. 
The earnings package placed on our website this morning includes a comparison of second quarter and year-to-date 2017 and 2016 results. My focus will be on the quarter, beginning with operating income by segment and then other income, interest expense and income taxes.
Referring to Page 7 of the earnings packet, our consolidated operating income for the second quarter of 2017 was $362.2 million as compared to $332.1 million in the second quarter of 2016, an increase of $30.1 million. 
Starting with the Wisconsin segment, operating income in the second quarter increased $8.9 million from the second quarter of 2016. On the favorable side, operation and maintenance expense was $29.1 million lower. This was largely offset by lower customer usage related to mild weather conditions in April and May. 
In the second quarter of 2017, our Illinois segment recognized operating income increase of $18.8 million compared to the second quarter of 2016. The increase was primarily driven by reduced operations and maintenance expense and continued investment in the gas system modernization program. 
Operating income in our Other States segment improved $2.4 million related to lower operations and maintenance expense resulting from cost control measures.
Following last month's acquisition of Bluewater Natural Gas Holding, our We Power segment was renamed the non-utility energy segment. For the second quarter, operating income at the non-utility energy segment was up $4.6 million. This increase reflects the additional investment in our Power the Future plant since in the second quarter of 2016. Beginning in the third quarter of 2017, this segment also will include the results of Bluewater. The operating loss at our corporate and other segment was $6.2 million for the second quarter of 2017, an increase of $4.6 million compared to the second quarter of last year. Taking the changes of these segments together, we arrive at $30.1 million increase in operating income.
During the second quarter of 2017, earnings from our equity investment in American Transmission Company totaled $41.8 million, an increase of $10.9 million compared to the same period of the prior year. Recall that in the second quarter of 2016, we recognized lower earnings from ATC as a result of the ALJ recommendation related to the FERC ROE reviews. 
Other income net decreased by $19.3 million quarter-over-quarter. Driving the decrease was a $19.6 million gain recognized in the second quarter of 2016 from the sale of the chilled water generation and distribution assets of Wisvest. Interest expense increased $1.8 million quarter-over-quarter, driven by lower capitalized interest.
Turning now to consolidated income taxes. We still expect [indiscernible] tax rate will be between 37% and 38% this year. However, our effective tax rate in the second quarter was down 1.8% when compared to the same period last year, due largely to the settlement of several items. 
Combining all of these items brings us to earnings of $199.1 million or $0.63 per share for the second quarter of 2017 compared to $181.4 million or $0.57 per share for the second quarter of 2016.
Net cash provided by operating activities increased $43.9 million during the 6 months ended June 30, 2017, compared to the same period in the prior year. A reduction in the working capital and higher operating income were partially offset by $100 million contribution to the pension plan in January 2017.
Looking at the cash flow statement on Page 6 of the earnings package. Our capital expenditures totaled $790 million in the first half of 2017, a $171.3 million increase compared to the first half of 2016 as we continue to invest in our core infrastructure. I want to remind you, we also invested $230 million through our acquisition of Bluewater, however, this investment is identified as a separate line in the cash flow statement.
Our adjusted debt-to-capital ratio was 51.5% at the end of June, a decrease from the 51.9% adjusted debt-to-capital ratio at the end of last year. Our calculation continues to treat half the WEC Energy Group 2007 series A junior subordinate notes as common equities. We are using cash to satisfy any shares required for our 401(k) plans, options and other programs. Going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares.
We've paid $328.3 million in common dividends during the first 6 months of 2017, an increase of $15.9 million over the same period last year. Higher dividends were driven by the 5.1% increase in the dividend rate compared to the first half of 2016.
Moving to sales. We continue to see customer growth across our system. At the end of June, our utilities were serving approximately 9,000 more electric and 13,000 more natural gas customers than they did the same time a year ago. Retail, electric and natural gas sales volumes are shown on a comparative basis on Page 11 and 12 of the earnings package, respectively. 
On a year-to-date basis, weather-normalized sales are adjusted to factor out the effects of leap year in 2016. Overall normalized sales results for natural gas were above our expectation and retail electric sales were slightly below our expectations. 
Turning now to our earnings forecast. As Allen mentioned, we are affirming our 2017 earnings guidance of $3.06 a share to $3.12 a share with an expectation of being in the upper end of the range. This projection assumes normal weather for the remainder of the year. 
Finally, I'd like to address the third quarter earnings per share guidance. As a reminder, during last year's third quarter, we earned $0.68 per share. This included $0.01 of acquisition costs to arrive at adjusted earnings of $0.69 per share. Earnings that quarter were primarily driven by weather that was 43% warmer than normal in Southeastern Wisconsin and related positive fuel recoveries that were partially offset by the Wisconsin sharing mechanisms. These items add approximately $0.07 to the quarter of 2016 to arrive at a base of $0.62 per share. Taking these into account, we expect our third quarter 2017 earnings per share to be in the range of $0.63 to $0.67 per share. This assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter.
With that, I'll turn things back to Allen."

Because looking at the conditions, they would clearly put -- they seem to, at least some of them, put a lot more pressure on you to control costs by virtue of not allowing you, under certain of those conditions, to continue to defer costs and by reducing the amount you could earn on what are -- on significant regulatory asset balances, right?

Since then, in September of last year, the FERC came out with their decision in the first case, that was at a 10.82% ROE, which is a 10.32 plus a 50 basis points adder, so the 10.82%.

We don't know if it'll be a the second half of the year. But currently, we're booking at the 10.82%. So the main driver, the swing between quarters there was the entry last year to get down to the first reserve needed. And it's maybe a little bit higher, too, because we're booking at a 10.82%.

It's just kind the cleanup of what we think is the best way run a service company. So just a variety of little items."

Thank you for joining us today as we review our results for the second quarter.

Thank you for joining us today as we review our results for the second quarter. I want to start by introducing the members of our team who are here with me today: Scott Lauber, our Chief Financial Officer; Jim Schubilske, our Treasurer; Susan Martin, General Counsel; Bill Guc, Controller; and finally, Beth Straka, our Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations.
Now As you saw this morning, we reported second quarter 2017 earnings per share of $0.63. Effective cost controls and warmer than normal June weather contributed to a solid second quarter. Scott will provide more detail in a moment. We are affirming our current 2017 guidance of $3.06 per share to $3.12 per share with an expectation of being in the upper end of the range. This is in line with our expected long-term earnings per share growth of 5% to 7%.
Now I would like to update you on our major investments and several developments on the regulatory front. On June 30, we closed the acquisition of Bluewater Natural Gas Holding after the Wisconsin Public Service Commission approved the investment. This $230 million investment in natural gas storage will provide approximately 1/3 of the current storage needs of our Wisconsin natural gas distribution companies. Bluewater will have a long-term service agreement with each of these 3 companies. The earnings and risk profile from this investment are expected to be essentially the same as if the storage was owned by our local gas distribution companies. I believe this investment will bring very meaningful benefits to our customers. 
You may recall on April 4, we filed a proposed settlement agreement with the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin. Now under the terms of this settlement, the currently approved base rates for all of our Wisconsin utilities would be frozen for 2018 and 2019. This would make a total of 4 years that base rates will be flat and essentially gives our customers price certainty through 2019. The settlement also requires that we continue to manage our costs aggressively. 
Under the proposed agreement, the current earning sharing mechanisms would be extended through 2019 at Wisconsin Electric and at Wisconsin Gas. In addition, a similar mechanism would be put in place for 2018 and 2019 at Wisconsin Public Service. There would be equal sharing between customers and shareholders of the first 50 basis points of earnings above Wisconsin Public Service's allowed return on equity of 10%. All earnings above 10.5% would go back to benefit customers. 
As part of the agreement, we are looking to expand and make permanent some electric pricing options for our large electric customers. These options have helped many of our customers reduce their energy costs, grow their businesses and create more than 2,000 jobs. These changes will allow us to retain an effective economic development tool and avoid a price increase for customers whose current pricing options would expire under existing terms. The settlement has the support of a broad cross-section of our industrial and commercial customers. In addition, state legislative leaders are supportive. 
The commission began consideration of the proposed settlement on April 20. Then on May 25, Wisconsin Commission staff issued a schedule outlining the key dates. On July 19th, the Wisconsin Commission staff issued a memorandum in response to our proposed rate freeze settlement. Staff's review confirmed an electric revenue deficiency, and thus in my view, demonstrated that the settlement we arrived at with our customers remains in the best interest of all of our customers. However, the staff proposed a wide range of conditions to the settlement. Unfortunately, none of these conditions are acceptable to us. 
Looking forward from today, comments to the staff memo are due on August 2. Reply comments are due on August 8. We expect the commission to make a decision on the proposed settlement in the late August to September time frame. Should the commission reject the proposed settlement, I expect we will file a traditional rate case. 
In Michigan, our proceeding to obtain regulatory approval for the construction of new gas-fired generation in the Upper Peninsula is progressing well. We anticipate receiving Michigan Commission approval within the 270-day statutory deadline which ends on October 27. In addition, we have received all local approvals needed to accommodate the project. If approved by the Michigan Commission, we expect this to be a $265 million investment. 
Turning to Illinois. We continue to make progress on the Peoples Gas system modernization program. This program is designed to make our gas distribution system in Chicago safer, more reliable and less expensive to maintain. Consistent with our plan, we expect to invest $300 million in the program this year. 
Now a reminder on our dividend. On January 19, our board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.52 per share, which is an increase of $0.025 or 5.1% over the previous quarterly dividend level. This represents a compound annual growth rate of 6.6% from the 2015 fourth quarter level. Our annualized dividend level stands at $2.08 per share. We continue to target a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings. And given that we arrive in this range now, I expect our dividend growth will continue to be in line with our earnings per share growth. 
Finally, here in Wisconsin, we're seeing some promising economic activity. The state's per capita real GDP has grown faster than the U.S. average. Wisconsin's unemployment rate fell to 3.1% in May, the lowest it has been since 1999, and well below the U.S. average of 4.3%. In Southeastern Wisconsin in particular, there are a number of active ongoing projects. 
Now with some additional details on our first quarter results and the financial outlook, here's Scott Lauber, our Chief Financial Officer."

Effective cost controls continue to have a positive impact on earnings. We exceeded our guidance for the second quarter, which, as you recall, was $0.56 to $0.60 per share. Lower-than-expected costs at our Illinois utilities and warmer-than-normal June weather contributed to these results. 
The earnings package placed on our website this morning includes a comparison of second quarter and year-to-date 2017 and 2016 results. My focus will be on the quarter, beginning with operating income by segment and then other income, interest expense and income taxes.
Referring to Page 7 of the earnings packet, our consolidated operating income for the second quarter of 2017 was $362.2 million as compared to $332.1 million in the second quarter of 2016, an increase of $30.1 million. 
Starting with the Wisconsin segment, operating income in the second quarter increased $8.9 million from the second quarter of 2016. On the favorable side, operation and maintenance expense was $29.1 million lower. This was largely offset by lower customer usage related to mild weather conditions in April and May. 
In the second quarter of 2017, our Illinois segment recognized operating income increase of $18.8 million compared to the second quarter of 2016. The increase was primarily driven by reduced operations and maintenance expense and continued investment in the gas system modernization program. 
Operating income in our Other States segment improved $2.4 million related to lower operations and maintenance expense resulting from cost control measures.
Following last month's acquisition of Bluewater Natural Gas Holding, our We Power segment was renamed the non-utility energy segment. For the second quarter, operating income at the non-utility energy segment was up $4.6 million. This increase reflects the additional investment in our Power the Future plant since in the second quarter of 2016. Beginning in the third quarter of 2017, this segment also will include the results of Bluewater. The operating loss at our corporate and other segment was $6.2 million for the second quarter of 2017, an increase of $4.6 million compared to the second quarter of last year. Taking the changes of these segments together, we arrive at $30.1 million increase in operating income.
During the second quarter of 2017, earnings from our equity investment in American Transmission Company totaled $41.8 million, an increase of $10.9 million compared to the same period of the prior year. Recall that in the second quarter of 2016, we recognized lower earnings from ATC as a result of the ALJ recommendation related to the FERC ROE reviews. 
Other income net decreased by $19.3 million quarter-over-quarter. Driving the decrease was a $19.6 million gain recognized in the second quarter of 2016 from the sale of the chilled water generation and distribution assets of Wisvest. Interest expense increased $1.8 million quarter-over-quarter, driven by lower capitalized interest.
Turning now to consolidated income taxes. We still expect [indiscernible] tax rate will be between 37% and 38% this year. However, our effective tax rate in the second quarter was down 1.8% when compared to the same period last year, due largely to the settlement of several items. 
Combining all of these items brings us to earnings of $199.1 million or $0.63 per share for the second quarter of 2017 compared to $181.4 million or $0.57 per share for the second quarter of 2016.
Net cash provided by operating activities increased $43.9 million during the 6 months ended June 30, 2017, compared to the same period in the prior year. A reduction in the working capital and higher operating income were partially offset by $100 million contribution to the pension plan in January 2017.
Looking at the cash flow statement on Page 6 of the earnings package. Our capital expenditures totaled $790 million in the first half of 2017, a $171.3 million increase compared to the first half of 2016 as we continue to invest in our core infrastructure. I want to remind you, we also invested $230 million through our acquisition of Bluewater, however, this investment is identified as a separate line in the cash flow statement.
Our adjusted debt-to-capital ratio was 51.5% at the end of June, a decrease from the 51.9% adjusted debt-to-capital ratio at the end of last year. Our calculation continues to treat half the WEC Energy Group 2007 series A junior subordinate notes as common equities. We are using cash to satisfy any shares required for our 401(k) plans, options and other programs. Going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares.
We've paid $328.3 million in common dividends during the first 6 months of 2017, an increase of $15.9 million over the same period last year. Higher dividends were driven by the 5.1% increase in the dividend rate compared to the first half of 2016.
Moving to sales. We continue to see customer growth across our system. At the end of June, our utilities were serving approximately 9,000 more electric and 13,000 more natural gas customers than they did the same time a year ago. Retail, electric and natural gas sales volumes are shown on a comparative basis on Page 11 and 12 of the earnings package, respectively. 
On a year-to-date basis, weather-normalized sales are adjusted to factor out the effects of leap year in 2016. Overall normalized sales results for natural gas were above our expectation and retail electric sales were slightly below our expectations. 
Turning now to our earnings forecast. As Allen mentioned, we are affirming our 2017 earnings guidance of $3.06 a share to $3.12 a share with an expectation of being in the upper end of the range. This projection assumes normal weather for the remainder of the year. 
Finally, I'd like to address the third quarter earnings per share guidance. As a reminder, during last year's third quarter, we earned $0.68 per share. This included $0.01 of acquisition costs to arrive at adjusted earnings of $0.69 per share. Earnings that quarter were primarily driven by weather that was 43% warmer than normal in Southeastern Wisconsin and related positive fuel recoveries that were partially offset by the Wisconsin sharing mechanisms. These items add approximately $0.07 to the quarter of 2016 to arrive at a base of $0.62 per share. Taking these into account, we expect our third quarter 2017 earnings per share to be in the range of $0.63 to $0.67 per share. This assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter.
With that, I'll turn things back to Allen."

Since then, in September of last year, the FERC came out with their decision in the first case, that was at a 10.82% ROE, which is a 10.32 plus a 50 basis points adder, so the 10.82%.

We don't know if it'll be the second half of the year. But currently, we're booking at the 10.82%. So the main driver, the swing between quarters there was the entry last year to get down to the first reserve needed. And it's maybe a little bit higher, too, because we're booking at a 10.82%.

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us as we review our performance for the third quarter of this year. Now before we dive into our update this afternoon, I'd like to take just a moment to thank you for the incredible outpouring of prayers and support and good wishes for Allen Leverett following his stroke earlier this month. I can tell you that Allen has been released from the hospital and is making progress in his recovery. I will continue to serve as Interim Chief Executive for as long as necessary, but the ultimate goal is obviously to bring Allen back. But again, your kindness and concern meant a great deal to Allen and his family, and a great deal to all of us as well. My thanks. 
Now I'd like to introduce the members of our senior team who are here with me today. We have Scott Lauber, our Chief Financial Officer; Jim Schubilske, Treasurer; Susan Martin, General Counsel; Bill Guc, our Controller; and Beth Straka, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations.
We'll begin with our third quarter results. As I'm sure you saw from our news release this morning, we reported third quarter earnings of $0.68 a share. We delivered a solid third quarter, largely driven by effective cost controls.
Our focus on cost management and efficiency gains was a major factor in offsetting the impact of mild summer weather compared to last year's third quarter. Those cool temperatures were particularly noticeable during August, which is normally 1 of the 2 warmest months in the Midwest.
Next I'd like to brief you on several development on the regulatory front and on our capital investments. On August 10, the Wisconsin Public Service Commission unanimously approved our proposed rate settlement. We received our final written order on September 8. Under the approved settlement, base rates for all of our Wisconsin utilities will remain flat for 2018 and for 2019. In total, this will keep base rates flat for 4 years, and essentially gives our customers price certainty through 2019.
The earnings sharing mechanisms that have been in place will be extended through 2019 at Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas and a similar mechanism will now be in place for 2018 and 2019 at Wisconsin Public Service. Now just a reminder, customers and stockholders share equally in the first 50 basis points of earnings above our allowed rate of return. Anything above the first 50 basis points will flow completely to customers. 
Now as part of the agreement, we've also expanded and made permanent certain pricing options for our large electric customers. These options will continue to help many of our customers grow their businesses, create jobs and reduce their energy costs. 
Turning to Michigan. I'm pleased to report that we obtained final regulatory approval just yesterday for the construction of new natural gas-fired generation in the Upper Peninsula. We also received all local approvals that are needed to move forward with the project. Our plan is to bring those facilities into commercial service in 2019. And at that time or soon thereafter, we expect to retire our coal-fired power plant at Presque Isle. The approved project calls for a $265 million investment in reciprocating internal combustion engines. It will be capable of generating up to 180 megawatts of electricity. These units, which will be owned by our utility subsidiary in Michigan, Upper Michigan Energy Resources, provide a long-term generation solution for customers in the Upper Peninsula, and that includes the iron ore mine owned by Cleveland Cliffs.
And now for an update on Illinois. We continue to make progress on the Peoples Gas system modernization program. Since we acquired Peoples Gas, we've made significant improvements in a number of important metrics. We've lowered contractor construction costs by 15%; we've achieved a 70% decline in customer complaints; construction timelines have been reduced by more than 25%; and I'm pleased to say that our working relationship with the city of Chicago is greatly improved.
Our system modernization program, as you've heard, is designed to make the gas distribution network in Chicago safer, more reliable, less expensive to maintain. You may recall, we still have an open bucket underprepared approach on this long-term project. We expect a decision by the Illinois Commerce Commission by year and. And consistent with our 2017 plan, we are on track to invest approximately $300 million on the effort in Chicago this year. 
Turning now to our operations in Minnesota. On October 13, Minnesota Energy Resources filed a rate case with the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission. We're seeking to increase natural gas base rates by $12.6 million or approximately 5%. And we've also requested, under procedures available in Minnesota, to self-implement an increase of $9.5 million or 3.8% effective January 1 of 2018.
A final decision on new permanent rates is not expected until the first quarter of 2019. I'd also like to update you on our recent FERC decision related to system support resource payments for the Presque Isle power plant in Michigan. In its decision, FERC ordered a refund of $22.6 million associated with the payments that we received for the period February 2014 through January of 2015.
As you may recall, this is very close to the amount the administrative law judge recommended last year. So consistent with our previous statements, the amount of the refund will not result in a dollar for dollar reduction in net income and we have taken the FERC decision into account for our year-end guidance.
Next I'd like to remind everyone that we will be rolling out our new 5-year capital forecasts at the EEI Finance Conference in early November. Over the past few months, Allen shared the developing plan with me in my role as Chairman of the Board. In the past few weeks, I have of course reviewed the capital plan in detail, and I share Allen's optimism about the direction of the plan. Now one piece of that new 5-year plan has just been put in place.
Our Wisconsin Public Service utility in Green Bay, along with Wisconsin Power and Life and Madison Gas and Electric, have purchased the forward wind energy center from Invenergy. The total purchase price is approximately $174 million. We will own 44.6% of the facility with an investment of approximately $78 million. It consists of 86 GE wind turbines with a capacity of about 130 megawatts. The wind farm is located 10 miles south of [indiscernible] in the eastern part of the state. If approved, Wisconsin Public Service customers will see real savings because we will be able to eliminate the existing power purchase agreement.
Pending regulatory approvals closing on the forward wind center could take place next spring. Again, we look forward to sharing more about our new 5-year capital plan at EEI and we really look forward to the opportunities that lie ahead.
In speaking of opportunity, you may have heard about the blockbuster announcement this summer. The announcement at Foxconn has chosen Wisconsin for one of the largest economic development projects in American history. Based on revenue, Foxconn is the fourth largest tech company in the world. And Foxconn has decided to bring a brand-new technology called 8 K to the United States. The company plans to invest $10 billion to build a massive production plant that could employ as many as 13,000 people in Wisconsin County just south of Milwaukee. We expect the electric demand for this Foxconn campus to be more than 200 megawatts. That's approximately 3x the size of our current largest Wisconsin customer. And that does not include the demand that will develop from the suppliers that will also need to locate near the Foxconn facility. Foxconn has chosen a site in Southeastern Wisconsin that is perfectly situated on our transmission network. We will not need to build any new generation. Our state-of-the-art network is well equipped today to provide reliable low-cost energy to Foxconn. 
And on top of that, folks, if you like gummy bears and you know who doesn't, I have more news for you. German candymaker Haribo has also selected Wisconsin for its first-ever manufacturing facility in North America. So as you can see, the manufacturing economy in Wisconsin is alive and well. 
And now with details on our third quarter results and our outlook for the remainder of 2017, here's our Chief Financial Officer, Scott Lauber. Scott?"
315117,540068828,1321467,"WEC Energy Group, Inc., Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2017",2017-10-26,"Earnings Calls","WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Gale. Our GAAP earnings were unchanged from the third quarter of 2016 at $0.68 per share. You may recall that our 2016 third quarter earnings included $0.01 of acquisition costs. Excluding these costs, our adjusted earnings were $0.69 in the th",969,"Thank you, Gale. Our GAAP earnings were unchanged from the third quarter of 2016 at $0.68 per share. You may recall that our 2016 third quarter earnings included $0.01 of acquisition costs. Excluding these costs, our adjusted earnings were $0.69 in the third quarter 2016. Our results were primarily driven by returns to normal weather condition, offset by positive impact on cost control. Weather in 2016 was 43% warmer than normal in Southeastern Wisconsin. The earnings packet placed on our website this morning includes a comparison of third quarter and year-to-date 2017 and 2016 results for GAAP and adjusted. There are no adjustments made to GAAP earnings in 2017. 
My focus will be on the quarter, beginning with operating income by segment and then other income, interest expense and income taxes. Referring to Page 9 of the earning packet, our consolidated operating income in the third quarter of 2017 was $393.6 million compared to an adjusted $402.5 million in the third quarter of 2016, a decrease of $8.9 million.
Starting with Wisconsin segment, operating income decreased $19.4 million quarter-over-quarter. Lower margin was driven by a return to normal weather and a normal fuel recovery pattern. This was offset by operations and maintenance expense that was $39.9 million lower compared to the third quarter of 2016. Last year, we recorded $18.6 million in operations and maintenance expense related to the earnings sharing mechanism in place at Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas.
In the third quarter of 2017, our Illinois segment recognized operating income increase of $800,000 compared to the third quarter of 2016. The increase is primarily driven by continued investment in the gas system modernization program.
As expected, operating loss in our Other States segment increased $2.1 million, driven by higher depreciation and amortization expense resulting from an increase in capital investments in our gas distribution utilities.
Turning now to our 9 utility energy infrastructure segment. As a reminder, this segment contains the operations of Bluewater Natural Gas Holding, which is acquired on June 30 of this year as well as the results of the Power the Future plants. For the third quarter, operating income in the segment was up $9.7 million. Bluewater's Natural Gas Holding contributed $5.9 million to operating income in 2017. Operating income from our Power the Future plants increased $3.8 million, reflecting the additional investment at these plants since the third quarter of 2016.
Operating income at our corporate and other segment was $1.1 million for the third quarter of 2017, an increase of $2.1 million from the adjusted operating loss in the third quarter of 2016. Taking the changes for these segments together, we arrived at $8.9 million decrease in adjusted operating income. 
During the third quarter of 2017, earnings from our equity investment in American Transmission Company totaled $39.2 million, an increase of $900,000 compared to the same quarter of 2016.
Other income net increased by $8.9 million quarter-over-quarter. This was largely due to 2 items, higher investment gains related to our deferred compensation plan and we incurred losses in our third quarter of 2016 related to the disposition of some nonutility assets.
Interest expense increased $4.7 million quarter-over-quarter, primarily driven by an increase in debt levels resulting from continued capital investments. 
Turning now to consolidated income taxes. We still expect that our effective income tax rate will be between 37% and 38% this year. Combining all of these items brings us to earnings of $215.4 million or $0.68 per share for the third quarter of 2017 compared to adjusted earnings of $219.1 million or $0.69 per share for the third quarter of 2016.
For the year-to-date, adjusted earnings increased $0.07 to $2.43 per share for the 9 months ended September 30, 2017, compared to an adjusted $2.36 per share for the 9 months ended September 30, 2016. This was largely due to cost control and efficiency gains.
Looking at the cash flow statement at Page 7 of the earnings package, net cash provided by operating activities increased $24.8 million during the 9 months ended September 30, 2017, compared to the same period of 2016. The reduction in working capital and higher operating income for partially offset by $100 million contribution to the pension plan at January 2017.
Our capital expenditures totaled $1.3 billion for the first 9 months of 2017, a $309.1 million increase compared to the same period in 2016, as we continue to invest in our coal infrastructure.
Our debt-to-capital ratio was 51.9% at the end of September, unchanged from the end of 2016. Our calculation continues to treat half of the WEC Energy Group 2007 Series A junior subordinated note as common equity. We're using cash to satisfy any shares required in our 401(k) plan, options and other programs. Going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares.
We paid $492.4 million in common stock dividends during the first 9 months of 2017, an increase of $23.8 million over the same period last year.
Moving to sales. We see continued customer growth across our system. At the end of September, our utility were serving approximately 9,000 more electric and 18,000 more natural gas customers than it did the same time a year ago. 
Sales volumes are shown on a comparative basis on Page 13 and 14 of the earnings package. On a year-to-date basis, weather-normalized sales factored out the effects of leap year in 2016.
Overall, normalized sales results for natural gas were slightly above our expectations and retail electric sales were slightly below our expectations.
Turning now to earnings forecasts. We are reaffirming our 2017 earnings guidance of $3.06 a share to $3.12 a share with an expectation of being in the upper end of the range. This projection assumes normal weather for the remainder of the year.
With that, I'll turn things back to Gale."

First of all, I really can only speak about our utilities, which would be We Energies and Wisconsin Public Service in Green Bay. But when you look at the broader picture, remember, we have set a goal to reduce carbon emissions by essentially 40% by the year 2030 off 2005 levels. We believe we can do that without significant rate pressure because of what's occurred with the improvement and the efficiency and the costs of some renewables. Believe it or not, I mean, when you look at just what's happened with the efficiency of utility scale solar, I mean, even 3 or 4 years ago for Wisconsin, you might see, oh, gosh, 4,000 megawatts tossed to 4,000 megawatts installed for a large utility scale solar plant in Wisconsin. That's today, down to circa $1,300. So what's going to be driving the restructuring of generation portfolios not just in our state but elsewhere, particularly where they're coal heavy, is really economics. And we're seeing significant economic changes that will allow us to add more renewables to our fleet. In part, we're able to do that and not put pressure on rates because we already have a state-of-the-art backbone, if you will, from the Power the Future units that we already built and are in place. So I think we are very well positioned to continue to take cost out, to continue to reduce carbon emissions. But at the end of the day, I mean, the company's goal is really to maintain a diverse fuel supply, less of coal, clearly less of coal, but at the end of the day, we probably, 10 or 15 years from now, we'll look like a 1/3, 1/3, 1/3. Basically 1/3 coal or 1/3 fossil fuel, 1/3 renewables, 1/3 natural gas. Did that help at all, Michael?"

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us as we review our performance for the third quarter of this year. Now before we dive into our update this afternoon, I'd like to take just a moment to thank you for the incredible outpouring of prayers and support and good wishes for Allen Leverett following his stroke earlier this month. I can tell you that Allen has been released from the hospital and is making progress in his recovery. I will continue to serve as Interim Chief Executive for as long as necessary, but the ultimate goal is, obviously, to bring Allen back. But again, your kindness and concern meant a great deal to Allen and his family, and a great deal to all of us as well. My thanks.
Now I'd like to introduce the members of our senior team who are here with me today. We have Scott Lauber, our Chief Financial Officer; Jim Schubilske, Treasurer; Susan Martin, General Counsel; Bill Guc, our Controller; and Beth Straka, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations.
We'll begin with our third quarter results. As I'm sure you saw from our news release this morning, we reported third quarter earnings of $0.68 a share. We delivered a solid third quarter, largely driven by effective cost controls.
Our focus on cost management and efficiency gains was a major factor in offsetting the impact of mild summer weather compared to last year's third quarter. Those cool temperatures were particularly noticeable during August, which is normally one of the two warmest months in the Midwest.
Next I'd like to brief you on several developments on the regulatory front and on our capital investments. On August 10, the Wisconsin Public Service Commission unanimously approved our proposed rate settlement. We received our final written order on September 8. Under the approved settlement, base rates for all of our Wisconsin utilities will remain flat for 2018 and for 2019. In total, this will keep base rates flat for 4 years, and essentially gives our customers price certainty through 2019.
The earnings sharing mechanisms that have been in place will be extended through 2019 at Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas and a similar mechanism will now be in place for 2018 and 2019 at Wisconsin Public Service. Just a reminder, customers and stockholders share equally in the first 50 basis points of earnings above our allowed rate of return. Anything above the first 50 basis points will flow completely to customers.
Now as part of the agreement, we've also expanded and made permanent certain pricing options for our large electric customers. These options will continue to help many of our customers grow their businesses, create jobs and reduce their energy costs.
Turning to Michigan. I'm pleased to report that we obtained final regulatory approval just yesterday for the construction of new natural gas-fired generation in the Upper Peninsula. We also received all local approvals that are needed to move forward with the project. Our plan is to bring those facilities into commercial service in 2019. And at that time or soon thereafter, we expect to retire our coal-fired power plant at Presque Isle. The approved project calls for a $265 million investment in reciprocating internal combustion engines. It will be capable of generating up to 180 megawatts of electricity. These units, which will be owned by our utility subsidiary in Michigan, Upper Michigan Energy Resources, provide a long-term generation solution for customers in the Upper Peninsula, and that includes the iron ore mine owned by Cleveland-Cliffs.
And now for an update on Illinois. We continue to make progress on the Peoples Gas system modernization program. Since we've acquired Peoples Gas, we've made significant improvements in a number of important metrics. We've lowered contractor construction costs by 15%. We've achieved a 70% decline in customer complaints. Construction time lines have been reduced by more than 25%, and I'm pleased to say that our working relationship with City of Chicago is greatly improved.
Our system modernization program, as you've heard, is designed to make the gas distribution network in Chicago safer, more reliable, less expensive to maintain. You may recall, we still have an open docket on the preferred approach to this long-term project. We expect a decision by the Illinois Commerce Commission by year-end. And consistent with our 2017 plan, we're on track to invest approximately $300 million on the effort in Chicago this year.
Turning now to our operations in Minnesota. On October 13, Minnesota Energy Resources filed a rate case with the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission. We're seeking to increase natural gas base rates by $12.6 million or approximately 5%. We have also requested, under the procedures available in Minnesota, to self-implement an increase of $9.5 million or 3.8% effective January 1 of 2018.
A final decision on new permanent rates is not expected until the first quarter of 2019. I'd also like to update you on our recent FERC decision related to system support resource payments for the Presque Isle Power Plant in Michigan. In its decision, FERC ordered a refund of $22.6 million associated with the payments that we received for the period February of 2014 through January of 2015.
As you may recall, this is very close to the amount that the administrative law judge recommended last year. So consistent with our previous statements, the amount of the refund will not result in a dollar-for dollar reduction in net income, and we have taken the FERC decision into account for our year-end guidance.
Next, I'd like to remind everyone that we will be rolling out our new 5-year capital forecast at the EEI Finance Conference in early November. Over the past few months, Allen shared the developing plan with me and my role as Chairman of the Board. In the past few weeks, I have, of course, reviewed the capital plan in great detail, and I share Allen's optimism about the direction of the plan. Now one piece of that new 5-year plan has just been put in place.
Our Wisconsin Public Service utility in Green Bay, along with Wisconsin Power and Light and Madison Gas and Electric, have purchased the Forward Wind Energy Center from Invenergy. The total purchase price is approximately $174 million. We will own 44.6% of the facility with an investment of approximately $78 million. Forward consists of 86 GE wind turbines with a capacity of about 130 megawatts. The wind farm is located 10 miles south of Fond du Lac County in the eastern part of the state. If approved, Wisconsin Public Service customers will see real savings because we will be able to eliminate the existing power purchase agreement.
Pending regulatory approvals closing on the Forward Wind Center could take place next spring. Again, we look forward to sharing more about our new 5-year capital plan at EEI, and we really look forward to the opportunities that lie ahead.
And speaking of opportunity, you may have heard about the blockbuster announcement this summer. The announcement that Foxconn has chosen Wisconsin for one of the largest economic development projects in American history. Based on revenue, Foxconn is the fourth largest tech company in the world. And Foxconn has decided to bring a brand-new technology called 8K to the United States. The company plans to invest $10 billion to build a massive production plant that could employ as many as 13,000 people in Racine County, just south of Milwaukee. We expect the electric demand from this Foxconn campus to be more than 200 megawatts. That's approximately 3x the size of our current largest Wisconsin customer. And that does not include the demand that will develop from the suppliers that will also need to locate near the Foxconn facility. Foxconn has chosen a site in Southeastern Wisconsin that is perfectly situated on our transmission network. We will not need to build any new generation. Our state-of-the-art network is well equipped today to provide reliable, low-cost energy to Foxconn.
And on top of that, folks, if you like gummy bears, and you know who doesn't, I have more news for you. The German candymaker HARIBO has also selected Wisconsin for its first-ever manufacturing facility in North America. So as you can see, the manufacturing economy in Wisconsin is alive and well.
And now with details on our third quarter results and our outlook for the remainder of 2017, here's our esteemed Chief Financial Officer, Scott Lauber. Scott?"
315117,540068828,1321915,"WEC Energy Group, Inc., Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2017",2017-10-26,"Earnings Calls","WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Gale. Our GAAP earnings were unchanged from the third quarter of 2016 at $0.68 per share. You may recall that our 2016 third quarter earnings included $0.01 of acquisition costs. Excluding these costs, our adjusted earnings were $0.69 in the th",974,"Thank you, Gale. Our GAAP earnings were unchanged from the third quarter of 2016 at $0.68 per share. You may recall that our 2016 third quarter earnings included $0.01 of acquisition costs. Excluding these costs, our adjusted earnings were $0.69 in the third quarter of 2016. Our results were primarily driven by a return to normal weather conditions, offset by positive impact of cost control. Weather in 2016 was 43% warmer than normal in Southeastern Wisconsin. The earnings packet placed on our website this morning includes a comparison of third quarter and year-to-date 2017 and 2016 results for GAAP and adjusted. There were no adjustments made to GAAP earnings in 2017.
My focus will be on the quarter, beginning with operating income by segment and then other income, interest expense and income taxes. Referring to Page 9 of the earning packet, our consolidated operating income in the third quarter of 2017 was $393.6 million compared to an adjusted $402.5 million in the third quarter of 2016, a decrease of $8.9 million.
Starting with the Wisconsin segment, operating income decreased $19.4 million quarter-over-quarter. Lower margin was driven by a return to normal weather and a normal fuel recovery pattern. This was offset by operations and maintenance expense that was $39.9 million lower compared to the third quarter of 2016. Last year, we recorded $18.6 million in operations and maintenance expense related to the earnings sharing mechanism in place at Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas.
In the third quarter of 2017, our Illinois segment recognized an operating income increase of $800,000 compared to the third quarter of 2016. The increase was primarily driven by continued investment in the gas system modernization program.
As expected, operating loss in our Other States segment increased $2.1 million, driven by higher depreciation and amortization expense resulting from an increase in capital investments in our gas distribution utilities.
Turning now to our non-utility energy infrastructure segment. As a reminder, this segment contains the operations of Bluewater Natural Gas Holding, which was acquired on June 30 of this year as well as a result of the Power the Future plants. For the third quarter, operating income in this segment was up $9.7 million. Bluewater Natural Gas Holding contributed $5.9 million to operating income in 2017. Operating income from our Power the Future plants increased $3.8 million, reflecting the additional investment at these plants since the third quarter of 2016.
Operating income at our corporate and other segment was $1.1 million for the third quarter of 2017, an increase of $2.1 million from the adjusted operating loss in the third quarter of 2016. Taking the changes for these segments together, we arrived at $8.9 million decrease in adjusted operating income.
During the third quarter of 2017, earnings from our equity investment in American Transmission Company totaled $39.2 million, an increase of $900,000 compared to the same quarter of 2016.
Other income net increased by $8.9 million quarter-over-quarter. This was largely due to 2 items, higher investment gains related to our deferred compensation plan and we incurred losses in our third quarter of 2016 related to the disposition of some nonutility assets.
Interest expense increased $4.7 million quarter-over-quarter, primarily driven by an increase in debt levels resulting from continued capital investments.
Turning now to consolidated income taxes. We still expect that our effective income tax rate will be between 37% and 38% this year. Combining all of these items brings us to earnings of $215.4 million or $0.68 per share for the third quarter of 2017, compared to adjusted earnings of $219.1 million or $0.69 per share for the third quarter of 2016.
For the year-to-date, adjusted earnings increased $0.07 to $2.43 per share for the 9 months ended September 30, 2017, compared to an adjusted $2.36 per share for the 9 months ended September 30, 2016. This was largely due to cost control and efficiency gains.
Looking at the cash flow statement on Page 7 of the earnings package, net cash provided by operating activities increased $24.8 million during the 9 months ended September 30, 2017, compared to the same period in 2016. The reduction in working capital and higher operating income were partially offset by a $100 million contribution to the pension plan in January 2017.
Our capital expenditures totaled $1.3 billion for the first 9 months of 2017, a $309.1 million increase compared to the same period in 2016, as we continue to invest in our core infrastructure.
Our debt-to-capital ratio was 51.9% at the end of September, unchanged from the end of 2016. Our calculation continues to treat half of the WEC Energy Group 2007 Series A Junior Subordinated Notes as common equity. We're using cash to satisfy any shares required in our 401(k) plan, options and other programs. Going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares.
We paid $492.4 million in common stock dividends during the first 9 months of 2017, an increase of $23.8 million over the same period last year.
Moving to sales. We see continued customer growth across our system. At the end of September, our utilities were serving approximately 9,000 more electric and 18,000 more natural gas customers than it did the same time a year ago.
Sales volumes are shown on a comparative basis on Page 13 and 14 of the earnings package. On a year-to-date basis, weather-normalized sales factor out the effects of leap year in 2016. Overall normalized sales results for natural gas were slightly above our expectations and retail electric sales were slightly below our expectations.
Turning now to our earnings forecasts. We are reaffirming our 2017 earnings guidance of $3.06 a share to $3.12 a share with an expectation of being in the upper end of the range. This projection assumes normal weather for the remainder of the year.
With that, I'll turn things back to Gale."

I mean, first of all, I really can only speak about our utilities, which would be We Energies and Wisconsin Public Service in Green Bay. But when you look at the broader picture, remember, we have set a goal to reduce carbon emissions by essentially 40% by the year 2030 off 2005 levels. We believe we can do that without significant rate pressure because of what's occurred with the improvement and the efficiency and the cost of some renewables. Believe it or not, I mean, when you look at just what's happened with the efficiency of utility-scale solar, I mean, even 3 or 4 years ago for Wisconsin, you might see, oh, gosh, 4,000 megawatts installed -- cost of 4,000 megawatts installed for a large utility-scale solar plant in Wisconsin. That's today down to circa $1,300. So what's going to be driving the restructuring of generation portfolios, not just in our state but elsewhere, particularly, where they're coal heavy, is really economics. And we're seeing significant economic changes that will allow us to add more renewables to our fleet. In part, we're able to do that and not put pressure on rates because we already have a state-of-the-art backbone, if you will, from the Power the Future units that we've already built and are in place. So I think we are very well positioned to continue to take costs out, to continue to reduce carbon emissions. But at the end of the day, I mean, the company's goal is really to maintain a diverse fuel supply, less of coal, clearly less of coal. But at the end of the day, we probably, 10 or 15 years from now, will look like a 1/3, 1/3, 1/3. Basically 1/3 coal, 1/3 fossil fuel, 1/3 renewables, 1/3 natural gas. Did that help at all, Michael?"

We're going to have to see, first of all, whether tax reform actually gets completed and then what the real details are. And there's some thought that there might be an optional election on interest deductibility with a trade-off on another tax deduction item. We'll just have to see. At this point, I think anything that -- I mean, we're, obviously, looking at the landscape, but anything that I might tell you would be pure speculation until we really understand the details.

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us as we review our performance for the third quarter of this year. Now before we dive into our update this afternoon, I'd like to take just a moment to thank you for the incredible outpouring",1411,"Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us as we review our performance for the third quarter of this year. Now before we dive into our update this afternoon, I'd like to take just a moment to thank you for the incredible outpouring of prayers and support and good wishes for Allen Leverett following his stroke earlier this month. I can tell you that Allen has been released from the hospital and is making progress in his recovery. I will continue to serve as Interim Chief Executive for as long as necessary, but the ultimate goal is, obviously, to bring Allen back. But again, your kindness and concern have meant a great deal to Allen and his family, and a great deal to all of us as well. My thanks.
Now I'd like to introduce the members of our senior team who are here with me today. We have Scott Lauber, our Chief Financial Officer; Jim Schubilske, Treasurer; Susan Martin, General Counsel; Bill Guc, our Controller; and Beth Straka, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations.
We'll begin with our third quarter results. As I'm sure you saw from our news release this morning, we reported third quarter earnings of $0.68 a share. We delivered a solid third quarter, largely driven by effective cost controls.
Our focus on cost management and efficiency gains was a major factor in offsetting the impact of mild summer weather compared to last year's third quarter. Those cool temperatures were particularly noticeable during August, which is normally one of the two warmest months in the Midwest.
Next I'd like to brief you on several developments on the regulatory front and on our capital investments. On August 10, the Wisconsin Public Service Commission unanimously approved our proposed rate settlement. We received our final written order on September 8. Under the approved settlement, base rates for all of our Wisconsin utilities will remain flat for 2018 and for 2019. In total, this will keep base rates flat for 4 years, and essentially gives our customers price certainty through 2019.
The earnings sharing mechanisms that have been in place will be extended through 2019 at Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas and a similar mechanism will now be in place for 2018 and 2019 at Wisconsin Public Service. Just a reminder, customers and stockholders share equally in the first 50 basis points of earnings above our allowed rate of return. Anything above the first 50 basis points will flow completely to customers.
Now as part of the agreement, we've also expanded and made permanent certain pricing options for our large electric customers. These options will continue to help many of our customers grow their businesses, create jobs and reduce their energy costs.
Turning to Michigan. I'm pleased to report that we obtained final regulatory approval just yesterday for the construction of new natural gas-fired generation in the Upper Peninsula. We also received all local approvals that are needed to move forward with the project. Our plan is to bring those facilities into commercial service in 2019. And at that time or soon thereafter, we expect to retire our coal-fired power plant at Presque Isle. The approved project calls for a $265 million investment in reciprocating internal combustion engines. It will be capable of generating up to 180 megawatts of electricity. These units, which will be owned by our utility subsidiary in Michigan, Upper Michigan Energy Resources, provide a long-term generation solution for customers in the Upper Peninsula, and that includes the iron ore mine owned by Cleveland-Cliffs.
And now for an update on Illinois. We continue to make progress on the Peoples Gas system modernization program. Since we've acquired Peoples Gas, we've made significant improvements in a number of important metrics. We've lowered contractor construction costs by 15%. We've achieved a 70% decline in customer complaints. Construction time lines have been reduced by more than 25%, and I'm pleased to say that our working relationship with the City of Chicago is greatly improved.
Our system modernization program, as you've heard, is designed to make the gas distribution network in Chicago safer, more reliable, less expensive to maintain. You may recall, we still have an open docket on the preferred approach to this long-term project. We expect a decision by the Illinois Commerce Commission by year end. And consistent with our 2017 plan, we're on track to invest approximately $300 million on the effort in Chicago this year.
Turning now to our operations in Minnesota. On October 13, Minnesota Energy Resources filed a rate case with the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission. We're seeking to increase natural gas base rates by $12.6 million or approximately 5%. We have also requested, under the procedures available in Minnesota, to self-implement an increase of $9.5 million or 3.8% effective January 1 of 2018.
A final decision on new permanent rates is not expected until the first quarter of 2019. I'd also like to update you on our recent FERC decision related to system support resource payments for the Presque Isle Power Plant in Michigan. In its decision, FERC ordered a refund of $22.6 million associated with the payments that we received for the period February of 2014 through January of 2015.
As you may recall, this is very close to the amount that the administrative law judge recommended last year. So consistent with our previous statements, the amount of the refund will not result in a dollar-for-dollar reduction in net income, and we have taken the FERC decision into account for our year end guidance.
Next, I'd like to remind everyone that we will be rolling out our new 5-year capital forecast at the EEI Finance Conference in early November. Over the past few months, Allen shared the developing plan with me in my role as Chairman of the Board. In the past few weeks, I have, of course, reviewed the capital plan in great detail, and I share Allen's optimism about the direction of the plan. Now one piece of that new 5-year plan has just been put in place.
Our Wisconsin Public Service utility in Green Bay, along with Wisconsin Power and Light and Madison Gas and Electric, have purchased the Forward Wind Energy Center from Invenergy. The total purchase price is approximately $174 million. We will own 44.6% of the facility with an investment of approximately $78 million. Forward consists of 86 GE wind turbines with a capacity of about 130 megawatts. The wind farm is located 10 miles south of Fond du Lac in the eastern part of the state. If approved, Wisconsin Public Service customers will see real savings because we will be able to eliminate the existing power purchase agreement.
Pending regulatory approvals closing on the Forward Wind Center could take place next spring. Again, we look forward to sharing more about our new 5-year capital plan at EEI, and we really look forward to the opportunities that lie ahead.
And speaking of opportunity, you may have heard about the blockbuster announcement this summer. The announcement that Foxconn has chosen Wisconsin for one of the largest economic development projects in American history. Based on revenue, Foxconn is the fourth largest tech company in the world. And Foxconn has decided to bring a brand-new technology called 8K to the United States. The company plans to invest $10 billion to build a massive production plant that could employ as many as 13,000 people in Racine County, just south of Milwaukee. We expect the electric demand from this Foxconn campus to be more than 200 megawatts. That's approximately 3x the size of our current largest Wisconsin customer. And that does not include the demand that will develop from the suppliers that will also need to locate near the Foxconn facility. Foxconn has chosen a site in southeastern Wisconsin that is perfectly situated on our transmission network. We will not need to build any new generation. Our state-of-the-art network is well equipped today to provide reliable, low-cost energy to Foxconn.
And on top of that, folks, if you like gummy bears, and you know who doesn't, I have more news for you. The German candymaker HARIBO has also selected Wisconsin for its first-ever manufacturing facility in North America. So as you can see, the manufacturing economy in Wisconsin is alive and well.
And now with details on our third quarter results and our outlook for the remainder of 2017, here's our esteemed Chief Financial Officer, Scott Lauber. Scott?"
315117,540068828,1322224,"WEC Energy Group, Inc., Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2017",2017-10-26,"Earnings Calls","WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Gale. Our GAAP earnings were unchanged from the third quarter of 2016 at $0.68 per share. You may recall that our 2016 third quarter earnings included $0.01 of acquisition costs. Excluding these costs, our adjusted earnings were $0.69 in the th",974,"Thank you, Gale. Our GAAP earnings were unchanged from the third quarter of 2016 at $0.68 per share. You may recall that our 2016 third quarter earnings included $0.01 of acquisition costs. Excluding these costs, our adjusted earnings were $0.69 in the third quarter of 2016. Our results were primarily driven by a return to normal weather conditions, offset by positive impact of cost control. Weather in 2016 was 43% warmer than normal in southeastern Wisconsin. The earnings packet placed on our website this morning includes a comparison of third quarter and year-to-date 2017 and 2016 results, both GAAP and adjusted. There were no adjustments made to GAAP earnings in 2017.
My focus will be on the quarter, beginning with operating income by segment and then other income, interest expense and income taxes. Referring to Page 9 of the earning packet, our consolidated operating income in the third quarter of 2017 was $393.6 million compared to the adjusted $402.5 million in the third quarter of 2016, a decrease of $8.9 million.
Starting with the Wisconsin segment, operating income decreased $19.4 million quarter-over-quarter. Lower margin was driven by a return to normal weather and a normal fuel recovery pattern. This was offset by operations and maintenance expense that was $39.9 million lower compared to the third quarter of 2016. Last year, we recorded $18.6 million in operations and maintenance expense related to the earnings sharing mechanism in place at Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas.
In the third quarter of 2017, our Illinois segment recognized an operating income increase of $800,000 compared to the third quarter of 2016. The increase was primarily driven by continued investment in the gas system modernization program.
As expected, operating loss in our Other States segment increased $2.1 million, driven by higher depreciation and amortization expense resulting from an increase in capital investments in our gas distribution utilities.
Turning now to our non-utility energy infrastructure segment. As a reminder, this segment contains the operations of Bluewater Natural Gas Holding, which was acquired on June 30 of this year as well as a result of the Power the Future plants. For the third quarter, operating income in this segment was up $9.7 million. Bluewater Natural Gas Holding contributed $5.9 million to operating income in 2017. Operating income from our Power the Future plants increased $3.8 million, reflecting the additional investment at these plants since the third quarter of 2016.
Operating income at our Corporate and Other segment was $1.1 million for the third quarter of 2017, an increase of $2.1 million from the adjusted operating loss in the third quarter of 2016. Taking the changes for these segments together, we arrived at $8.9 million decrease in adjusted operating income.
During the third quarter of 2017, earnings from our equity investment in American Transmission Company totaled $39.2 million, an increase of $900,000 compared to the same quarter of 2016.
Other income net increased by $8.9 million quarter-over-quarter. This was largely due to 2 items, higher investment gains related to our deferred compensation plan and we incurred losses in our third quarter of 2016 related to the disposition of some nonutility assets.
Interest expense increased $4.7 million quarter-over-quarter, primarily driven by an increase in debt levels resulting from continued capital investments.
Turning now to consolidated income taxes. We still expect that our effective income tax rate will be between 37% and 38% this year. Combining all of these items brings us to earnings of $215.4 million or $0.68 per share for the third quarter of 2017, compared to adjusted earnings of $219.1 million or $0.69 per share for the third quarter of 2016.
For the year-to-date, adjusted earnings increased $0.07 to $2.43 per share for the 9 months ended September 30, 2017, compared to an adjusted $2.36 per share for the 9 months ended September 30, 2016. This was largely due to cost control and efficiency gains.
Looking at the cash flow statement on Page 7 of the earnings package, net cash provided by operating activities increased $24.8 million during the 9 months ended September 30, 2017, compared to the same period in 2016. The reduction in working capital and higher operating income were partially offset by a $100 million contribution to the pension plan in January 2017.
Our capital expenditures totaled $1.3 billion for the first 9 months of 2017, a $309.1 million increase compared to the same period in 2016, as we continue to invest in our core infrastructure.
Our debt-to-capital ratio was 51.9% at the end of September, unchanged from the end of 2016. Our calculation continues to treat half of the WEC Energy Group 2007 Series A Junior Subordinated Notes as common equity. We're using cash to satisfy any shares required in our 401(k) plan, options and other programs. Going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares.
We paid $492.4 million in common stock dividends during the first 9 months of 2017, an increase of $23.8 million over the same period last year.
Moving to sales. We see continued customer growth across our system. At the end of September, our utilities were serving approximately 9,000 more electric and 18,000 more natural gas customers than it did the same time a year ago.
Sales volumes are shown on a comparative basis on Page 13 and 14 of the earnings package. On a year-to-date basis, weather-normalized sales factor out the effects of leap year in 2016. Overall normalized sales results for natural gas were slightly above our expectations and retail electric sales were slightly below our expectations.
Turning now to our earnings forecasts. We are reaffirming our 2017 earnings guidance of $3.06 a share to $3.12 a share with an expectation of being in the upper end of the range. This projection assumes normal weather for the remainder of the year.
With that, I'll turn things back to Gale."

I mean, first of all, I really can only speak about our utilities, which would be We Energies and Wisconsin Public Service in Green Bay. But when you look at the broader picture, remember, we have set a goal to reduce carbon emissions by essentially 40% by the year 2030 off 2005 levels. We believe we can do that without significant rate pressure because of what's occurred with the improvement and the efficiency and the cost of some renewables. Believe it or not, I mean, when you look at just what's happened with the efficiency of utility-scale solar, I mean, even 3 or 4 years ago for Wisconsin, you might see, oh, gosh, $4,000 a megawatt installed -- cost of $4,000 a megawatt installed for a large utility-scale solar plant in Wisconsin. That's today down to circa $1,300. So what's going to be driving the restructuring of generation portfolios, not just in our state but elsewhere, particularly, where they're coal heavy, is really economics. And we're seeing significant economic changes that will allow us to add more renewables to our fleet. In part, we're able to do that and not put pressure on rates because we already have a state-of-the-art backbone, if you will, from the Power the Future units that we've already built and are in place. So I think we are very well positioned to continue to take costs out, to continue to reduce carbon emissions. But at the end of the day, I mean, the company's goal is really to maintain a diverse fuel supply, less of coal, clearly less of coal. But at the end of the day, we probably, 10 or 15 years from now, will look like a 1/3, 1/3, 1/3. Basically 1/3 coal, or 1/3 fossil fuel, 1/3 renewables, 1/3 natural gas. Did that help at all, Michael?"

But it is just way too early to think about a prefunding or think about any change in our plan. We're going to have to see, first of all, whether tax reform actually gets completed and then what the real details are. And there's some thought that there might be an optional election on interest deductibility with a trade-off on another tax deduction item. We'll just have to see. At this point, I think anything that -- I mean, we're, obviously, looking at the landscape, but anything that I might tell you would be pure speculation until we really understand the details.

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us as we review our performance for the third quarter of this year. Now before we dive into our update this afternoon, I'd like to take just a moment to thank you for the incredible outpouring of prayers and support and good wishes for Allen Leverett following his stroke earlier this month. I can tell you that Allen has been released from the hospital and is making progress in his recovery. I will continue to serve as Interim Chief Executive for as long as necessary, but the ultimate goal is, obviously, to bring Allen back. But again, your kindness and concern have meant a great deal to Allen and his family, and a great deal to all of us as well. My thanks.
Now I'd like to introduce the members of our senior team who are here with me today. We have Scott Lauber, our Chief Financial Officer; Jim Schubilske, Treasurer; Susan Martin, General Counsel; Bill Guc, our Controller; and Beth Straka, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations.
We'll begin with our third quarter results. As I'm sure you saw from our news release this morning, we reported third quarter earnings of $0.68 a share. We delivered a solid third quarter, largely driven by effective cost controls.
Our focus on cost management and efficiency gains was a major factor in offsetting the impact of mild summer weather compared to last year's third quarter. Those cool temperatures were particularly noticeable during August, which is normally one of the two warmest months in the Midwest.
Next I'd like to brief you on several developments on the regulatory front and on our capital investments. On August 10, the Wisconsin Public Service Commission unanimously approved our proposed rate settlement. We received our final written order on September 8. Under the approved settlement, base rates for all of our Wisconsin utilities will remain flat for 2018 and for 2019. In total, this will keep base rates flat for 4 years, and essentially gives our customers price certainty through 2019.
The earnings sharing mechanisms that have been in place will be extended through 2019 at Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas and a similar mechanism will now be in place for 2018 and 2019 at Wisconsin Public Service. Just a reminder, customers and stockholders share equally in the first 50 basis points of earnings above our allowed rate of return. Anything above the first 50 basis points will flow completely to customers.
Now as part of the agreement, we've also expanded and made permanent certain pricing options for our large electric customers. These options will continue to help many of our customers grow their businesses, create jobs and reduce their energy costs.
Turning to Michigan. I'm pleased to report that we obtained final regulatory approval just yesterday for the construction of new natural gas-fired generation in the Upper Peninsula. We also received all local approvals that are needed to move forward with the project. Our plan is to bring those facilities into commercial service in 2019. And at that time or soon thereafter, we expect to retire our coal-fired power plant at Presque Isle. The approved project calls for a $265 million investment in reciprocating internal combustion engines. It will be capable of generating up to 180 megawatts of electricity. These units, which will be owned by our utility subsidiary in Michigan, Upper Michigan Energy Resources, provide a long-term generation solution for customers in the Upper Peninsula, and that includes the iron ore mine owned by Cleveland-Cliffs.
And now for an update on Illinois. We continue to make progress on the Peoples Gas system modernization program. Since we've acquired Peoples Gas, we've made significant improvements in a number of important metrics. We've lowered contractor construction costs by 15%. We've achieved a 70% decline in customer complaints. Construction time lines have been reduced by more than 25%, and I'm pleased to say that our working relationship with the City of Chicago is greatly improved.
Our system modernization program, as you've heard, is designed to make the gas distribution network in Chicago safer, more reliable, less expensive to maintain. You may recall, we still have an open docket on the preferred approach to this long-term project. We expect a decision by the Illinois Commerce Commission by year end. And consistent with our 2017 plan, we're on track to invest approximately $300 million on the effort in Chicago this year.
Turning now to our operations in Minnesota. On October 13, Minnesota Energy Resources filed a rate case with the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission. We're seeking to increase natural gas base rates by $12.6 million or approximately 5%. We have also requested, under the procedures available in Minnesota, to self-implement an increase of $9.5 million or 3.8% effective January 1 of 2018.
A final decision on new permanent rates is not expected until the first quarter of 2019. I'd also like to update you on our recent FERC decision related to system support resource payments for the Presque Isle Power Plant in Michigan. In its decision, FERC ordered a refund of $22.6 million associated with the payments that we received for the period February of 2014 through January of 2015.
As you may recall, this is very close to the amount that the administrative law judge recommended last year. So consistent with our previous statements, the amount of the refund will not result in a dollar-for-dollar reduction in net income, and we have taken the FERC decision into account for our year end guidance.
Next, I'd like to remind everyone that we will be rolling out our new 5-year capital forecast at the EEI Finance Conference in early November. Over the past few months, Allen shared the developing plan with me in my role as Chairman of the Board. In the past few weeks, I have, of course, reviewed the capital plan in great detail, and I share Allen's optimism about the direction of the plan. Now one piece of that new 5-year plan has just been put in place.
Our Wisconsin Public Service utility in Green Bay, along with Wisconsin Power and Light and Madison Gas and Electric, have purchased the Forward Wind Energy Center from Invenergy. The total purchase price is approximately $174 million. We will own 44.6% of the facility with an investment of approximately $78 million. Forward consists of 86 GE wind turbines with a capacity of about 130 megawatts. The wind farm is located 10 miles south of Fond du Lac in the eastern part of the state. If approved, Wisconsin Public Service customers will see real savings because we will be able to eliminate the existing power purchase agreement.
Pending regulatory approvals closing on the Forward Wind Center could take place next spring. Again, we look forward to sharing more about our new 5-year capital plan at EEI, and we really look forward to the opportunities that lie ahead.
And speaking of opportunity, you may have heard about the blockbuster announcement this summer. The announcement that Foxconn has chosen Wisconsin for one of the largest economic development projects in American history. Based on revenue, Foxconn is the fourth largest tech company in the world. And Foxconn has decided to bring a brand-new technology called 8K to the United States. The company plans to invest $10 billion to build a massive production plant that could employ as many as 13,000 people in Racine County, just south of Milwaukee. We expect the electric demand from this Foxconn campus to be more than 200 megawatts. That's approximately 3x the size of our current largest Wisconsin customer. And that does not include the demand that will develop from the suppliers that will also need to locate near the Foxconn facility. Foxconn has chosen a site in southeastern Wisconsin that is perfectly situated on our transmission network. We will not need to build any new generation. Our state-of-the-art network is well equipped today to provide reliable, low-cost energy to Foxconn.
And on top of that, folks, if you like gummy bears, and you know who doesn't, I have more news for you. The German candymaker HARIBO has also selected Wisconsin for its first-ever manufacturing facility in North America. So as you can see, the manufacturing economy in Wisconsin is alive and well.
And now with details on our third quarter results and our outlook for the remainder of 2017, here's our esteemed Chief Financial Officer, Scott Lauber. Scott?"
315117,540068828,1325058,"WEC Energy Group, Inc., Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2017",2017-10-26,"Earnings Calls","WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Gale. Our GAAP earnings were unchanged from the third quarter of 2016 at $0.68 per share. You may recall that our 2016 third quarter earnings included $0.01 of acquisition costs. Excluding these costs, our adjusted earnings were $0.69 in the th",974,"Thank you, Gale. Our GAAP earnings were unchanged from the third quarter of 2016 at $0.68 per share. You may recall that our 2016 third quarter earnings included $0.01 of acquisition costs. Excluding these costs, our adjusted earnings were $0.69 in the third quarter of 2016. Our results were primarily driven by a return to normal weather conditions, offset by positive impact of cost control. Weather in 2016 was 43% warmer than normal in southeastern Wisconsin. The earnings packet placed on our website this morning includes a comparison of third quarter and year-to-date 2017 and 2016 results, both GAAP and adjusted. There were no adjustments made to GAAP earnings in 2017.
My focus will be on the quarter, beginning with operating income by segment and then other income, interest expense and income taxes. Referring to Page 9 of the earning packet, our consolidated operating income in the third quarter of 2017 was $393.6 million compared to the adjusted $402.5 million in the third quarter of 2016, a decrease of $8.9 million.
Starting with the Wisconsin segment, operating income decreased $19.4 million quarter-over-quarter. Lower margin was driven by a return to normal weather and a normal fuel recovery pattern. This was offset by operations and maintenance expense that was $39.9 million lower compared to the third quarter of 2016. Last year, we recorded $18.6 million in operations and maintenance expense related to the earnings sharing mechanism in place at Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas.
In the third quarter of 2017, our Illinois segment recognized an operating income increase of $800,000 compared to the third quarter of 2016. The increase was primarily driven by continued investment in the gas system modernization program.
As expected, operating loss in our Other States segment increased $2.1 million, driven by higher depreciation and amortization expense resulting from an increase in capital investments in our gas distribution utilities.
Turning now to our non-utility energy infrastructure segment. As a reminder, this segment contains the operations of Bluewater Natural Gas Holding, which was acquired on June 30 of this year as well as a result of the Power the Future plants. For the third quarter, operating income in this segment was up $9.7 million. Bluewater Natural Gas Holding contributed $5.9 million to operating income in 2017. Operating income from our Power the Future plants increased $3.8 million, reflecting the additional investment at these plants since the third quarter of 2016.
Operating income at our Corporate and Other segment was $1.1 million for the third quarter of 2017, an increase of $2.1 million from the adjusted operating loss in the third quarter of 2016. Taking the changes for these segments together, we arrived at $8.9 million decrease in adjusted operating income.
During the third quarter of 2017, earnings from our equity investment in American Transmission Company totaled $39.2 million, an increase of $900,000 compared to the same quarter of 2016.
Other income net increased by $8.9 million quarter-over-quarter. This was largely due to 2 items, higher investment gains related to our deferred compensation plan and we incurred losses in our third quarter of 2016 related to the disposition of some nonutility assets.
Interest expense increased $4.7 million quarter-over-quarter, primarily driven by an increase in debt levels resulting from continued capital investments.
Turning now to consolidated income taxes. We still expect that our effective income tax rate will be between 37% and 38% this year. Combining all of these items brings us to earnings of $215.4 million or $0.68 per share for the third quarter of 2017, compared to adjusted earnings of $219.1 million or $0.69 per share for the third quarter of 2016.
For the year-to-date, adjusted earnings increased $0.07 to $2.43 per share for the 9 months ended September 30, 2017, compared to an adjusted $2.36 per share for the 9 months ended September 30, 2016. This was largely due to cost control and efficiency gains.
Looking at the cash flow statement on Page 7 of the earnings package, net cash provided by operating activities increased $24.8 million during the 9 months ended September 30, 2017, compared to the same period in 2016. The reduction in working capital and higher operating income were partially offset by a $100 million contribution to the pension plan in January 2017.
Our capital expenditures totaled $1.3 billion for the first 9 months of 2017, a $309.1 million increase compared to the same period in 2016, as we continue to invest in our core infrastructure.
Our debt-to-capital ratio was 51.9% at the end of September, unchanged from the end of 2016. Our calculation continues to treat half of the WEC Energy Group 2007 Series A Junior Subordinated Notes as common equity. We're using cash to satisfy any shares required in our 401(k) plan, options and other programs. Going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares.
We paid $492.4 million in common stock dividends during the first 9 months of 2017, an increase of $23.8 million over the same period last year.
Moving to sales. We see continued customer growth across our system. At the end of September, our utilities were serving approximately 9,000 more electric and 18,000 more natural gas customers than it did the same time a year ago.
Sales volumes are shown on a comparative basis on Page 13 and 14 of the earnings package. On a year-to-date basis, weather-normalized sales factor out the effects of leap year in 2016. Overall normalized sales results for natural gas were slightly above our expectations and retail electric sales were slightly below our expectations.
Turning now to our earnings forecasts. We are reaffirming our 2017 earnings guidance of $3.06 a share to $3.12 a share with an expectation of being in the upper end of the range. This projection assumes normal weather for the remainder of the year.
With that, I'll turn things back to Gale."

And then perhaps in tandem with that, I'd love to hear your thoughts on recovery from a regulatory perspective of the latest investment you are talking about on the wind side, just given the stayout, et cetera?"

I mean, first of all, I really can only speak about our utilities, which would be We Energies and Wisconsin Public Service in Green Bay. But when you look at the broader picture, remember, we have set a goal to reduce carbon emissions by essentially 40% by the year 2030 off 2005 levels. We believe we can do that without significant rate pressure because of what's occurred with the improvement and the efficiency and the cost of some renewables. Believe it or not, I mean, when you look at just what's happened with the efficiency of utility-scale solar, I mean, even 3 or 4 years ago for Wisconsin, you might see, oh, gosh, $4,000 a megawatt installed -- cost of $4,000 a megawatt installed for a large utility-scale solar plant in Wisconsin. That's today down to circa $1,300. So what's going to be driving the restructuring of generation portfolios, not just in our state but elsewhere, particularly, where they're coal heavy, is really economics. And we're seeing significant economic changes that will allow us to add more renewables to our fleet. In part, we're able to do that and not put pressure on rates because we already have a state-of-the-art backbone, if you will, from the Power the Future units that we've already built and are in place. So I think we are very well positioned to continue to take costs out, to continue to reduce carbon emissions. But at the end of the day, I mean, the company's goal is really to maintain a diverse fuel supply, less of coal, clearly less of coal. But at the end of the day, we probably, 10 or 15 years from now, will look like a 1/3, 1/3, 1/3. Basically 1/3 coal, or 1/3 fossil fuel, 1/3 renewables, 1/3 natural gas. Did that help at all, Michael?"

I guess, the question really I'd ask you, Scott, is how much balance sheet capacity do you think the company has whether it's for incremental rate base growth or you've shown the ability to successfully integrate another company whether it'd be incremental M&A. How are you thinking about the strength of the balance sheet and how much room or excess capacity the current balance sheet has?"
