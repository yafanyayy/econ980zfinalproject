Good morning, everyone.As you can see from our results, free cash flow and earnings per share performance were the highlights for the quarter and the year. We generated $631 million in free cash flow in 2016 and this was net of $276 mil",1771,"Thank you, Lori. Good morning, everyone.
As you can see from our results, free cash flow and earnings per share performance were the highlights for the quarter and the year. We generated $631 million in free cash flow in 2016 and this was net of $276 million in CapEx and $66 million in restructuring. The significant upside relative to our guidance was primarily driven by our continuous strong focus on working capital. We also delivered $0.76 in adjusted adjusted EPS in the fourth quarter and $2.66 per share in 2016 after repurchasing only 5 million shares in the first 9 months of the year.
In the fourth quarter, both Food Care and Diversey Care delivered organic sales growth of approximately and 3% adjusted EPS growth of 16%. In Food Care, protein packaging volumes in North America increased more than 6%. Our hygiene business increased sales in constant -- by 5% in constant dollars and we delivered favorable price/mix on a global basis. Diversey Care's growth was primarily driven by favorable price/mix of over 2% and volume increases of 7% and 3% in Asia Pacific and North America, respectively.
Where we fell short in the quarter was our top line constant dollar growth in Product Care, which weighed on our adjusted EBITDA performance. We knew December would be a critical month for us, with most of our global growth depending on our e-commerce business. And we were happy with our e-commerce volume growth of 15% in the quarter, but this was offset by weakness in global industrial GDP and our product rationalization efforts. And despite the shortfall in sales, adjusted EBITDA margins increased 80 basis points over the last year to 22.3%.
So as I'm sure you all know, I am not happy with our overall organic growth of 1.3% in 2016. We underestimated the impact of the economic and geopolitical environment in Latin America and the Middle East, the depth of the downcycle in the Australian beef market and the weakness in the industrial world. But at the same time, I'm very pleased with the agility of our organization, its ability to deliver bottom line results and properly prioritize. I'm also extremely pleased with the innovation pipelines and the number of new disruptive products that we are gradually introducing and launching across the 3 divisions.
Our total net sales outlook for 2017 of 2.5% constant dollar growth reflects approximately 3% of growth from -- for Food Care and Product Care and 1% for Diversey Care, which accounts for the short-term impact of the expiration of the brand licensing agreement with SC Johnson. Internally, the actions that we're taking to drive growth in 2017 are purposeful. We will leverage our strong global presence in Food Care and continue growing at a faster pace than the protein packaging markets. We will capitalize on the e-commerce opportunity with our disruptive technologies. And the underlying constant dollar sales growth for Diversey Care, excluding SCJ, is expected to be at an all-time high in 2017, and our plans to reveal our consumer brands business is very well underway.
We recognize that 2017 will prove to be a critical year for Sealed Air, particularly as we proceed with our plans for the separation of New Diversey. As you know, we disclosed back in October that we are pursuing a tax-free spin-off. And today, we announced that we are also exploring other strategic alternatives, including the potential sale of New Diversey, and we're confident that the separation is the appropriate next step in our company's transformation and will enable us to unlock meaningful value for customers and shareholders. At this point, we are very limited on what we can share about the separation process and thank you in advance for respecting our need to significantly limit our comments.
So now let me turn back on the fourth quarter and year-end performance. On Slide 5 and 6 of our presentation, you can see our performance by region for the fourth quarter and the full year.
In Q4, organic sales growth was 2% with positive trends across all regions. Organic growth in North America was driven by an increase of approximately 4% in volume. Constant dollar growth in Latin America was a result of our pricing efforts to offset currency devaluations. And in EMEA, positive trends in Food Care and Diversey Care were partially offset by declines in Product Care. And performance in Asia was very strong in Diversey Care at 7% constant dollar growth, but the total company's results were impacted by a 10% decline in Australia due to the beef market downcycle. Australia accounted for approximately 7% of Food Care net sales in the fourth quarter.
And for the full year 2016, net sales increased 1.3% as compared to 2015 on an organic basis. Constant dollar growth in Latin America was 9% and organic growth in EMEA was 2%. North America and Asia Pacific were essentially unchanged as compared to last year.
Turning to Slide 7, which highlights volume and price/mix trends by division and by region. You can see that from this slide that on a global basis, volume trends were flat to up 2% throughout the year. Let me highlight that our volume in North America has accelerated throughout the year with 4.2% growth in the fourth quarter on the heels of 3.8% in the third quarter. We delivered favorable price/mix in each quarter throughout 2016 as a result of positive trends in Food Care and Diversey Care.
Now let me turn to Slide 8 and review Food Care results. Positive volume trends in North America and EMEA, favorable price/mix and disciplined cost management were key contributors to our fourth quarter organic sales growth of 3% and adjusted EBITDA margin of 21%, an increase of 250 basis points over last year. We are seeing the benefit of higher beef volume and market share gains through the continued global adoption of our new products. Similar to the third quarter, these positive trends were offset by volume declines in Australia and Latin America.
For the full year 2016, Food Care delivered $3.2 billion in net sales or 2% organic sales growth. Packaging solutions were $2.6 billion and hygiene solutions were $600 million. In adjusted EBITDA, Food Care reported $661 million or 20.5% of net sales, packaging solutions delivered adjusted EBITDA of $593 million or 22.7% of net sales and hygiene delivered the remaining $68 million of EBITDA or 11.3% of net sales.
I'd like to highlight that the hygiene business has improved its margins by over 400 basis points on an as reported basis in 2013 and has a very bright future as part of New Diversey by providing market-leading solutions and technology advancement enhanced by acquisitions of Dry Lube and Ciptec.
For the full 2017, Food Care sales are forecasted to increase approximately 3% in constant dollars. Our core business is expected to continue growing faster than the market with more contribution from our Change the Game initiatives, particularly Optidur and Darfresh. Latin America is starting to stabilize and Australia will continue to be impacted by declines in the beef market also, to a lesser degree, as compared to 2016. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to increase at a faster pace than sales. And similar to 2016, we expect the Q1 to be our low point for sales and EBITDA.
Turning to Diversey Care's results on Slide 9. You can see that net sales were up 3% in constant dollars in the fourth quarter and up 2% for the full year. Adjusted EBITDA margins of 13% increased 180 basis points in the quarter and, for the full year, margins increased 120 basis points to 12.8%. Sales growth in the quarter and throughout the year was driven by increased sales from existing and new customers in North America, Europe and Asia Pacific. In Western Europe, most of our largest countries experienced positive constant sales growth. And in Asia Pacific, growth was led by strength in China, India and Southeast Asia. Throughout the Middle East and parts of Europe, the hospitality sector struggled in the second half as a result of declines in tourism and occupancy rates due to terrorist attacks.
In 2017, Diversey sales are expected to increase approximately 1% on a constant dollar basis, with adjusted EBITDA margins in line with 2016 results. And as I noted earlier, our plans are well underway to mitigate the impact of SCJ and sales from the core business, excluding SCJ, is growing at an accelerated pace. This growth is a direct result of the investments that we have made in our product portfolio, go-to-market strategy and sales organization.
Slide 10 highlights the results for our -- from our Product Care division. In the fourth quarter and full year, Product Care net sales on a constant dollar basis were essentially unchanged as compared to -- with 2015. Adjusted EBITDA margins increased 80 basis points to 22.3% in the quarter and 90 basis points to 21.8% in 2016.
In the fourth quarter, Product Care delivered strong volume trends in North America, which were partially offset by declines in Europe. Adjusting for product rationalization, North America volume were up approximately 5%, driven by strength in our e-commerce segment. And similar to the third quarter, our performance in Europe was negatively impacted by the industrial environments. And in the latter half of 2016, we have been introducing an unprecedented number of new technologies and solutions. And as a result, we are experiencing significant interest from our customers, which mainly you saw firsthand at PACK EXPO in -- many of you saw at PACK EXPO in early November. Sales for these products, including I-Pack, FloWrap, sales wrap, inflatable bubble and auto mailers are expected to ramp up in 2017 and contribute to both our top and bottom line growth. We will continue to invest heavily in the business to support new product launches and global growth opportunities as for -- but for our industrial base business, we are planning for sales to be relatively in line with 2016. And also keep in mind that our rationalization efforts are behind us, but that you will not see a true apples-to-apples constant dollar sales growth rate until the second half of 2017.
For the full year 2017, we anticipate year-over-year constant dollar sales to increase approximately 3%. And similar to product -- to Food Care, adjusted EBITDA is expected to increase at a faster pace than sales.
And now, let me pass the call to Carol to review our net sales and adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow and our -- more details on our outlook for 2017. Carol?"

We delivered $1.7 billion in net sales in the fourth quarter and $6.8 billion for the full year 2016. Volume contributed $26 million and",956,"Thank you, Jerome.
Turning to Slide 11, let me walk you through our net sales performance on a year-over-year basis. We delivered $1.7 billion in net sales in the fourth quarter and $6.8 billion for the full year 2016. Volume contributed $26 million and $50 million to top line growth in the quarter and for the full year, respectively. Favorable price/mix was $9 million in Q4 and $41 million for the year. Unfavorable currency translation was $40 million in the quarter and $243 million in 2016. Food Care divestitures impacted sales by $5 million in Q4 and $102 million for the full year.
On Slide 12, you can see that our adjusted EBITDA was $304 million or 17.5% of net sales in the fourth quarter and $1.16 billion or 17.1% for the full year. Mix and price/cost spread was $13 million favorable in Q4 and $46 million in 2016. Volume growth contributed $9 million to the quarter and $19 million for the year. Restructuring savings were $10 million and $43 million in Q4 and 2016, respectively. Operating expenses increased $6 million in the quarter. For the full year, operating expenses increased $69 million, most of which is related to compensation inflation. Currency was a negative $4 million in Q4 and a negative $35 million in 2016. For the full year, divestitures had a negative impact of $21 million on adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted gross margins improved 60 basis points in the fourth quarter and in the full year, resulting in 36.8% margin and 37.4% margin, respectively. We were pleased with this performance in light of the volatility of input costs and timing of raw material cost pass-throughs in Food Care.
Adjusted earnings per share were $0.76 in the fourth quarter and $2.66 for the full year. Currency translation reduced EPS by $0.01 in the quarter and by $0.11 for the full year. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 18% and, for the full year, 21.6%. We repurchased 4.7 million shares for approximately $217 million in 2016. We still have approximately $667 million available under the board-approved share repurchase plan and expect to return to share buyback following the New Diversey separation. 
Turning to Slide 13. Free cash flow was a source of cash of $631 million. Working capital and other assets and liabilities were a source of cash of $151 million. CapEx increased to $276 million, which includes $100 million related to the investment in our Charlotte campus and $30 million related to other CapEx restructuring activities. CapEx in 2015 was $184 million. As Jerome commented, the strong free cash flow performance was driven by optimization of our working capital, including the implementation of our new supply chain financing program. Our procurement team and our credit and collections team exceeded their targets for the fourth quarter, generating more than $80 million improvement above our prior guidance for free cash flow. 
Now turning to outlook on Slide 14. In constant dollars, net sales are expected to increase approximately 2.5% for the full year 2017. This forecast assumes approximately 1% constant dollar growth for Diversey Care and approximately 3% growth for both Food Care and Product Care. While both volume and price/mix are expected to be contributors to 2017 growth, we expect more growth to come from accelerated volume trends throughout the year. We estimate the currency translation will reduce net sales by approximately $220 million or 3%. Our major currency exposures in 2016 included the euro, which was approximately 18% of net sales; the British pound, which was 5%; Australian dollar was 4%; and the Brazilian reals, Mexican peso and Canadian dollar were each approximately 3% of net sales. 2017 adjusted EBITDA is expected to be approximately $1.18 billion. Please note that contrary to last year, interest income of $10 million is excluded from our EBITDA guidance. Unfavorable currency translation is estimated to be approximately $40 million. As a reminder, a 5% swing in the euro has an impact of approximately $10 million on adjusted EBITDA. 
Our medical and corporate expenses are expected to be a net expense of $90 million for the full year 2017. Our net interest expense for 2017 is estimated at $215 million. Depreciation and amortization is forecast to be approximately $275 million. Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be approximately $2.70, assuming unfavorable currency translation of $0.14. We expect our adjusted tax rate to increase approximately 23%, which will negatively impact year-over-year EPS by $0.05. Our forecast for EPS is based on a weighted average $197 million diluted shares. We are forecasting free cash flow to be approximately $600 million in 2017. We expect working capital and other current assets and liabilities to be to cash as we continue to progress on inventory management and our supply chain financing program. Cash restructuring payments are estimated to be approximately $85 million to $100 million, depending on the pace of addressing stranded cost. We expect to realize restructuring savings of approximately $40 million in 2017, with additional savings in 2018. Cash interest payments are expected to be $210 million. Cash tax payments are estimated to increase to $175 million, and CapEx is expected to return to a more normalized level of approximately $185 million. Our outlook for free cash flow in 2017 does not include any material fees associated with the separation efforts of New Diversey. The costs associated with the separation is expected to be managed within existing programs and funds generated as a result of the separation. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. Before I open the call to questions, I would like to remind you, our first quarter 2017 earnings call is tentatively scheduled for Thursday, April 27. 
With that, operator, can you please open up the call for questions?"

I'm not happy with the growth that we had and I am disappointed. Why? Because we didn't have a very strong -- or we didn't have much growth in the first half, a little bit in the third quarter. It's improving so",917,"Good question again. And no, I'm not happy. I'm not happy with the growth that we had and I am disappointed. Why? Because we didn't have a very strong -- or we didn't have much growth in the first half, a little bit in the third quarter. It's improving somewhat in the fourth quarter, but it was not at the levels that I was expecting. And yes, indeed, we have been surprised by a few things. Number one is the global GDP. You go to Bloomberg on February 2016 and you see that global GDP was forecasted at 2.4%, and it ended up, global, it ended up at 1.9%. With the U.S. at 2.4% also, which ended up also at 1.9%. And in Europe, which was forecasted at 1.9% and it is at 1.6%. And for 2017, the trend seems to be the same. Last year. '17 was seen to have a global GDP forecast for 2017 a year ago at 2.6% and today's [ph] projection is 2.3%. So we can't ignore these kind of things, and what disappointed me is the lack of industrial GDP growth in the world economy, which had 1.9% global GDP growth. This is probably one of the worst years that we have experienced in many years actually. And it's always next year, which is supposed to be better but you know what, we're not counting on it. And in our forecast at this point in time, we are considering that the industrial world is not going to be better. And if it comes as a good surprise, we'd love that. Back in June of 2015 during Analyst Day, almost 2 years ago now or 18 months ago, we were seeing a macro world, which was going to be better. The reality is that in 2016, LATAM is much worse or has been much worse than we thought it was going to be. And again, industrial markets have been much softer. So that's how we plan. What am I unhappy with? Very frankly, we have invested a lot of money in new products and in R&D and marketing to position new products. At PACK EXPO late October, we have shown and we have announced quite a few innovation, which are going to be -- which are disruptive and are going to make an impact. But what you have seen at that time for several of those equipment, our products, which it was the first production. So we did not launch -- we launched at that time, and now in 2017, we have to ramp up those things. The thing that we all need to understand is that we're doing very different things that we were doing a few years ago. A few years ago, we were launching just simple products. Today, we're launching solutions, we're launching equipment [indiscernible] razor blades. Those are higher-margin products, but the issue of this is that it takes a little bit of -- the sales cycle is a little bit longer. When you work with meat processors and retail chains in Europe, in North America to establish Darfresh entree or those kinds of extraordinary solutions, which have a very, very clear megatrend, it just takes time. And we have talked about that. We have talked about some of those related that the cycle between the first time we talk about that, [indiscernible] such a product or solution and the production or the go net produced after ordering the equivalent set, this is 2 years. And it is the same on Product Care. One thing was to sell a little inflatable machine. Another thing is to do operational excellence with our e-commerce partners and improve all the organization and showing them how much value they can create out of sell wrap, FloWrap and pack and kind of things. So I'm disappointed with the overall world economy supports, [indiscernible] excited which is why during the year 2016, we have invested so much money in R&D and in marketing to position these new solutions because I really believe that this is disruptive and our expected growth is probably delayed, just had probably been delayed by a few quarters. But I conclude, because this is very key, that we have seen an acceleration of the volume growth in Sealed Air in the fourth quarter. We had the highest volume growth in Food Care of each -- of all the quarters in the fourth quarter. Same for Diversey. And almost the same, we had a very strong third quarter in Product Care, but almost the same in Product Care. So it's absolutely not doom and gloom, but we have to be realistic. And 2017 is going to be mostly about volume. And talking about Diversey, let me remind you what I said earlier. It is going to be our fastest growth business, fastest growth year if you exclude the short-term impact of the SCJ. And we told you why this agreement did not get renewed, is that it was not fitting [indiscernible] company. We wanted access to wider markets, to consumer market, to all kinds of do-it-yourself type of markets and SCJ didn't want that. And therefore, we agree to disagree. Yes, it does have a short-term impact, but this was really the right thing to do for the company. We have lots of great plans in place and you're going to see outside of this SCJ business, we're going to have the highest growth that we ever had in Diversey Care."

But for the whole year, we are counting on flat sales, which is why by the way, we are not going to -- we are not having a lot of price in our growth forecast. We have price/mix, but we don't have very much of that. What you have to know is that we're very diligent. We have announced the price increase effective March 1 in our Product Care business. We're looking at systematic price product line by line. It's not going to apply across the board because it's going to apply to polyethylene-based products and we don't have only polyethylene-based products in Product Care.

With respect to providing a range, we just felt that it was probably plainer to pick a point of the $1.18 billion and work towards at that. It helps with our modeling as well as yours and our investors to do that. So that's what we've done. And then just -- we highlighted and called out the various moving pieces, and I think one of the changes versus maybe what you were looking at before is definitely on the share count and the currency and SCJ.

It is -- it has dramatically come down in 2016 for all the reasons that we talked about. And when you think about the herd in 2014, it was $29 million ahead, and in 2016, it was about $26.2 million. And this has been a huge reduction and the slaughter rate has dramatically decreased. We believe that it's going to continue in 2017 at a lower pace, but it's going to continue. And that definitely, as the herd is being rebuilt from 2016 in '17 and onwards towards 2021, we believe that the business in Australia, the slaughter rate is going to increase. And as you know, it is a positive from 2018. So what we see is that from 2018, we're going to have the 3 big parts of the world, which are exporting, et cetera, which are Latin America, Australia and North America be on an up cycle. And that's going to be definitely very positive with that. To be noted also is that the exports out of Brazil are improving. But you have to remember that about 88% of the Brazilian beef exports are frozen and 12% are fresh. The good news is that fresh is expanding with the approval to export to the U.S. and will open to Asian markets as well. So on Product Care, we think we have a huge momentum on 3PL and e-commerce. We are going to be showing more of the partnership agreements that we have during -- in the second quarter with very important ones, and so we're doing great things. It's going great. And we are going to be showing nice, we believe, nice growth in the 3PL e-commerce in North America. The European business has been negative in the fourth quarter. Disappointing, definitely led by our industrial business in Europe. And -- but we -- the whole question is how do we mitigate with e-commerce and 3PL the flattish trend in industrial? And our view is that we shouldn't count on industrial increase in the second -- in 2017 and preserve our positions there. At the very same time, continue to aggressively grow the businesses where which have momentum and in which we're very disruptive."

382724,407640355,1128222,"Sealed Air Corporation, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 09, 2017",2017-02-09,"Earnings Calls","Sealed Air Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Lori. Good morning, everyone.As you can see from our results, free cash flow and earnings per share performance were the highlights for the quarter and the year. We generated $631 million in free cash flow in 2016 and this was net of $276 mil",1770,"Thank you, Lori. Good morning, everyone.
As you can see from our results, free cash flow and earnings per share performance were the highlights for the quarter and the year. We generated $631 million in free cash flow in 2016 and this was net of $276 million in CapEx and $66 million in restructuring. The significant upside relative to our guidance was primarily driven by our continuous strong focus on working capital. We also delivered $0.76 in adjusted EPS in the fourth quarter and $2.66 per share in 2016 after repurchasing only 5 million shares in the first 9 months of the year.
In the fourth quarter, both Food Care and Diversey Care delivered organic sales growth of approximately and 3% adjusted EPS growth of 16%. In Food Care, protein packaging volumes in North America increased more than 6%. Our hygiene business increased sales in constant -- by 5% in constant dollars and we delivered favorable price/mix on a global basis. Diversey Care's growth was primarily driven by favorable price/mix of over 2% and volume increases of 7% and 3% in Asia Pacific and North America, respectively.
Where we fell short in the quarter was our top line constant dollar growth in Product Care, which weighed on our adjusted EBITDA performance. We knew December would be a critical month for us, with most of our global growth depending on our e-commerce business. And we were happy with our e-commerce volume growth of 15% in the quarter, but this was offset by weakness in global industrial GDP and our product rationalization efforts. And despite the shortfall in sales, adjusted EBITDA margins increased 80 basis points over the last year to 22.3%.
So as I'm sure you all know, I am not happy with our overall organic growth of 1.3% in 2016. We underestimated the impact of the economic and geopolitical environment in Latin America and the Middle East, the depth of the downcycle in the Australian beef market and the weakness in the industrial world. But at the same time, I'm very pleased with the agility of our organization, its ability to deliver bottom line results and properly prioritize. I'm also extremely pleased with the innovation pipelines and the number of new disruptive products that we are gradually introducing and launching across the 3 divisions.
Our total net sales outlook for 2017 of 2.5% constant dollar growth reflects approximately 3% of growth from -- for Food Care and Product Care and 1% for Diversey Care, which accounts for the short-term impact of the expiration of the brand licensing agreement with SC Johnson. Internally, the actions that we're taking to drive growth in 2017 are purposeful. We will leverage our strong global presence in Food Care and continue growing at a faster pace than the protein packaging markets. We will capitalize on the e-commerce opportunity with our disruptive technologies. And the underlying constant dollar sales growth for Diversey Care, excluding SCJ, is expected to be at an all-time high in 2017, and our plans to reveal our consumer brands business is very well underway.
We recognize that 2017 will prove to be a critical year for Sealed Air, particularly as we proceed with our plans for the separation of New Diversey. As you know, we disclosed back in October that we are pursuing a tax-free spin-off. And today, we announced that we are also exploring other strategic alternatives, including the potential sale of New Diversey, and we're confident that the separation is the appropriate next step in our company's transformation and will enable us to unlock meaningful value for customers and shareholders. At this point, we are very limited on what we can share about the separation process and thank you in advance for respecting our need to significantly limit our comments.
So now let me turn back on the fourth quarter and year-end performance. On Slide 5 and 6 of our presentation, you can see our performance by region for the fourth quarter and the full year.
In Q4, organic sales growth was 2% with positive trends across all regions. Organic growth in North America was driven by an increase of approximately 4% in volume. Constant dollar growth in Latin America was a result of our pricing efforts to offset currency devaluations. And in EMEA, positive trends in Food Care and Diversey Care were partially offset by declines in Product Care. And performance in Asia was very strong in Diversey Care at 7% constant dollar growth, but the total company's results were impacted by a 10% decline in Australia due to the beef market downcycle. Australia accounted for approximately 7% of Food Care net sales in the fourth quarter.
And for the full year 2016, net sales increased 1.3% as compared to 2015 on an organic basis. Constant dollar growth in Latin America was 9% and organic growth in EMEA was 2%. North America and Asia Pacific were essentially unchanged as compared to last year.
Turning to Slide 7, which highlights volume and price/mix trends by division and by region. You can see that from this slide that on a global basis, volume trends were flat to up 2% throughout the year. Let me highlight that our volume in North America has accelerated throughout the year with 4.2% growth in the fourth quarter on the heels of 3.8% in the third quarter. We delivered favorable price/mix in each quarter throughout 2016 as a result of positive trends in Food Care and Diversey Care.
Now let me turn to Slide 8 and review Food Care results. Positive volume trends in North America and EMEA, favorable price/mix and disciplined cost management were key contributors to our fourth quarter organic sales growth of 3% and adjusted EBITDA margin of 21%, an increase of 250 basis points over last year. We are seeing the benefit of higher beef volume and market share gains through the continued global adoption of our new products. Similar to the third quarter, these positive trends were offset by volume declines in Australia and Latin America.
For the full year 2016, Food Care delivered $3.2 billion in net sales or 2% organic sales growth. Packaging solutions were $2.6 billion and hygiene solutions were $600 million. In adjusted EBITDA, Food Care reported $661 million or 20.5% of net sales, packaging solutions delivered adjusted EBITDA of $593 million or 22.7% of net sales and hygiene delivered the remaining $68 million of EBITDA or 11.3% of net sales.
I'd like to highlight that the hygiene business has improved its margins by over 400 basis points on an as reported basis in 2013 and has a very bright future as part of New Diversey by providing market-leading solutions and technology advancement enhanced by acquisitions of Dry Lube and Ciptec.
For the full 2017, Food Care sales are forecasted to increase approximately 3% in constant dollars. Our core business is expected to continue growing faster than the market with more contribution from our Change the Game initiatives, particularly Optidur and Darfresh. Latin America is starting to stabilize and Australia will continue to be impacted by declines in the beef market also, to a lesser degree, as compared to 2016. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to increase at a faster pace than sales. And similar to 2016, we expect the Q1 to be our low point for sales and EBITDA.
Turning to Diversey Care's results on Slide 9. You can see that net sales were up 3% in constant dollars in the fourth quarter and up 2% for the full year. Adjusted EBITDA margins of 13% increased 180 basis points in the quarter and, for the full year, margins increased 120 basis points to 12.8%. Sales growth in the quarter and throughout the year was driven by increased sales from existing and new customers in North America, Europe and Asia Pacific. In Western Europe, most of our largest countries experienced positive constant sales growth. And in Asia Pacific, growth was led by strength in China, India and Southeast Asia. Throughout the Middle East and parts of Europe, the hospitality sector struggled in the second half as a result of declines in tourism and occupancy rates due to terrorist attacks.
In 2017, Diversey sales are expected to increase approximately 1% on a constant dollar basis, with adjusted EBITDA margins in line with 2016 results. And as I noted earlier, our plans are well underway to mitigate the impact of SCJ and sales from the core business, excluding SCJ, is growing at an accelerated pace. This growth is a direct result of the investments that we have made in our product portfolio, go-to-market strategy and sales organization.
Slide 10 highlights the results for our -- from our Product Care division. In the fourth quarter and full year, Product Care net sales on a constant dollar basis were essentially unchanged as compared to -- with 2015. Adjusted EBITDA margins increased 80 basis points to 22.3% in the quarter and 90 basis points to 21.8% in 2016.
In the fourth quarter, Product Care delivered strong volume trends in North America, which were partially offset by declines in Europe. Adjusting for product rationalization, North America volume were up approximately 5%, driven by strength in our e-commerce segment. And similar to the third quarter, our performance in Europe was negatively impacted by the industrial environments. And in the latter half of 2016, we have been introducing an unprecedented number of new technologies and solutions. And as a result, we are experiencing significant interest from our customers, which mainly you saw firsthand at PACK EXPO in -- many of you saw at PACK EXPO in early November. Sales for these products, including I-Pack, FloWrap, sales wrap, inflatable bubble and auto mailers are expected to ramp up in 2017 and contribute to both our top and bottom line growth. We will continue to invest heavily in the business to support new product launches and global growth opportunities as for -- but for our industrial base business, we are planning for sales to be relatively in line with 2016. And also keep in mind that our rationalization efforts are behind us, but that you will not see a true apples-to-apples constant dollar sales growth rate until the second half of 2017.
For the full year 2017, we anticipate year-over-year constant dollar sales to increase approximately 3%. And similar to product -- to Food Care, adjusted EBITDA is expected to increase at a faster pace than sales.
And now, let me pass the call to Carol to review our net sales and adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow and our -- more details on our outlook for 2017. Carol?"

We delivered $1.7 billion in net sales in the fourth quarter and $6.8 billion for the full year 2016. Volume contributed $26 million and",959,"Thank you, Jerome.
Turning to Slide 11, let me walk you through our net sales performance on a year-over-year basis. We delivered $1.7 billion in net sales in the fourth quarter and $6.8 billion for the full year 2016. Volume contributed $26 million and $50 million to top line growth in the quarter and for the full year, respectively. Favorable price/mix was $9 million in Q4 and $41 million for the year. Unfavorable currency translation was $40 million in the quarter and $243 million in 2016. Food Care divestitures impacted sales by $5 million in Q4 and $102 million for the full year.
On Slide 12, you can see that our adjusted EBITDA was $304 million or 17.5% of net sales in the fourth quarter and $1.16 billion or 17.1% for the full year. Mix and price/cost spread was $13 million favorable in Q4 and $46 million in 2016. Volume growth contributed $9 million to the quarter and $19 million for the year. Restructuring savings were $10 million and $43 million in Q4 and 2016, respectively. Operating expenses increased $6 million in the quarter. For the full year, operating expenses increased $69 million, most of which is related to compensation inflation. Currency was a negative $4 million in Q4 and a negative $35 million in 2016. For the full year, divestitures had a negative impact of $21 million on adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted gross margins improved 60 basis points in the fourth quarter and in the full year, resulting in 36.8% margin and 37.4% margin, respectively. We were pleased with this performance in light of the volatility of input cost and timing of raw material cost pass-throughs in Food Care. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.76 in the fourth quarter and $2.66 for the full year. Currency translation reduced EPS by $0.01 in the quarter and by $0.11 for the full year. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 18% and, for the full year, 21.6%. We repurchased 4.7 million shares for approximately $217 million in 2016. We still have approximately $667 million available under the board-approved share repurchase plan and expect to return to share buybacks following the New Diversey separation.
Turning to Slide 13. Free cash flow was a source of cash of $631 million. Working capital and other assets and liabilities were a source of cash of $151 million. CapEx increased to $276 million, which includes $100 million related to the investment in our Charlotte campus and $30 million related to other CapEx restructuring activity. CapEx in 2015 was $184 million.
As Jerome commented, the strong free cash flow performance was driven by optimization of our working capital, including the implementation of our new supply chain financing program. Our procurement team and our credit and collections team exceeded their targets for the fourth quarter, generating more than $80 million improvement above our prior guidance for free cash flow.
Now turning to outlook on Slide 14. In constant dollars, net sales are expected to increase approximately 2.5% for the full year 2017. This forecast assumes approximately 1% constant dollar growth for Diversey Care and approximately 3% growth for both Food Care and Product Care. While both volume and price/mix are expected to be contributors to 2017 growth, we expect more growth to come from accelerated volume trends throughout the year.
We estimate that currency translation will reduce net sales by approximately $220 million or 3%. Our major currency exposures in 2016 included the euro, which was approximately 18% of net sales; the British pound, which was 5%; Australian dollar was 4%; and the Brazilian real, Mexican peso and Canadian dollar were each approximately 3% of net sales.
2017 adjusted EBITDA is expected to be approximately $1.18 billion. Please note that contrary to last year, interest income of $10 million is excluded from our EBITDA guidance. Unfavorable currency translation is estimated to be approximately $40 million. As a reminder, a 5% swing in the euro has an impact of approximately $10 million on adjusted EBITDA.
Our medical and corporate expenses are expected to be a net expense of $90 million for the full year 2017. Our net interest expense for 2017 is estimated at $215 million. Depreciation and amortization is forecast to be approximately $275 million.
Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be approximately $2.70, assuming unfavorable currency translation of $0.14. We expect our adjusted tax rate to increase to approximately 23%, which will negatively impact year-over-year EPS by $0.05. Our forecast for EPS is based on a weighted average $197 million diluted shares.
We are forecasting free cash flow to be approximately $600 million in 2017. We expect working capital and other current assets and liabilities to be a source of cash as we continue to progress on inventory management and our supply chain financing program. Cash restructuring payments are estimated to be approximately $85 million to $100 million depending on the pace of addressing stranded costs. We expect to realize restructuring savings of approximately $40 million in 2017, with additional savings in 2018. Cash interest payments are expected to be $210 million. Cash tax payments are estimated to increase to $175 million. And CapEx is expected to return to a more normalized level of approximately $185 million.
Our outlook for free cash flow in 2017 does not include any material fees associated with the separation efforts of New Diversey. The cost associated with the separation is expected to be managed within existing programs and funds generated as a result of the separation.
That concludes our prepared remarks. Before I open the call to questions, I would like to remind you our first quarter 2017 earnings call is tentatively scheduled for Thursday, April 27.

Because in -- we didn't have a very strong -- or we didn't have much growth in the first half, a little bit in the third quarter. It'",936,"George, good question again. And no, I'm not happy. I'm not happy with the growth that we had and I am disappointed. Why? Because in -- we didn't have a very strong -- or we didn't have much growth in the first half, a little bit in the third quarter. It's improving somewhat in the fourth quarter, but it is not at the levels that I was expecting. And yes, indeed, we have been surprised by a few things.
Number one is the global GDP. You go to Bloomberg on February 2016 and you see that global GDP was forecasted at 2.4% and it ended up, global, ended up at 1.9%; with the U.S. at 2.4% also, which ended up also at 1.9%; and in Europe, which was forecasted at 1.9% and it is at 1.6%. And for 2017, the trend seems to be the same. Last year, '17 was seen to have a global GDP forecast for 2017 a year ago at 2.6% and today's projection is 2.3%. So we can't ignore these kind of things and what disappointed me is the lack of industrial GDP growth. In a world economy which had 1.9% global GDP growth, this is probably one of the worst years that we have experienced in many years actually. And it's always next year, which is supposed to be better, but you know what, we're not counting on it. And in our forecast at this point in time, we are considering that the industrial world is not going to be better. And if it comes as a good surprise, we'll be -- we'd love that.
Back in 20 -- in June of 2015 during Analyst Day, almost 2 years ago now or 18 months ago, we were seeing a macro world which was going to be better. The reality is that, in 2016, LATAM is much worse than -- has been much worse than we thought it was going to be. And again, industrial markets had been much softer. So that's how we plan.
What am I happy with? Very frankly, we have invested a lot of money in new products and in R&D and marketing to position new products. At PACK EXPO late October, we have shown and we have announced quite a few innovation which are going to be -- which are disruptive and are going to make an impact. But what you had seen at that time for several of those equipment, our products which -- it was the first production, so we did not launch -- we launched it at that time. And now, in 2017, we have to ramp up those things.
The thing that we all need to understand is that we're doing very different things that we were doing a few years ago. A few years ago, we were launching just simple products. Today, we're launching solutions, we're launching equipment razor/razor blade. Those are higher-margin products, but the issue of this is that it takes a little bit of -- the sales cycle is a little bit longer. When you work with meat processors and retail chains in Europe, in North America to establish Darfresh On Tray or those kind of extraordinary solutions which have a very, very clear megatrend, it just takes time. And we have talked about that. We have talked that with some of those relators that the cycle between the first time we talk about that -- about such a product or solution and the production or the go net produced after ordering the equipment set, this is 2 years. And it's the same on Product Care. One thing was to sell a little inflatable machine, another thing is to do operational excellence with our e-commerce partners and improve all the organization and show them how much value they can create out of sale wrap, FloWrap and I-Pack and those kind of things.
So I'm disappointed with the overall world economy support, extraordinarily excited which is why during the year 2016, we have invested so much money in R&D and in marketing to position those new solutions because I really believe that this is disruptive and our expected growth is probably delayed -- just has probably been delayed by a few quarters. But I'll conclude, because this is very key, that we have seen an acceleration of the volume growth in Sealed Air in the fourth quarter. We had the highest volume growth in Food Care of each -- of all the quarters in 20 -- in the fourth quarter, same for Diversey. And almost the same, we had a very strong third quarter in Product Care, but same -- almost the same in Product Care. So it's absolutely not doom and gloom, but we have to be realistic. And 2017 is going to be mostly about volume.
And talking about Diversey, let me remind you what I said earlier. It is going to be our fastest growth business -- fastest growth year if you exclude the short-term impact of the SCJ. And we told you why this agreement did not get renewed. It's that it was not fitting either company. We wanted access to wider market, to consumer market, to all kinds of do-it-yourself type of markets and SCJ didn't want that. And therefore, we agree to disagree.

If you want to have a number for comparison purposes, the interest income that was included in the adjusted EBITDA reported for 2016 is $13 million of positive interest income, and we'll reflect that change in Q1.
With respect to providing a range, we just felt that it was probably plainer to pick a point of the $1.18 billion and work towards at that. It helps with our modeling as well as yours and our investors to do that, so that's what we've done. And then, just -- we highlighted and called out the various moving pieces.

And should currency be better than the $40 million impact, we're going to be obviously happy about this. It is pretty choppy. Remember, the euro was at $1.03 four weeks ago or 3.5 weeks ago.

Generally speaking, what you have to consider is that our solution-based offering is having a higher margin because as we are creating, with some of our solutions, extraordinary value for our customers, we are in a mode of sharing those and we have growing examples of those. And when you take products like Optidur where you have less leakage at the production level where you have more additional sales because of the shine of the product and tightness in the vacuum; when you have Darfresh On Tray which reduces dramatically the shrink at the retailer level and it improves the shelf life and, therefore, the supply chain; when you have products like FloWrap and sales wrap whose number one benefit are -- in I-Pack, number one benefit is to reduce the shipping costs because they have less -- they generate less cube, this -- which is, by the way, in e-commerce, the number one cost. When you take the whole packaging operation, the number one cost is freight, is shipping cost.

Let me address the second part of your question first, which is the index. Yes, generally speaking, we can see some ratios which are hanging in there. The reality is that we have the bulk of our business, about 9 -- 85% of your business is in North America and is in Europe. And when you look at those 2 parts of the world and when you talk with our customers and, very frankly, on the industrial part, their exports and their business is suffering, and it's just sluggish. When you have the U.S. with a GDP of 1.9% all driven by consumers, you can call this an industrial GDP boom or these kind of things. And the bulk -- as I said, the bulk of our Product Care business is in North America and in Europe, so that's the way it is. Unfortunately, we have a large part of our Product Care business in there. Fortunately, we are growing very fast in the 3PL and e-commerce business. And the solution that we have are absolutely, second to none, disruptive and revolutionary that every time we are engaged with new customers, we are going through a whole process of new value being created and working on how we can go and get these kind of things done.
So if you -- and now addressing your first question, which was related to the margins of e-commerce versus industrial, yes, indeed, with our current portfolio, they are slightly lower. But with the solutions that we have shown at PACK EXPO, they are going to be definitely improving and not lagging our industrial business."

We see -- we had negative volume in Latin America, actually very negative in Brazil, positive in some other parts of Latin America, but for a total being negative. We are -- we believe that this is going to be stabilizing. When you look at the herd and the beef side for the cattle cycle, we are seeing that, specifically in Brazil, we are seeing that it has hit the trough in 2016. We believe that the first half of the year is going to be somewhat flattish and that it is going to start to improve in the second half of 2017.
When you look at Australia, 2017 is going to be lower than 2016. Again, we are following very closely the herd size. The herd size is being rebuilt in 2017. It is -- it has dramatically come down in 2016 for all the reasons that we talked about. And when you think about the herd in 2014, it was 29 million ahead and, in 2016, it was about 26.2 million. And this has been a huge reduction and the slaughter rate has dramatically decreased. We believe that it's going to continue in 2017 at a lower pace, but it's going to continue. And that definitely, as the herd is being rebuilt from 2016 in '17 and onwards towards 2021, we believe that the business in Australia, the slaughter rate is going to increase. And as you know, it is a positive from 2018.
So what we see is that, from 2018, we're going to have the 3 big parts of the world which are exporting, et cetera, which are Latin America, Australia and North America be on an up cycle, and that's going to be definitely very positive with us. To be noted also is that the exports out of Brazil are improving, but you have to remember that about 88% of the Brazilian beef exports are frozen and 12% are fresh. The good news is that fresh is expanding with the approval to export to the U.S. and will open to Asian markets as well.
So on Product Care, we think we have a huge momentum on 3PL and e-commerce. We are going to be showing more of the partnership agreement that we have during -- in the second quarter with very important ones, and so we're doing great things. It's going great. And we are going to be showing nice, we believe, nice growth in the 3PL e-commerce in North America. The European business has been negative in the fourth quarter, disappointing, definitely led by our industrial business in Europe. And -- but we -- the whole question is how do we mitigate, with e-commerce and 3PL, the flattish trend in industrial? And our view is that we shouldn't count on industrial increase in the second -- in 2017 and preserve our positions there. At the very same time, continue to aggressively grow the businesses where -- which have momentum and in which we're very disruptive."

Good morning, everyone.As you can see from our results, free cash flow and earnings per share performance were the highlights for the quarter and the year.

As you can see from our results, free cash flow and earnings per share performance were the highlights for the quarter and the year. We generated $631 million in free cash flow in 2016 and this was net of $276 million in CapEx and $66 million in restructuring. The significant upside relative to our guidance was primarily driven by our continuous strong focus on working capital. We also delivered $0.76 in adjusted EPS in the fourth quarter and $2.66 per share in 2016 after repurchasing only 5 million shares in the first 9 months of the year.
In the fourth quarter, both Food Care and Diversey Care delivered organic sales growth of approximately 3% and adjusted EPS growth of 16%. In Food Care, protein packaging volumes in North America increased more than 6%. Our hygiene business increased sales in constant -- by 5% in constant dollars and we delivered favorable price/mix on a global basis. Diversey Care's growth was primarily driven by favorable price/mix of over 2% and volume increases of 7% and 3% in Asia Pacific and North America, respectively.
Where we fell short in the quarter was our top line constant dollar growth in Product Care, which weighed on our adjusted EBITDA performance. We knew December would be a critical month for us, with most of our global growth depending on our e-commerce business. And we were happy with our e-commerce volume growth of 15% in the quarter, but this was offset by weakness in global industrial GDP and our product rationalization efforts. And despite the shortfall in sales, adjusted EBITDA margins increased 80 basis points over the last year to 22.3%.
So as I'm sure you all know, I am not happy with our overall organic growth of 1.3% in 2016. We underestimated the impact of the economic and geopolitical environment in Latin America and the Middle East, the depth of the downcycle in the Australian beef market and the weakness in the industrial world. But at the same time, I'm very pleased with the agility of our organization, its ability to deliver bottom line results and properly prioritize. I'm also extremely pleased with the innovation pipelines and the number of new disruptive products that we are gradually introducing and launching across the 3 divisions.
Our total net sales outlook for 2017 of 2.5% constant dollar growth reflects approximately 3% of growth from -- for Food Care and Product Care and 1% for Diversey Care, which accounts for the short-term impact of the expiration of the brand licensing agreement with SC Johnson. Internally, the actions that we're taking to drive growth in 2017 are purposeful. We will leverage our strong global presence in Food Care and continue growing at a faster pace than the protein packaging markets. We will capitalize on the e-commerce opportunity with our disruptive technologies. And the underlying constant dollar sales growth for Diversey Care, excluding SCJ, is expected to be at an all-time high in 2017, and our plans to reveal our consumer brands business is very well underway.
We recognize that 2017 will prove to be a critical year for Sealed Air, particularly as we proceed with our plans for the separation of New Diversey. As you know, we disclosed back in October that we are pursuing a tax-free spin-off. And today, we announced that we are also exploring other strategic alternatives, including the potential sale of New Diversey, and we're confident that the separation is the appropriate next step in our company's transformation and will enable us to unlock meaningful value for customers and shareholders. At this point, we are very limited on what we can share about the separation process and thank you in advance for respecting our need to significantly limit our comments.
So now let me turn back on the fourth quarter and year-end performance. On Slide 5 and 6 of our presentation, you can see our performance by region for the fourth quarter and the full year.
In Q4, organic sales growth was 2% with positive trends across all regions. Organic growth in North America was driven by an increase of approximately 4% in volume. Constant dollar growth in Latin America was a result of our pricing efforts to offset currency devaluations. And in EMEA, positive trends in Food Care and Diversey Care were partially offset by declines in Product Care. And performance in Asia was very strong in Diversey Care at 7% constant dollar growth, but the total company's results were impacted by a 10% decline in Australia due to the beef market downcycle. Australia accounted for approximately 7% of Food Care net sales in the fourth quarter.
And for the full year 2016, net sales increased 1.3% as compared to 2015 on an organic basis. Constant dollar growth in Latin America was 9% and organic growth in EMEA was 2%. North America and Asia Pacific were essentially unchanged as compared to last year.
Turning to Slide 7, which highlights volume and price/mix trends by division and by region. You can see that from this slide that on a global basis, volume trends were flat to up 2% throughout the year. Let me highlight that our volume in North America has accelerated throughout the year with 4.2% growth in the fourth quarter on the heels of 3.8% in the third quarter. We delivered favorable price/mix in each quarter throughout 2016 as a result of positive trends in Food Care and Diversey Care.
Now let me turn to Slide 8 and review Food Care results. Positive volume trends in North America and EMEA, favorable price/mix and disciplined cost management were key contributors to our fourth quarter organic sales growth of 3% and adjusted EBITDA margin of 21%, an increase of 250 basis points over last year. We are seeing the benefit of higher beef volume and market share gains through the continued global adoption of our new products. Similar to the third quarter, these positive trends were offset by volume declines in Australia and Latin America.
For the full year 2016, Food Care delivered $3.2 billion in net sales or 2% organic sales growth. Packaging solutions were $2.6 billion and hygiene solutions were $600 million. In adjusted EBITDA, Food Care reported $661 million or 20.5% of net sales, packaging solutions delivered adjusted EBITDA of $593 million or 22.7% of net sales and hygiene delivered the remaining $68 million of EBITDA or 11.3% of net sales.
I'd like to highlight that the hygiene business has improved its margins by over 400 basis points on an as-reported basis in 2013 and has a very bright future as part of New Diversey by providing market-leading solutions and technology advancement enhanced by acquisitions of Dry Lube and Ciptec.
For the full 2017, Food Care sales are forecasted to increase approximately 3% in constant dollars. Our core business is expected to continue growing faster than the market with more contribution from our Change the Game initiatives, particularly Optidur and Darfresh. Latin America is starting to stabilize and Australia will continue to be impacted by declines in the beef market also, to a lesser degree, as compared to 2016. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to increase at a faster pace than sales. And similar to 2016, we expect the Q1 to be our low point for sales and EBITDA.
Turning to Diversey Care's results on Slide 9. You can see that net sales were up 3% in constant dollars in the fourth quarter and up 2% for the full year. Adjusted EBITDA margins of 13% increased 180 basis points in the quarter and, for the full year, margins increased 120 basis points to 12.8%. Sales growth in the quarter and throughout the year was driven by increased sales from existing and new customers in North America, Europe and Asia Pacific. In Western Europe, most of our largest countries experienced positive constant sales growth. And in Asia Pacific, growth was led by strength in China, India and Southeast Asia. Throughout the Middle East and parts of Europe, the hospitality sector struggled in the second half as a result of declines in tourism and occupancy rates due to terrorist attacks.
In 2017, Diversey sales are expected to increase approximately 1% on a constant dollar basis, with adjusted EBITDA margins in line with 2016 results. And as I noted earlier, our plans are well underway to mitigate the impact of SCJ and sales from the core business, excluding SCJ, is growing at an accelerated pace. This growth is a direct result of the investments that we have made in our product portfolio, go-to-market strategy and sales organization.
Slide 10 highlights the results for our -- from our Product Care division. In the fourth quarter and full year, Product Care net sales on a constant dollar basis were essentially unchanged as compared to -- with 2015. Adjusted EBITDA margins increased 80 basis points to 22.3% in the quarter and 90 basis points to 21.8% in 2016.
In the fourth quarter, Product Care delivered strong volume trends in North America, which were partially offset by declines in Europe. Adjusting for product rationalization, North America volume were up approximately 5%, driven by strength in our e-commerce segment. And similar to the third quarter, our performance in Europe was negatively impacted by the industrial environment. And in the latter half of 2016, we have been introducing an unprecedented number of new technologies and solutions. And as a result, we are experiencing significant interest from our customers, which mainly you saw firsthand at PACK EXPO in -- many of you saw at PACK EXPO in early November. Sales for these products, including I-Pack, FloWrap, StealthWrap, inflatable bubble and auto mailers, are expected to ramp up in 2017 and contribute to both our top and bottom line growth. We will continue to invest heavily in the business to support new product launches and global growth opportunity. As for -- but for our industrial base business, we are planning for sales to be relatively in line with 2016. And also keep in mind that our rationalization efforts are behind us, but that you will not see a true apples-to-apples constant dollar sales growth rate until the second half of 2017.
For the full year 2017, we anticipate year-over-year constant dollar sales to increase approximately 3%. And similar to product -- to Food Care, adjusted EBITDA is expected to increase at a faster pace than sales.
And now, let me pass the call to Carol to review our net sales and adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow and our -- more details on our outlook for 2017. Carol?"

Turning to Slide 11, let me walk you through our net sales performance on a year-over-year basis. We delivered $1.7 billion in net sales in the fourth quarter and $6.8 billion for the full year 2016. Volume contributed $26 million and $50 million to top line growth in the quarter and for the full year, respectively. Favorable price/mix was $9 million in Q4 and $41 million for the year. Unfavorable currency translation was $40 million in the quarter and $243 million in 2016. Food Care divestitures impacted sales by $5 million in Q4 and $102 million for the full year.
On Slide 12, you can see that our adjusted EBITDA was $304 million or 17.5% of net sales in the fourth quarter and $1.16 billion or 17.1% for the full year. Mix and price/cost spread was $13 million favorable in Q4 and $46 million in 2016. Volume growth contributed $9 million to the quarter and $19 million for the year. Restructuring savings were $10 million and $43 million in Q4 and 2016, respectively. Operating expenses increased $6 million in the quarter. For the full year, operating expenses increased $69 million, most of which is related to compensation inflation. Currency was a negative $4 million in Q4 and a negative $35 million in 2016. For the full year, divestitures had a negative impact of $21 million on adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted gross margins improved 60 basis points in the fourth quarter and in the full year, resulting in 36.8% margin and 37.4% margin, respectively. We were pleased with this performance in light of the volatility of input cost and timing of raw material cost pass-throughs in Food Care. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.76 in the fourth quarter and $2.66 for the full year. Currency translation reduced EPS by $0.01 in the quarter and by $0.11 for the full year. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 18% and, for the full year, 21.6%. We repurchased 4.7 million shares for approximately $217 million in 2016. We still have approximately $667 million available under the board-approved share repurchase plan and expect to return to share buybacks following the New Diversey separation.
Turning to Slide 13. Free cash flow was a source of cash of $631 million. Working capital and other assets and liabilities were a source of cash of $151 million. CapEx increased to $276 million, which includes $100 million related to the investment in our Charlotte campus and $30 million related to other CapEx restructuring activity. CapEx in 2015 was $184 million.
As Jerome commented, the strong free cash flow performance was driven by optimization of our working capital, including the implementation of our new supply chain financing program. Our procurement team and our credit and collections team exceeded their targets for the fourth quarter, generating more than $80 million improvement above our prior guidance for free cash flow.
Now turning to outlook on Slide 14. In constant dollars, net sales are expected to increase approximately 2.5% for the full year 2017. This forecast assumes approximately 1% constant dollar growth for Diversey Care and approximately 3% growth for both Food Care and Product Care. While both volume and price/mix are expected to be contributors to 2017 growth, we expect more growth to come from accelerated volume trends throughout the year.
We estimate that currency translation will reduce net sales by approximately $220 million or 3%. Our major currency exposures in 2016 included the euro, which was approximately 18% of net sales; the British pound, which was 5%; Australian dollar was 4%; and the Brazilian real, Mexican peso and Canadian dollar were each approximately 3% of net sales.
2017 adjusted EBITDA is expected to be approximately $1.18 billion. Please note that contrary to last year, interest income of $10 million is excluded from our EBITDA guidance. Unfavorable currency translation is estimated to be approximately $40 million. As a reminder, a 5% swing in the euro has an impact of approximately $10 million on adjusted EBITDA.
Our medical and corporate expenses are expected to be a net expense of $90 million for the full year 2017. Our net interest expense for 2017 is estimated at $215 million. Depreciation and amortization is forecast to be approximately $275 million.
Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be approximately $2.70, assuming unfavorable currency translation of $0.14. We expect our adjusted tax rate to increase to approximately 23%, which will negatively impact year-over-year EPS by $0.05. Our forecast for EPS is based on a weighted average $197 million diluted shares.
We are forecasting free cash flow to be approximately $600 million in 2017. We expect working capital and other current assets and liabilities to be a source of cash as we continue to progress on inventory management and our supply chain financing program. Cash restructuring payments are estimated to be approximately $85 million to $100 million depending on the pace of addressing stranded costs. We expect to realize restructuring savings of approximately $40 million in 2017, with additional savings in 2018. Cash interest payments are expected to be $210 million. Cash tax payments are estimated to increase to $175 million. And CapEx is expected to return to a more normalized level of approximately $185 million.
Our outlook for free cash flow in 2017 does not include any material fees associated with the separation efforts of New Diversey. The cost associated with the separation is expected to be managed within existing programs and funds generated as a result of the separation.
That concludes our prepared remarks. Before I open the call to questions, I would like to remind you our first quarter 2017 earnings call is tentatively scheduled for Thursday, April 27.

I'm not happy with the growth that we had and I am disappointed. Why? Because in -- we didn't have a very strong -- or we didn't have much growth in the first half, a little bit in the third quarter. It's improving somewhat in the fourth quarter, but it is not at the levels that I was expecting. And yes, indeed, we have been surprised by a few things.
Number one is the global GDP. You go to Bloomberg on February 2016 and you see that global GDP was forecasted at 2.4% and it ended up, global, ended up at 1.9%; with the U.S. at 2.4% also, which ended up also at 1.9%; and in Europe, which was forecasted at 1.9% and it is at 1.6%. And for 2017, the trend seems to be the same. Last year, '17 was seen to have a global GDP forecast for 2017 a year ago at 2.6% and today's projection is 2.3%. So we can't ignore those kind of things and what disappointed me is the lack of industrial GDP growth. In a world economy which had 1.9% global GDP growth, this is probably one of the worst years that we have experienced in many years actually. And it's always next year, which is supposed to be better, but we're not counting on it. And in our forecast at this point in time, we are considering that the industrial world is not going to be better. And if it comes as a good surprise, we'll be -- we'd love that.
Back in 20 -- in June 2015 during Analyst Day, almost 2 years ago now or 18 months ago, we were seeing a macro world which was going to be better. The reality is that, in 2016, LATAM is much worse than -- has been much worse than we thought it was going to be. And again, industrial markets had been much softer. So that's how we plan.
What am I happy with? Very frankly, we have invested a lot of money in new products and in R&D and marketing to position new products. At PACK EXPO late October, we have shown and we have announced quite a few innovations which are going to be -- which are disruptive and are going to make an impact. But what you had seen at that time for several of those equipment, our products which -- it was the first production, so we did not launch -- we launched it at that time. And now, in 2017, we have to ramp up those things.
The thing that we all need to understand is that we're doing very different things that we were doing a few years ago. A few years ago, we were launching just simple products. Today, we're launching solutions, we're launching equipment razor/razor blade. Those are higher-margin products, but the issue of this is that it takes a little bit of -- the sales cycle is a little bit longer. When you work with meat processors and retail chains in Europe, in North America to establish Darfresh On Tray or those kind of extraordinary solutions which have a very, very clear megatrend, it just takes time. And we have talked about that. We have talked that with some of those relators that the cycle between the first time we talk about that -- about such a product or solution and the production or the go net produced after ordering the equipment set, this is 2 years. And it's the same on Product Care. One thing was to sell a little inflatable machine, another thing is to do operational excellence with our e-commerce partners and improve all the organization and show them how much value they can create out of StealthWrap, FloWrap and I-Pack and those kind of things.
So I'm disappointed with the overall world economy support, extraordinarily excited which is why during the year 2016, we have invested so much money in R&D and in marketing to position those new solutions because I really believe that this is disruptive and our expected growth is probably delayed -- just has probably been delayed by a few quarters. But I'll conclude, because this is very key, that we have seen an acceleration of the volume growth in Sealed Air in the fourth quarter. We had the highest volume growth in Food Care of each -- of all the quarters in 20 -- in the fourth quarter, same for Diversey. And almost the same, we had a very strong third quarter in Product Care, but same -- almost the same in Product Care. So it's absolutely not doom and gloom, but we have to be realistic. And 2017 is going to be mostly about volume.
And talking about Diversey, let me remind you what I said earlier. It is going to be our fastest growth business -- fastest growth year if you exclude the short-term impact of the SCJ. And we told you why this agreement did not get renewed. It's that it was not fitting either company. We wanted access to wider market, to consumer market, to all kinds of do-it-yourself type of markets and SCJ didn't want that. And therefore, we agree to disagree. Yes, it does have a short-term impact, but this was really the right thing to do for the company. We have lots of great plans in place. And you're going to see, outside of this SCJ business, we're going to have the highest growth that we ever had in Diversey Care."

If you want to have a number for comparison purposes, the interest income that was included in the adjusted EBITDA reported for 2016 is $13 million of positive interest income, and we'll reflect that change in Q1.
With respect to providing a range, we just felt that it was probably plainer to pick a point of the $1.18 billion and work towards that. It helps with our modeling as well as yours and our investors to do that, so that's what we've done. And then, just -- we highlighted and called out the various moving pieces.

And then, next to that, you have a very transparent explanation of flat Diversey Care in terms of EBITDA for the simple reason -- constant currency -- flat EBITDA for the simple reason that we have a temporary situation with this consumer goods contract. And this converts to a double-digit EBITDA growth in constant currency every single year in the last 4 years in Diversey Care. So that's what's going on. And should currency be better than the $40 million impact, we're going to be obviously happy about this. It is pretty choppy. Remember, the euro was at $1.03 four weeks ago or 3.5 weeks ago.

When you take the whole packaging operation, the No. 1 cost is freight, is shipping cost.

Let me address the second part of your question first, which is the index. Yes, in general speaking, we can see some ratios which are hanging in there. The reality is that we have the bulk of our business, about 9 -- 85% of our business is in North America and is in Europe. And when you look at those 2 parts of the world and when you talk with our customers and, very frankly, on the industrial part, their exports and their business is suffering, and it's just sluggish. When you have the U.S. with a GDP of 1.9% all driven by consumers, you can call this an industrial GDP boom or these kind of things. And the bulk -- as I said, the bulk of our Product Care business is in North America and in Europe, so that's the way it is. Unfortunately, we have a large part of our Product Care business in there. Fortunately, we are growing very fast in the 3PL and e-commerce business. And the solution that we have are absolutely, second to none, disruptive and revolutionary that every time we are engaged with new customers, we are going through a whole process of new value being created and working on how we can go and get these kind of things done.
So if you -- and now addressing your first question, which was related to the margins of e-commerce versus industrial, yes, indeed, with our current portfolio, they are slightly lower. But with the solutions that we have shown at PACK EXPO, they are going to be definitely improving and not lagging our industrial business."

We see -- we had negative volume in Latin America, actually very negative in Brazil, positive in some other parts of Latin America, but for a total being negative. We are -- we believe that this is going to be stabilizing. When we look at the herd and the beef cycle, the cattle cycle, we are seeing that, specifically in Brazil, we are seeing that it has hit the trough in 2016. We believe that the first half of the year is going to be somewhat flattish and that it is going to start to improve in the second half of 2017.
When you look at Australia, 2017 is going to be lower than 2016. Again, we are following very closely the herd size. The herd size is being rebuilt in 2017. It is -- it has dramatically come down in 2016 for all the reasons that we talked about. And when you think about the herd in 2014, it was 29 million ahead and, in 2016, it was about 26.2 million. And this has been a huge reduction and the slaughter rate has dramatically decreased. We believe that it's going to continue in 2017 at a lower pace, but is going to continue. And that definitely, as the herd is being rebuilt from 2016, in '17 and onwards towards 2021, we believe that the business in Australia, the slaughter rate is going to increase. And as you know, it is a positive from 2018.
So what we see is that, from 2018, we're going to have the 3 big parts of the world which are exporting, et cetera, which are Latin America, Australia and North America, be on an up cycle, and that's going to be definitely very positive with us. To be noted also is that the exports out of Brazil are improving, but you have to remember that about 88% of the Brazilian beef exports are frozen and 12% are fresh. The good news is that fresh is expanding with the approval to export to the U.S. and will open to Asian markets as well.
So on Product Care, we think we have a huge momentum on 3PL and e-commerce. We are going to be showing more of the partnership agreement that we have during -- in the second quarter with very important ones, and so we're doing great things. It's going great. And we are going to be showing nice, we believe, nice growth in the 3PL e-commerce in North America. The European business has been negative in the fourth quarter, disappointing, definitely led by our industrial business in Europe. And -- but we -- the whole question is how do we mitigate, with e-commerce and 3PL, the flattish trend in industrial? And our view is that we shouldn't count on industrial increase in the second -- in 2017 and preserve our positions there. At the very same time, continue to aggressively grow the businesses where -- which have momentum and in which we're very disruptive."

Good morning, everyone.As you can see from our results, free cash flow and earnings per share performance were the highlights for the quarter and the year. We generated $631 million in free cash flow in 2016 and this was net of $276 mil",1768,"Thank you, Lori. Good morning, everyone.
As you can see from our results, free cash flow and earnings per share performance were the highlights for the quarter and the year. We generated $631 million in free cash flow in 2016 and this was net of $276 million in CapEx and $66 million in restructuring. The significant upside relative to our guidance was primarily driven by our continuous strong focus on working capital. We also delivered $0.76 in adjusted EPS in the fourth quarter and $2.66 per share in 2016 after repurchasing only 5 million shares in the first 9 months of the year.
In the fourth quarter, both Food Care and Diversey Care delivered organic sales growth of approximately 3% and adjusted EPS growth of 16%. In Food Care, protein packaging volumes in North America increased more than 6%. Our hygiene business increased sales in constant -- by 5% in constant dollars and we delivered favorable price/mix on a global basis. Diversey Care's growth was primarily driven by favorable price/mix of over 2% and volume increases of 7% and 3% in Asia Pacific and North America, respectively.
Where we fell short in the quarter was our top line constant dollar growth in Product Care, which weighed on our adjusted EBITDA performance. We knew December would be a critical month for us, with most of our global growth depending on our e-commerce business. And we were happy with our e-commerce volume growth of 15% in the quarter, but this was offset by weakness in global industrial GDP and our product rationalization efforts. And despite the shortfall in sales, adjusted EBITDA margins increased 80 basis points over the last year to 22.3%.
So as I'm sure you all know, I am not happy with our overall organic growth of 1.3% in 2016. We underestimated the impact of the economic and geopolitical environment in Latin America and the Middle East, the depth of the downcycle in the Australian beef market and the weakness in the industrial world. But at the same time, I'm very pleased with the agility of our organization, its ability to deliver bottom line results and properly prioritize. I'm also extremely pleased with the innovation pipelines and the number of new disruptive products that we are gradually introducing and launching across the 3 divisions.
Our total net sales outlook for 2017 of 2.5% constant dollar growth reflects approximately 3% of growth from -- for Food Care and Product Care and 1% for Diversey Care, which accounts for the short-term impact of the expiration of the brand licensing agreement with SC Johnson. Internally, the actions that we're taking to drive growth in 2017 are purposeful. We will leverage our strong global presence in Food Care and continue growing at a faster pace than the protein packaging markets. We will capitalize on the e-commerce opportunity with our disruptive technologies. And the underlying constant dollar sales growth for Diversey Care, excluding SCJ, is expected to be at an all-time high in 2017, and our plans to reveal our consumer brands business is very well underway.
We recognize that 2017 will prove to be a critical year for Sealed Air, particularly as we proceed with our plans for the separation of New Diversey. As you know, we disclosed back in October that we are pursuing a tax-free spin-off. And today, we announced that we are also exploring other strategic alternatives, including the potential sale of New Diversey, and we're confident that the separation is the appropriate next step in our company's transformation and will enable us to unlock meaningful value for customers and shareholders. At this point, we are very limited on what we can share about the separation process and thank you in advance for respecting our need to significantly limit our comments.
So now let me turn back on the fourth quarter and year-end performance. On Slide 5 and 6 of our presentation, you can see our performance by region for the fourth quarter and the full year.
In Q4, organic sales growth was 2% with positive trends across all regions. Organic growth in North America was driven by an increase of approximately 4% in volume. Constant dollar growth in Latin America was a result of our pricing efforts to offset currency devaluations. And in EMEA, positive trends in Food Care and Diversey Care were partially offset by declines in Product Care. And performance in Asia was very strong in Diversey Care at 7% constant dollar growth, but the total company's results were impacted by a 10% decline in Australia due to the beef market downcycle. Australia accounted for approximately 7% of Food Care net sales in the fourth quarter.
And for the full year 2016, net sales increased 1.3% as compared to 2015 on an organic basis. Constant dollar growth in Latin America was 9% and organic growth in EMEA was 2%. North America and Asia Pacific were essentially unchanged as compared to last year.
Turning to Slide 7, which highlights volume and price/mix trends by division and by region. You can see that from this slide that on a global basis, volume trends were flat to up 2% throughout the year. Let me highlight that our volume in North America has accelerated throughout the year with 4.2% growth in the fourth quarter on the heels of 3.8% in the third quarter. We delivered favorable price/mix in each quarter throughout 2016 as a result of positive trends in Food Care and Diversey Care.
Now let me turn to Slide 8 and review Food Care results. Positive volume trends in North America and EMEA, favorable price/mix and disciplined cost management were key contributors to our fourth quarter organic sales growth of 3% and adjusted EBITDA margin of 21%, an increase of 250 basis points over last year. We are seeing the benefit of higher beef volume and market share gains through the continued global adoption of our new products. Similar to the third quarter, these positive trends were offset by volume declines in Australia and Latin America.
For the full year 2016, Food Care delivered $3.2 billion in net sales or 2% organic sales growth. Packaging solutions were $2.6 billion and hygiene solutions were $600 million. In adjusted EBITDA, Food Care reported $661 million or 20.5% of net sales, packaging solutions delivered adjusted EBITDA of $593 million or 22.7% of net sales and hygiene delivered the remaining $68 million of EBITDA or 11.3% of net sales.
I'd like to highlight that the hygiene business has improved its margins by over 400 basis points on an as-reported basis in 2013 and has a very bright future as part of New Diversey by providing market-leading solutions and technology advancement enhanced by acquisitions of Dry Lube and Ciptec.
For the full 2017, Food Care sales are forecasted to increase approximately 3% in constant dollars. Our core business is expected to continue growing faster than the market with more contribution from our Change the Game initiatives, particularly Optidur and Darfresh. Latin America is starting to stabilize and Australia will continue to be impacted by declines in the beef market also, to a lesser degree, as compared to 2016. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to increase at a faster pace than sales. And similar to 2016, we expect the Q1 to be our low point for sales and EBITDA.
Turning to Diversey Care's results on Slide 9. You can see that net sales were up 3% in constant dollars in the fourth quarter and up 2% for the full year. Adjusted EBITDA margins of 13% increased 180 basis points in the quarter and, for the full year, margins increased 120 basis points to 12.8%. Sales growth in the quarter and throughout the year was driven by increased sales from existing and new customers in North America, Europe and Asia Pacific. In Western Europe, most of our largest countries experienced positive constant sales growth. And in Asia Pacific, growth was led by strength in China, India and Southeast Asia. Throughout the Middle East and parts of Europe, the hospitality sector struggled in the second half as a result of declines in tourism and occupancy rates due to terrorist attacks.
In 2017, Diversey sales are expected to increase approximately 1% on a constant dollar basis, with adjusted EBITDA margins in line with 2016 results. And as I noted earlier, our plans are well underway to mitigate the impact of SCJ and sales from the core business, excluding SCJ, is growing at an accelerated pace. This growth is a direct result of the investments that we have made in our product portfolio, go-to-market strategy and sales organization.
Slide 10 highlights the results for our -- from our Product Care division. In the fourth quarter and full year, Product Care net sales on a constant dollar basis were essentially unchanged as compared to -- with 2015. Adjusted EBITDA margins increased 80 basis points to 22.3% in the quarter and 90 basis points to 21.8% in 2016.
In the fourth quarter, Product Care delivered strong volume trends in North America, which were partially offset by declines in Europe. Adjusting for product rationalization, North America volume were up approximately 5%, driven by strength in our e-commerce segment. And similar to the third quarter, our performance in Europe was negatively impacted by the industrial environment. And in the latter half of 2016, we have been introducing an unprecedented number of new technologies and solutions. And as a result, we are experiencing significant interest from our customers, which mainly you saw firsthand at PACK EXPO in -- many of you saw at PACK EXPO in early November. Sales for these products, including I-Pack, FloWrap, StealthWrap, inflatable bubble and auto mailers, are expected to ramp up in 2017 and contribute to both our top and bottom line growth. We will continue to invest heavily in the business to support new product launches and global growth opportunity. As for -- but for our industrial base business, we are planning for sales to be relatively in line with 2016. And also keep in mind that our rationalization efforts are behind us, but that you will not see a true apples-to-apples constant dollar sales growth rate until the second half of 2017.
For the full year 2017, we anticipate year-over-year constant dollar sales to increase approximately 3%. And similar to product -- to Food Care, adjusted EBITDA is expected to increase at a faster pace than sales.
And now, let me pass the call to Carol to review our net sales and adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow and our -- more details on our outlook for 2017. Carol?"

We delivered $1.7 billion in net sales in the fourth quarter and $6.8 billion for the full year 2016. Volume contributed $26 million and",959,"Thank you, Jerome.
Turning to Slide 11, let me walk you through our net sales performance on a year-over-year basis. We delivered $1.7 billion in net sales in the fourth quarter and $6.8 billion for the full year 2016. Volume contributed $26 million and $50 million to top line growth in the quarter and for the full year, respectively. Favorable price/mix was $9 million in Q4 and $41 million for the year. Unfavorable currency translation was $40 million in the quarter and $243 million in 2016. Food Care divestitures impacted sales by $5 million in Q4 and $102 million for the full year.
On Slide 12, you can see that our adjusted EBITDA was $304 million or 17.5% of net sales in the fourth quarter and $1.16 billion or 17.1% for the full year. Mix and price/cost spread was $13 million favorable in Q4 and $46 million in 2016. Volume growth contributed $9 million to the quarter and $19 million for the year. Restructuring savings were $10 million and $43 million in Q4 and 2016, respectively. Operating expenses increased $6 million in the quarter. For the full year, operating expenses increased $69 million, most of which is related to compensation inflation. Currency was a negative $4 million in Q4 and a negative $35 million in 2016. For the full year, divestitures had a negative impact of $21 million on adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted gross margins improved 60 basis points in the fourth quarter and in the full year, resulting in 36.8% margin and 37.4% margin, respectively. We were pleased with this performance in light of the volatility of input cost and timing of raw material cost pass-throughs in Food Care. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.76 in the fourth quarter and $2.66 for the full year. Currency translation reduced EPS by $0.01 in the quarter and by $0.11 for the full year. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 18% and, for the full year, 21.6%. We repurchased 4.7 million shares for approximately $217 million in 2016. We still have approximately $667 million available under the board-approved share repurchase plan and expect to return to share buybacks following the New Diversey separation.
Turning to Slide 13. Free cash flow was a source of cash of $631 million. Working capital and other assets and liabilities were a source of cash of $151 million. CapEx increased to $276 million, which includes $100 million related to the investment in our Charlotte campus and $30 million related to other CapEx restructuring activity. CapEx in 2015 was $184 million.
As Jerome commented, the strong free cash flow performance was driven by optimization of our working capital, including the implementation of our new supply chain financing program. Our procurement team and our credit and collections team exceeded their targets for the fourth quarter, generating more than $80 million improvement above our prior guidance for free cash flow.
Now turning to outlook on Slide 14. In constant dollars, net sales are expected to increase approximately 2.5% for the full year 2017. This forecast assumes approximately 1% constant dollar growth for Diversey Care and approximately 3% growth for both Food Care and Product Care. While both volume and price/mix are expected to be contributors to 2017 growth, we expect more growth to come from accelerated volume trends throughout the year.
We estimate that currency translation will reduce net sales by approximately $220 million or 3%. Our major currency exposures in 2016 included the euro, which was approximately 18% of net sales; the British pound, which was 5%; Australian dollar was 4%; and the Brazilian real, Mexican peso and Canadian dollar were each approximately 3% of net sales.
2017 adjusted EBITDA is expected to be approximately $1.18 billion. Please note that contrary to last year, interest income of $10 million is excluded from our EBITDA guidance. Unfavorable currency translation is estimated to be approximately $40 million. As a reminder, a 5% swing in the euro has an impact of approximately $10 million on adjusted EBITDA.
Our medical and corporate expenses are expected to be a net expense of $90 million for the full year 2017. Our net interest expense for 2017 is estimated at $215 million. Depreciation and amortization is forecast to be approximately $275 million.
Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be approximately $2.70, assuming unfavorable currency translation of $0.14. We expect our adjusted tax rate to increase to approximately 23%, which will negatively impact year-over-year EPS by $0.05. Our forecast for EPS is based on a weighted average $197 million diluted shares.
We are forecasting free cash flow to be approximately $600 million in 2017. We expect working capital and other current assets and liabilities to be a source of cash as we continue to progress on inventory management and our supply chain financing program. Cash restructuring payments are estimated to be approximately $85 million to $100 million depending on the pace of addressing stranded costs. We expect to realize restructuring savings of approximately $40 million in 2017, with additional savings in 2018. Cash interest payments are expected to be $210 million. Cash tax payments are estimated to increase to $175 million. And CapEx is expected to return to a more normalized level of approximately $185 million.
Our outlook for free cash flow in 2017 does not include any material fees associated with the separation efforts of New Diversey. The cost associated with the separation is expected to be managed within existing programs and funds generated as a result of the separation.
That concludes our prepared remarks. Before I open the call to questions, I would like to remind you our first quarter 2017 earnings call is tentatively scheduled for Thursday, April 27.

Because in -- we didn't have a very strong -- or we didn't have much growth in the first half, a little bit in the third quarter. It'",931,"George, good question again. And no, I'm not happy. I'm not happy with the growth that we had and I am disappointed. Why? Because in -- we didn't have a very strong -- or we didn't have much growth in the first half, a little bit in the third quarter. It's improving somewhat in the fourth quarter, but it is not at the levels that I was expecting. And yes, indeed, we have been surprised by a few things.
Number one is the global GDP. You go to Bloomberg on February 2016 and you see that global GDP was forecasted at 2.4% and it ended up, global, ended up at 1.9%; with the U.S. at 2.4% also, which ended up also at 1.9%; and in Europe, which was forecasted at 1.9% and it is at 1.6%. And for 2017, the trend seems to be the same. Last year, '17 was seen to have a global GDP forecast for 2017 a year ago at 2.6% and today's projection is 2.3%. So we can't ignore those kind of things and what disappointed me is the lack of industrial GDP growth. In a world economy which had 1.9% global GDP growth, this is probably one of the worst years that we have experienced in many years actually. And it's always next year, which is supposed to be better, but we're not counting on it. And in our forecast at this point in time, we are considering that the industrial world is not going to be better. And if it comes as a good surprise, we'll be -- we'd love that.
Back in 20 -- in June 2015 during Analyst Day, almost 2 years ago now or 18 months ago, we were seeing a macro world which was going to be better. The reality is that, in 2016, LATAM is much worse than -- has been much worse than we thought it was going to be. And again, industrial markets had been much softer. So that's how we plan.
What am I happy with? Very frankly, we have invested a lot of money in new products and in R&D and marketing to position new products. At PACK EXPO late October, we have shown and we have announced quite a few innovations which are going to be -- which are disruptive and are going to make an impact. But what you had seen at that time for several of those equipment, our products which -- it was the first production, so we did not launch -- we launched it at that time. And now, in 2017, we have to ramp up those things.
The thing that we all need to understand is that we're doing very different things that we were doing a few years ago. A few years ago, we were launching just simple products. Today, we're launching solutions, we're launching equipment razor/razor blade. Those are higher-margin products, but the issue of this is that it takes a little bit of -- the sales cycle is a little bit longer. When you work with meat processors and retail chains in Europe, in North America to establish Darfresh On Tray or those kind of extraordinary solutions which have a very, very clear megatrend, it just takes time. And we have talked about that. We have talked that with some of those relators that the cycle between the first time we talk about that -- about such a product or solution and the production or the go net produced after ordering the equipment set, this is 2 years. And it's the same on Product Care. One thing was to sell a little inflatable machine, another thing is to do operational excellence with our e-commerce partners and improve all the organization and show them how much value they can create out of StealthWrap, FloWrap and I-Pack and those kind of things.
So I'm disappointed with the overall world economy support, extraordinarily excited which is why during the year 2016, we have invested so much money in R&D and in marketing to position those new solutions because I really believe that this is disruptive and our expected growth is probably delayed -- just has probably been delayed by a few quarters. But I'll conclude, because this is very key, that we have seen an acceleration of the volume growth in Sealed Air in the fourth quarter. We had the highest volume growth in Food Care of each -- of all the quarters in 20 -- in the fourth quarter, same for Diversey. And almost the same, we had a very strong third quarter in Product Care, but same -- almost the same in Product Care. So it's absolutely not doom and gloom, but we have to be realistic. And 2017 is going to be mostly about volume.
And talking about Diversey, let me remind you what I said earlier. It is going to be our fastest growth business -- fastest growth year if you exclude the short-term impact of the SCJ. And we told you why this agreement did not get renewed. It's that it was not fitting either company. We wanted access to wider market, to consumer market, to all kinds of do-it-yourself type of markets and SCJ didn't want that. And therefore, we agree to disagree. Yes, it does have a short-term impact, but this was really the right thing to do for the company. We have lots of great plans in place. And you're going to see, outside of this SCJ business, we're going to have the highest growth that we ever had in Diversey Care."

So we've made that change in our guidance and we'll reflect that in our actual results as we move forward. If you want to have a number for comparison purposes, the interest income that was included in the adjusted EBITDA reported for 2016 is $13 million of positive interest income, and we'll reflect that change in Q1.
With respect to providing a range, we just felt that it was probably plainer to pick a point of the $1.18 billion and work towards that. It helps with our modeling as well as yours and our investors to do that, so that's what we've done. And then, just -- we highlighted and called out the various moving pieces.

And then, next to that, you have a very transparent explanation of flat Diversey Care in terms of EBITDA for the simple reason -- constant currency -- flat EBITDA for the simple reason that we have a temporary situation with this consumer goods contract. And this converts to a double-digit EBITDA growth in constant currency every single year in the last 4 years in Diversey Care. So that's what's going on. And should currency be better than the $40 million impact, we're going to be obviously happy about this. It is pretty choppy. Remember, the euro was at $1.03 four weeks ago or 3.5 weeks ago.

When you take the whole packaging operation, the No. 1 cost is freight, is shipping cost.

The amounts are lower than what we had originally forecast even as late as Q3. And you're also correct that it is largely driven by the separation plans. I made the comment on our Q3 earnings call that we would manage initial costs within the existing program as it's related to starting to address some of the stranded costs, and that's what we've looked at. We've also been very diligent about going through the programs and prioritizing based on what could give a near-term return and also recognizing that the separation of a business of this size from Diversey also takes commitment and focus. And we want to make sure we optimize value for the shareholder and we continue great service for our customers, so that's also calls to prioritization and a decrease in the amount we spent in 2016.
And shifting to 2017, in total, the amount for restructuring is not changing. We would expect to have some spend in 2018, but also a savings in 2018 based on this shift. But we will be taking a hard look as we move throughout the first half at this program and what will add the most value for Sealed Air.
With respect to the CapEx, we'll provide more color on forecasted CapEx for Food Care and for Product Care post identification of the separation."

Let me address the second part of your question first, which is the index. Yes, in general speaking, we can see some ratios which are hanging in there. The reality is that we have the bulk of our business, about 9 -- 85% of our business is in North America and is in Europe. And when you look at those 2 parts of the world and when you talk with our customers and, very frankly, on the industrial part, their exports and their business is suffering, and it's just sluggish. When you have the U.S. with a GDP of 1.9% all driven by consumers, you can call this an industrial GDP boom or these kind of things. And the bulk -- as I said, the bulk of our Product Care business is in North America and in Europe, so that's the way it is. Unfortunately, we have a large part of our Product Care business in there. Fortunately, we are growing very fast in the 3PL and e-commerce business. And the solution that we have are absolutely, second to none, disruptive and revolutionary that every time we are engaged with new customers, we are going through a whole process of new value being created and working on how we can go and get these kind of things done.
So if you -- and now addressing your first question, which was related to the margins of e-commerce versus industrial, yes, indeed, with our current portfolio, they are slightly lower. But with the solutions that we have shown at PACK EXPO, they are going to be definitely improving and not lagging our industrial business."

We see -- we had negative volume in Latin America, actually very negative in Brazil, positive in some other parts of Latin America, but for a total being negative. We are -- we believe that this is going to be stabilizing. When we look at the herd and the beef cycle, the cattle cycle, we are seeing that, specifically in Brazil, we are seeing that it has hit the trough in 2016. We believe that the first half of the year is going to be somewhat flattish and that it is going to start to improve in the second half of 2017.
When you look at Australia, 2017 is going to be lower than 2016. Again, we are following very closely the herd size. The herd size is being rebuilt in 2017. It is -- it has dramatically come down in 2016 for all the reasons that we talked about. And when you think about the herd in 2014, it was 29 million ahead and, in 2016, it was about 26.2 million. And this has been a huge reduction and the slaughter rate has dramatically decreased. We believe that it's going to continue in 2017 at a lower pace, but is going to continue. And that definitely, as the herd is being rebuilt from 2016, in '17 and onwards towards 2021, we believe that the business in Australia, the slaughter rate is going to increase. And as you know, it is a positive from 2018.
So what we see is that, from 2018, we're going to have the 3 big parts of the world which are exporting, et cetera, which are Latin America, Australia and North America, be on an up cycle, and that's going to be definitely very positive with us. To be noted also is that the exports out of Brazil are improving, but you have to remember that about 88% of the Brazilian beef exports are frozen and 12% are fresh. The good news is that fresh is expanding with the approval to export to the U.S. and will open to Asian markets as well.
So on Product Care, we think we have a huge momentum on 3PL and e-commerce. We are going to be showing more of the partnership agreement that we have during -- in the second quarter with very important ones, and so we're doing great things. It's going great. And we are going to be showing nice, we believe, nice growth in the 3PL e-commerce in North America. The European business has been negative in the fourth quarter, disappointing, definitely led by our industrial business in Europe. And -- but we -- the whole question is how do we mitigate, with e-commerce and 3PL, the flattish trend in industrial? And our view is that we shouldn't count on industrial increase in the second -- in 2017 and preserve our positions there. At the very same time, continue to aggressively grow the businesses where -- which have momentum and in which we're very disruptive."

And during our prepared remarks, we will cover the announced sale of Diversey, the end use of proceeds and how we will address trended and unallocated costs. We will review in detail our first quarter results and outlook for continuing operations. We will also highlight Diversey results, and after our prepared remarks, we will open up the call for your questions. So let's get started. 
On March 27, we announced a definitive agreement to sell Diversey, our Diversey care division and our related hygiene business to Bain Capital Private Equity for $3.2 billion. The transaction is expected to close early September with net proceeds of approximately $2.5 billion. This transaction marks a significant milestone for both Sealed Air and Diversey, and we're committed to a timely and successful separation. 
For Sealed Air, this transaction will give us an even greater focus on executing our profitable growth story and investing in our core business. The increased financial flexibility will enable us to return cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, while at the same time, target value-added acquisitions. To address the diluted impacts of this transaction, we increased our share repurchase program by an additional $1.5 billion, expanding our total authorization for future repurchases to approximately $2.2 billion. We will continue our quarterly cash dividend of $0.16 per share, and we will pay down approximately $1.1 billion of debt and maintain our credit profile. 
In reviewing our first quarter performance for continuing operations, you will see that we have a very solid start of the year. Sales were $1 billion, an increase of 3% constant dollar growth. Food Care sales of [ $656 million ] had constant dollar growth of 2% and Product Care sales of $377 million had constant dollar growth of 4%, excluding 50 basis points of rationalization efforts in Europe. We are very pleased to see the execution in North America with constant dollar sales growth of 6%, and both Food Care and Product Care contributed to this performance with sales growth of 7% and 3%, respectively. 
We are also pleased with our EBITDA performance for both Food Care and Product Care. Combined, those 2 divisions delivered adjusted EBITDA of $216 million or 21% of sales, offset by $34 million in corporate expenses. These resulted in adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations of $182 million or 18% of sales. And Carol will provide more detail later on the call on corporate expenses, which includes stranded and unallocated costs associated with the sale of Diversey. 
Diversey, which was recorded in discontinued operations in the first quarter, delivered $582 million in sales, an increase of 2% in constant dollars. And if we did not have discontinued operations accounting, adjusted EBITDA would've been $53 million as compared with $48 million in adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter of last year. Our comments throughout the rest of this call will be focused on results from continuing operations. 
So let me now turn to Slide 5. Our regional performance was still there. North America accounted for 55% of our net sales, and as I just noted, increased 6% in constant dollars. Latin America, which accounted for 9% of net sales, had constant dollar sales growth of 5.5%. Mexico, by the way, increased 17% and Brazil was up 5%, which was partially offset by a 4% decline in Argentina. On a combined basis, Mexico, Brazil and Argentina accounted for 8% of total company net sales. Asia-Pacific represented 15% of net sales and was flat year-over-year with 10% growth in New Zealand and 9% growth in China. Growth in New Zealand and China was offset by the 12% decline in Australia due to the beef market downcycle. Australia, New Zealand and China combined accounted for 10% of our total company net sales. EMEA, which accounted for the remaining 21% of the total company net sales, was the only region that declined in the quarter. And the 3.5% decline in constant currency was primarily due to timing of Food Care equipment sales, rationalization efforts in Product Care that were completed in May of last year and the decline in net sales in Russia related to currency because our pricing is indexed to the euro. On an as-reported basis, Russia was slightly up versus last year. 
Now turn to Slide 6, which highlights volume and price/mix trends by division and region. You can see from this slide that on a global basis, volume trends were up 4% in the first quarter. We delivered over 7% volume growth in North America, with 9% volume growth in Food Care and 6% growth in Product Care. I wanted to note that Sealed Air has not delivered volume growth like this since the recovery in 2010 after the great global recession. 
Volume growth in North America was partially offset by unfavorable price/mix of 1.7%. In Food Care, unfavorable pricing was due to timing of raw material cost pass-throughs, which we expect to turn in the second half of the year. And in Product Care, unfavorable mix was impacted by continued growth in e-commerce and fulfillment. We announced price increases that began in early Q2, which should help topline going forward. 
I also want to note that we experienced positive volume trends in Latin America led by 2% volume growth in food packaging -- in Food Care packaging. This is the first time since the first quarter of 2014 that volume contributed to sales growth in this region. Despite improvement in Q1, the consequences of the selective ban on the Brazilian beef export is expected to slow down the recovery in this local market and negatively impact our volume in Q2 and Q3. But Latin America continues to be a significant growth opportunity for us and we expect trends to improve as we head into 2018. 
Turning now to Slide 7 and review Food Care results in more details. Food Care delivered [ $656 million ] in net sales in the first quarter, an increase of approximately 2% on a constant dollar basis. Adjusted EBITDA of $142 million or margins of 21.6% was impacted by higher input cost. Adjusted EBITDA in Q1 2016 was $139 million. The strength we delivered in North America was not only driven by the increased cattle production in the region, but also growth in fresh pork, small and processed meat and cheeses. North America accounted for 41 -- 51% of Food Care sales in the first quarter. Latin America, which accounted for 13% of Food Care sales, delivered positive volume trends for the first time in several quarters, resulting in 5% constant dollar growth. Growth in North America and Latin America was partially offset by continued weakness in Australia as I talked about, and declines in Europe due to timing of equipment sales and Forex in Russia. 
First half sales was a strong year for -- first half of 2016 was a strong year for equipment in Europe, resulting in a tough year-on-year comparable in Q1. As we head into the second half, we expect equipment sales to return to growth and the EMEA region accounted for 20% of Food Care net sales with Asia-Pacific accounted for the remaining [ 16% ] of sales. 
For the full year 2017, we continue to expect Food Care to deliver 3% constant sales growth with continued strength in North America, improving trends in EMEA and a more favorable global price/mix as the year progresses due to the timing of raw materials cost pass-through in North America. 
Slide 8 highlights results from our Product Care division. Product Care net sales of $377 million increased 4% in constant dollars, excluding [ 50 ] basis points of rationalization in Europe, which happened in end of May of last year. Adjusted EBITDA was $74 million or 19.7% of sales. Performance accelerated through the quarter with all regions delivering positive constant dollar sales and volume growth. North America, which accounted for 62% of Product Care's net sales, increased 3% with strong growth in e-commerce and fulfillment. EMEA accounted for 23% of sales and increase slightly, driven by high single-digit growth in Germany, offset by flat sales in the U.K. and declines in France largely related to the rationalization I referred to. Asia-Pacific and Latin America combined accounted for the remaining 15% of sales and were up nearly 10% led by strength in China, Japan and Mexico. 
We continue to grow alongside the rapidly expanding e-commerce and fulfillment market and sees good areas of stabilization within the industrial sectors. Our new products, including B Plus FloWrap, StealthWrap, inflatable bubbles and automated mailers, are also gaining momentum across all of our end markets and our customers' focus on addressing dimensional weight pricing. We expect our automated fulfillment solutions to continue ramping throughout the year and further contribute to our performance. 
It is worth highlighting that last week, we announced with UPS the opening of a packaging innovation center in Louisville, Kentucky on the UPS largest supply chain solutions site. We were honored to be selected at UPS partner to help address their customers' packaging and shipping challenges, and this clearly demonstrates the power of our innovative solutions and the ability for UPS and Sealed Air to collaboratively work together to add value to customers around the world. 
For the full 2017, we expect the momentum we experienced in the first quarter to continue throughout the rest of the year, resulting in constant dollar sales growth in the range of 3% to 4%. Growth within our e-commerce and fulfillment segment is far surpassing industrial growth. 
And now, let me pass the call to Carol to review our net sales and adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow and our outlook for the full year. Carol?"

Turning to Slide 9, let me walk you through our net sales from continuing operation on a year-over-year basis. We delivered $1 billion in net sales in the first quarter. Volume contributed $38 million and was partially offset by unfavor",1181,"Thank you, Jerome. Turning to Slide 9, let me walk you through our net sales from continuing operation on a year-over-year basis. We delivered $1 billion in net sales in the first quarter. Volume contributed $38 million and was partially offset by unfavorable price/mix of $11 million. Jerome has already provided color on our topline trend. 
Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operation was $182 million. Volume growth contributed $17 million in Q1. Mix and price/cost spread was $12 million unfavorable. Operating expenses increased $5 million and restructuring savings were $1 million. Currency had an unfavorable impact on adjusted EBITDA of $2 million. You can also see on the bridge that we disclosed unallocated costs as a separate item, which were $8 million in the first quarter 2017 as compared to $5 million in the first quarter 2016. I will expand on this further when we discuss the 2017 full year guidance. 
Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operation were $0.43 from the first quarter compared to $0.42 in Q1 2016. Our adjusted tax rate for continuing operation in Q1 2017 was 14% compared to 19% in Q1 2016. The adjusted tax rate in the first quarter was favorably impacted by a tax benefit on share-based compensation and benefits related to statutes of limitations, exploration and audit settlements. 
Turning to Slide 10. We are presenting our free cash flow on a consolidated basis, which includes results from continuing and discontinued operations. In the first quarter, consolidated free cash flow, excluding payments related to the Diversey sale, was a use of cash of $31 million. CapEx was $50 million; cash interest payments, $48 million; and restructuring costs were $15 million. Aligned with our typical free cash flow seasonality, working capital and other assets and liabilities were a use of cash of $115 million. 
Now turning to our outlook on Slide 11. Net sales from continuing operation for 2017 are expected to be approximately $4.3 billion, an increase of over 3% on a constant dollar basis. This forecast just moves approximately 3% constant dollar growth for Food Care and 3% to 4% for Product Care. We expect growth to be driven largely by volume in both businesses. We estimate that currency translation will reduce net sales by approximately $35 million. For continuing operations, our major currency exposures include the euro, which was approximately 13% of net sales in Q1; the Australian dollar at 5%; British pound, 4%; and the Mexican peso, New Zealand dollar and Brazilian real, each for approximately 3% of net sales. 
2017 adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations is expected to be approximately $825 million. Corporate expenses are expected to be approximately $130 million in 2017, which includes $25 million of unallocated costs related to discontinued operations accounting. These unallocated costs consists of functional support and related expenses previously allocated to Diversey Care and hygiene solutions that did onetime qualify for discontinued operations. Our goal is to eliminate most of the unallocated costs by the end of [ 2018. ] 
Corporate expenses also include approximately $40 million of stranded costs. Identification of stranded costs is based on a percent of net sales. With the divestiture of this size, we recognize that we need to reduce the size of our corporate expense structure. We will be making a concerted effort to reduce stranded costs by 50% and repurpose the balance to support growth initiative. This reduction is planned for the 24-month period following the close of the transaction. Keep in mind that once the transaction closes in September, we will start supporting Diversey through our transitioned services agreement for up to 12 to 18 months. We expect to receive approximately $23 million in PSA revenues during this period, which will largely offset the unallocated cost. 
Unfavorable currency translation is estimated to be approximately $5 million. Our net interest expense for 2017 is estimated at $195 million with the assumption that we pay down $1.1 billion of debt with the net proceeds of the Diversey sale. Depreciation and amortization is forecast to be approximately [ $165 million. ] We expect our adjusted tax rate to be approximately 28% for the full year 2017. Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be approximately $1.70. Our forecast for EPS is based on the current weighted average shares outstanding of $196 million. Keep in mind that we are no longer restricted on share buybacks. And to address dilution of the sale of Diversey, we will begin buying shares through open market purchases and accelerated share repurchases. We expect to fund the repurchase program with cash flow generation and net proceeds from the sale of Diversey. 
Let's turn to Slide 12 and review our outlook for free cash flow. To calculate our free cash flow outlook, our forecast is based on our estimated full year outlook for continuing operation and only the first 8 months of discontinued operations. Let me walk you through how we estimate our free cash flow for the year. We started with an estimated consolidated adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1 billion with $825 million of expected EBITDA from continuing operations and $215 million from the first 8 months of discontinued operations, assuming an early September close. We anticipate cash interest payments to be $200 million and cash tax payments to be $160 million. Restructuring cash cost, excluding efforts dedicated to reducing unallocated and stranded costs, are estimated to be $50 million. Capital expenditures are forecast to be $175 million. Of which, [ $165 million ] represents Sealed Air continuing operations expenditures. Restructuring related CapEx is expected to be $25 million in 2017 and is included in the $175 million CapEx estimate. Working capital and other assets and liabilities is expected to be a use of cash of $65 million. As you know, our free cash flow is typically generated in the second half of the year with the fourth quarter being our strongest quarter for cash generation, and that is especially true of the Diversey business. 
With these factors in mind, our forecast for free cash flow in 2017 is approximately $390 million, excluding cash payments and related to the sale of Diversey. Looking beyond 2017, our targeted adjusted EBITDA conversion to free cash flow for continuing operations is 50% plus. 
I would like to discuss the growth and net proceeds of the sale of highlighted on Slide 13. Bain Capital is acquiring Diversey in an all-cash transaction valued at $3.2 billion. We expect to receive net cash proceeds of approximately $2.5 billion. Cash taxes are expected to be in the range of $250 million to $275 million. The pension liabilities transferring with Diversey is approximately $200 million, and transaction fees and separation costs are anticipated to be $70 million. Restructuring cost to address unallocated and stranded costs are estimated to be $50 million. The remaining balance includes other cost and debt-like obligations. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. Before we open the call to questions, I would like to remind you, our second quarter 2017 earnings call is tentatively scheduled for Thursday, August 3. 
With that, operator, can you please open the call for questions?"

So most of the delta from the guidance that we provided before to the update for working capital and other is largely driven because of the current plans, close date for the transaction in early September. And also your question about the restructuring, just to make sure we have clarity there. We have previously guided $85 million to $100 million in restructuring for 2017. As you see, we now have restructuring for continuing operations excluding anything associated with the separation, at $50 million. And you also see, as we highlighted in the deck, that we have $50 million identify for restructuring associated with addressing stranded costs. So those 2 together, we are still within our $85 million to $100 million for 2017, although on the high end. We expect that the $50 million for the restructuring associated with stranded costs, that will actually spread mostly from Q4 and then into 2018 as we address those stranded costs."

But if it is a cost which is allocated as a percentage of sales or things like this, before closing, all of those costs move to Sealed Air, to new Sealed Air. And that is probably part of this explanation, and we have talked about $25 million of those cost, which, in fact, are moved into our accounting Sealed Air, new Sealed Air accounting.

We don't have the margin issue, as you said, with Product Care because actually, we really are very happy with the restoration of margin in that division that we have carried throughout the years. But what you have seen is that we have actually -- what we have not seen, but what we have had is somewhat flat pricing but a negative price/mix. And you have seen that we have 3 2 where -- that for the year, we said that we're going to have 3% to 4% constant dollar sales growth. The reality in growth in the gross profit line is that we're seeing a slight degradation in the first quarter and it's going to be impacting also the second quarter because we have had hedged the hedging price increases, which we have not been able to immediately offset with our own price increases, which we have started. So we already are seeing some price increase, slight price increase in the first quarter, which is going to continue in the second quarter. But that's one part. One part is the slight margin compression that all of our competitors have had in food packaging and in product packaging and things like this because of the speed and how hefty those resin cost increases have been. The second thing is the mix. And in Product Care, we are growing, as we already told you in the previous quarters, much faster in e-commerce and fulfillment than in our industrial packaging. By the way, our industrial packaging is doing much better than it has done. We are seeing some lift.  We're seeing some restoration of volume, which is very pleasant to see, even industrial GDP, which is still not very good, but we're seeing this. But what is important to understand is that yes, we do have some lower value-added products temporarily in e-commerce. But we also have, and you need to remember that, have launched an equipment line. Two years ago. We didn't have any equipment product. We have a PACK EXPO last October showing our new line of equipment and those are starting to ramp up. You can imagine that when your production starts to ramp up, you have lower margins because you had to absorb volume variances in your plan. And we are, by far, not at the margins we need to be in our equipment, but this is the nature of the business. You ramp up your equipment, and when those are going to start kicking with sizable volume and we're doing -- we have a lot of momentum in that sector, we are going to improve our margin. This is why, and I'm concluding with this, this is why I said that short term, our margins in e-commerce 3PL are lower than our total margin. But that this is not going to be the case over time."

If we -- let's take it from a prior pre-Diversey being discontinued operations basis, which will then get away from that accounting issue you're talking about, Jerome. So I think, prior guidance, you were looking for about [ $1.180 billion ] in EBITDA. And if I take the 8 25 of continuing operations and I gross up the $215 million for a full year, our lineup at around $1.150 billion. We also have currency, which seems like it's been less negative, which is a good thing, and volume trends have been at least good, it would appear as you've been expecting. So if you agree with the premise of everything I just set up, there does appear to be some difference in what you were guiding to in terms of what you're seeing right now. What would cause that? And then my second question and I'll turn it over. Jerome, you've done a great job of driving margins, in part by getting fair value for your products in the market relative to the worth they are to the customers. Do you feel you have much more upside in that regard, either in Product Care or Food Care in terms of, again, getting that fair value, that fair price for the value provided to customers?

And I know that's not all corporate. There's some spending on growth initiatives in there. Any thoughts on changing the cadence of some of that spending? And maybe pushing it out a little bit to offset some of the dilution from the sale in terms of the impact from the stranded costs?"

So the $130 million includes the $25 million of unallocated -- not to delve into technical generally accepted accounting principles, but just to note that all those costs are -- they're a shift from discontinued to continuing operations because the accounting rules are very specific that unless something can be identified as a discrete cost, it can't fit in discontinued operations. So we have to pull it up in the continuing operations. That's why we called it out. That will be the easiest part of the cost to exit. They will first largely be covered by approximately $23 million in transition service agreement proceeds. Over those agreements, they vary across all of the work stream. Some last 6 months, some are 12, some can go up to 18 months, but they should largely cover that $25 million. Then in addition to that, I highlighted the $40 million, which we will work to exit 50% of that beginning at the close date and estimated will probably take approximately 24 months to exit those cost. And we have included in that $50 million in the restructuring to get to the net proceeds for the sale of the business to cover the exit of those costs. If we don't have the growth to be able to cover that $20 million that we're saying we're not exiting, obviously, we will have to take actions to address more than the $20 million because our goal is to continue to have quality of earnings via EBITDA growth as we see top line growth. It always doesn't happen smoothly one for one depending on if we're growing in a certain sector or making investments such as with the e-commerce and fulfillment markets, where we're growing rapidly there. But we do plan to have year-over-year. Also, if we look at corporate -- either in corporate expenses or what we're investing within the businesses, Jerome has created a culture here at Sealed Air and we'll continue to manage that way. We have to earn the right to grow and earn the right to be able to spend and invest. And if the performance of the business level, or in total for the company, if we're not seeing that growth and that improvement in performance, we will very aggressively manage the cost."

Last year, I said that we were expecting to have the total growth of about 3%, which we did not deliver. But I was expecting this to be ramping -- the growth of last year to be ramping up to twice the end of the year. So when you step back, what are you seeing? You're seeing that basically, I was wrong by 1 to 2 quarters maximum. And I do confirm that I am expecting to see the volume growth and the total growth to firm up because we said 3% to 4% this year. And when you look at -- the specifically to the volume we have had this past quarter about the double growth that we have had for a long time because our volume growth in New Sealed Air has been up about 0.8% to 0.7% in the first 3 quarters of last year and about 2% in the fourth quarter. So what you're seeing is that this growth has picked up. So Q4 volume growth for New Sealed Air was 2%. Q4 -- Q1 volume growth for the first quarter was 3.8%. And I do confirm that this is a very good and positive trend, which is making me very confident that our strategy was and is the right one, innovation and segmentation is the name of the game.

And during our prepared remarks, we will cover the announced sale of Diversey, the end use of proceeds and how we will address trended and unallocated costs. We will review in detail our first quarter results and outlook for continuing operations. We will also highlight Diversey results, and after our prepared remarks, we will open up the call for your questions. So let's get started. 
On March 27, we announced a definitive agreement to sell Diversey, our Diversey Care division and our related hygiene business to Bain Capital Private Equity for $3.2 billion. The transaction is expected to close early September, with net proceeds of approximately $2.5 billion. This transaction marks a significant milestone for both Sealed Air and Diversey, and we're committed to a timely and successful separation. 
For Sealed Air, this transaction will give us an even greater focus on executing our profitable growth story and investing in our core business. The increased financial flexibility will enable us to return cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, while at the same time, target value-added acquisitions. To address the diluted impacts of this transaction, we increased our share repurchase program by an additional $1.5 billion, expanding our total authorization for future repurchases to approximately $2.2 billion. We will continue our quarterly cash dividend of $0.16 per share, and we will pay down approximately $1.1 billion of debt and maintain our credit profile. 
In reviewing our first quarter performance for continuing operations, you will see that we had a very solid start of the year. Sales were $1 billion, an increase of 3% constant dollar growth. Food Care sales of $656 million had constant dollar growth of 2% and Product Care sales of $377 million had constant dollar growth of 4%, excluding 50 basis points of rationalization efforts in Europe. We are very pleased to see the execution in North America with constant dollar sales growth of 6%, and both Food Care and Product Care contributed to this performance with sales growth of 7% and 3%, respectively. 
We are also pleased with our EBITDA performance for both Food Care and Product Care. Combined, those 2 divisions delivered adjusted EBITDA of $216 million or 21% of sales, offset by $34 million in corporate expenses. These resulted in adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations of $182 million or 18% of sales. And Carol will provide more details later on the call on corporate expenses, which includes stranded and unallocated costs associated with the sale of Diversey. 
Diversey, which was recorded in discontinued operations in the first quarter, delivered $582 million in sales, an increase of 2% in constant dollars. And if we did not have discontinued operations accounting, adjusted EBITDA would've been $53 million as compared with $48 million in adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter of last year. Our comments throughout the rest of this call will be focused on results from continuing operations. 
So let me now turn to Slide 5. Our regional performance was still there. North America accounted for 55% of our net sales, and as I just noted, increased 6% in constant dollars. Latin America, which accounted for 9% of net sales, had constant dollar sales growth of 5.5%. Mexico, by the way, increased 17% and Brazil was up 5%, which was partially offset by a 4% decline in Argentina. On a combined basis, Mexico, Brazil and Argentina accounted for 8% of total company's net sales. Asia-Pacific represented 15% of net sales and was flat year-over-year, with 10% growth in New Zealand and 9% growth in China. Growth in New Zealand and China was offset by the 12% decline in Australia due to the beef market downcycle. Australia, New Zealand and China combined accounted for 10% of our total company net sales. EMEA, which  accounted for the remaining 21% of the total company net sales, was the only region that declined in the quarter. And the 3.5% decline in constant currency was primarily due to timing of Food Care equipment sales, rationalization efforts in Product Care that were completed in May of last year and the decline in net sales in Russia related to currency because our pricing is indexed to the euro. On an as-reported basis, Russia was slightly up versus last year. 
Now turn to Slide 6, which highlights volume and price/mix trends by division and region. You can see from this slide that on a global basis, volume trends were up 4% in the first quarter. We delivered over 7% volume growth in North America, with 9% volume growth in Food Care and 6% growth in Product Care. I wanted to note that Sealed Air has not delivered volume growth like this since the recovery in 2010 after the great global recession. 
Volume growth in North America was partially offset by unfavorable price/mix of 1.7%. In Food Care, unfavorable pricing was due to timing of raw material cost pass-through, which we expect to turn in the second half of the year. And in Product Care, unfavorable mix was impacted by continued growth in e-commerce and fulfillment. We announced price increases that began in early Q2, which should help top line going forward. 
I also want to note that we experienced positive volume trends in Latin America led by 2% volume growth in food packaging -- in Food Care packaging. This is the first time since the first quarter of 2014 that volume contributed to sales growth in this region. Despite improvement in Q1, the consequences of the selective ban on the Brazilian beef export is expected to slow down the recovery in this local market and negatively impact our volume in Q2 and Q3. But Latin America continues to be a significant growth opportunity for us, and we expect trends to improve as we head into 2018. 
Turning now to Slide 7 and review Food Care results in more details. Food Care delivered $656 million in net sales in the first quarter, an increase of approximately 2% on a constant dollar basis. Adjusted EBITDA of $142 million or margins of 21.6% was impacted by higher input cost. Adjusted EBITDA in Q1 2016 was $139 million. The strength we delivered in North America was not only driven by the increased cattle production in the region, but also growth in fresh pork, smoked and processed meat and cheeses. North America accounted for 41% -- 51% of Food Care sales in the first quarter. Latin America, which accounted for 13% of Food Care sales, delivered positive volume trends for the first time in several quarters, resulting in 5% constant dollar growth. Growth in North America and Latin America was partially offset by continued weakness in Australia as I talked about, and declines in Europe due to timing of equipment sales and Forex in Russia. 
First half sales was a strong year for -- first half of 2016 was a strong year for equipment in Europe, resulting in a tough year-on-year comparable in Q1. As we head into the second half, we expect equipment sales to return to growth and the EMEA region accounted for 20% of Food Care net sales, with Asia-Pacific accounting for the remaining 16% of sales. 
For the full year 2017, we continue to expect Food Care to deliver 3% constant sales growth, with continued strength in North America, improving trends in EMEA and a more favorable global price/mix as the year progresses due to the timing of raw materials cost pass-through in North America. 
Slide 8 highlights results from our Product Care division. Product Care net sales of $377 million increased 4% in constant dollars, excluding 50 basis points of rationalization in Europe, which happened in end of May of last year. Adjusted EBITDA was $74 million or 19.7% of sales. Performance accelerated through the quarter, with all regions delivering positive constant dollar sales and volume growth. North America, which accounted for 62% of Product Care's net sales, increased 3%, with strong growth in e-commerce and fulfillment. EMEA accounted for 23% of sales and increased slightly, driven by high single-digit growth in Germany, offset by flat sales in the U.K. and declines in France largely related to the rationalization I referred to. Asia-Pacific and Latin America, combined, accounted for the remaining 15%of sales and were up nearly 10% led by strength in China, Japan and Mexico. 
We continue to grow alongside the rapidly expanding e-commerce and fulfillment market and sees good areas of stabilization within the industrial sectors. Our new products, including B+, FloWrap, StealthWrap, inflatable bubbles and automated mailers, are also gaining momentum across all of our end markets, and our customers focus on addressing dimensional weight pricing. We expect our automated fulfillment solutions to continue ramping throughout the year and further contribute to our performance. 
It is worth highlighting that last week, we announced with UPS the opening of a packaging innovation center in Louisville, Kentucky on the UPS largest Supply Chain Solutions site. We were honored to be selected as UPS' partner to help address their customers' packaging and shipping challenges, and this clearly demonstrates the power of our innovative solutions and the ability for UPS and Sealed Air to collaboratively work together to add value to customers around the world. 
For the full 2017, we expect the momentum we experienced in the first quarter to continue throughout the rest of the year, resulting in constant dollar sales growth in the range of 3% to 4%. Growth within our e-commerce and fulfillment segment is far surpassing industrial growth. 
And now let me pass the call to Carol to review our net sales and adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow and our outlook for the full year. Carol?"

Turning to Slide 9, let me walk you through our net sales from continuing operations on a year-over-year basis. We delivered $1 billion in net sales in the first quarter. Volume contributed $38 million and was partially offset by unfavorable price/mix of $11 million. Jerome has already provided color on our top line trend. 
Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was $182 million. Volume growth contributed $17 million in Q1. Mix and price/cost spread was $12 million unfavorable. Operating expenses increased $5 million and restructuring savings were $1 million. Currency had an unfavorable impact on adjusted EBITDA of $2 million. You can also see on the bridge that we disclosed the unallocated costs as a separate item, which were $8 million in the first quarter 2017 as compared to $5 million in the first quarter 2016. I will expand on this further when we discuss the 2017 full year guidance. 
Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.43 from the first quarter compared to $0.42 in Q1 2016. Our adjusted tax rate for continuing operations in Q1 2017 was 14% compared to 19% in Q1 2016. The adjusted tax rate in the first quarter was favorably impacted by a tax benefit on share-based compensation and benefits related to statutes of limitations, explorations and audit settlements. 
Turning to Slide 10. We are presenting our free cash flow on a consolidated basis, which includes results from continuing and discontinued operations. In the first quarter, consolidated free cash flow, excluding payments related to the Diversey sale, was a use of cash of $31 million. CapEx was $50 million; cash interest payments, $48 million; and restructuring costs were $15 million. Aligned with our typical free cash flow seasonality, working capital and other assets and liabilities were a use of cash of $115 million. 
Now turning to our outlook on Slide 11. Net sales from continuing operations for 2017 are expected to be approximately $4.3 billion, an increase of over 3% on a constant dollar basis. This forecast is assumed approximately 3% constant dollar growth for Food Care and 3% to 4% for Product Care. We expect growth to be driven largely by volume in both businesses. We estimate that currency translation will reduce net sales by approximately $35 million. For continuing operations, our major currency exposures include the euro, which was approximately 13% of net sales in Q1; the Australian dollar at 5%; British pound, 4%; and the Mexican peso, New Zealand dollar and Brazilian real, each for approximately 3% of net sales. 
2017 adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations is expected to be approximately $825 million. Corporate expenses are expected to be approximately $130 million in 2017, which includes $25 million of unallocated costs related to discontinued operations accounting. These unallocated costs consist of functional support and related expenses previously allocated to Diversey Care and hygiene solutions that did not qualify for discontinued operations. Our goal is to eliminate most of the unallocated costs by the end of 2018.
Corporate expenses also include approximately $40 million of stranded costs. Identification of stranded costs is based on a percent of net sales. With the divestiture of this size, we recognize that we need to reduce the size of our corporate expense structure. We will be making a concerted effort to reduce stranded costs by 50% and repurpose the balance to support growth initiatives. This reduction is planned for the 24-month period following the close of the transaction. Keep in mind that once the transaction closes in September, we will start supporting Diversey through our transition services agreement for up to 12 to 18 months. We expect to receive approximately $23 million in PSA revenues during this period, which will largely offset the unallocated cost. 
Unfavorable currency translation is estimated to be approximately $5 million. Our net interest expense for 2017 is estimated at $195 million, with the assumption that we pay down $1.1 billion of debt with the net proceeds of the Diversey sale. Depreciation and amortization is forecast to be approximately $165 million. We expect our adjusted tax rate to be approximately 28% for the full year 2017. Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be approximately $1.70. Our forecast for EPS is based on the current weighted average shares outstanding of $196 million. Keep in mind that we are no longer restricted on share buybacks. And to address dilution of the sale of Diversey, we will begin buying shares through open market purchases and accelerated share repurchases. We expect to fund the repurchase program with cash flow generation and net proceeds from the sale of Diversey. 
Let's turn to Slide 12 and review our outlook for free cash flow. To calculate our free cash flow outlook, our forecast is based on our estimated full year outlook for continuing operations and only the first 8 months of discontinued operations. Let me walk you through how we estimate our free cash flow for the year. We started with an estimated consolidated adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1 billion, with $825 million of expected EBITDA from continuing operations and $215 million from the first 8 months of discontinued operations, assuming an early September close. We anticipate cash interest payments to be $200 million and cash tax payments to be $160 million. Restructuring cash cost, excluding efforts dedicated to reducing unallocated and stranded costs, are estimated to be $50 million. Capital expenditures are forecast to be $175 million, of which, $165 million represents Sealed Air continuing operations expenditures. Restructuring related CapEx is expected to be $25 million in 2017 and is included in the $175 million CapEx estimate. Working capital and other assets and liabilities is expected to be a use of cash of $65 million. As you know, our free cash flow is typically generated in the second half of the year, with the fourth quarter being our strongest quarter for cash generation, and that is especially true of the Diversey business. 
With these factors in mind, our forecast for free cash flow in 2017 is approximately $390 million, excluding cash payments related to the sale of Diversey. Looking beyond 2017, our targeted adjusted EBITDA conversion to free cash flow for continuing operations is 50% plus. 
I would like to discuss the gross and net proceeds of the sale as highlighted on Slide 13. Bain Capital is acquiring Diversey in an all-cash transaction valued at $3.2 billion. We expect to receive net cash proceeds of approximately $2.5 billion. Cash taxes are expected to be in the range of $250 million to $275 million. The pension liability transferring with Diversey is approximately $200 million, and transaction fees and separation costs are anticipated to be $70 million. Restructuring cost to address unallocated and stranded costs are estimated to be $50 million. The remaining balance includes other cost and debt-like obligations. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. Before we open the call to questions, I would like to remind you, our second quarter 2017 earnings call is tentatively scheduled for Thursday, August 3. 
With that, operator, can you please open the call for questions?"

And also, your question about the restructuring, just to make sure we have clarity there. We have previously guided $85 million to $100 million in restructuring for 2017. As you see, we now have restructuring for continuing operations, excluding anything associated with the separation, at $50 million. And you also see, as we highlighted in the deck, that we have $50 million identified for restructuring associated with addressing stranded costs. So those 2 together, we are still within our $85 million to $100 million for 2017, although on the high end. We expect that the $50 million for the restructuring associated with stranded costs, that will actually spread mostly from Q4, and then into 2018 as we address those stranded costs."

But if it is a cost which is allocated as a percentage of sales or things like this, before closing, all of those costs move to Sealed Air, to new Sealed Air.

We don't have a margin issue, as you said, with Product Care because actually, we're really very happy with the restoration of margins in that division that we have carried throughout the years. But what you have seen is that we have actually -- what we have not seen, but what we have had is somewhat flat pricing, but a negative price/mix. And you have seen that we have 3% to where -- that for the year, we said that we're going to have 3% to 4% constant dollar sales growth. The reality in the gross profit line is that we're seeing a slight degradation in the first quarter and it's going to be impacting also the second quarter because we have had hedged the resin price increases, which we have not been able to immediately offset with our own price increases, which we have started. So we already are seeing some price increase, slight price increase in the first quarter, which is going to continue in the second quarter. But that's one part. One part is the slight margin compression that all of our competitors have had in food packaging and in product packaging and things like this because of the speed and how hefty those resin cost increases have been. The second thing is the mix. And in Product Care, we are growing, as we already told you in the previous quarters, much faster in e-commerce and fulfillment than in our industrial packaging. By the way, our industrial packaging is doing much better than it has done. We are seeing some lift.  We're seeing some restoration of volume, which is very pleasant to see in an industrial GDP, which is still not very good, but we're seeing this. But what is important to understand is that yes, we do have some lower value-added products temporarily in e-commerce. But we also have, and you need to remember that, have launched an equipment line. Two years ago, we didn't have any equipment product. We have a PACK EXPO last October, showing our new line of equipment and those are starting to ramp up. You can imagine that when your production starts to ramp up, you have lower margins because you have to absorb volume variances in your plan. And we are, by far, not at the margins we need to be in our equipment, but this is the nature of the beat. You'll ramp up your equipment, and when those are going to start kicking with sizable volume and we're doing -- we have a lot of momentum in that sector, we are going to improve our margin. This is why, and I'm concluding with this, this is why I said that short term, our margins in e-commerce 3PL are lower than our total margin. But that this is not going to be the case, over time."

If we -- and let's take it from a prior -- pre-Diversey being discontinued operations basis, which will then get away from that accounting issue you're talking about, Jerome. So I think, prior guidance, you were looking for about $1.180 billion in EBITDA. And if I take the $825 million of continuing operations and I gross up the $215 million for full year, are lined up at around $1.150 billion. We also have currency, which seems like it's been less negative, which is a good thing, and volume trends have been at least good, it would appear, as you've been expecting.

I think you made some comments that $23 million of that will get covered by some transition service agreements once the sale closes. And then eventually, you hope to take out half of the $40 million of stranded costs. So is the right way to think of it as a negative $130 million this year going to something like a negative $110 million next year? And I know that's not all corporate. There's some spending on growth initiatives in there. Any thoughts on changing the cadence of some of that spending and maybe pushing it out a little bit to offset some of the dilution from the sale in terms of the impact from the stranded costs?"

So the $130 million includes the $25 million of unallocated -- not to delve into technical generally accepted accounting principles, but just to note that all those costs are -- they're a shift from discontinued to continuing operations because the accounting rules are very specific that unless something can be identified as a discrete cost, it can't fit in discontinued operations. So we have to pull it up in the continuing operations. That's why we called it out. That will be the easiest part of the cost to exit. They will first largely be covered by approximately $23 million in transition service agreement proceeds. Over those agreements, they vary across all of the work stream. Some last 6 months, some are 12, some can go up to 18 months, but they should largely cover that $25 million. Then in addition to that, I highlighted the $40 million, which we will work to exit 50% of that beginning at the close date and estimated we'll probably take approximately 24 months to exit those cost. And we have included in that $50 million in the restructuring to get to the net proceeds for the sale of the business to cover the exit of those costs. If we don't have the growth to be able to cover that $20 million that we're saying we're not exiting, obviously, we will have to take actions to address more than the $20 million because our goal is to continue to have quality of earnings via EBITDA growth as we see top line growth. It always doesn't happen smoothly one for one, depending on if we're growing in a certain sector and making investments such as with the e-commerce and fulfillment markets, where we're growing rapidly there. But we do plan to have year-over-year. Also, if we look at corporate -- either in corporate expenses or what we're investing within the businesses, Jerome has created a culture here at Sealed Air and we'll continue to manage that way. We have to earn the right to grow and earn the right to be able to spend and invest. And if the performance of the business level, or in total for the company, if we're not seeing that growth and that improvement in performance, we will very aggressively manage the cost."

And when you look at -- the specifically to the volume, we have had this past quarter about the double growth that we have had for a long time because our volume growth in New Sealed Air has been about 0.8% to 0.7% in the first 3 quarters of last year and about 2% in the fourth quarter. So what you're seeing is that this growth has picked up. So Q4 volume growth for New Sealed Air was 2%. Q4 -- Q1 volume growth for the first quarter was 3.8%. And I do confirm that this is a very good and positive trend, which is making me very confident that our strategy was and is the right one, innovation and segmentation is the name of the game.

And during our prepared remarks, we will cover the announced sale of Diversey, planned use of proceeds and how we will address trended and unallocated costs. We will review in detail our first quarter results and outlook for continuing operations. We will also highlight Diversey results, and after our prepared remarks, we will open up the call for your questions. So let's get started. 
On March 27, we announced a definitive agreement to sell Diversey, our Diversey Care division and our related hygiene business to Bain Capital Private Equity for $3.2 billion. The transaction is expected to close early September, with net proceeds of approximately $2.5 billion. This transaction marks a significant milestone for both Sealed Air and Diversey, and we're committed to a timely and successful separation. 
For Sealed Air, this transaction will give us an even greater focus on executing our profitable growth story and investing in our core business. The increased financial flexibility will enable us to return cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, while at the same time, target value-added acquisitions. 
To address the dilutive impacts of this transaction, we increased our share repurchase program by an additional $1.5 billion, expanding our total authorization for future repurchases to approximately $2.2 billion. We will continue our quarterly cash dividend of $0.16 per share, and we will pay down approximately $1.1 billion of debt and maintain our credit profile. 
In reviewing our first quarter performance for continuing operations, you will see that we had a very solid start of the year. Sales were $1 billion, an increase of 3% constant dollar growth. Food Care sales of $656 million had constant dollar growth of 2% and Product Care sales of $377 million had constant dollar growth of 4%, excluding 50 basis points of rationalization efforts in Europe. We are very pleased to see the execution in North America with constant dollar sales growth of 6%, and both Food Care and Product Care contributed to this performance with sales growth of 7% and 3%, respectively. 
We are also pleased with our EBITDA performance for both Food Care and Product Care. Combined, those 2 divisions delivered adjusted EBITDA of $216 million or 21% of sales, offset by $34 million in corporate expenses. This resulted in adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations of $182 million or 18% of sales. And Carol will provide more details later on the call on corporate expenses, which includes stranded and unallocated costs associated with the sale of Diversey. 
Diversey, which was recorded in discontinued operations in the first quarter, delivered $582 million in sales, an increase of 2% in constant dollars. And if we did not have discontinued operations accounting, adjusted EBITDA would have been $53 million as compared with $48 million in adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter of last year. Our comments throughout the rest of this call will be focused on results from continuing operations. 
So let me now turn to Slide 5. Our regional performance was still there. North America accounted for 55% of our net sales, and as I just noted, increased 6% in constant dollars. Latin America, which accounted for 9% of net sales, had constant dollar sales growth of 5.5%. Mexico, by the way, increased 17% and Brazil was up 5%, which was partially offset by a 4% decline in Argentina. On a combined basis, Mexico, Brazil and Argentina accounted for 8% of total company's net sales. 
Asia-Pacific represented 15% of net sales and was flat year-over-year, with 10% growth in New Zealand and 9% growth in China. Growth in New Zealand and China was offset by the 12% decline in Australia due to the beef market downcycle. Australia, New Zealand and China combined accounted for 10% of our total company net sales. 
EMEA, which  accounted for the remaining 21% of the total company net sales, was the only region that declined in the quarter. And the 3.5% decline in constant currency was primarily due to timing of Food Care equipment sales, rationalization efforts in Product Care that were completed in May of last year and the decline in net sales in Russia related to currency because our pricing is indexed to the euro. On an as-reported basis, Russia was slightly up versus last year. 
Now turning to Slide 6, which highlights volume and price/mix trends by division and region. You can see from this slide that on a global basis, volume trends were up 4% in the first quarter. We delivered over 7% volume growth in North America, with 9% volume growth in Food Care and 6% growth in Product Care. I wanted to note that Sealed Air has not delivered volume growth like this since the recovery in 2010 after the great global recession. 
Volume growth in North America was partially offset by unfavorable price/mix of 1.7%. In Food Care, unfavorable pricing was due to timing of raw material cost pass-through, which we expect to turn in the second half of the year. And in Product Care, unfavorable mix was impacted by continued growth in e-commerce and fulfillment. We announced price increases that began in early Q2, which should help top line going forward. 
I also want to note that we experienced positive volume trends in Latin America led by 2% volume growth in food packaging -- in Food Care packaging. This is the first time since the first quarter of 2014 that volume contributed to sales growth in this region. Despite improvement in Q1, the consequences of the selective ban on the Brazilian beef export is expected to slow down the recovery in this local market and negatively impact our volume in Q2 and Q3. But Latin America continues to be a significant growth opportunity for us, and we expect trends to improve as we head into 2018. 
Turning now to Slide 7 and review Food Care results in more details. Food Care delivered $656 million in net sales in the first quarter, an increase of approximately 2% on a constant dollar basis. Adjusted EBITDA of $142 million or margins of 21.6% was impacted by higher input cost. Adjusted EBITDA in Q1 2016 was $139 million. The strength we delivered in North America was not only driven by the increased cattle production in the region, but also growth in fresh pork, smoked and processed meat and cheeses. North America accounted for 41% -- 51% of Food Care sales in the first quarter. Latin America, which accounted for 13% of Food Care sales, delivered positive volume trends for the first time in several quarters, resulting in 5% constant dollar growth. Growth in North America and Latin America was partially offset by continued weakness in Australia as I talked about, and declines in Europe due to timing of equipment sales and ForEx in Russia. 
First half sales was a strong year for -- first half of 2016 was a strong year for equipment in Europe, resulting in a tough year-on-year comparable in Q1. As we head into the second half, we expect equipment sales to return to growth and the EMEA region accounted for 20% of Food Care net sales, with Asia-Pacific accounting for the remaining 16% of sales. 
For the full year 2017, we continue to expect Food Care to deliver 3% constant sales growth, with continued strength in North America, improving trends in EMEA and a more favorable global price/mix as the year progresses due to the timing of raw materials cost pass-through in North America. 
Slide 8 highlights results from our Product Care division. Product Care net sales of $377 million increased 4% in constant dollars, excluding 50 basis points of rationalization in Europe, which happened in end of May of last year. Adjusted EBITDA was $74 million or 19.7% of sales. Performance accelerated through the quarter, with all regions delivering positive constant dollar sales and volume growth. North America, which accounted for 62% of Product Care's net sales, increased 3%, with strong growth in e-commerce and fulfillment. EMEA accounted for 23% of sales and increased slightly, driven by high single-digit growth in Germany, offset by flat sales in the U.K. and declines in France largely related to the rationalization I referred to. Asia-Pacific and Latin America, combined, accounted for the remaining 15% of sales and were up nearly 10% led by strength in China, Japan and Mexico. 
We continue to grow alongside the rapidly expanding e-commerce and fulfillment market and sees good areas of stabilization within the industrial sectors. Our new products, including B+, FloWrap, StealthWrap, inflatable bubbles and automated mailers, are also gaining momentum across all of our end markets, and our customers focus on addressing dimensional weight pricing. We expect our automated fulfillment solutions to continue ramping throughout the year and further contribute to our performance. 
It is worth highlighting that last week, we announced with UPS the opening of a packaging innovation center in Louisville, Kentucky on the UPS largest Supply Chain Solutions site. We were honored to be selected as UPS' partner to help address their customers' packaging and shipping challenges, and this clearly demonstrates the power of our innovative solutions and the ability for UPS and Sealed Air to collaboratively work together to add value to customers around the world. 
For the full 2017, we expect the momentum we experienced in the first quarter to continue throughout the rest of the year, resulting in constant dollar sales growth in the range of 3% to 4%. Growth within our e-commerce and fulfillment segment is far surpassing industrial growth. 
And now let me pass the call to Carol to review our net sales and adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow and our outlook for the full year. Carol?"
382724,427748096,1197022,"Sealed Air Corporation, Q1 2017 Earnings Call, May 09, 2017",2017-05-09,"Earnings Calls","Sealed Air Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Jerome.

Turning to Slide 9, let me walk you through our net sales from continuing operations on a year-over-year basis. We delivered $1 billion in net sales in the first quarter. Volume contributed $38 million and was partially offset by unfavorable price/mix of $11 million. Jerome has already provided color on our top line trend. 
Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was $182 million. Volume growth contributed $17 million in Q1. Mix and price/cost spread was $12 million unfavorable. Operating expenses increased $5 million and restructuring savings were $1 million. Currency had an unfavorable impact on adjusted EBITDA of $2 million. You can also see on the bridge that we disclose the unallocated costs as a separate item, which were $8 million in the first quarter 2017 as compared to $5 million in the first quarter 2016. I will expand on this further when we discuss the 2017 full year guidance. 
Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.43 in the first quarter compared to $0.42 in Q1 2016. Our adjusted tax rate for continuing operations in Q1 2017 was 14% compared to 19% in Q1 2016. The adjusted tax rate in the first quarter was favorably impacted by a tax benefit on share-based compensation and benefits related to statute of limitations expirations and audit settlements. 
Turning to Slide 10. We are presenting our free cash flow on a consolidated basis, which includes results from continuing and discontinued operations. In the first quarter, consolidated free cash flow, excluding payments related to the Diversey sale, was a use of cash of $31 million. CapEx was $50 million; cash interest payments, $48 million; and restructuring costs were $15 million. Aligned with our typical free cash flow seasonality, working capital and other assets and liabilities were a use of cash of $115 million. 
Now turning to our outlook on Slide 11. Net sales from continuing operations for 2017 are expected to be approximately $4.3 billion, an increase of over 3% on a constant dollar basis. This forecast assumes approximately 3% constant dollar growth for Food Care and 3% to 4% for Product Care. We expect growth to be driven largely by volume in both businesses. 
We estimate that currency translation will reduce net sales by approximately $35 million. For continuing operations, our major currency exposures include the euro, which was approximately 13% of net sales in Q1; the Australian dollar at 5%; the British pound, 4%; and the Mexican peso, New Zealand dollar and Brazilian real, each for approximately 3% of net sales. 
2017 adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations is expected to be approximately $825 million. Corporate expenses are expected to be approximately $130 million in 2017, which includes $25 million of unallocated costs related to discontinued operations accounting. These unallocated costs consist of functional support and related expenses previously allocated to Diversey Care and hygiene solutions that did not qualify for discontinued operations. Our goal is to eliminate most of the unallocated costs by the end of 2018.
Corporate expenses also include approximately $40 million of stranded costs. Identification of stranded costs is based on a percent of net sales. With a divestiture of this size, we recognize that we need to reduce the size of our corporate expense structure. We will be making a concerted effort to reduce stranded costs by 50% and repurpose the balance to support growth initiatives. This reduction is planned for the 24-month period following the close of the transaction. Keep in mind that once the transaction closes in September, we will start supporting Diversey through our transition services agreement for up to 12 to 18 months. We expect to receive approximately $23 million in PSA revenues during this period, which will largely offset the unallocated cost. 
Unfavorable currency translation is estimated to be approximately $5 million. Our net interest expense for 2017 is estimated at $195 million, with the assumption that we pay down $1.1 billion of debt with the net proceeds of the Diversey sale. Depreciation and amortization is forecast to be approximately $165 million. We expect our adjusted tax rate to be approximately 28% for the full year 2017. Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be approximately $1.70. 
Our forecast for EPS is based on the current weighted average shares outstanding of 196 million. Keep in mind that we are no longer restricted on share buybacks. And to address dilution of the sale of Diversey, we will begin buying shares through open market purchases and accelerated share repurchases. We expect to fund the repurchase program with cash flow generation and net proceeds from the sale of Diversey. 
Let's turn to Slide 12 and review our outlook for free cash flow. To calculate our free cash flow outlook, our forecast is based on our estimated full year outlook for continuing operations and only the first 8 months of discontinued operations. Let me walk you through how we estimate our free cash flow for the year. 
We started with an estimated consolidated adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1 billion, with $825 million of expected EBITDA from continuing operations and $215 million from the first 8 months of discontinued operations, assuming an early September close. We anticipate cash interest payments to be $200 million and cash tax payments to be $160 million. Restructuring cash cost, excluding efforts dedicated to reducing unallocated and stranded costs, are estimated to be $50 million. Capital expenditures are forecast to be $175 million, of which, $165 million represents Sealed Air continuing operations expenditures. Restructuring-related CapEx is expected to be $25 million in 2017 and is included in the $175 million CapEx estimate. Working capital and other assets and liabilities is expected to be a use of cash of $65 million. As you know, our free cash flow is typically generated in the second half of the year, with the fourth quarter being our strongest quarter for cash generation, and that is especially true of the Diversey business. 
With these factors in mind, our forecast for free cash flow in 2017 is approximately $390 million, excluding cash payments related to the sale of Diversey. Looking beyond 2017, our targeted adjusted EBITDA conversion to free cash flow for continuing operations is 50% plus. 
I would like to discuss the gross and net proceeds of the sale as highlighted on Slide 13. Bain Capital is acquiring Diversey in an all-cash transaction valued at $3.2 billion. We expect to receive net cash proceeds of approximately $2.5 billion. Cash taxes are expected to be in the range of $250 million to $275 million. The pension liability transferring with Diversey is approximately $200 million, and transaction fees and separation costs are anticipated to be $70 million. Restructuring cost to address unallocated and stranded costs are estimated to be $50 million. The remaining balance includes other cost and debt-like obligations. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. Before we open the call to questions, I would like to remind you, our second quarter 2017 earnings call is tentatively scheduled for Thursday, August 3. 
With that, operator, can you please open the call for questions?"

So most of the delta from the guidance that we provided before, to the update for working capital and other, is largely driven because of the current planned close date for the transaction in early September. And also, your question about the restructuring, just to make sure we have clarity there. We had previously guided $85 million to $100 million in restructuring for 2017. As you see, we now have restructuring for continuing operations, excluding anything associated with the separation, at $50 million. And you also see, as we highlighted in the deck, that we have $50 million identified for restructuring associated with addressing stranded costs. So those 2 together, we are still within our $85 million to $100 million for 2017, although on the high end. We expect that the $50 million for the restructuring associated with stranded costs, that will actually spread mostly from Q4, and then into 2018 as we address those stranded costs."

But if it is a cost which is allocated as a percentage of sales or things like this, before closing, all of those costs move to Sealed Air, to New Sealed Air. And that is probably part of this explanation, and we have talked about $25 million of those costs, which in fact, are moved into our accounting, Sealed Air, New Sealed Air accounting.

We don't have a margin issue, as you said, with Product Care because actually, we're really very happy with the restoration of margins in that division that we have carried throughout the years. But what you have seen is that we have actually -- what we have not seen, but what we have had is a somewhat flat pricing, but a negative price/mix. And you have seen that we have 3% to where -- that for the year, we said that we're going to have 3% to 4% constant dollar sales growth. The reality in the gross profit line is that we're seeing a slight degradation in the first quarter and it's going to be impacting also the second quarter because we have had hefty resin price increases, which we have not been able to immediately offset with our own price increases, which we have started. So we already are seeing some price increase, slight price increase in the first quarter, which is going to continue in the second quarter. But that's one part. One part is the slight margin compression that all of our competitors have had in food packaging and in product packaging and things like this because of the speed and how hefty those resin cost increases have been. The second thing is the mix. And in Product Care, we are growing, as we already told you in the previous quarters, much faster in e-commerce and fulfillment than in our industrial packaging. By the way, our industrial packaging is doing much better than it has done. We are seeing some lift. We're seeing some restoration of volume, which is very pleasant to see in an industrial GDP which is still not very good, but we're seeing this. But what is important to understand is that yes, we do have some lower value-added products temporarily in e-commerce. But we also have, and you need to remember that, have launched an equipment line. Two years ago, we didn't have any equipment product. We have a PACK EXPO last October, shown our new line of equipment and those are starting to ramp up. You can imagine that when your production starts to ramp up, you have lower margins because you have to absorb volume variances in your plan. And we are, by far, not at the margins we need to be in our equipment, but this is the nature of the beast. You ramp up your equipment, and when those are going to start kicking with sizable volume and we're doing -- we have a lot of momentum in that sector, we are going to improve our margin. This is why, and I'm concluding with this, this is why I said that short term, our margins in e-commerce 3PL are lower than our total margin. But that this is not going to be the case, over time."

If we -- and let's take it from a prior -- pre-Diversey being discontinued operations basis, which will then get away from that accounting issue you're talking about, Jerome. So I think, prior guidance, you were looking for about $1.180 billion in EBITDA. And if I take the $825 million of continuing operations and I gross up the $215 million for a full year, I wind up at around $1.150 billion. We also have currency, which seems like it's been less negative, which is a good thing, and volume trends have been at least as good, it would appear, as you've been expecting. So if you agree with the premise of everything I just set up, there does appear to be some difference in what you were guiding to in terms of what you're seeing right now. What would cause that? And then my second question, and I'll turn it over. Jerome, you've done a great job of driving margin, in part by getting fair value for your products in the market relative to the worth they are to their customers. Do you feel you have much more upside in that regard, either in Product Care or Food Care in terms of, again, getting that fair value, that fair price for the value provided to customers?

With regards to Product Care, those are negotiations, and because we don't have, basically, formulas, and that has affected some gross profits in the first quarter because of the speed of those $0.05 and $0.03 and potentially some more to come. We have announced price increases on -- and we have executed price increases on -- based on resins. We also had some benzene and MDI, very hefty price -- cost increases, and we have already started to implement price increases on our Instapak product line, which is important."

I think you made some comments that $23 million of that would get covered by some transition service agreements once the sale closes.

And I know that's not all corporate, there's some spending on growth initiatives in there.

So the $130 million includes the $25 million of unallocated -- and not to delve into technical generally accepted accounting principles, but just to note that all those costs are, they're a shift from discontinued to continuing operations because the accounting rules are very specific that unless something can be identified as a discrete cost, it can't fit in discontinued operations. So we have to pull it up into continuing operations. That's why we called it out. That will be the easiest part of the cost to exit. They will first largely be covered by approximately $23 million in transition service agreement proceeds. Over those agreements, they vary across all of the work stream. Some last 6 months, some are 12, some can go up to 18 months, but they should largely cover that $25 million. Then, in addition to that, I highlighted the $40 million, which we will work to exit 50% of that beginning at the close date and estimated we'll probably take approximately 24 months to exit those costs. And we have included in that $50 million in the restructuring to get to the net proceeds for the sale of the business to cover the exit of those costs. If we don't have the growth to be able to cover that $20 million that we're saying we're not exiting, obviously, we will have to take actions to address more than the $20 million because our goal is to continue to have quality of earnings via EBITDA growth as we see top line growth. It always doesn't happen smoothly one for one, depending on if we're growing in a certain sector and making investments such as with the e-commerce and fulfillment markets, where we're growing rapidly there. But we do plan to have year-over-year. Also, if we look at corporate -- either our corporate expenses or what we're investing within the businesses, Jerome has created a culture here at Sealed Air and we'll continue to manage that way. We have to earn the right to grow and earn the right to be able to spend and invest. And if the performance of the business level, or in total for the company, if we're not seeing that growth and that improvement in performance, we will very aggressively manage the cost."

Last year, I said that we were expecting to have a total growth of about 3%, which we did not deliver.

You're seeing that basically, I was wrong by 1 to 2 quarters maximum. And I do confirm that I am expecting to see the volume growth and the total growth to firm up because we said 3% to 4% this year. And when you look at the -- specifically to the volume, we have had this past quarter about the double growth that we have had for a long time because our volume growth in New Sealed Air has been of about 0.8% to 0.7% in the first 3 quarters of last year and about 2% in the fourth quarter. So what you're seeing is that this growth has picked up. So Q4 volume growth for New Sealed Air was 2%. Q4 -- Q1 volume growth for the first quarter was 3.8%. And I do confirm that this is a very good and positive trend, which is making me very confident that our strategy was and is the right one, innovation and segmentation is the name of the game.

We",1625,"Thank you, Lori, and good morning, everyone. We have a lot to cover on our call this morning. And during our prepared remarks, we will cover the announced sale of Diversey, planned use of proceeds and how we will address trended and unallocated costs. We will review in detail our first quarter results and outlook for continuing operations. We will also highlight Diversey results, and after our prepared remarks, we will open up the call for your questions. So let's get started. 
On March 27, we announced a definitive agreement to sell Diversey, our Diversey Care division and our related hygiene business to Bain Capital Private Equity for $3.2 billion. The transaction is expected to close early September, with net proceeds of approximately $2.5 billion. This transaction marks a significant milestone for both Sealed Air and Diversey, and we're committed to a timely and successful separation. 
For Sealed Air, this transaction will give us an even greater focus on executing our profitable growth story and investing in our core business. The increased financial flexibility will enable us to return cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, while at the same time, target value-added acquisitions. 
To address the dilutive impacts of this transaction, we increased our share repurchase program by an additional $1.5 billion, expanding our total authorization for future repurchases to approximately $2.2 billion. We will continue our quarterly cash dividend of $0.16 per share, and we will pay down approximately $1.1 billion of debt and maintain our credit profile. 
In reviewing our first quarter performance for continuing operations, you will see that we had a very solid start of the year. Sales were $1 billion, an increase of 3% constant dollar growth. Food Care sales of $656 million had constant dollar growth of 2% and Product Care sales of $377 million had constant dollar growth of 4%, excluding 50 basis points of rationalization efforts in Europe. We are very pleased to see the execution in North America with constant dollar sales growth of 6%, and both Food Care and Product Care contributed to this performance with sales growth of 7% and 3%, respectively. 
We are also pleased with our EBITDA performance for both Food Care and Product Care. Combined, those 2 divisions delivered adjusted EBITDA of $216 million or 21% of sales, offset by $34 million in corporate expenses. This resulted in adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations of $182 million or 18% of sales. And Carol will provide more details later on the call on corporate expenses, which includes stranded and unallocated costs associated with the sale of Diversey. 
Diversey, which was recorded in discontinued operations in the first quarter, delivered $582 million in sales, an increase of 2% in constant dollars. And if we did not have discontinued operations accounting, adjusted EBITDA would have been $53 million as compared with $48 million in adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter of last year. Our comments throughout the rest of this call will be focused on results from continuing operations. 
So let me now turn to Slide 5. Our regional performance was still there. North America accounted for 55% of our net sales, and as I just noted, increased 6% in constant dollars. Latin America, which accounted for 9% of net sales, had constant dollar sales growth of 5.5%. Mexico, by the way, increased 17% and Brazil was up 5%, which was partially offset by a 4% decline in Argentina. On a combined basis, Mexico, Brazil and Argentina accounted for 8% of total company's net sales. 
Asia-Pacific represented 15% of net sales and was flat year-over-year, with 10% growth in New Zealand and 9% growth in China. Growth in New Zealand and China was offset by the 12% decline in Australia due to the beef market downcycle. Australia, New Zealand and China combined accounted for 10% of our total company net sales. 
EMEA, which  accounted for the remaining 21% of the total company net sales, was the only region that declined in the quarter. And the 3.5% decline in constant currency was primarily due to timing of Food Care equipment sales, rationalization efforts in Product Care that were completed in May of last year and the decline in net sales in Russia related to currency because our pricing is indexed to the euro. On an as-reported basis, Russia was slightly up versus last year. 
Now turning to Slide 6, which highlights volume and price/mix trends by division and region. You can see from this slide that on a global basis, volume trends were up 4% in the first quarter. We delivered over 7% volume growth in North America, with 9% volume growth in Food Care and 6% growth in Product Care. I wanted to note that Sealed Air has not delivered volume growth like this since the recovery in 2010 after the great global recession. 
Volume growth in North America was partially offset by unfavorable price/mix of 1.7%. In Food Care, unfavorable pricing was due to timing of raw material cost pass-through, which we expect to turn in the second half of the year. And in Product Care, unfavorable mix was impacted by continued growth in e-commerce and fulfillment. We announced price increases that began in early Q2, which should help top line going forward. 
I also want to note that we experienced positive volume trends in Latin America led by 2% volume growth in food packaging -- in Food Care packaging. This is the first time since the first quarter of 2014 that volume contributed to sales growth in this region. Despite improvement in Q1, the consequences of the selective ban on the Brazilian beef export is expected to slow down the recovery in this local market and negatively impact our volume in Q2 and Q3. But Latin America continues to be a significant growth opportunity for us, and we expect trends to improve as we head into 2018. 
Turning now to Slide 7 and review Food Care results in more details. Food Care delivered $656 million in net sales in the first quarter, an increase of approximately 2% on a constant dollar basis. Adjusted EBITDA of $142 million or margins of 21.6% was impacted by higher input cost. Adjusted EBITDA in Q1 2016 was $139 million. The strength we delivered in North America was not only driven by the increased cattle production in the region, but also growth in fresh pork, smoked and processed meat and cheeses. North America accounted for 41% -- 51% of Food Care sales in the first quarter. Latin America, which accounted for 13% of Food Care sales, delivered positive volume trends for the first time in several quarters, resulting in 5% constant dollar growth. Growth in North America and Latin America was partially offset by continued weakness in Australia as I talked about, and declines in Europe due to timing of equipment sales and ForEx in Russia. 
First half sales was a strong year for -- first half of 2016 was a strong year for equipment in Europe, resulting in a tough year-on-year comparable in Q1. As we head into the second half, we expect equipment sales to return to growth and the EMEA region accounted for 20% of Food Care net sales, with Asia-Pacific accounting for the remaining 16% of sales. 
For the full year 2017, we continue to expect Food Care to deliver 3% constant sales growth, with continued strength in North America, improving trends in EMEA and a more favorable global price/mix as the year progresses due to the timing of raw materials cost pass-through in North America. 
Slide 8 highlights results from our Product Care division. Product Care net sales of $377 million increased 4% in constant dollars, excluding 50 basis points of rationalization in Europe, which happened in end of May of last year. Adjusted EBITDA was $74 million or 19.7% of sales. Performance accelerated through the quarter, with all regions delivering positive constant dollar sales and volume growth. North America, which accounted for 62% of Product Care's net sales, increased 3%, with strong growth in e-commerce and fulfillment. EMEA accounted for 23% of sales and increased slightly, driven by high single-digit growth in Germany, offset by flat sales in the U.K. and declines in France largely related to the rationalization I referred to. Asia-Pacific and Latin America, combined, accounted for the remaining 15% of sales and were up nearly 10% led by strength in China, Japan and Mexico. 
We continue to grow alongside the rapidly expanding e-commerce and fulfillment market and sees good areas of stabilization within the industrial sectors. Our new products, including B+, FloWrap, StealthWrap, inflatable bubbles and automated mailers, are also gaining momentum across all of our end markets, and our customers focus on addressing dimensional weight pricing. We expect our automated fulfillment solutions to continue ramping throughout the year and further contribute to our performance. 
It is worth highlighting that last week, we announced with UPS the opening of a packaging innovation center in Louisville, Kentucky on the UPS largest Supply Chain Solutions site. We were honored to be selected as UPS' partner to help address their customers' packaging and shipping challenges, and this clearly demonstrates the power of our innovative solutions and the ability for UPS and Sealed Air to collaboratively work together to add value to customers around the world. 
For the full 2017, we expect the momentum we experienced in the first quarter to continue throughout the rest of the year, resulting in constant dollar sales growth in the range of 3% to 4%. Growth within our e-commerce and fulfillment segment is far surpassing industrial growth. 
And now let me pass the call to Carol to review our net sales and adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow and our outlook for the full year. Carol?"
382724,427748096,1204703,"Sealed Air Corporation, Q1 2017 Earnings Call, May 09, 2017",2017-05-09,"Earnings Calls","Sealed Air Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Jerome.

Turning to Slide 9, let me walk you through our net sales from continuing operations on a year-over-year basis. We delivered $1 billion in net sales in the first quarter. Volume contributed $38 million and was partially offset by unfavorable price/mix of $11 million. Jerome has already provided color on our top line trend. 
Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was $182 million. Volume growth contributed $17 million in Q1. Mix and price/cost spread was $12 million unfavorable. Operating expenses increased $5 million and restructuring savings were $1 million. Currency had an unfavorable impact on adjusted EBITDA of $2 million. You can also see on the bridge that we disclose the unallocated costs as a separate item, which were $8 million in the first quarter 2017 as compared to $5 million in the first quarter 2016. I will expand on this further when we discuss the 2017 full year guidance. 
Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.43 in the first quarter compared to $0.42 in Q1 2016. Our adjusted tax rate for continuing operations in Q1 2017 was 14% compared to 19% in Q1 2016. The adjusted tax rate in the first quarter was favorably impacted by a tax benefit on share-based compensation and benefits related to statute of limitations expirations and audit settlements. 
Turning to Slide 10. We are presenting our free cash flow on a consolidated basis, which includes results from continuing and discontinued operations. In the first quarter, consolidated free cash flow, excluding payments related to the Diversey sale, was a use of cash of $31 million. CapEx was $50 million; cash interest payments, $48 million; and restructuring costs were $15 million. Aligned with our typical free cash flow seasonality, working capital and other assets and liabilities were a use of cash of $115 million. 
Now turning to our outlook on Slide 11. Net sales from continuing operations for 2017 are expected to be approximately $4.3 billion, an increase of over 3% on a constant dollar basis. This forecast assumes approximately 3% constant dollar growth for Food Care and 3% to 4% for Product Care. We expect growth to be driven largely by volume in both businesses. 
We estimate that currency translation will reduce net sales by approximately $35 million. For continuing operations, our major currency exposures include the euro, which was approximately 13% of net sales in Q1; the Australian dollar at 5%; the British pound, 4%; and the Mexican peso, New Zealand dollar and Brazilian real, each for approximately 3% of net sales. 
2017 adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations is expected to be approximately $825 million. Corporate expenses are expected to be approximately $130 million in 2017, which includes $25 million of unallocated costs related to discontinued operations accounting. These unallocated costs consist of functional support and related expenses previously allocated to Diversey Care and hygiene solutions that did not qualify for discontinued operations. Our goal is to eliminate most of the unallocated costs by the end of 2018.
Corporate expenses also include approximately $40 million of stranded costs. Identification of stranded costs is based on a percent of net sales. With a divestiture of this size, we recognize that we need to reduce the size of our corporate expense structure. We will be making a concerted effort to reduce stranded costs by 50% and repurpose the balance to support growth initiatives. This reduction is planned for the 24-month period following the close of the transaction. Keep in mind that once the transaction closes in September, we will start supporting Diversey through our transition services agreement for up to 12 to 18 months. We expect to receive approximately $23 million in PSA revenues during this period, which will largely offset the unallocated cost. 
Unfavorable currency translation is estimated to be approximately $5 million. Our net interest expense for 2017 is estimated at $195 million, with the assumption that we pay down $1.1 billion of debt with the net proceeds of the Diversey sale. Depreciation and amortization is forecast to be approximately $165 million. We expect our adjusted tax rate to be approximately 28% for the full year 2017. Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be approximately $1.70. 
Our forecast for EPS is based on the current weighted average shares outstanding of 196 million. Keep in mind that we are no longer restricted on share buybacks. And to address dilution of the sale of Diversey, we will begin buying shares through open market purchases and accelerated share repurchases. We expect to fund the repurchase program with cash flow generation and net proceeds from the sale of Diversey. 
Let's turn to Slide 12 and review our outlook for free cash flow. To calculate our free cash flow outlook, our forecast is based on our estimated full year outlook for continuing operations and only the first 8 months of discontinued operations. Let me walk you through how we estimate our free cash flow for the year. 
We started with an estimated consolidated adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1 billion, with $825 million of expected EBITDA from continuing operations and $215 million from the first 8 months of discontinued operations, assuming an early September close. We anticipate cash interest payments to be $200 million and cash tax payments to be $160 million. Restructuring cash cost, excluding efforts dedicated to reducing unallocated and stranded costs, are estimated to be $50 million. Capital expenditures are forecast to be $175 million, of which, $165 million represents Sealed Air continuing operations expenditures. Restructuring-related CapEx is expected to be $25 million in 2017 and is included in the $175 million CapEx estimate. Working capital and other assets and liabilities is expected to be a use of cash of $65 million. As you know, our free cash flow is typically generated in the second half of the year, with the fourth quarter being our strongest quarter for cash generation, and that is especially true of the Diversey business. 
With these factors in mind, our forecast for free cash flow in 2017 is approximately $390 million, excluding cash payments related to the sale of Diversey. Looking beyond 2017, our targeted adjusted EBITDA conversion to free cash flow for continuing operations is 50% plus. 
I would like to discuss the gross and net proceeds of the sale as highlighted on Slide 13. Bain Capital is acquiring Diversey in an all-cash transaction valued at $3.2 billion. We expect to receive net cash proceeds of approximately $2.5 billion. Cash taxes are expected to be in the range of $250 million to $275 million. The pension liability transferring with Diversey is approximately $200 million, and transaction fees and separation costs are anticipated to be $70 million. Restructuring cost to address unallocated and stranded costs are estimated to be $50 million. The remaining balance includes other cost and debt-like obligations. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. Before we open the call to questions, I would like to remind you, our second quarter 2017 earnings call is tentatively scheduled for Thursday, August 3. 
With that, operator, can you please open the call for questions?"

So most of the delta from the guidance that we provided before, to the update for working capital and other, is largely driven because of the current planned close date for the transaction in early September. And also, your question about the restructuring, just to make sure we have clarity there. We had previously guided $85 million to $100 million in restructuring for 2017. As you see, we now have restructuring for continuing operations, excluding anything associated with the separation, at $50 million. And you also see, as we highlighted in the deck, that we have $50 million identified for restructuring associated with addressing stranded costs. So those 2 together, we are still within our $85 million to $100 million for 2017, although on the high end. We expect that the $50 million for the restructuring associated with stranded costs, that will actually spread mostly from Q4, and then into 2018 as we address those stranded costs."

But what you have seen is that we have actually -- what we have not seen, but what we have had is a somewhat flat pricing, but a negative price/mix. And you have seen that we have 3% to where -- that for the year, we said that we're going to have 3% to 4% constant dollar sales growth. The reality in the gross profit line is that we're seeing a slight degradation in the first quarter and it's going to be impacting also the second quarter because we have had hefty resin price increases, which we have not been able to immediately offset with our own price increases, which we have started. So we already are seeing some price increase, slight price increase in the first quarter, which is going to continue in the second quarter. But that's one part. One part is the slight margin compression that all of our competitors have had in food packaging and in product packaging and things like this because of the speed and how hefty those resin cost increases have been. The second thing is the mix. And in Product Care, we are growing, as we already told you in the previous quarters, much faster in e-commerce and fulfillment than in our industrial packaging. By the way, our industrial packaging is doing much better than it has done. We are seeing some lift. We're seeing some restoration of volume, which is very pleasant to see in an industrial GDP which is still not very good, but we're seeing this. But what is important to understand is that yes, we do have some lower value-added products temporarily in e-commerce. But we also have, and you need to remember that, have launched an equipment line. Two years ago, we didn't have any equipment product. We have a PACK EXPO last October, shown our new line of equipment and those are starting to ramp up. You can imagine that when your production starts to ramp up, you have lower margins because you have to absorb volume variances in your plan. And we are, by far, not at the margins we need to be in our equipment, but this is the nature of the beast. You ramp up your equipment, and when those are going to start kicking with sizable volume and we're doing -- we have a lot of momentum in that sector, we are going to improve our margin. This is why, and I'm concluding with this, this is why I said that short term, our margins in e-commerce 3PL are lower than our total margin. But that this is not going to be the case, over time."

And the reasons, once again, are hefty and quick resin increases and the product mix with regards to our equipment and our lower value-add products into e-commerce. So that's one. The second one is that we are -- in Food Care, we're seeing growth and we're satisfied with what's going on in there, and we are not seeing the major EBITDA contraction or lower growth than you were expecting.

So the $130 million includes the $25 million of unallocated -- and not to delve into technical generally accepted accounting principles, but just to note that all those costs are, they're a shift from discontinued to continuing operations because the accounting rules are very specific that unless something can be identified as a discrete cost, it can't fit in discontinued operations. So we have to pull it up into continuing operations. That's why we called it out. That will be the easiest part of the cost to exit. They will first largely be covered by approximately $23 million in transition service agreement proceeds. Over those agreements, they vary across all of the work stream. Some last 6 months, some are 12, some can go up to 18 months, but they should largely cover that $25 million. Then, in addition to that, I highlighted the $40 million, which we will work to exit 50% of that beginning at the close date and estimated we'll probably take approximately 24 months to exit those costs. And we have included in that $50 million in the restructuring to get to the net proceeds for the sale of the business to cover the exit of those costs. If we don't have the growth to be able to cover that $20 million that we're saying we're not exiting, obviously, we will have to take actions to address more than the $20 million because our goal is to continue to have quality of earnings via EBITDA growth as we see top line growth. It always doesn't happen smoothly one for one, depending on if we're growing in a certain sector and making investments such as with the e-commerce and fulfillment markets, where we're growing rapidly there. But we do plan to have year-over-year. Also, if we look at corporate -- either our corporate expenses or what we're investing within the businesses, Jerome has created a culture here at Sealed Air and we'll continue to manage that way. We have to earn the right to grow and earn the right to be able to spend and invest. And if the performance of the business level, or in total for the company, if we're not seeing that growth and that improvement in performance, we will very aggressively manage the cost."

And when you look at the -- specifically to the volume, we have had this past quarter about the double growth that we have had for a long time because our volume growth in New Sealed Air has been of about 0.8% to 0.7% in the first 3 quarters of last year and about 2% in the fourth quarter. So what you're seeing is that this growth has picked up. So Q4 volume growth for New Sealed Air was 2%. Q4 -- Q1 volume growth for the first quarter was 3.8%.

We will cover our second quarter and first half results, key drivers for the second half and how we are executing on our strategy. We will also provide an update on our sale of Diversey to Bain, use of proceeds and our share buyback program. And as we review our quarterly results and near-term business trends, you will see that our long-term profitable growth strategy is coming to fruition presently led by volume growth. You are now seeing renewed top line growth as a result of our Change the Game execution. 
In Product Care, our set strategy is to disproportionately grow our e-commerce and 3PL business and progressively transform it with automated fulfillment solutions that will over time give us equivalent margins to our industrial business. In Food Care, we are benefiting from our focused efforts to deliver unique, differentiated case-ready applications that align with protein processes productivity imperatives as retailers and consumers demand for longer shelf life and waste reduction. Our execution on our growth initiatives will continue to gain momentum. 
We are making the right investment and taking the correct actions where needed to drive additional and sustainable EBITDA growth. During our Analyst Day scheduled for the week of December 4, we will provide an update on our strategy in 2018 outlook and longer-term financial objectives. 
In reviewing our second quarter for continuing operations, sales of $1.1 billion were up 4% in constant dollars after delivering a 3% increase in the first quarter. Food Care sales were up 3% and Product Care sales were up 6%. The acceleration in both divisions was led by outstanding results in North America with growth of 9% in constant dollars on the heels of 6% growth in Q1. This is the highest level of growth we have delivered in North America since 2010. 
Adjusted EBITDA of [ $196 million ] increased from $182 million in the first quarter. Our divisions performed in line with our expectations, particularly in light of higher raw material cost and increased waist surcharges. 
In Product Care, we were faced with increased cost of [indiscernible] nylon, NDI and paper. And the price increases that we are announced in the spring did not produce the yield that we were expecting, therefore, we announced a second price increase effective September 1. Also, we have a temporary unfavorable mix impact in Product Care due to higher sales of utility products to our e-commerce and fulfillment operations. 
With that said, I cannot be more pleased with the execution of our automated solutions portfolio and the value it is bringing to our customers. Sales already increased more than 10% in the first half and the [indiscernible] plan continues to expand globally. 
In Food Care, we continue to see increased market penetration for our proprietary case-ready solutions and we are capitalizing on the North American beef cycle. To be fully transparent, we have been surprised by the magnitude of the impact on our business from the beef inspection scandal in Brazil. And as you all know, we have been faced with higher resin cost, which takes time to recover, given our formula pricing. We just started to see a turnaround in formula late in the second quarter. Before 2017, we are committed to achieving our financial objective and expect sequential EBITDA growth in both divisions in Q3 and Q4. Our second half results will benefit from a combination of higher sales of our differentiated solutions as well as our price and cost actions. 
With regards to our Diversey, our sales of Diversey to Bain is on track to close and we are committed to a successful separation. When we announced the sale in an late March, we also increased our share buyback program to address the dilution of the transaction. Following our May 9 earnings call into August 1, we repurchased 6.5 million shares for [ $285 million ] using a combination of open market repurchases and accelerated share repurchase program. We have approximately $1.9 billion remaining under our existing program. And once the transaction closes, we will have more flexibility with share repurchases, targeted M&A opportunities and, as previously discussed, we also plan to pay down our debts. 
Let me now turn to Slide 5 and briefly review our regional performance for Sealed Air for the second quarter. North America accounted for 55% of our net sales and as I noted, delivered impressive growth of 9% in constant dollars. Europe, Middle East, Africa, which accounted for 22% of our total net sales. Food Care sales in EMEA decline 1% year-over-year as positive sales trends in France, Italy and Spain were offset by weakness in the U.K., Russia and Germany. Product Care was down 2% primarily related to rationalization efforts in France and the softness in the industrial sector in the U.K. Excluding this rationalization, Product Care sales in EMEA were -- would've been down less than 1%. And this is, by the way, the last quarter that we will report a year-over-year impact from rationalization. Asia-Pacific represented 14% of net sales. In Food Care, APAC sales declined 7% due to the Australian beef market downcycle, which was partially offset by an increase of 11% in New Zealand and 6% in China. Product Care delivered double-digit growth in APAC led by 15% growth in Japan and 11% in China. In Latin America, which accounted for 9% of net sales, declined 4% in constant dollars. Food Care was badly hit by Brazil and to a lesser extent, the economies weakness in Argentina. On the contrary, Mexico was our fastest-growing country in LATAM with 9% growth. 
Turning to Slide 6, which highlights volume and price mixtures by division and by region. You can see that this slide -- from this slide that on a global basis, volume trends were up 4% in the second quarter led by 9% volume growth in North America. Price/mix was essentially neutral to our overall sales performance. In Food Care, I want to highlight that for the first time since the first quarter of [ 2016, ] North America delivered a favorable price/mix due to the continued adoption of our case-ready platform and the timing of raw material cost pass-through. And in Product Care, unfavorable price/mix in North America was partially offset by the positive impact of our rationalization on product mix in EMEA. 
And now let's turn to Slide 7 and review Food Care results in more detail. Food Care delivered $680 million in net sales in the second quarter and adjusted EBITDA of $146 million or 21.5% of net sales. As illustrated in the EBITDA bridge provided on this slide, higher volumes in cost management were offset by a negative price/mix and flat cost price. Strength in North America was driven by an improved protein production in all market segments led by the beef sector with a 5% increase in slaughter rates and the adoption of case-ready applications across all proteins. And looking ahead to Q3 and Q4, we expect North America to be our fastest-growing region yet at a slightly more motivated pace. Keep in mind that our second half is facing tougher comps as cattle production started to increase in the second half of last year. Therefore, the industry is forecasting production to be at a more measured rate of 3% to 4%. 
EMEA accounted -- which accounted for 22% of Food Care sales was essentially flat compared with last year as follows [indiscernible] [ first ] quarter. Food Care equipment sales return to growth 1 quarter earlier than anticipated. And I would add that the pipeline for both materials and equipment is nicely improving. Multiple penetration for our case-ready solutions, including our Darfresh platform, ready meals and [indiscernible], which continue to increase. This is the primary driver for higher equipment sales and our anticipated improved performance in EMEA in the second half. 
APAC accounts for 14% of Food Care, with Australia and New Zealand accounting for close to 70% of our sales in this region. This production in Australia was down approximately 12% in the second quarter as cattle farmers continue to rebuilding their herds. We have easier comps heading into the second half, however, we are not anticipating growth in this region until late 2018. 
Latin America represents the remaining 12% of sales with Mexico, Brazil and Argentina accounting for approximately [ 75% ] of Food Care sales. Our business in Mexico increased 9% in constant dollars as we continue to penetrate the market with our advanced solutions. Despite the current events in Brazil and the economic situation in Argentina, we continue to view LATAM as a region with significant growth potential. And as such, we recently closed the acquisition of Deltaplam, which is a $25 million net sales Brazilian manufacturer of flexible packaging. Deltaplam utilizes superior extrusion technology to create recyclable high-value solutions, and this acquisition strengthens our position in Latin America, expands our portfolio of consumer unit package solutions and extends our reach into several new market segments. For the full year of 2017, we expect Food Care to increase [ sales ] 3% in constant dollars led by North America and improving trends in EMEA. We expect sequential growth in EBITDA in Q3 and Q4 largely due to timing of our raw material cost pass-through. 
Slide 8 highlights results for our Product Care division. Product Care net sales were $391 million and adjusted EBITDA was $77 million or 19.7% of net sales. Similar to Food Care, you can see the EBITDA bridge that higher volumes and cost management were offset by a negative mix and price/cost spread. North America and EMEA accounts for approximately 85% of Product Care sales. E-commerce and fulfillment are our fastest-growing sectors in both of these regions and we are starting to see a rebound in some areas with the industrial segments. Sales in APAC were [ up ] 10% in constant dollars led by Japan and China, where we are experiencing its increased demand for our different shaded solutions portfolio, including Sealed Air inflatable and automated equipment. We are increasing our market presence in this region and have expanded our local manufacturing capabilities to support that growth. 
For the full year 2017, we continue to anticipate topline sales growth in the range of 3% to 4%. We expect sequential EBITDA improvement in Q3 and Q4 as a result of cost management coupled with pricing actions. And as compared to last year, our third quarter is expected to be flat to down with year-on-year growth returning in the fourth quarter. For the full year 2017, we expect adjusted EBITDA in Product Care to be essentially in line with 2016 as a result of segment mix and the timing of recovery of raw material cost. 
Let me now call -- pass the call to Carol to review our net sales and adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow and our outlook for 2017. Carol?"
382724,530181731,1271419,"Sealed Air Corporation, Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Aug 08, 2017",2017-08-08,"Earnings Calls","Sealed Air Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Jerome.

Let's turn to Slide 9 and 10, which provides the sales and EBITDA bridges purchase for Q2 and the first half 2017. Jerome has provided comments on our soldiers in the quarter and first half of the year, so my comments will focus on the bottom of Slide 9, which highlights our second quarter adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations on a year-over-year basis. 
Adjusted EBITDA was $196 million. Volume contributed $19 million in Q2, which was offset by unfavorable mix and price/cost spread of $20 million. Operating expenses decreased $5 million and restructuring savings were $2 million. Currency had an unfavorable impact on adjusted EBITDA of $2 million. Unallocated costs were $3 million in the second quarter 2017 as compared to $4 million in the second quarter 2016. Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.35 in the second quarter compared to $0.37 in Q2 2016. Our adjusted tax rate for continuing operations in Q2 2017 was 39% compared to 32% in Q2 2016. The adjusted tax rate in the second quarter 2017 was impacted by our mix of earnings and higher tax jurisdictions. 
On Slide 10, we present our first half sales and EBITDA bridges. Higher volumes in the first half of the year were essentially offset by unfavorable mix and price/cost spread. 
On Slide 11, free cash flow as presented on a consolidated basis, which includes results from continuing and discontinued operations. For the 6 months ended June 30, consolidated free cash flow, excluding payments related to the sale of Diversey, was a force of cash of $93 million. CapEx was $93 million. Cash interest payments were $105 million and restructuring costs were $33 million. Aligned with our typical free cash flow seasonality, working capital and other assets and liabilities were a use of cash of $110 million. Payments related to the sale of Diversey were $45 million, of which, $33 million relates to our cash tax payment that secured certain benefits, enabling us to divest Diversey in a tax efficient manner. This cash tax payment was included in our gross to net proceeds calculation, which we estimated cash tax payments in the range of $250 million to $275 million. 
Turning to our outlook on Slide 12. We are on track to achieve approximately $4.3 billion in net sales or more than 3% constant dollar growth. This forecast assumes increases of 3% in Food Care and 3% to 4% and Product Care. We expect our topline performance to be driven largely by volume in both divisions. 2017 adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations is expected to be in the range of $825 million to $835 million as compared with our previous guidance of approximately $825 million. Corporate expenses are now expected to be $125 million, which includes $20 million of unallocated costs related to discontinued operations. As a reminder, these unallocated costs consist of functional support and related expenses previously allocated to Diversey care and hygiene solutions that do not qualify for discontinued operations. 
Our net interest expense for 2017 is estimated at $190 million with the assumption that we pay down $1.1 billion of debt in 2017. Depreciation and amortization is forecast at $160 million. We continue to expect our adjusted tax rate to be 28% for the full year 2017. Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $1.75 to $1.80 compared to our previous guidance of approximately $1.70. Our adjusted earnings per share outlook is based on 193 million shares, which reflect the weighted average full year effect of share repurchases through August 1. 
Currency is not expected to have a material impact on net sales, adjusted EBITDA or adjusted earnings per share for the full year 2017. Our major currency exposures include the euro, which was approximately 13% of net sales in Q2; Australian dollar, 5%; and the Mexican peso, British pound, Canadian dollar and Brazilian real were each approximately 3% of net sales. 
Turning to Slide 13. We will review our outlook for free cash flow. Our forecast for free cash flow in 2017 is approximately $400 million. This forecast excludes cash payments related to the sale of Diversey. To calculate our free cash flow outlook, we started with an estimated consolidated adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1 billion, which includes our full year 2017 outlook from continuing operations plus $215 million from the first 8 months of discontinued operations assuming a September close. We anticipate cash interest payments to be $200 million and cash tax payments to be $160 million. Restructuring cash cost, excluding efforts dedicated to reducing unallocated and stranded costs, are estimated to be $50 million. Capital expenditures are forecast to be $175 million, of which, $165 million represents Sealed Air continuing operations. Restructuring-related CapEx is expected at $25 million in 2017 and it is included in the $175 million total CapEx estimate. Working capital and other assets and liabilities is expected to be a use of cash of approximately $65 million. As you know, a large portion of our free cash flow is typically generated in the second half of the year with the fourth quarter being our strongest quarter for cash generation. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. Before I open the call to questions, I would like to note that our third quarter 2017 earnings call is tentatively scheduled for Wednesday, November 8th.

We had a strategy, which is about differentiating ourselves from competition and introducing our Change the Game strategy. This is clearly ongoing because actually, it shows in our product mix. New products don't necessarily have the margins that we will have when they reach bigger volumes and things like this. New product introduction can be somewhat costly. But at the very same time, you're seeing this volume growth and these trends, which are very, very different from what you have seen in the industry. And as a result of that, you've got to ask yourself again, what's going on? What is going on is that the evolution of our portfolio is ongoing and that we are passing cost increases -- our cost increases. And this is something that we know how to do and when we're not 100% successful, we just come back later on. And it's not so much about pricing of competition. It is about the execution on our strategy, some tactical things. And if we don't get it right away, we just come back. The reality is that in Food Care, our case-ready applications are ongoing everywhere. This is not a North American phenomenon, and we're seeing this through our equipment sales. Our equipment sales are strong and our oldest book is something very strong. This is going to happen later in this year and this is also going to continue next year. And what we're seeing there is that the -- it's about replacement equipment and it's also about new installs. This is not in North America only. This is in North America as there is a need for automation in newer and more performing equipment. This is the case in Latin America, which is making us also very positive about the fact that there are long-term strengths here to come. This is also in Australia and New Zealand. So what you're seeing is our customers investing in new type of equipment. It can be Darfresh On Tray, it can be Darfresh VSP technology, et cetera, but we see a very strong trend. What you're also seeing in Product Care is that we are going through a trend, this evolution of our portfolio and our segment sales. E-commerce and 3PLs is here to grow. It is, for us, a very important segment. And we are seeing equipment introduction again all over the world, replacing equipment in Japan. You saw tremendous growth in China, in North America. The oldest book in Europe is also very strong. And this is something, which is a fundamental trend in our portfolio. Short term, the number that I gave you, 79% increase in the last 12 months on paper, NDI, 30% off in Europe, [ 2 ] [indiscernible] in China versus last -- same time last year, nylon Dublin and things like this almost, are things that are short-term headwinds, but we know how to deal with that. We have proven to you over the past few years that we deal properly and we pass our cost increases."

This is a trend. We have 2 very strong offering here. [ Four ] corrugated boxes, our I-Pack and e-Cube product line improved dimensional weight costing. And our sales wrap and FloWrap equipment and the generations to come, which we are going to present at PACK EXPO later in the year, are tremendous substitutes for boxes.

But there's a little bit of momentum there. You have some producers who have announced price increases for July that did not something that have been announced for -- that have been pushed for August. And then you have some more announcements, which have been done for September. So you've got some of those things gains on right now.

We believe that our fourth quarter is going to be very strong and the most important thing is to see that this Change the Game, which was in doubt in 2016 that we were believing was coming, is definitely coming. This is why we're having that growth momentum right now, which we didn't have in 2016 and which in general, the industry doesn't have."

First is just aside from paying down debt and buying back shares to offset the dilution once the deal closes, what is your just overarching strategic plan for the new company? Do you eventually plan to grow by acquisition? Or what exactly do you have in mind? Obviously, EBITDA over the last 8 quarters or so has been kind of flat to down. It's just been hard to generate organic EBITDA growth. So what do you have in mind longer term post the deal closing?"

It is very important to understand who we are. We're not a sample packaging company. We are solutions driven and our margins will expand as we expand the value of our solutions to our customers. That is very clear and there is a fundamental megatrend in the way we are working with our customers. They respond. We are the very big player in the sectors of protein and in the sector of Protective Packaging to our solutions. We are. That is the way we're going. So we're not going to only buy back share and pay down debt. We are starting to look at some potential acquisition targets. Multiples are very high. Generally speaking, acquisitions do not return shareholder value traditionally or most of them don't. There is a vast majority of acquisitions do not generate shareholder value in general. And when you look at the multiple right now, you have to be careful. This Deltaplam, very small acquisition, is a very good example of a small acquisition in a given country where we do believe that there is potential. It was the right time at the right place with the right equipment and technology. They have fabulous equipment and that is going to be a very nice little acquisition. We're looking at some others. At the very same time, you have to understand that we've been very, very busy with the separation of Diversey.  Therefore, we're not going to rush into things right away. We are working diligently and with discipline on the next step, but we are going to be doing acquisitions over time."

We're seeing that you have equipment being sold and placed and ordered by red meat producers. And we are -- I was in Brazil 3 weeks ago, and just talking to all of those customers and they believe that the slaughter rates are going to start increase sometime in the third quarter and into the fourth quarter. So this is not a long-term trend. This is specific to Brazil, given the scandals that have happened. Then, you look at Argentina and Argentina is seeing its consumption go up by 2%, which is very little. And you see the exports going up nicely at increasing in year-to-date by 38%, except that Argentina is not a big meat producer anymore. It is the #17 meat exporter -- sorry, not producer, exporter. It is the 17th largest exporter of meat and much smaller than it was a decade ago. That is for Argentina and Brazil. You are seeing -- we are seeing some positives in other countries. Very strong business in Mexico where we have extraordinary positions. I was there last week. I can assure you that the trends are very, very positive there. We're seeing nice trends in the second quarter in Chile for fish production where we participate very nicely there.

We will cover our second quarter and first half results, key drivers for the second half and how we are executing on our strategy. We will also provide an update on our sale of Diversey to Bain, use of proceeds",1810,"Thank you, Lori, and good morning, everyone. We will cover our second quarter and first half results, key drivers for the second half and how we are executing on our strategy. We will also provide an update on our sale of Diversey to Bain, use of proceeds and our share buyback program. And as we review our quarterly results and near-term business trends, you will see that our long-term profitable growth strategy is coming to fruition, presently led by volume growth. You are now seeing renewed top line growth as a result of our Change the Game execution. 
In Product Care, our set strategy is to disproportionately grow our e-commerce and 3PL business and progressively transform it with automated fulfillment solutions that will, over time, give us equivalent margins to our industrial business. 
In Food Care, we are benefiting from our focused efforts to deliver unique, differentiated, case-ready applications that align with protein processes' productivity imperatives and retailers' and consumers' demand for longer shelf life and waste reduction. Our execution on our growth initiatives will continue to gain momentum. We are making the right investments and taking the correct actions where needed to drive additional and sustainable EBITDA growth. 
During our Analyst Day scheduled for the week of December 4, we will provide an update on our strategy and 2018 outlook and longer-term financial objectives. 
In reviewing our second quarter for continuing operations, sales of $1.1 billion were up 4% in constant dollars after delivering a 3% increase in the first quarter. Food Care sales were up 3%, and Product Care sales were up 6%. The acceleration in both divisions was led by outstanding results in North America, with growth of 9% in constant dollars on the heel of 6% growth in Q1. This is the highest level of growth we have delivered in North America since 2010. 
Adjusted EBITDA of $196 million increased from $182 million in the first quarter. Our divisions performed in line with our expectations, particularly in light of higher raw material cost and increased freight surcharges. 
In Product Care, we were faced with increased cost of olefin, nylon, NDI and paper. And the price increases that we announced in the spring did not produce the yield that we were expecting. Therefore, we announced a second price increase effective September 1. Also, we have a temporary unfavorable mix impact in Product Care due to higher sales of utility products to our e-commerce and fulfilling operations. With that said, I cannot be more pleased with the execution of our automated solutions portfolio and the value it is bringing to our customers. Sales already increased more than 10% in the first half, and the pipeline continues to expand globally. 
In Food Care, we continue to see increased market penetration for our proprietary, case-ready solutions, and we are capitalizing on the North American beef cycle. To be fully transparent, we have been surprised by the magnitude of the impact on our business from the beef inspection scandal in Brazil. And as you all know, we have been faced with higher resin costs, which takes time to recover, given our formula pricing. We just started to see a turnaround in formulas late in the second quarter. But for 2017, we are committed to achieving our financial objective and expect sequential EBITDA growth in both divisions in Q3 and Q4. Our second half results will benefit from a combination of higher sales of our differentiated solution as well as our price and cost actions. 
With regards to our Diversey. Our sales of Diversey to Bain is on track to close, and we are committed to a successful separation. When we announced the sale in late March, we also increased our share buyback program to address the dilution of the transaction. Following our May 9 earnings call into August 1, we repurchased 6.5 million shares for $285 million using a combination of open-market repurchases and accelerated share repurchase program. We have approximately $1.9 billion remaining under our existing program. And once the transaction closes, we will have more flexibility with share repurchases; targeted M&A opportunity; and as previously discussed, we also plan to pay down our debt. 
Let me now turn to Slide 5 and briefly review our regional performance for Sealed Air for the second quarter. North America accounted for 55% of our net sales and as I noted, delivered impressive growth of 9% in constant dollars. Europe, Middle East, Africa, which accounted for 22% of our total net sales. Food Care sales in EMEA declined 1% year-over-year as positive sales trends in France, Italy and Spain were offset by weakness in the U.K., Russia and Germany. Product Care was down 2%, primarily related to rationalization efforts in France and the softness in the industrial sector in the U.K. Excluding this rationalization, Product Care sales in EMEA were -- would have been down less than 1%. And this is, by the way, the last quarter that we will report a year-over-year impact from rationalization. Asia Pacific represented 14% of net sales. In Food Care, APAC sales declined 7% due to the Australian beef market down cycle, which was partially offset by an increase of 11% in New Zealand and 6% in China. Product Care delivered double-digit growth in APAC, led by 15% growth in Japan and 11% in China. And Latin America, which accounted for 9% of net sales, declined 4% in constant dollars. Food Care was badly hit by Brazil and to a lesser extent, the economic weakness in Argentina. On the contrary, Mexico was our fastest-growing country in LatAm with 9% growth. 
Turning to Slide 6, which highlights volume and price mix trends by division and by region. You can see that this slide -- from this slide that on a global basis, volume trends were up 4% in the second quarter led by 9% volume growth in North America. Price/mix was essentially neutral to our overall sales performance. In Food Care, I want to highlight that for the first time since the third quarter of 2015, North America delivered a favorable price/mix due to the continued adoption of our case-ready platform and the timing of raw material cost pass-through. And in Product Care, unfavorable price/mix in North America was partially offset by the positive impact of our rationalization in -- on product mix in EMEA. 
And now let's turn to Slide 7 and review Food Care results in more detail. Food Care delivered $680 million in net sales in the second quarter and adjusted EBITDA of $146 million or 21.5% of net sales. As illustrated in the EBITDA bridge provided on this slide, higher volumes and cost management were offset by a negative price/mix and price/cost spread. Strength in North America was driven by improved protein production in all market segments led by the beef sector with a 5% increase in slaughter rates and the adoption of case-ready applications across all proteins. And looking ahead to Q3 and Q4, we expect North America to be our fastest-growing region, yet at a slightly more moderated pace. Keep in mind that our second half is facing tougher comps as cattle production started to increase in the second half of last year. Therefore, the industry is forecasting production to be at a more measured rate of 3% to 4%. 
EMEA accounted -- which accounted for 22% of Food Care sales, was essentially flat compared with last year as it follows a tough first quarter. Food Care equipment sales returned to growth 1 quarter earlier than anticipated, and I would add that the pipeline for both materials and equipment is nicely improving. Multiple penetration for our case-ready solutions, including our Darfresh platform, ready meals and ovenables, will continue to increase. This is the primary driver for higher equipment sales and our anticipated improved performance in EMEA in the second half. 
APAC accounts for 14% of Food Care, with Australia and New Zealand accounting for close to 70% of our sales in this region. Beef production in Australia was down approximately 12% in the second quarter as cattle farmers continue to rebuilding their herds. We have easier comps heading into the second half. However, we are not anticipating growth in this region until late 2018. 
Latin America represents the remaining 12% of sales, with Mexico, Brazil and Argentina accounting for approximately 75% of Food Care sales. Our business in Mexico increased 9% in constant dollars as we continue to penetrate the market with our advanced solutions. Despite the current events in Brazil and the economic situation in Argentina, we continue to view LatAm as a region with significant growth potential. And as such, we recently closed the acquisition of Deltaplam, which is a $25 million net sales Brazilian manufacturer of flexible packaging. Deltaplam utilizes superior extrusion technology to create recyclable, high-value solutions, and this acquisition strengthens our position in Latin America, expands our portfolio of consumer unit packaged solutions and extends our reach into several new market segments. For the full year of 2017, we expect Food Care to increase sales 3% in constant dollars led by North America and improving trends in EMEA. We expect sequential growth in EBITDA in Q3 and Q4, largely due to timing of our raw materials cost pass-through. 
Slide 8 highlights results for our Product Care division. Product Care net sales were $391 million, and adjusted EBITDA was $77 million or 19.7% of net sales. Similar to Food Care, you can see in the EBITDA bridge that higher volumes and cost management were offset by a negative mix and price/cost spread. North America and EMEA account for approximately 85% of Product Care sales. E-commerce and fulfillment are our fastest-growing sectors in both of these regions, and we are starting to see a rebound in some areas with industrial segments. Sales in APAC were up 10% in constant dollars, led by Japan and China, where we are experiencing its increased demand for our differentiated solutions portfolio, including Fill-Air inflatable and automated equipment. We are increasing our market presence in this region and have expanded our local manufacturing capabilities to support that growth. 
For the full -- the year 2017, we continue to anticipate top line sales growth in the range of 3% to 4%. We expect sequential EBITDA improvement in Q3 and Q4 as a result of cost management, coupled with pricing actions. And as compared to last year, our third quarter is expected to be flat to down, with year-on-year growth returning in the fourth quarter. For the full year 2017, we expect adjusted EBITDA in Product Care to be essentially in line with 2016 as a result of segment mix and the timing of recovery of raw material cost. 
Let me now call -- pass the call to Carol to review our net sales and adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow and our outlook for 2017. Carol?"

Let's turn to Slides 9 and 10, which provide the sales and EBITDA bridges for Q2 and the first half 2017. Jerome has provided comments on our sales trends in the quarter and first half of the year, so my comments will focus on the bottom of Slide 9, which highlights our second quarter adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations on a year-over-year basis. 
Adjusted EBITDA was $196 million. Volume contributed $19 million in Q2, which was offset by unfavorable mix and price/cost spread of $20 million. Operating expenses decreased $5 million, and restructuring savings were $2 million. Currency had an unfavorable impact on adjusted EBITDA of $2 million. Unallocated costs were $3 million in the second quarter 2017 as compared to $4 million in the second quarter 2016. Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.35 in the second quarter compared to $0.37 in Q2 2016. Our adjusted tax rate for continuing operations in Q2 2017 was 39% compared to 32% in Q2 2016. The adjusted tax rate in the second quarter 2017 was impacted by our mix of earnings and higher tax jurisdictions. 
On Slide 10, we present our first half sales and EBITDA bridges. Higher volumes in the first half of the year were essentially offset by unfavorable mix and price/cost spread. 
On Slide 11, free cash flow is presented on a consolidated basis, which includes results from continuing and discontinued operations. For the 6 months ended June 30, consolidated free cash flow, excluding payments related to the sale of Diversey, was a source of cash of $93 million. CapEx was $93 million. Cash interest payments were $105 million, and restructuring costs were $33 million. Aligned with our typical free cash flow seasonality, working capital and other assets and liabilities were a use of cash of $110 million. Payments related to the sale of Diversey were $45 million, of which $33 million relates to a cash tax payment that secured certain benefits, enabling us to divest Diversey in a tax-efficient manner. This cash tax payment was included in our gross to net proceeds calculation, which we estimated cash tax payments in the range of $250 million to $275 million. 
Turning to our outlook on Slide 12. We are on track to achieve approximately $4.3 billion in net sales or more than 3% constant dollar growth. This forecast assumes increases of 3% in Food Care and 3% to 4% in Product Care. We expect our top line performance to be driven largely by volume in both divisions. 2017 adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations is expected to be in the range of $825 million to $835 million as compared with our previous guidance of approximately $825 million. Corporate expenses are now expected to be $125 million, which includes $20 million of unallocated costs related to discontinued operations. As a reminder, these unallocated costs consist of functional support and related expenses previously allocated to Diversey Care and hygiene solutions that do not qualify for discontinued operations. 
Our net interest expense for 2017 is estimated at $190 million, with the assumption that we pay down $1.1 billion of debt in 2017. Depreciation and amortization is forecast at $160 million. We continue to expect our adjusted tax rate to be 28% for the full year 2017. Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $1.75 to $1.80 compared to our previous guidance of approximately $1.70. Our adjusted earnings per share outlook is based on 193 million shares, which reflects the weighted average full year effect of share repurchases through August 1. 
Currency is not expected to have a material impact on net sales, adjusted EBITDA or adjusted earnings per share for the full year 2017. Our major currency exposures include the euro, which was approximately 13% of net sales in Q2; Australian dollar, 5%; and the Mexican peso, British pound, Canadian dollar and Brazilian real were each approximately 3% of net sales. 
Turning to Slide 13, we will review our outlook for free cash flow. Our forecast for free cash flow in 2017 is approximately $400 million. This forecast excludes cash payments related to the sale of Diversey. To calculate our free cash flow outlook, we started with an estimated consolidated adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1 billion, which includes our full year 2017 outlook from continuing operations, plus $215 million from the first 8 months of discontinued operations assuming a September close. We anticipate cash interest payments to be $200 million and cash tax payments to be $160 million. 
Restructuring cash costs, excluding efforts dedicated to reducing unallocated and stranded costs, are estimated to be $50 million. Capital expenditures are forecast to be $175 million, of which, $165 million represents Sealed Air continuing operations. Restructuring-related CapEx is expected at $25 million in 2017, and it is included in the $175 million total CapEx estimate. Working capital and other assets and liabilities is expected to be a use of cash of approximately $65 million. As you know, a large portion of our free cash flow is typically generated in the second half of the year, with the fourth quarter being our strongest quarter for cash generation. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. Before I open the call to questions, I would like to note that our third quarter 2017 earnings call is tentatively scheduled for Wednesday, November 8. 
With that, operator, can you please open the call for questions?"

We had a strategy, which is about differentiating ourselves from competition and introducing our Change the Game strategy. You -- this is clearly ongoing because, actually, it shows in our product mix. New products don't necessarily have the margins that we'll have when they reach bigger volumes and things like this. New product introduction can be somewhat costly. But at the very same time, you're seeing this volume growth and these trends, which are very, very different from what you are seeing in the industry. And as a result of that, you've got to ask yourself, what's going on? What is going on is that the evolution of our portfolio is ongoing and that we are passing cost increases -- our cost increases. And this is something that we know how to do. And when we're not 100% successful, we just come back later on. And it's not so much about pricing of competition. It is about the execution on our strategy, some tactical things. And if we don't get it right, right away, we just come back. The reality is that in Food Care, our case-ready applications are ongoing everywhere. This is not a North American phenomenon, and we're seeing this through our equipment sales. Our equipment sales are strong, and our orders book is very strong. This is going to happen later in this year, and this is also going to continue next year. And what we're seeing there is that the -- it's about replacement equipment and it's also about new installs. This is not in North America only. This is in North America as there is a need for automation and newer and more performing equipment. This is the case in Latin America, which is making us also very positive about the fact that there are long-term strengths here to come. This is also in Australia and New Zealand. So what you're seeing is our customer investing in new type of equipment. It can be Darfresh On Tray. It can be Darfresh VSP technology, et cetera, but we see a very strong trend. What you're also seeing in Product Care is that we are going through a tremendous evolution of our portfolio and our segment sales. E-commerce and 3PL is here to grow. It is, for us, a very important segment. And we are seeing equipment introduction again all over the world, replacing equipment in Japan. You saw tremendous growth in China, in North America. The orders book in Europe is also very strong. And this is something which is a fundamental trend in our portfolio. Short term, the numbers that I gave you, 79% increase in the last 12 months on paper; NDI, 30% up in Europe, [ 2 ] in China versus last -- the same time last year; nylon doubling and things like this, almost, are things that are short-term headwinds, but we know how to deal with that. We have proven to you over the past few years that we deal properly and we pass our cost increases."

There is a trend in e-commerce, and this trend is that corrugated cardboard prices are going up dramatically and that as a result of that, you are going to see more and more pouchers, which are enabling lower dimension and weight costing for shipping and lower cost of packaging. This is a trend. We have 2 very strong offering here. For boxes, our I-Pack and e-Cube product line improved dimensional weight costing. And our StealthWrap and FloWrap equipment and the generations to come, which we are going to present at PACK EXPO later in the year, are tremendous substitutes for boxes. So we have a huge momentum in e-commerce 3PL, and this is, therefore, accelerating our sales growth in Product Care.

As a positive negative, we're a little bit concerned with polyethylene prices. We were anticipating that they were going to start to come down in September. And right now, we have some producers who are already just talking about price increases on the heels of possible hurricane. I mean, this is the last -- this is the most fun thing that you can hear, but there is a little bit of momentum there. You have some producers who have announced price increases for July that did not happen that's been announced for -- that's been pushed to August. And then you have some more announcements, which have been done for September. So you've got some of those gains on right now.

So that's why we're seeing that. Next to that, we are -- our -- we're very determined to get our price increase through, and we might suffer a little bit from volume in some more commoditized segments in there.

This is -- this has been much -- the impact has been much bigger than anyone could anticipate. The exports have been impacted also. Our view is that this is temporary. We're seeing that it's stabilizing. We're seeing that you have equipment being sold and placed and ordered by red meat producers. And we are -- I was in Brazil 3 weeks ago and just talking to all of those customers, and they believe that the slaughter rates are going to start to increase sometime in the third quarter and into the fourth quarter. So this is not a long-term trend. This is specific to Brazil, given the scandals that have happened. Then you look at Argentina, and Argentina is seeing its consumption go up by 2%, which is very little. And you see the exports going up nicely at -- increasing in year-to-date by 38%, except that Argentina is not a big meat producer anymore. It is the #17 meat exporter -- sorry, not producer, exporter. It is the 17th largest exporter of meat and much smaller than it was a decade ago. That is for Argentina and Brazil. You are seeing -- we're seeing some positives in other countries. Very strong business in Mexico, where we have extraordinary position. Is was there last week. I can assure you that the trends are very, very positive there. We're seeing nice trends in the second quarter in Chile for fish production, where we participate very nicely there.

It's positive also for us because all of that is packed with our bags, and we are really happy going -- to see what's going on there. With regards to e-commerce, yes, we have a product mix. Very nice. We have segment mix, which, at this point in time, is negative. We made no mystery about that already last year. What we were not seeing is the growth that we think. What you have to understand is that we're having positions. We're building with our new business with our customers. And what I talked about last quarter is something that is happening, which is that it takes time to go and sell equipment. It is a capital spending for our customers. This is not a consumable. So on one side, you'll have margin squeezed a little bit to the very strong and steep increases of raw materials, paper, polyethylene, nylon, et cetera, which are ingredients, which are raw materials for our mailers, for our phones, for our Bubble Wrap, et cetera. And -- but we can get over that. And next to that, you have this capital equipment. The very strong sign is that our sales of equipment in Product Care year-to-date are up 10% compared to last year, knowing that we had some StealthWrap and FloWrap and also made its core view, which were equipment which were prototypes shown in -- at PACK EXPO last year, we're seeing a very nice momentum in there that's going to accelerate.

We will cover our second quarter and first half results, key drivers for the second half and how we are executing on our strategy. We will also provide an update on our sale of Diversey to Bain, use of proceeds and our share buyback program. And as we review our quarterly results and near-term business trends, you will see that our long-term profitable growth strategy is coming to fruition, presently led by volume growth. You are now seeing renewed top line growth as a result of our Change the Game execution.
In Product Care, our stated strategy is to disproportionately grow our e-commerce and 3PL business and progressively transform it with automated fulfillment solutions that will over time give us equivalent margins to our industrial business.
In Food Care, we are benefiting from our focused efforts to deliver unique, differentiated, case-ready applications that align with protein processors' productivity imperatives and retailers' and consumers' demand for longer shelf life and waste reduction. Our execution on our growth initiatives will continue to gain momentum. We are making the right investments and taking the correct actions where needed to drive additional and sustainable EBITDA growth.
During our Analyst Day scheduled for the week of December 4, we will provide an update on our strategy and 2018 outlook and longer-term financial objectives.
In reviewing our second quarter for continuing operations, sales of $1.1 billion were up 4% in constant dollars after delivering a 3% increase in the first quarter. Food Care sales were up 3%, and Product Care sales were up 6%. The acceleration in both divisions was led by outstanding results in North America, with growth of 9% in constant dollars on the heel of 6% growth in Q1. This is the highest level of growth we have delivered in North America since 2010.
Adjusted EBITDA of $196 million increased from $182 million in the first quarter. Our divisions performed in line with our expectations, particularly in light of higher raw material cost and increased freight surcharges.
In Product Care, we were faced with increased cost of olefin, nylon, NDI and paper. And the price increases that we announced in the spring did not produce the yield that we were expecting. Therefore, we announced a second price increase effective September 1. Also, we have a temporary unfavorable mix impact in Product Care due to higher sales of utility products to our e-commerce and fulfilling operations. With that said, I cannot be more pleased with the execution of our automated solutions portfolio and the value it is bringing to our customers. Sales already increased more than 10% in the first half, and the pipeline continues to expand globally.
In Food Care, we continue to see increased market penetration for our proprietary, case-ready solutions, and we are capitalizing on the North American beef cycle. To be fully transparent, we have been surprised by the magnitude of the impact on our business from the beef inspection scandal in Brazil. And as you all know, we have been faced with higher resin costs, which takes time to recover, given our formula pricing. We just started to see a turnaround in formulas late in the second quarter. But for 2017, we are committed to achieving our financial objective and expect sequential EBITDA growth in both divisions in Q3 and Q4. Our second half results will benefit from a combination of higher sales of our differentiated solution as well as our price and cost actions.
With regards to our Diversey. Our sales of Diversey to Bain is on track to close, and we are committed to a successful separation. When we announced the sale in late March, we also increased our share buyback program to address the dilution of the transaction. Following our May 9 earnings call into August 1, we repurchased 6.5 million shares for $285 million using a combination of open-market repurchases and accelerated share repurchase program. We have approximately $1.9 billion remaining under our existing program. And once the transaction closes, we will have more flexibility with share repurchases; targeted M&A opportunity; and as previously discussed, we also plan to pay down our debt.
Let me now turn to Slide 5 and briefly review our regional performance for Sealed Air for the second quarter. North America accounted for 55% of our net sales and, as I noted, delivered impressive growth of 9% in constant dollars. Europe, Middle East, Africa, which accounted for 22% of our total net sales. Food Care sales in EMEA declined 1% year-over-year as positive sales trends in France, Italy and Spain were offset by weakness in the U.K., Russia and Germany. Product Care was down 2%, primarily related to rationalization efforts in France and the softness in the industrial sector in the U.K. Excluding this rationalization, Product Care sales in EMEA were -- would have been down less than 1%. And this is, by the way, the last quarter that we will report a year-over-year impact from rationalization. Asia Pacific represented 14% of net sales. In Food Care, APAC sales declined 7% due to the Australian beef market down cycle, which was partially offset by an increase of 11% in New Zealand and 6% in China. Product Care delivered double-digit growth in APAC, led by 15% growth in Japan and 11% in China. And Latin America, which accounted for 9% of net sales, declined 4% in constant dollars. Food Care was badly hit by Brazil and to a lesser extent, the economic weakness in Argentina. On the contrary, Mexico was our fastest-growing country in LatAm with 9% growth.
Turning to Slide 6, which highlights volume and price mix trends by division and by region. You can see that this slide -- from this slide that on a global basis, volume trends were up 4% in the second quarter led by 9% volume growth in North America. Price/mix was essentially neutral to our overall sales performance. In Food Care, I want to highlight that for the first time since the third quarter of 2015, North America delivered a favorable price/mix due to the continued adoption of our case-ready platform and the timing of raw material cost pass-through. And in Product Care, unfavorable price/mix in North America was partially offset by the positive impact of our rationalization in -- on product mix in EMEA.
And now let's turn to Slide 7 and review Food Care results in more detail. Food Care delivered $680 million in net sales in the second quarter and adjusted EBITDA of $146 million or 21.5% of net sales. As illustrated in the EBITDA bridge provided on this slide, higher volumes and cost management were offset by a negative price/mix and price/cost spread. Strength in North America was driven by improved protein production in all market segments led by the beef sector with a 5% increase in slaughter rates and the adoption of case-ready applications across all proteins. And looking ahead to Q3 and Q4, we expect North America to be our fastest-growing region, yet at a slightly more moderated pace. Keep in mind that our second half is facing tougher comps as cattle production started to increase in the second half of last year. Therefore, the industry is forecasting production to be at a more measured rate of 3% to 4%.
EMEA accounted -- which accounted for 22% of Food Care sales, was essentially flat compared with last year as it follows a tough first quarter. Food Care equipment sales returned to growth one quarter earlier than anticipated, and I would add that the pipeline for both materials and equipment is nicely improving. Multiple penetration for our case-ready solutions, including our Darfresh platform, ready meals and ovenables, will continue to increase. This is the primary driver for higher equipment sales and our anticipated improved performance in EMEA in the second half.
APAC accounts for 14% of Food Care, with Australia and New Zealand accounting for close to 70% of our sales in this region. Beef production in Australia was down approximately 12% in the second quarter as cattle farmers continue to rebuilding their herds. We have easier comps heading into the second half. However, we are not anticipating growth in this region until late 2018.
Latin America represents the remaining 12% of sales, with Mexico, Brazil and Argentina accounting for approximately 75% of Food Care sales. Our business in Mexico increased 9% in constant dollars as we continue to penetrate the market with our advanced solutions. Despite the current events in Brazil and the economic situation in Argentina, we continue to view LatAm as a region with significant growth potential. And as such, we recently closed the acquisition of Deltaplam, which is a $25 million net sales Brazilian manufacturer of flexible packaging. Deltaplam utilizes superior extrusion technology to create recyclable, high-value solutions, and this acquisition strengthens our position in Latin America, expands our portfolio of consumer unit packaged solutions and extends our reach into several new market segments. For the full year of 2017, we expect Food Care to increase sales 3% in constant dollars led by North America and improving trends in EMEA. We expect sequential growth in EBITDA in Q3 and Q4, largely due to timing of our raw materials cost pass-through.
Slide 8 highlights results for our Product Care division. Product Care net sales were $391 million, and adjusted EBITDA was $77 million or 19.7% of net sales. Similar to Food Care, you can see in the EBITDA bridge that higher volumes and cost management were offset by a negative mix and price/cost spread. North America and EMEA account for approximately 85% of Product Care sales. E-commerce and fulfillment are our fastest-growing sectors in both of these regions, and we are starting to see a rebound in some areas with industrial segments. Sales in APAC were up 10% in constant dollars, led by Japan and China, where we are experiencing its increased demand for our differentiated solutions portfolio, including Fill-Air inflatable and automated equipment. We are increasing our market presence in this region and have expanded our local manufacturing capabilities to support that growth.
For the full -- the year 2017, we continue to anticipate top line sales growth in the range of 3% to 4%. We expect sequential EBITDA improvement in Q3 and Q4 as a result of cost management, coupled with pricing actions. And as compared to last year, our third quarter is expected to be flat to down, with year-on-year growth returning in the fourth quarter. For the full year 2017, we expect adjusted EBITDA in Product Care to be essentially in line with 2016 as a result of segment mix and the timing of recovery of raw material cost.
Let me now call -- pass the call to Carol to review our net sales and adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow and our outlook for 2017. Carol?"

Let's turn to Slides 9 and 10, which provide the sales and EBITDA bridges for Q2 and the first half 2017. Jerome has provided comments on our sales trends in the quarter and first half of the year, so my comments will focus on the bottom of Slide 9, which highlights our second quarter adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations on a year-over-year basis.
Adjusted EBITDA was $196 million. Volume contributed $19 million in Q2, which was offset by unfavorable mix and price/cost spread of $20 million. Operating expenses decreased $5 million, and restructuring savings were $2 million. Currency had an unfavorable impact on adjusted EBITDA of $2 million. Unallocated costs were $3 million in the second quarter 2017 as compared to $4 million in the second quarter 2016. Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.35 in the second quarter compared to $0.37 in Q2 2016. Our adjusted tax rate for continuing operations in Q2 2017 was 39% compared to 32% in Q2 2016. The adjusted tax rate in the second quarter 2017 was impacted by our mix of earnings in higher tax jurisdictions.
On Slide 10, we present our first half sales and EBITDA bridges. Higher volumes in the first half of the year were essentially offset by unfavorable mix and price/cost spread.
On Slide 11, free cash flow is presented on a consolidated basis, which includes results from continuing and discontinued operations. For the 6 months ended June 30, consolidated free cash flow, excluding payments related to the sale of Diversey, was a source of cash of $93 million. CapEx was $93 million. Cash interest payments were $105 million, and restructuring costs were $33 million. Aligned with our typical free cash flow seasonality, working capital and other assets and liabilities were a use of cash of $110 million. Payments related to the sale of Diversey were $45 million, of which $33 million relates to a cash tax payment that secured certain benefits, enabling us to divest Diversey in a tax-efficient manner. This cash tax payment was included in our gross to net proceeds calculation, which we estimated cash tax payments in the range of $250 million to $275 million.
Turning to our outlook on Slide 12. We are on track to achieve approximately $4.3 billion in net sales or more than 3% constant dollar growth. This forecast assumes increases of 3% in Food Care and 3% to 4% in Product Care. We expect our top line performance to be driven largely by volume in both divisions. 2017 adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations is expected to be in the range of $825 million to $835 million as compared with our previous guidance of approximately $825 million. Corporate expenses are now expected to be $125 million, which includes $20 million of unallocated costs related to discontinued operations. As a reminder, these unallocated costs consist of functional support and related expenses previously allocated to Diversey Care and hygiene solutions that do not qualify for discontinued operations.
Our net interest expense for 2017 is estimated at $190 million, with the assumption that we pay down $1.1 billion of debt in 2017. Depreciation and amortization is forecast at $160 million. We continue to expect our adjusted tax rate to be 28% for the full year 2017. Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $1.75 to $1.80 compared to our previous guidance of approximately $1.70. Our adjusted earnings per share outlook is based on 193 million shares, which reflects the weighted average full year effect of share repurchases through August 1.
Currency is not expected to have a material impact on net sales, adjusted EBITDA or adjusted earnings per share for the full year 2017. Our major currency exposures include the euro, which was approximately 13% of net sales in Q2; Australian dollar, 5%; and the Mexican peso, British pound, Canadian dollar and Brazilian real were each approximately 3% of net sales.
Turning to Slide 13, we will review our outlook for free cash flow. Our forecast for free cash flow in 2017 is approximately $400 million. This forecast excludes cash payments related to the sale of Diversey. To calculate our free cash flow outlook, we started with an estimated consolidated adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1 billion, which includes our full year 2017 outlook from continuing operations, plus $215 million from the first 8 months of discontinued operations assuming a September close. We anticipate cash interest payments to be $200 million and cash tax payments to be $160 million.
Restructuring cash costs, excluding efforts dedicated to reducing unallocated and stranded costs, are estimated to be $50 million. Capital expenditures are forecast to be $175 million, of which, $165 million represents Sealed Air continuing operations. Restructuring-related CapEx is expected at $25 million in 2017, and it is included in the $175 million total CapEx estimate. Working capital and other assets and liabilities is expected to be a use of cash of approximately $65 million. As you know, a large portion of our free cash flow is typically generated in the second half of the year, with the fourth quarter being our strongest quarter for cash generation.
This concludes our prepared remarks. Before I open the call to questions, I would like to note that our third quarter 2017 earnings call is tentatively scheduled for Wednesday, November 8.
With that, operator, can you please open the call for questions?"

We had a strategy, which is about differentiating ourselves from competition and introducing our Change the Game strategy. You -- this is clearly ongoing because, actually, it shows in our product mix. New products don't necessarily have the margins that we'll have when they reach bigger volumes and things like this. New product introduction can be somewhat costly. But at the very same time, you're seeing this volume growth and these trends, which are very, very different from what you are seeing in the industry. And as a result of that, you've got to ask yourself, what's going on? What is going on is that the evolution of our portfolio is ongoing in that we are passing cost increases -- our cost increases. And this is something that we know how to do. And when we're not 100% successful, we just come back later on. And it's not so much about pricing of competition. It is about the execution on our strategy. Some are tactical things. And if we don't get it right, right away, we just come back. The reality is that in Food Care, our case-ready applications are ongoing everywhere. This is not a North American phenomenon, and we're seeing this through our equipment sales. Our equipment sales are strong, and our orders book is very strong. This is going to happen later in this year, and this is also going to continue next year. And what we're seeing there is that the -- it's about replacement equipment and it's also about new installs. This is not in North America only. This is in North America as there is a need for automation and newer and more performing equipment. This is the case in Latin America, which is making us also very positive about the fact that there are long-term strengths here to come. This is also in Australia and New Zealand. So what you're seeing is our customer investing in new type of equipment. It can be Darfresh On Tray. It can be Darfresh VSP technology, et cetera, but we see a very strong trend. What you're also seeing in Product Care is that we are going through a tremendous evolution of our portfolio and our segment sales. E-commerce and 3PL is geared to grow. It is, for us, a very important segment. And we are seeing equipment introduction again all over the world, replacing equipment in Japan. You saw tremendous growth in China, in North America. The orders book in Europe is also very strong. And this is something which is a fundamental trend in our portfolio. Short term, the numbers that I gave you, 79% increase in the last 12 months on paper; NDI, 30% up in Europe, 2x in China versus last -- the same time last year; nylon doubling and things like this, almost, are things that are short-term headwinds, but we know how to deal with that. We have proven to you over the past few years that we deal properly and we pass our cost increases."

There is a trend in e-commerce, and this trend is that corrugated cardboard prices are going up dramatically and that as a result of that, you are going to see more and more pouchers which are enabling lower dimension and weight costing for shipping and lower cost of packaging. This is a trend. We have 2 very strong offering here. For corrugated -- for boxes, our I-Pack and e-Cube product line improved dimensional weight costing. And our StealthWrap and FloWrap equipment and the generations to come, which we are going to present at PACK EXPO later in the year, are tremendous substitutes for boxes. So we have a huge momentum in e-commerce 3PL, and this is, therefore, accelerating our sales growth in Product Care. Yes, we are -- because of the cost increases, we are having slightly lower margins. But as I said, we're dealing with those. So how quickly, we're going to show you. During our Investor Day week of December 4, we're going to show you our 3-year targets and plans.

But at this point in time, there is a positive bubble in the air, which is related to currency, and that's one thing we have as a positive -- on the possible -- as a possible positive. As a positive negative, we're a little bit concerned with polyethylene prices. We were anticipating that they were going to start to come down in September. And right now, we have some producers who are already just talking about price increases on the heels of possible hurricane. I mean, this is the last -- this is the most fun thing that you can hear, but there is a little bit of momentum there. You have some producers who have announced price increases for July that did not happen that's been announced for -- that's been pushed to August. And then you have some more announcements, which have been done for September. So you've got some of those gains going on right now. But we're a little bit concerned that as a potential negative, we will not have what we were expecting in terms of raw materials on polyethylene for September to December. So that's why we're seeing that. Next to that, we are -- our -- we're very determined to get our price increase through, and we might suffer a little bit from volume in some more commoditized segments in there.

This is -- this has been much -- the impact has been much bigger than anyone could anticipate. The exports have been impacted also. Our view is that this is temporary. We're seeing that it's stabilizing. We're seeing that you have equipment being sold and placed and ordered by red meat producers. And we are -- I was in Brazil 3 weeks ago and just talking to all of those customers, and they believe that the slaughter rates are going to start to increase sometime in the third quarter and into the fourth quarter. So this is not a long-term trend. This is specific to Brazil, given the scandals that have happened. Then you look at Argentina, and Argentina is seeing its consumption go up by 2%, which is very little. And you see the exports going up nicely at -- increasing in year-to-date by 38%, except that Argentina is not a big meat producer anymore. It is the #17 meat exporter -- sorry, not producer, exporter. It is the 17th largest exporter of meat and much smaller than it was a decade ago. That is for Argentina and Brazil. You are seeing -- we're seeing some positives in other countries. Very strong business in Mexico, where we have extraordinary position. I was there last week. I can assure you that the trends are very, very positive there. We're seeing nice trends in the second quarter in Chile for fish production, where we participate very nicely there. So all in all, total Latin America is negative as a result of the weight of Brazil, but we believe that this is temporary."

And exports have been freshened and frozen and could be for the month of June, have been almost 12% higher than a year ago. So this is very strong. It's positive also for us because all of that is packed with our bags, and we are really happy going -- to see what's going on there. With regards to e-commerce, yes, we have a product mix. Very nice. We have segment mix, which, at this point in time, is negative. We made no mystery about that already last year. What we were not seeing is the growth that we think. What you have to understand is that we're having positions. We're building with our new business with our customers. And what I talked about last quarter is something that is happening, which is that it takes time to go and sell equipment. It is a capital spending for our customers. This is not a consumable. So on one side, you'll have margin squeezed a little bit to the very strong and steep increases of raw materials, paper, polyethylene, nylon, et cetera, which are ingredients, which are raw materials for our mailers, for our phones, for our Bubble Wrap, et cetera. And -- but we can get over that. And next to that, you have this capital equipment. The very strong sign is that our sales of equipment in Product Care year-to-date are up 10% compared to last year, knowing that we had some StealthWrap and FloWrap and also made its core view, which were equipment which were prototypes shown in -- at PACK EXPO last year, we're seeing a very nice momentum in there that's going to accelerate.

We will cover our second quarter and first half results, key drivers for the second half and how we are executing on our strategy. We will also provide an update on our sale of Diversey to Bain, use of proceeds and our share buyback program. And as we review our quarterly results and near-term business trends, you will see that our long-term profitable growth strategy is coming to fruition, presently led by volume growth. You are now seeing renewed top line growth as a result of our Change the Game execution.
In Product Care, our stated strategy is to disproportionately grow our e-commerce and 3PL business and progressively transform it with automated fulfillment solutions that will over time give us equivalent margins to our industrial business.
In Food Care, we are benefiting from our focused efforts to deliver unique, differentiated, case-ready applications that align with protein processors' productivity imperatives and retailers' and consumers' demand for longer shelf life and waste reduction. Our execution on our growth initiatives will continue to gain momentum. We are making the right investments and taking the correct actions where needed to drive additional and sustainable EBITDA growth.
During our Analyst Day scheduled for the week of December 4, we will provide an update on our strategy and 2018 outlook and longer-term financial objectives.
In reviewing our second quarter for continuing operations, sales of $1.1 billion were up 4% in constant dollars after delivering a 3% increase in the first quarter. Food Care sales were up 3%, and Product Care sales were up 6%. The acceleration in both divisions was led by outstanding results in North America, with growth of 9% in constant dollars on the heel of 6% growth in Q1. This is the highest level of growth we have delivered in North America since 2010.
Adjusted EBITDA of $196 million increased from $182 million in the first quarter. Our divisions performed in line with our expectations, particularly in light of higher raw material cost and increased freight surcharges.
In Product Care, we were faced with increased cost of olefin, nylon, NDI and paper. And the price increases that we announced in the spring did not produce the yield that we were expecting. Therefore, we announced a second price increase effective September 1. Also, we have a temporary unfavorable mix impact in Product Care due to higher sales of utility products to our e-commerce and fulfilling operations. With that said, I cannot be more pleased with the execution of our automated solutions portfolio and the value it is bringing to our customers. Sales already increased more than 10% in the first half, and the pipeline continues to expand globally.
In Food Care, we continue to see increased market penetration for our proprietary, case-ready solutions, and we are capitalizing on the North American beef cycle. To be fully transparent, we have been surprised by the magnitude of the impact on our business from the beef inspection scandal in Brazil. And as you all know, we have been faced with higher resin costs, which takes time to recover, given our formula pricing. We just started to see a turnaround in formulas late in the second quarter. But for 2017, we are committed to achieving our financial objective and expect sequential EBITDA growth in both divisions in Q3 and Q4. Our second half results will benefit from a combination of higher sales of our differentiated solution as well as our price and cost actions.
With regards to our Diversey. Our sales of Diversey to Bain is on track to close, and we are committed to a successful separation. When we announced the sale in late March, we also increased our share buyback program to address the dilution of the transaction. Following our May 9 earnings call into August 1, we repurchased 6.5 million shares for $285 million using a combination of open-market repurchases and accelerated share repurchase program. We have approximately $1.9 billion remaining under our existing program. And once the transaction closes, we will have more flexibility with share repurchases; targeted M&A opportunity; and as previously discussed, we also plan to pay down our debt.
Let me now turn to Slide 5 and briefly review our regional performance for Sealed Air for the second quarter. North America accounted for 55% of our net sales and, as I noted, delivered impressive growth of 9% in constant dollars. Europe, Middle East, Africa, which accounted for 22% of our total net sales. Food Care sales in EMEA declined 1% year-over-year as positive sales trends in France, Italy and Spain were offset by weakness in the U.K., Russia and Germany. Product Care was down 2%, primarily related to rationalization efforts in France and the softness in the industrial sector in the U.K. Excluding this rationalization, Product Care sales in EMEA were -- would have been down less than 1%. And this is, by the way, the last quarter that we will report a year-over-year impact from rationalization. Asia Pacific represented 14% of net sales. In Food Care, APAC sales declined 7% due to the Australian beef market down cycle, which was partially offset by an increase of 11% in New Zealand and 6% in China. Product Care delivered double-digit growth in APAC, led by 15% growth in Japan and 11% in China. And Latin America, which accounted for 9% of net sales, declined 4% in constant dollars. Food Care was badly hit by Brazil and to a lesser extent, the economic weakness in Argentina. On the contrary, Mexico was our fastest-growing country in LatAm with 9% growth.
Turning to Slide 6, which highlights volume and price mix trends by division and by region. You can see that this slide -- from this slide that on a global basis, volume trends were up 4% in the second quarter led by 9% volume growth in North America. Price/mix was essentially neutral to our overall sales performance. In Food Care, I want to highlight that for the first time since the third quarter of 2015, North America delivered a favorable price/mix due to the continued adoption of our case-ready platform and the timing of raw material cost pass-through. And in Product Care, unfavorable price/mix in North America was partially offset by the positive impact of our rationalization in -- on product mix in EMEA.
And now let's turn to Slide 7 and review Food Care results in more detail. Food Care delivered $680 million in net sales in the second quarter and adjusted EBITDA of $146 million or 21.5% of net sales. As illustrated in the EBITDA bridge provided on this slide, higher volumes and cost management were offset by a negative price/mix and price/cost spread. Strength in North America was driven by improved protein production in all market segments led by the beef sector with a 5% increase in slaughter rates and the adoption of case-ready applications across all proteins. And looking ahead to Q3 and Q4, we expect North America to be our fastest-growing region, yet at a slightly more moderated pace. Keep in mind that our second half is facing tougher comps as cattle production started to increase in the second half of last year. Therefore, the industry is forecasting production to be at a more measured rate of 3% to 4%.
EMEA accounted -- which accounted for 22% of Food Care sales, was essentially flat compared with last year as it follows a tough first quarter. Food Care equipment sales returned to growth one quarter earlier than anticipated, and I would add that the pipeline for both materials and equipment is nicely improving. Multiple penetration for our case-ready solutions, including our Darfresh platform, ready meals and ovenables, will continue to increase. This is the primary driver for higher equipment sales and our anticipated improved performance in EMEA in the second half.
APAC accounts for 14% of Food Care, with Australia and New Zealand accounting for close to 70% of our sales in this region. Beef production in Australia was down approximately 12% in the second quarter as cattle farmers continue to rebuilding their herds. We have easier comps heading into the second half. However, we are not anticipating growth in this region until late 2018.
Latin America represents the remaining 12% of sales, with Mexico, Brazil and Argentina accounting for approximately 75% of Food Care sales. Our business in Mexico increased 9% in constant dollars as we continue to penetrate the market with our advanced solutions. Despite the current events in Brazil and the economic situation in Argentina, we continue to view LatAm as a region with significant growth potential. And as such, we recently closed the acquisition of Deltaplam, which is a $25 million net sales Brazilian manufacturer of flexible packaging. Deltaplam utilizes superior extrusion technology to create recyclable, high-value solutions, and this acquisition strengthens our position in Latin America, expands our portfolio of consumer unit packaged solutions and extends our reach into several new market segments. For the full year of 2017, we expect Food Care to increase sales 3% in constant dollars led by North America and improving trends in EMEA. We expect sequential growth in EBITDA in Q3 and Q4, largely due to timing of our raw materials cost pass-through.
Slide 8 highlights results for our Product Care division. Product Care net sales were $391 million, and adjusted EBITDA was $77 million or 19.7% of net sales. Similar to Food Care, you can see in the EBITDA bridge that higher volumes and cost management were offset by a negative mix and price/cost spread. North America and EMEA account for approximately 85% of Product Care sales. E-commerce and fulfillment are our fastest-growing sectors in both of these regions, and we are starting to see a rebound in some areas with industrial segments. Sales in APAC were up 10% in constant dollars, led by Japan and China, where we are experiencing its increased demand for our differentiated solutions portfolio, including Fill-Air inflatable and automated equipment. We are increasing our market presence in this region and have expanded our local manufacturing capabilities to support that growth.
For the full -- the year 2017, we continue to anticipate top line sales growth in the range of 3% to 4%. We expect sequential EBITDA improvement in Q3 and Q4 as a result of cost management, coupled with pricing actions. And as compared to last year, our third quarter is expected to be flat to down, with year-on-year growth returning in the fourth quarter. For the full year 2017, we expect adjusted EBITDA in Product Care to be essentially in line with 2016 as a result of segment mix and the timing of recovery of raw material cost.
Let me now call -- pass the call to Carol to review our net sales and adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow and our outlook for 2017. Carol?"

Let's turn to Slides 9 and 10, which provide the sales and EBITDA bridges for Q2 and the first half 2017. Jerome has provided comments on our sales trends in the quarter and first half of the year, so my comments will focus on the bottom of Slide 9, which highlights our second quarter adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations on a year-over-year basis.
Adjusted EBITDA was $196 million. Volume contributed $19 million in Q2, which was offset by unfavorable mix and price/cost spread of $20 million. Operating expenses decreased $5 million, and restructuring savings were $2 million. Currency had an unfavorable impact on adjusted EBITDA of $2 million. Unallocated costs were $3 million in the second quarter 2017 as compared to $4 million in the second quarter 2016. Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.35 in the second quarter compared to $0.37 in Q2 2016. Our adjusted tax rate for continuing operations in Q2 2017 was 39% compared to 32% in Q2 2016. The adjusted tax rate in the second quarter 2017 was impacted by our mix of earnings in higher tax jurisdictions.
On Slide 10, we present our first half sales and EBITDA bridges. Higher volumes in the first half of the year were essentially offset by unfavorable mix and price/cost spread.
On Slide 11, free cash flow is presented on a consolidated basis, which includes results from continuing and discontinued operations. For the 6 months ended June 30, consolidated free cash flow, excluding payments related to the sale of Diversey, was a source of cash of $93 million. CapEx was $93 million. Cash interest payments were $105 million, and restructuring costs were $33 million. Aligned with our typical free cash flow seasonality, working capital and other assets and liabilities were a use of cash of $110 million. Payments related to the sale of Diversey were $45 million, of which $33 million relates to a cash tax payment that secured certain benefits, enabling us to divest Diversey in a tax-efficient manner. This cash tax payment was included in our gross to net proceeds calculation, which we estimated cash tax payments in the range of $250 million to $275 million.
Turning to our outlook on Slide 12. We are on track to achieve approximately $4.3 billion in net sales or more than 3% constant dollar growth. This forecast assumes increases of 3% in Food Care and 3% to 4% in Product Care. We expect our top line performance to be driven largely by volume in both divisions. 2017 adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations is expected to be in the range of $825 million to $835 million as compared with our previous guidance of approximately $825 million. Corporate expenses are now expected to be $125 million, which includes $20 million of unallocated costs related to discontinued operations. As a reminder, these unallocated costs consist of functional support and related expenses previously allocated to Diversey Care and hygiene solutions that do not qualify for discontinued operations.
Our net interest expense for 2017 is estimated at $190 million, with the assumption that we pay down $1.1 billion of debt in 2017. Depreciation and amortization is forecast at $160 million. We continue to expect our adjusted tax rate to be 28% for the full year 2017. Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $1.75 to $1.80 compared to our previous guidance of approximately $1.70. Our adjusted earnings per share outlook is based on 193 million shares, which reflects the weighted average full year effect of share repurchases through August 1.
Currency is not expected to have a material impact on net sales, adjusted EBITDA or adjusted earnings per share for the full year 2017. Our major currency exposures include the euro, which was approximately 13% of net sales in Q2; Australian dollar, 5%; and the Mexican peso, British pound, Canadian dollar and Brazilian real were each approximately 3% of net sales.
Turning to Slide 13, we will review our outlook for free cash flow. Our forecast for free cash flow in 2017 is approximately $400 million. This forecast excludes cash payments related to the sale of Diversey. To calculate our free cash flow outlook, we started with an estimated consolidated adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1 billion, which includes our full year 2017 outlook from continuing operations, plus $215 million from the first 8 months of discontinued operations assuming a September close. We anticipate cash interest payments to be $200 million and cash tax payments to be $160 million.
Restructuring cash costs, excluding efforts dedicated to reducing unallocated and stranded costs, are estimated to be $50 million. Capital expenditures are forecast to be $175 million, of which, $165 million represents Sealed Air continuing operations. Restructuring-related CapEx is expected at $25 million in 2017, and it is included in the $175 million total CapEx estimate. Working capital and other assets and liabilities is expected to be a use of cash of approximately $65 million. As you know, a large portion of our free cash flow is typically generated in the second half of the year, with the fourth quarter being our strongest quarter for cash generation.
This concludes our prepared remarks. Before I open the call to questions, I would like to note that our third quarter 2017 earnings call is tentatively scheduled for Wednesday, November 8.
With that, operator, can you please open the call for questions?"

And paper and for example, corrugated OCC went up 79% since July of last year. So they were very hefty, very big. We tried to pass important price increases, and some of that got passed, but not enough. So this is not very different than what happens from time to time.

We had a strategy, which is about differentiating ourselves from competition and introducing our Change the Game strategy. You -- this is clearly ongoing because, actually, it shows in our product mix. New products don't necessarily have the margins that we'll have when they reach bigger volumes and things like this. New product introduction can be somewhat costly. But at the very same time, you're seeing this volume growth and these trends, which are very, very different from what you are seeing in the industry. And as a result of that, you've got to ask yourself, what's going on? What is going on is that the evolution of our portfolio is ongoing in that we are passing cost increases -- our cost increases. And this is something that we know how to do. And when we're not 100% successful, we just come back later on. And it's not so much about pricing of competition. It is about the execution on our strategy. Some are tactical things. And if we don't get it right, right away, we just come back. The reality is that in Food Care, our case-ready applications are ongoing everywhere. This is not a North American phenomenon, and we're seeing this through our equipment sales. Our equipment sales are strong, and our orders book is very strong. This is going to happen later in this year, and this is also going to continue next year. And what we're seeing there is that the -- it's about replacement equipment and it's also about new installs. This is not in North America only. This is in North America as there is a need for automation and newer and more performing equipment. This is the case in Latin America, which is making us also very positive about the fact that there are long-term strengths here to come. This is also in Australia and New Zealand. So what you're seeing is our customer investing in new type of equipment. It can be Darfresh On Tray. It can be Darfresh VSP technology, et cetera, but we see a very strong trend. What you're also seeing in Product Care is that we are going through a tremendous evolution of our portfolio and our segment sales. E-commerce and 3PL is geared to grow. It is, for us, a very important segment. And we are seeing equipment introduction again all over the world, replacing equipment in Japan. You saw tremendous growth in China, in North America. The orders book in Europe is also very strong. And this is something which is a fundamental trend in our portfolio. Short term, the numbers that I gave you, 79% increase in the last 12 months on paper; NDI, 30% up in Europe, 2x in China versus last -- the same time last year; nylon doubling and things like this, almost, are things that are short-term headwinds, but we know how to deal with that. We have proven to you over the past few years that we deal properly and we pass our cost increases."

There is a trend in e-commerce, and this trend is that corrugated cardboard prices are going up dramatically and that as a result of that, you are going to see more and more pouchers which are enabling lower dimension and weight costing for shipping and lower cost of packaging. This is a trend. We have 2 very strong offering here. For corrugated -- for boxes, our I-Pack and e-Cube product line improved dimensional weight costing. And our StealthWrap and FloWrap equipment and the generations to come, which we are going to present at PACK EXPO later in the year, are tremendous substitutes for boxes. So we have a huge momentum in e-commerce 3PL, and this is, therefore, accelerating our sales growth in Product Care. Yes, we are -- because of the cost increases, we are having slightly lower margins. But as I said, we're dealing with those. So how quickly, we're going to show you.

But at this point in time, there is a positive bubble in the air, which is related to currency, and that's one thing we have as a positive -- on the possible -- as a possible positive. As a positive negative, we're a little bit concerned with polyethylene prices. We were anticipating that they were going to start to come down in September. And right now, we have some producers who are already just talking about price increases on the heels of possible hurricane. I mean, this is the last -- this is the most fun thing that you can hear, but there is a little bit of momentum there. You have some producers who have announced price increases for July that did not happen that's been announced for -- that's been pushed to August. And then you have some more announcements, which have been done for September. So you've got some of those gains going on right now. But we're a little bit concerned that as a potential negative, we will not have what we were expecting in terms of raw materials on polyethylene for September to December. So that's why we're seeing that. Next to that, we are -- our -- we're very determined to get our price increase through, and we might suffer a little bit from volume in some more commoditized segments in there. So that's what we're doing. Overall, these are short-term tailwinds or headwinds, very short term. We believe that our fourth quarter is going to be very strong.

This is -- this has been much -- the impact has been much bigger than anyone could anticipate. The exports have been impacted also. Our view is that this is temporary. We're seeing that it's stabilizing. We're seeing that you have equipment being sold and placed and ordered by red meat producers. And we are -- I was in Brazil 3 weeks ago and just talking to all of those customers, and they believe that the slaughter rates are going to start to increase sometime in the third quarter and into the fourth quarter. So this is not a long-term trend. This is specific to Brazil, given the scandals that have happened. Then you look at Argentina, and Argentina is seeing its consumption go up by 2%, which is very little. And you see the exports going up nicely at -- increasing in year-to-date by 38%, except that Argentina is not a big meat producer anymore. It is the #17 meat exporter -- sorry, not producer, exporter. It is the 17th largest exporter of meat and much smaller than it was a decade ago. That is for Argentina and Brazil. You are seeing -- we're seeing some positives in other countries. Very strong business in Mexico, where we have extraordinary position. I was there last week. I can assure you that the trends are very, very positive there. We're seeing nice trends in the second quarter in Chile for fish production, where we participate very nicely there. So all in all, total Latin America is negative as a result of the weight of Brazil, but we believe that this is temporary."

And exports have been freshened and frozen and could be for the month of June, have been almost 12% higher than a year ago. So this is very strong. It's positive also for us because all of that is packed with our bags, and we are really happy going -- to see what's going on there. With regards to e-commerce, yes, we have a product mix. Very nice. We have segment mix, which, at this point in time, is negative. We made no mystery about that already last year. What we were not seeing is the growth that we think. What you have to understand is that we're having positions. We're building with our new business with our customers. And what I talked about last quarter is something that is happening, which is that it takes time to go and sell equipment. It is a capital spending for our customers. This is not a consumable. So on one side, you'll have margin squeezed a little bit to the very strong and steep increases of raw materials, paper, polyethylene, nylon, et cetera, which are ingredients, which are raw materials for our mailers, for our phones, for our Bubble Wrap, et cetera. And -- but we can get over that. And next to that, you have this capital equipment. The very strong sign is that our sales of equipment in Product Care year-to-date are up 10% compared to last year, knowing that we had some StealthWrap and FloWrap and also made its core view, which were equipment which were prototypes shown in -- at PACK EXPO last year, we're seeing a very nice momentum in there that's going to accelerate.

We will cover our second quarter and first half results, key drivers for the second half and how we are executing on our strategy. We will also provide an update on our sale of Diversey to Bain, use of proceeds and our share buyback program. And as we review our quarterly results and near-term business trends, you will see that our long-term profitable growth strategy is coming to fruition, presently led by volume growth. You are now seeing renewed top line growth as a result of our Change the Game execution.
In Product Care, our stated strategy is to disproportionately grow our e-commerce and 3PL business and progressively transform it with automated fulfillment solutions that will over time give us equivalent margins to our industrial business.
In Food Care, we are benefiting from our focused efforts to deliver unique, differentiated, case-ready applications that align with protein processors' productivity imperatives and retailers' and consumers' demand for longer shelf life and waste reduction. Our execution on our growth initiatives will continue to gain momentum. We are making the right investments and taking the correct actions where needed to drive additional and sustainable EBITDA growth.
During our Analyst Day scheduled for the week of December 4, we will provide an update on our strategy and 2018 outlook and longer-term financial objectives.
In reviewing our second quarter for continuing operations, sales of $1.1 billion were up 4% in constant dollars after delivering a 3% increase in the first quarter. Food Care sales were up 3%, and Product Care sales were up 6%. The acceleration in both divisions was led by outstanding results in North America, with growth of 9% in constant dollars on the heel of 6% growth in Q1. This is the highest level of growth we have delivered in North America since 2010.
Adjusted EBITDA of $196 million increased from $182 million in the first quarter. Our divisions performed in line with our expectations, particularly in light of higher raw material cost and increased freight surcharges.
In Product Care, we were faced with increased cost of olefin, nylon, NDI and paper. And the price increases that we announced in the spring did not produce the yield that we were expecting. Therefore, we announced a second price increase effective September 1. Also, we have a temporary unfavorable mix impact in Product Care due to higher sales of utility products to our e-commerce and fulfilling operations. With that said, I cannot be more pleased with the execution of our automated solutions portfolio and the value it is bringing to our customers. Sales already increased more than 10% in the first half, and the pipeline continues to expand globally.
In Food Care, we continue to see increased market penetration for our proprietary, case-ready solutions, and we are capitalizing on the North American beef cycle. To be fully transparent, we have been surprised by the magnitude of the impact on our business from the beef inspection scandal in Brazil. And as you all know, we have been faced with higher resin costs, which takes time to recover, given our formula pricing. We just started to see a turnaround in formulas late in the second quarter. But for 2017, we are committed to achieving our financial objective and expect sequential EBITDA growth in both divisions in Q3 and Q4. Our second half results will benefit from a combination of higher sales of our differentiated solution as well as our price and cost actions.
With regards to our Diversey. Our sales of Diversey to Bain is on track to close, and we are committed to a successful separation. When we announced the sale in late March, we also increased our share buyback program to address the dilution of the transaction. Following our May 9 earnings call into August 1, we repurchased 6.5 million shares for $285 million using a combination of open-market repurchases and accelerated share repurchase program. We have approximately $1.9 billion remaining under our existing program. And once the transaction closes, we will have more flexibility with share repurchases; targeted M&A opportunity; and as previously discussed, we also plan to pay down our debt.
Let me now turn to Slide 5 and briefly review our regional performance for Sealed Air for the second quarter. North America accounted for 55% of our net sales and, as I noted, delivered impressive growth of 9% in constant dollars. Europe, Middle East, Africa, which accounted for 22% of our total net sales. Food Care sales in EMEA declined 1% year-over-year as positive sales trends in France, Italy and Spain were offset by weakness in the U.K., Russia and Germany. Product Care was down 2%, primarily related to rationalization efforts in France and the softness in the industrial sector in the U.K. Excluding this rationalization, Product Care sales in EMEA were -- would have been down less than 1%. And this is, by the way, the last quarter that we will report a year-over-year impact from rationalization. Asia Pacific represented 14% of net sales. In Food Care, APAC sales declined 7% due to the Australian beef market down cycle, which was partially offset by an increase of 11% in New Zealand and 6% in China. Product Care delivered double-digit growth in APAC, led by 15% growth in Japan and 11% in China. And Latin America, which accounted for 9% of net sales, declined 4% in constant dollars. Food Care was badly hit by Brazil and to a lesser extent, the economic weakness in Argentina. On the contrary, Mexico was our fastest-growing country in LatAm with 9% growth.
Turning to Slide 6, which highlights volume and price mix trends by division and by region. You can see that this slide -- from this slide that on a global basis, volume trends were up 4% in the second quarter led by 9% volume growth in North America. Price/mix was essentially neutral to our overall sales performance. In Food Care, I want to highlight that for the first time since the third quarter of 2015, North America delivered a favorable price/mix due to the continued adoption of our case-ready platform and the timing of raw material cost pass-through. And in Product Care, unfavorable price/mix in North America was partially offset by the positive impact of our rationalization in -- on product mix in EMEA.
And now let's turn to Slide 7 and review Food Care results in more detail. Food Care delivered $680 million in net sales in the second quarter and adjusted EBITDA of $146 million or 21.5% of net sales. As illustrated in the EBITDA bridge provided on this slide, higher volumes and cost management were offset by a negative price/mix and price/cost spread. Strength in North America was driven by improved protein production in all market segments led by the beef sector with a 5% increase in slaughter rates and the adoption of case-ready applications across all proteins. And looking ahead to Q3 and Q4, we expect North America to be our fastest-growing region, yet at a slightly more moderated pace. Keep in mind that our second half is facing tougher comps as cattle production started to increase in the second half of last year. Therefore, the industry is forecasting production to be at a more measured rate of 3% to 4%.
EMEA accounted -- which accounted for 22% of Food Care sales, was essentially flat compared with last year as it follows a tough first quarter. Food Care equipment sales returned to growth one quarter earlier than anticipated, and I would add that the pipeline for both materials and equipment is nicely improving. Multiple penetration for our case-ready solutions, including our Darfresh platform, ready meals and ovenables, will continue to increase. This is the primary driver for higher equipment sales and our anticipated improved performance in EMEA in the second half.
APAC accounts for 14% of Food Care, with Australia and New Zealand accounting for close to 70% of our sales in this region. Beef production in Australia was down approximately 12% in the second quarter as cattle farmers continue to rebuilding their herds. We have easier comps heading into the second half. However, we are not anticipating growth in this region until late 2018.
Latin America represents the remaining 12% of sales, with Mexico, Brazil and Argentina accounting for approximately 75% of Food Care sales. Our business in Mexico increased 9% in constant dollars as we continue to penetrate the market with our advanced solutions. Despite the current events in Brazil and the economic situation in Argentina, we continue to view LatAm as a region with significant growth potential. And as such, we recently closed the acquisition of Deltaplam, which is a $25 million net sales Brazilian manufacturer of flexible packaging. Deltaplam utilizes superior extrusion technology to create recyclable, high-value solutions, and this acquisition strengthens our position in Latin America, expands our portfolio of consumer unit packaged solutions and extends our reach into several new market segments. For the full year of 2017, we expect Food Care to increase sales 3% in constant dollars led by North America and improving trends in EMEA. We expect sequential growth in EBITDA in Q3 and Q4, largely due to timing of our raw materials cost pass-through.
Slide 8 highlights results for our Product Care division. Product Care net sales were $391 million, and adjusted EBITDA was $77 million or 19.7% of net sales. Similar to Food Care, you can see in the EBITDA bridge that higher volumes and cost management were offset by a negative mix and price/cost spread. North America and EMEA account for approximately 85% of Product Care sales. E-commerce and fulfillment are our fastest-growing sectors in both of these regions, and we are starting to see a rebound in some areas with industrial segments. Sales in APAC were up 10% in constant dollars, led by Japan and China, where we are experiencing its increased demand for our differentiated solutions portfolio, including Fill-Air inflatable and automated equipment. We are increasing our market presence in this region and have expanded our local manufacturing capabilities to support that growth.
For the full -- the year 2017, we continue to anticipate top line sales growth in the range of 3% to 4%. We expect sequential EBITDA improvement in Q3 and Q4 as a result of cost management, coupled with pricing actions. And as compared to last year, our third quarter is expected to be flat to down, with year-on-year growth returning in the fourth quarter. For the full year 2017, we expect adjusted EBITDA in Product Care to be essentially in line with 2016 as a result of segment mix and the timing of recovery of raw material cost.
Let me now call -- pass the call to Carol to review our net sales and adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow and our outlook for 2017. Carol?"

Let's turn to Slides 9 and 10, which provide the sales and EBITDA bridges for Q2 and the first half 2017. Jerome has provided comments on our sales trends in the quarter and first half of the year, so my comments will focus on the bottom of Slide 9, which highlights our second quarter adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations on a year-over-year basis.
Adjusted EBITDA was $196 million. Volume contributed $19 million in Q2, which was offset by unfavorable mix and price/cost spread of $20 million. Operating expenses decreased $5 million, and restructuring savings were $2 million. Currency had an unfavorable impact on adjusted EBITDA of $2 million. Unallocated costs were $3 million in the second quarter 2017 as compared to $4 million in the second quarter 2016. Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.35 in the second quarter compared to $0.37 in Q2 2016. Our adjusted tax rate for continuing operations in Q2 2017 was 39% compared to 32% in Q2 2016. The adjusted tax rate in the second quarter 2017 was impacted by our mix of earnings in higher tax jurisdictions.
On Slide 10, we present our first half sales and EBITDA bridges. Higher volumes in the first half of the year were essentially offset by unfavorable mix and price/cost spread.
On Slide 11, free cash flow is presented on a consolidated basis, which includes results from continuing and discontinued operations. For the 6 months ended June 30, consolidated free cash flow, excluding payments related to the sale of Diversey, was a source of cash of $93 million. CapEx was $93 million. Cash interest payments were $105 million, and restructuring costs were $33 million. Aligned with our typical free cash flow seasonality, working capital and other assets and liabilities were a use of cash of $110 million. Payments related to the sale of Diversey were $45 million, of which $33 million relates to a cash tax payment that secured certain benefits, enabling us to divest Diversey in a tax-efficient manner. This cash tax payment was included in our gross to net proceeds calculation, which we estimated cash tax payments in the range of $250 million to $275 million.
Turning to our outlook on Slide 12. We are on track to achieve approximately $4.3 billion in net sales or more than 3% constant dollar growth. This forecast assumes increases of 3% in Food Care and 3% to 4% in Product Care. We expect our top line performance to be driven largely by volume in both divisions. 2017 adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations is expected to be in the range of $825 million to $835 million as compared with our previous guidance of approximately $825 million. Corporate expenses are now expected to be $125 million, which includes $20 million of unallocated costs related to discontinued operations. As a reminder, these unallocated costs consist of functional support and related expenses previously allocated to Diversey Care and hygiene solutions that do not qualify for discontinued operations.
Our net interest expense for 2017 is estimated at $190 million, with the assumption that we pay down $1.1 billion of debt in 2017. Depreciation and amortization is forecast at $160 million. We continue to expect our adjusted tax rate to be 28% for the full year 2017. Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $1.75 to $1.80 compared to our previous guidance of approximately $1.70. Our adjusted earnings per share outlook is based on 193 million shares, which reflects the weighted average full year effect of share repurchases through August 1.
Currency is not expected to have a material impact on net sales, adjusted EBITDA or adjusted earnings per share for the full year 2017. Our major currency exposures include the euro, which was approximately 13% of net sales in Q2; Australian dollar, 5%; and the Mexican peso, British pound, Canadian dollar and Brazilian real were each approximately 3% of net sales.
Turning to Slide 13, we will review our outlook for free cash flow. Our forecast for free cash flow in 2017 is approximately $400 million. This forecast excludes cash payments related to the sale of Diversey. To calculate our free cash flow outlook, we started with an estimated consolidated adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1 billion, which includes our full year 2017 outlook from continuing operations, plus $215 million from the first 8 months of discontinued operations assuming a September close. We anticipate cash interest payments to be $200 million and cash tax payments to be $160 million.
Restructuring cash costs, excluding efforts dedicated to reducing unallocated and stranded costs, are estimated to be $50 million. Capital expenditures are forecast to be $175 million, of which, $165 million represents Sealed Air continuing operations. Restructuring-related CapEx is expected at $25 million in 2017, and it is included in the $175 million total CapEx estimate. Working capital and other assets and liabilities is expected to be a use of cash of approximately $65 million. As you know, a large portion of our free cash flow is typically generated in the second half of the year, with the fourth quarter being our strongest quarter for cash generation.
This concludes our prepared remarks. Before I open the call to questions, I would like to note that our third quarter 2017 earnings call is tentatively scheduled for Wednesday, November 8.

And paper and for example, corrugated OCC went up 79% since July of last year. So they were very hefty, very big. We tried to pass important price increases, and some of that got passed, but not enough. So this is not very different than what happens from time to time.

We had a strategy, which is about differentiating ourselves from competition and introducing our Change the Game strategy. You -- this is clearly ongoing because, actually, it shows in our product mix. New products don't necessarily have the margins that we'll have when they reach bigger volumes and things like this. New product introduction can be somewhat costly. But at the very same time, you're seeing this volume growth and these trends, which are very, very different from what you are seeing in the industry. And as a result of that, you've got to ask yourself, what's going on? What is going on is that the evolution of our portfolio is ongoing in that we are passing cost increases -- our cost increases. And this is something that we know how to do. And when we're not 100% successful, we just come back later on. And it's not so much about pricing of competition. It is about the execution on our strategy. Some are tactical things. And if we don't get it right, right away, we just come back. The reality is that in Food Care, our case-ready applications are ongoing everywhere. This is not a North American phenomenon, and we're seeing this through our equipment sales. Our equipment sales are strong, and our orders book is very strong. This is going to happen later in this year, and this is also going to continue next year. And what we're seeing there is that the -- it's about replacement equipment and it's also about new installs. This is not in North America only. This is in North America as there is a need for automation and newer and more performing equipment. This is the case in Latin America, which is making us also very positive about the fact that there are long-term strengths here to come. This is also in Australia and New Zealand. So what you're seeing is our customer investing in new type of equipment. It can be Darfresh On Tray. It can be Darfresh VSP technology, et cetera, but we see a very strong trend. What you're also seeing in Product Care is that we are going through a tremendous evolution of our portfolio and our segment sales. E-commerce and 3PL is geared to grow. It is, for us, a very important segment. And we are seeing equipment introduction again all over the world, replacing equipment in Japan. You saw tremendous growth in China, in North America. The orders book in Europe is also very strong. And this is something which is a fundamental trend in our portfolio. Short term, the numbers that I gave you, 79% increase in the last 12 months on paper; NDI, 30% up in Europe, 2x in China versus last -- the same time last year; nylon doubling and things like this, almost, are things that are short-term headwinds, but we know how to deal with that. We have proven to you over the past few years that we deal properly and we pass our cost increases."

There is a trend in e-commerce, and this trend is that corrugated cardboard prices are going up dramatically and that as a result of that, you are going to see more and more pouchers which are enabling lower dimension and weight costing for shipping and lower cost of packaging. This is a trend. We have 2 very strong offering here. For corrugated -- for boxes, our I-Pack and e-Cube product line improved dimensional weight costing. And our StealthWrap and FloWrap equipment and the generations to come, which we are going to present at PACK EXPO later in the year, are tremendous substitutes for boxes. So we have a huge momentum in e-commerce 3PL, and this is, therefore, accelerating our sales growth in Product Care. Yes, we are -- because of the cost increases, we are having slightly lower margins. But as I said, we're dealing with those. So how quickly, we're going to show you.

But at this point in time, there is a positive bubble in the air, which is related to currency, and that's one thing we have as a positive -- on the possible -- as a possible positive. As a positive negative, we're a little bit concerned with polyethylene prices. We were anticipating that they were going to start to come down in September. And right now, we have some producers who are already just talking about price increases on the heels of possible hurricane. I mean, this is the last -- this is the most fun thing that you can hear, but there is a little bit of momentum there. You have some producers who have announced price increases for July that did not happen that's been announced for -- that's been pushed to August. And then you have some more announcements, which have been done for September. So you've got some of those gains going on right now. But we're a little bit concerned that as a potential negative, we will not have what we were expecting in terms of raw materials on polyethylene for September to December. So that's why we're seeing that. Next to that, we are -- our -- we're very determined to get our price increase through, and we might suffer a little bit from volume in some more commoditized segments in there. So that's what we're doing. Overall, these are short-term tailwinds or headwinds, very short term. We believe that our fourth quarter is going to be very strong.

If I remember well, the April exports were at over 30% growth out of the U.S. So what Brazil did not export and given the cycle in -- negative cycle in Australia, the U.S. has been a huge winner in this. And you are seeing right now that prices of U.S. beef are very high, but this did not affect the exports. And exports have been freshened and frozen and could be for the month of June, have been almost 12% higher than a year ago. So this is very strong. It's positive also for us because all of that is packed with our bags, and we are really happy going -- to see what's going on there. With regards to e-commerce, yes, we have a product mix. Very nice. We have segment mix, which, at this point in time, is negative. We made no mystery about that already last year. What we were not seeing is the growth that we think. What you have to understand is that we're having positions. We're building with our new business with our customers. And what I talked about last quarter is something that is happening, which is that it takes time to go and sell equipment. It is a capital spending for our customers. This is not a consumable. So on one side, you'll have margin squeezed a little bit to the very strong and steep increases of raw materials, paper, polyethylene, nylon, et cetera, which are ingredients, which are raw materials for our mailers, for our phones, for our Bubble Wrap, et cetera. And -- but we can get over that. And next to that, you have this capital equipment. The very strong sign is that our sales of equipment in Product Care year-to-date are up 10% compared to last year, knowing that we had some StealthWrap and FloWrap and also made its core view, which were equipment which were prototypes shown in -- at PACK EXPO last year, we're seeing a very nice momentum in there that's going to accelerate. So we're producing a few of those machines. And when that accelerates also, we're going to see margin expansion."

We will have also the opportunity to hear from Ted Doheny, who will be taking over as CEO from me on January 1; and Bill Stiehl, our Acting Chief Financial Officer. But before all and relevant to my retirement, I'll take this opportunity to let you know that I ran my first New York -- my first marathon in New York last Sunday. Thanks to my son, Alexi, and my friend, Allen. For those of you who are up to the challenge, you will be rewarded for life. But don't worry, I will not turn into Forest Gump in my retirement. 
Back to business. You can see that in the third quarter, net sales growth accelerated to 6% on an as-reported basis and 5% in constant dollars. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 19%. Our performance in the third quarter continued to improve compared to the first half of the year when we delivered 3% constant dollar top line growth and 18% margin. And this momentum is continuing into the fourth quarter and we have -- and we are delivering on our 2017 outlook as a result of our higher sales in our pricing and cost discipline. In fact, we are executing on our long-term profitable growth strategy that we outlined at the Analyst Day in June 2015. Remember, at that time, we set a 3-year sales growth target of 4% to 5% for each of those 2 divisions. We said that we expect sales growth to accelerate throughout the period of 2016 to 2018 and that this growth will be led by volume, thanks to our market maker innovative strategy. In 2016, we didn't see much movement on the topline and exited the year with an increase of just 1% constant dollar sales growth. However, our growth have been improving each quarter since the [ fourth ] quarter of 2016. In the [ first ] quarter of last year, we started delivering one -- in constant currency 1% sales growth. In the [ first ] quarter of this year in constant dollars, we delivered 3% growth. In the second quarter, we delivered 4% growth and now in the third quarter, we are reporting 5% constant currency sales growth. And should the temporary and increasingly steep PE raising cost increases of 13% or $0.10 per pound since August and $0.15 year-to-date not have surprised all our industry, those sales gains would've translated into the bottom line already. The good news is that, that I said temporary cost increases and also that we have fully implemented our announced Product Care and Food Care price increases on September 1 and October 1, respectively. This is where our confidence comes in as we head into year-end. We are seeking rapid adoption of our game-changing solutions. We're seeing healthy end market demand, particularly in North America and Asia and our now famous operational disciplines are taking hold. 
On September 6th, we closed the Diversey sale. When we announced the transaction in March 2017, we increased our share repurchase program and we said that we would pay down debt, address on the costs and target selected M&A that was in line with our strategic direction. Through September 30, we repurchased approximately 15.5 million shares valued at $677 million through a combination of open-market and accelerated share repurchase program, including a [indiscernible] that is currently ongoing. We paid down $1.1 billion in debt, bringing our total debt balance down to $3.3 billion. We have already made progress on our cost structure and we'll continue to do so heading into next year. 
We also closed 2 acquisitions, a small strategic food packaging company in Brazil, Deltaplam, which closed in August. And then in October, we closed the Fagerdala acquisition, a Protective Packaging company based in Singapore that significantly expands our presence in Asia. 
As all of you know, on September 9th, I announced my retirement effective December 31, 2017. I have really enjoyed my time at Sealed Air, and I'm extremely proud of what we have become, thanks to the vision and determination of our management team and our 14,000 global employees who I want to recognize here. We have built a winning culture, a culture that is obsessed with creating new value for our customers. We take the responsibility of being the industry leader and the market maker by creating new markets with disruptive innovations and instilling discipline throughout the industry we serve. Our long-term profitable growth strategy is well underway and we continue to gain traction globally as you could see from our sales growth, focusing all of our efforts on some very key mega trends. Our journey as a knowledge-based company continues with many exciting opportunities ahead. And I am very confident that under Ted, Bill and the entire leadership team, the organization will continue to thrive and generate significant value for our customers, shareholders and employees. 
Bill join Sealed Air in 2013 and has been on this journey alongside our senior leadership team. Ted and I continue to work closely together to ensure a seamless and successful transition. We have been spending time in Charlotte, North Carolina and have also -- and are also traveling around the world with our senior team to meet with customers and employees. 
Let me now move back to our third quarter results in more detail and turning to Slide 6, where we highlight our results by region. We experienced constant dollar year-over-year growth across all regions. North America once again was our fastest growing region at 7% with sales up 9% in Food Care and up 4% in Product Care. Sales in EMEA, Asia-Pacific and Latin America increased in the range of 2% to 3%. I want to highlight that Product Care sales in Asia-Pacific were up 15% in the third quarter led by volume growth. 
On Slide 7, you can see our volume and price/mix trends by division and by region. As we anticipated, topline performance was primarily driven by 5% volume growth with positive trends across all regions. Food Care volumes were up 5% with 9% growth in North America and positive trends in both Latin America and EMEA. Product Care volumes were up 6% driven by our largest regions: North America and EMEA increasing 4% and 7%, respectively. Overall price/mix was relatively neutral to our topline results. Keep in mind that our pricing actions in Product Care went into effect as of September 1, and in Food Care for our non-formula customers effective October 1. 
And now let's turn to Slide 8 and review Food Care results in more detail. Food Care sales were [ $760 million ] and adjusted EBITDA was $168 million or 22% of sales. Sales were up 4% in constant dollars compared to last year due to higher volumes. Our margin compressed year-over-year primarily due to timing of raw material cost pass-through and higher input cost. It is important to note, however, that sequentially, EBITDA margin improved [ 60 ] basis points as formula started to align better with higher input costs and we continued to focus our focus on expense management. 
Our performance in North America, which accounted for 51% of Food Care sales, was driven by the ongoing adoption of our case-ready platform across all proteins, including seafood and higher equipment sales. We capitalize on end market demand in all protein segments led by an increase in slaughter rates of more than 5% in the beef sector. We expect our business in the North America to continue outpacing the market in Q4, although keep in mind, we have the tougher year-over-year comparables on volumes to come. 
EMEA, which accounted for 22% of Food Care sales, was essentially flat compared with last year. We are continuing to see adoption of our new products in an environment where the protein market is growing modestly, but this was offset by timing of equipment sales. Heading into year-end, we anticipate improving topline trends with growing coming -- with growth coming from both equipment and new product sales. 
APAC accounted for 50% of Food Care with Australia and New Zealand accounting for close to 70% of our sales in this region. Australia and New Zealand declined in the quarter as a result of further deterioration in the dairy market. But an encouraging data point to share is that for the first time in over a year, slaughter rates in Australia were relatively flat with prior year. The beef cycle is now near bottom, and we expect growth to return late 2018. 
Latin America represented the remaining 12% of sales with Mexico, Brazil and Argentina accounting for approximately 80% of Food Care sales. Constant dollar sales were [ up 3% ] led by growth in Argentina and stabilizing trends in Brazil. This was offset by a temporary decline in Mexico, where our business was impacted by the earthquake late in the quarter. But heading into year-end, we anticipate improving trends in both Brazil and Mexico, albeit slow with continued growth in Central America. 
For the full year 2017, we expect Food Care to increase sales approximately 3.5% in constant dollars. Adjusted EBITDA margin are expected to be approximately 22%. 
Slide 9 highlights results from our Product Care division. Product Care net sales were $415 million, and adjusted EBITDA was $87 million or 21% of net sales. You can see in the EBITDA bridge that compared to last year, higher volumes were offset by a negative mix and price/cost spread. Product Care margins improved sequentially by 100 basis points. This improvement was primarily related to higher volume, yield on our pricing actions and cost management. 
North America and EMEA accounted for approximately 85% of Product Care sales and were up 4% and 7%, respectively. APAC had another strong quarter with 15% growth led by China and Japan. Our advanced product portfolio, including inflatable, iPac, SalesWrap and FloWrap continue to gain significant traction as our e-commerce and fulfillment customers optimize and automate their distribution channels. In Western Europe, I want to highlight that in the third quarter, we benefited from accelerated execution of automated solutions, volume growth of our consumables after record level of equipment installed over the last 12 months and focus of strength across some of the industrial segments. With the acquisition of Fagerdala, we triple our manufacturing footprint in China and as you would expect, there are synergies to leverage and meaningful cost selling opportunities. 
For the full year of 2017, we expect Product Care to increase sales approximately 6% on a constant dollar basis, which would include $20 million in sales from Fagerdala. 
Adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to be approximately 20%, and this implies a Q4 constant dollar year-over-year growth of approximately 10% and adjusted EBITDA margin of 21%. 
Let me now turn the call over to Bill to review our overall sales and EBITDA bridges and outlook heading into year-end. Bill?"

Slide 11 and 12 provide the net sales and EBITDA bridges for Q3 and 9 months ending September 30. My comments will focus on Slide 11, which highlights our third quarter results from continuing operations on a year-over-year basis. You can see that our topline performance was primarily led by higher volumes of $55 million and favorable currency of $13 million. Adjusted EBITDA was $217 million or 19% of sales. Volume contributed $23 million in Q3, which was partially offset by unfavorable mix and price/cost spread of [ $16 million. ] Operating expenses decreased $10 million and restructuring savings were $4 million. Currency had a favorable impact on adjusted EBITDA of $3 million. 
Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.46 in the third quarter compared to $0.41 in Q3 of 2016. Our adjusted tax rate for continuing operations was 31%. 
On Slide 12, we present our sales and EBITDA bridges for the 9 months ended September 30. In the EBITDA bridge, we see that higher volumes were essentially offset by unfavorable mix and price/cost spread. 
Turning to Slide 13. Free cash flow is presented on a consolidated basis, which includes results from continuing and discontinued operations. For the 9 months ended September 30, consolidated free cash flow, excluding payments related to the sale of Diversey, was a source of cash of $267 million. CapEx was $127 million. Cash interest payments were $153 million and restructuring costs were $49 million. Aligned with our typical free cash flow seasonality, working capital and other assets and liabilities were a use of cash of $70 million. 
Turning to our outlook on Slide 14. For topline, we now expect sales to be approximately $4.4 billion, an increase of 6% on an as-reported basis. Favorable FX is expected to have an impact of approximately $40 million. Constant dollar growth is expected to be approximately 4.5%, including sales from Fagerdala [ up ] $20 million. Our major currency exposures include the euro, which was approximately 13% of net sales in Q3; the Australian dollar, 5%; and the Mexican peso; British pound; Canadian dollars; and Brazilian real, were each approximately 3% of net sales. 2017 adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations is expected to be approximately $830 million, which includes $7 million from favorable FX. Corporate expenses are now estimated to be $115 million. Our net interest expense for 2017 is estimated at $185 million. Depreciation and amortization is forecasted to be $160 million. We now expect our adjusted tax rate to be 30% for the full year 2017. 
Our outlook for adjusted earnings per share is unchanged at 1 75 to 1 80. Our adjusted EPS outlook is based on 190 million shares, which reflects the weighted average full year effect of share repurchases through September 30. 
Let's now turn to Slide 15 and review our free cash flow outlook. As a reminder, we present free cash flow on a consolidated basis, which includes our outlook for continuing operations and results from discontinued operations. We continue to expect free cash flow to be approximately $400 million. This forecast excludes cash payments related to the sale of Diversey. To calculate our free cash flow outlook, we start with an estimated consolidated adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1 billion, which includes our full year 2017 outlook from continuing operations of $830 million. We anticipate cash interest payments to be $200 million and cash tax payments to be [ $160 million. ] Restructuring cash costs, excluding efforts dedicated to reducing separation-related costs, are estimated to be $55 million. Capital expenditures are forecasted to be $175 million, of which [ $165 million ] represents Sealed Air continuing operations. Restructuring-related CapEx is expected to be $20 million in 2017 and is included in the $175 million CapEx estimate. Working capital and other assets and liabilities is now expected to be a use of cash of approximately $40 million as compared to our previous guidance of a use of cash of $65 million. As you know, a large portion of our free cash flow is typically generated in the second half of the year with the fourth quarter being our strongest quarter for cash generation. 
I would like to now pass the call over to Ted, who will provide us with early insights and thoughts on our future opportunities and strategic direction. On behalf of the senior leadership team and our employees, we would like to welcome you to Sealed Air and congratulate you on your new role."

As Jerome indicated, I started at Sealed Air mid-September and my short story is that I like the company even more looking inside than I did analyzing it from the outside. I've been traveling the world to meet with employees and customers and have also had the opportunity to visit some of our facilities, including spending time with the talented team from Fagerdala in China. My previous experience has been with 2 iconic and market-leading companies in the equipment, service and solution space. When I was approached about the opportunity with Sealed Air, I saw another iconic company that has successfully transformed over these past 5 years from a product-driven to a market-driven company. As I learn more about Sealed Air, I see that we have an exciting opportunity to now move from being a leading company in the packaging industry to being a world-class company selling the most complex challenges in packaging with automated solutions. Sealed Air's reputation of being a true innovative leader within the global packaging segment is impressive, and our pipeline of automation in both Product Care and Food Care is creating even more opportunity to further reimagine the business and think outside the box and maybe even outside the package. In 2018, we'll build off our sales growth in 2017 and gain share in the markets we serve. We will execute our strategy with both sales and profit growth as well as operational excellence that will demonstrate incremental margin improvement over 2017. We'll continue to allocate capital as we outlined with share buybacks and strategic M&A. With $1.4 billion remaining under the authorized share buyback program,  we'll continue to be active in the market with open market and accelerated share repurchases. On M&A, we'll focus on companies that expand our market presence geographically and take our innovations to adjacent markets. We look for technology and automation companies that further enhance our Food Care and Product Care businesses that solve our customers' toughest packaging challenges. Our organic growth, M&A strategy and focus on operational excellence will take our business to the next level of performance. 
We plan on sharing our 2018 and long-term profitable growth plans with you in the coming months, including an Investor Day later next year.

So let me remind you, $0.15 since the beginning of the year, that's almost 20%. And since August 1, that's about 13%. And here, we're talking about PE. I'm not talking about nylon, I'm not talking about other raw materials, which went in a very steep way. So this is in light of us having in Food Care a sizable part of our business, which is formula driven. And remember also that in the month of July and before, we were thinking -- and not only us, everybody was thinking that because of the capacity additions coming on stream, prices were not going to go up. They were going to come down. So yes, we did have margin squeezed. I would call it margin compression. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we are seeing that this is temporary and that as a result of that, we are going to do what we have done in the last round when resin prices went down, we are going to recoup our -- the quality of our business. So I'm really not worried. And we are going to start seeing this in my mind, definitely in 2018, depending on the pace again at which resins are really coming down."

I guess, I would've thought by now, we'll start to see some of the formula-based pricing from earlier in the year when resin started to move up, kick in. I'm just wondering if there's some offsetting factors on there on the mix side of things. And maybe you could just comment on the overall pricing environment outside of the moves in resin. We heard from a couple of other guys in the industry about some pricing pressure just in response to weak and demand and some other related products with customer margins. Are you seeing any pressure to pass through some of that deflation that we're seeing in food these days? And these price increases that you've announced for September 1 and October 1, are you getting any significant customer pushback to those so far?"

Because we had PE margins in nylon and so on margin compress",449,"So let me start with the last part of your question. Our September 1 Product Care price increase went through fully. Our October non-formula pricing, Food Care price increase went in fully. Why? Because we had PE margins in nylon and so on margin compression and we also had other type of inflation, including freight. And for those of you who don't know that post Harvey had consequences on freight cost, availability of trucks needing to buy resins from the spot market and all of those kind of things because our priority #1 was to delight our customers over a difficult times for supplies and sellers, et cetera. And we did not spare any efforts nor any money in making sure that we will have absolutely no disruption. Did that cost money? Absolutely. But what is absolutely important to understand is what I said exactly 5 years ago or in January in 2012 when I said we are the market leader. The market leader has a responsibility, and the responsibility for the market leader is to be disciplined and to lead on price. Yes, we do need to be leading on price. We have led on price, which is why we're still extraordinarily firm. Yet we did hear that some competitors were not as disciplined. That's their problem. We -- in order to keep investing, the amount of money we're investing in innovation in order to bring them, our customers, the revolutionary solutions that we're bringing them and surprise them by adding value, tremendous new value to them, we need to be able to have the funds and the resources and, therefore, keep investing at the pace we're investing and, by the way, accelerating to bring those solutions in automation, in new product, et cetera, et cetera. So that is the context. Next to that, you do have -- and this is why we are already slightly improving on our margins compared to the first half of the year as a result of having this September 1 price increase in Product Care [indiscernible]. So do we have competition? Yes, we do have competition. But you have customers who are price-driven customers, which are not the ones we want. And you have customers who are value customers, which is the ones we want. And we are absolutely committed to continue, thanks to our solutions, to add new additional and much higher value than they could get from a slight price concessions. Do we have markets [indiscernible] here and there? Of course, but not very much more than before, depending on the country, including the U.S. We have some competitors who have been desperate in taking business, but this is normal."

The success of the strategy that we have embarked into in Product Care moving to automation, the very successful B+ acquisition of August of [ 2015 ] continues at a fast pace. The deployment of those automation technologies in Japan, in China, in Europe and in North America adds a tremendous success. And also, our automation in Food Care we called No Link and Cognovit Pro and on the other end, our case-ready, which is really starting to take hold. So we're very confident that we are exactly on the pace to do and execute on what we said back in June of 2015 when we gave the '16 to 2018 look during our Analyst Day. It is actually amazing to see how what we said at that time is happening. Going back to your question on margin, we have formulas in Food Care and they've been a little bit slower to kick in because they would have kicked in -- they were supposed to kick in from the [ third ] quarter as resins were coming down and as formulas were coming up, leading to margin expansion. And as resins came up, you see that this phenomenon is slightly delayed. And we have proven to you in the past that in an environment like the one we're going to lead through, probably through the end of this year and into early next year, we are going to restore our margins.

So pricing opportunities we have, I see in the business that we need to look at and push pricing for certain options, other things that are there. So we have some pricing opportunity going forward. On the innovations side, as Jerome highlighted, that's been really exciting for me and just my first 6 weeks to see how we're at the table, not a with itty-bitty but with the big players. Jerome's introduced me. I got to meet some of the major players and we're there talking about their biggest problems. If we stay in that commodity base where some of our competitors are, then we have to live with the pricing and that will bring up operational excellence. We got to continue to drive our cost down. But with these innovations, for instance, your statistics on flatscreen TVs going to the Internet. Over half of them are being shipped. The number one problem this major e-commerce customers have is damage. How can we fix that? We're at the table to do that. The second problem is making it easy and environmentally friendly for where it shows up. So we're on conversation, not what is price of your product, can you help us solve this problem, bring that solution across. And we have some really cool innovative technology that we're talking about the solution and there's no conversation in what is  widget A versus widget B last year. So that ties innovation into pricing in the margin that you want to see. The third piece of the operational excellence, I think we have an opportunity to really drive the business to world-class level and operational excellence. We had a huge disruption in the business with the sale of Diversey, really bringing the team together, looking at our facilities around the world.

So our solutions that we're working on when you pull it out-of-the-box, make it nice and pretty. Maybe do you really need the box? Do you need that Styrofoam which you're throwing away?

This, along with our initial actions to reduce the unallocated and the stranded costs, is why we're now estimating our corporate expenses to be approximately $115 million for the full year 2017. Ted and I have actually been meeting quite a bit, working together on our specific plans to address these stranded costs as well as unallocated cost going forward, and we'll continue supporting growth initiatives while at the same time addressing stranded costs. Relative to the types of costs, we've said that we have $20 million of unallocated cost and they're actually going to be offset by transition services agreement revenue. That TSA revenue actually began on September 6 when we closed to the Diversey transaction, and they will go forward on a 12 to an 18-month period beginning in September of '17 and will also then give us time to specifically reduce those unallocated costs. Meanwhile, for the $20 million of stranded costs, we are absolutely on track and we're very confident that our 24-month target, which is 24 months since the separation, is achievable and we will work towards that goal."

You will have also the opportunity to hear from Ted Doheny, who will be taking over as CEO from me on January 1; and Bill Stiehl, our Acting Chief Financial Officer. But before all and relevant to my retirement, I take this opportunity to let you know that I ran my first New York -- my first marathon in New York last Sunday. Thanks to my son, Alexi, and my friend, Allen. For those of you who are up to the challenge, you will be rewarded for life. But don't worry, I will not turn into Forest Gump in my retirement. 
Back to business. You can see that in the third quarter, net sales growth accelerated to 6% on an as-reported basis and 5% in constant dollars. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 19%. Our performance in the third quarter continued to improve compared to the first half of the year when we delivered 3% constant dollar top line growth and 18% margin. And this momentum is continuing into the fourth quarter and we have been -- and we are delivering on our 2017 outlook as a result of our higher sales in our pricing and cost discipline. In fact, we are executing on our long-term profitable growth strategy that we outlined at the Analyst Day in June 2015. Remember, at that time, we set a 3-year sales growth target of 4% to 5% for each of those 2 divisions. We said that we expect sales growth to accelerate throughout the period of 2016 to 2018 and that this growth would be led by volume, thanks to our market maker innovative strategy. In 2016, we didn't see much movement on the topline and exited the year with an increase of just 1% constant dollar sales growth. However, our growth have been improving each quarter since the fourth quarter of 2016. In the fourth quarter of last year, we started delivering one -- in constant currency 1% sales growth. In the first quarter of this year in constant dollars, we delivered 3% growth. In the second quarter, we delivered 4% growth and now in the third quarter, we are reporting 5% constant currency sales growth. And should the temporary and incredibly steep PE resin cost increases of 13% or $0.10 per pound since August and $0.15 year-to-date not has surprised all our industry, those sales gains would've translated into the bottom line already. The good news is that I said temporary cost increases and also, that we have fully implemented our announced Product Care and Food Care price increases on September 1 and October 1, respectively. This is where our confidence comes in as we head into year-end. We are seeing rapid adoption of our game-changing solutions. We're seeing healthy end market demand, particularly in North America and Asia and our now famous operational disciplines are taking hold. 
On September 6th, we closed the Diversey sale. When we announced the transaction in March 2017, we increased our share repurchase program and we said that we would pay down debt, address stranded costs and target selected M&A that was aligned with our strategic direction. Through September 30, we repurchased approximately 15.5 million shares valued at $677 million through a combination of open-market and accelerated share repurchase programs, including a new sale that is currently ongoing. We paid down $1.1 billion in debt, bringing our total debt balance down to $3.3 billion. We have already made progress on our cost structure and we'll continue to do so heading into next year. 
We also closed 2 acquisitions, a small strategic food packaging company in Brazil, Deltaplam, which closed in August. And then in October, we closed the Fagerdala acquisition, a Protective Packaging company based in Singapore that significantly expands our presence in Asia. 
As all of you know, on September 9th, I announced my retirement effective December 31, 2017. I have really enjoyed my time at Sealed Air, and I'm extremely proud of what we have become, thanks to the vision and determination of our management team and our 14,000 global employees who I want to recognize here. We have built a winning culture, a culture that is obsessed with creating new value for our customers. We take the responsibility of being the industry leader and the market maker by creating new markets with disruptive innovations and instilling discipline throughout the industries we serve. Our long-term profitable growth strategy is well underway and we continue to gain traction globally as you could see from our sales growth, focusing all of our efforts on some very key mega trends. Our journey as a knowledge-based company continues with many exciting opportunities ahead. And I am very confident that under Ted, Bill and the entire leadership team, the organization will continue to thrive and generate significant value for our customers, shareholders and employees. 
Bill join Sealed Air in 2013 and has been on this journey alongside our senior leadership team. Ted and I continue to work closely together to ensure a seamless and successful transition. We have been spending time in Charlotte, North Carolina and have also -- and are also traveling around the world with our senior team to meet with customers and employees. 
Let me now move back to our third quarter results in more detail and turning to Slide 6, where we highlight our results by region. We experienced constant dollar year-over-year growth across all regions. North America once again was our fastest growing region at 7%, with sales up 9% in Food Care and up 4% in Product Care. Sales in EMEA, Asia-Pacific and Latin America increased in the range of 2% to 3%. I want to highlight that Product Care sales in Asia-Pacific were up 15% in the third quarter led by volume growth. 
On Slide 7, you can see our volume and price mix trends by division and by region. As we anticipated, topline performance was primarily driven by 5% volume growth with positive trends across all regions. Food Care volumes were up 5% with 9% growth in North America and positive trends in both Latin America and EMEA. Product Care volumes were up 6% driven by our largest regions: North America and EMEA increasing 4% and 7%, respectively. Overall price mix was relatively neutral to our topline results. Keep in mind that our pricing actions in Product Care went into effect as of September 1, and in Food Care for our non-formula customers effective October 1. 
And now let's turn to Slide 8 and review Food Care results in more detail. Food Care sales were  $716 million and adjusted EBITDA was $158 million or 22% of sales. Sales were up 4% in constant dollars compared to last year due to higher volumes. Our margin compressed year-over-year primarily due to timing of raw material cost passthroughs and higher input cost. It is important to note, however, that sequentially, EBITDA margin improved 60 basis points, as formula started to align better with higher input costs and we continued to focus our focus on expense management. 
Our performance in North America, which accounted for 51% of Food Care sales, was driven by the ongoing adoption of our cash-ready platform across all proteins, including seafood and higher equipment sales. We capitalize on end market demand in all protein segments led by an increase in slaughter rates of more than 5% in the beef sector. We expect our business in North America to continue outpacing the market. In Q4, although keep in mind, we have tougher year-over-year comparables on volumes to come. 
EMEA, which accounted for 22% of Food Care sales, was essentially flat compared with last year. We are continuing to see adoption of our new products in an environment where the protein market is growing modestly, but this was offset by timing of equipment sales. Heading into year-end, we anticipate improving topline trends with growing coming -- with growth coming from both equipment and new product sales. 
APAC accounted for 15% of Food Care with Australia and New Zealand accounting for close to 70% of our sales in this region. Australia and New Zealand declined in the quarter as a result of further deterioration in the dairy market. But an encouraging data point to share is that for the first time in over a year, slaughter rates in Australia were relatively flat with prior year. The beef cycle is now near bottom, and we expect growth to return late 2018. 
Latin America represented the remaining 12% of sales with Mexico, Brazil and Argentina accounting for approximately 80% of Food Care sales. Constant dollar sales were up 3% led by growth in Argentina and stabilizing trends in Brazil. This was offset by a temporary decline in Mexico, where our business was impacted by the earthquake late in the quarter. But heading into year-end, we anticipate improving trends in both Brazil and Mexico, albeit slow with continued growth in Central America. 
For the full year 2017, we expect Food Care to increase sales approximately 3.5% in constant dollars. Adjusted EBITDA margin are expected to be approximately 22%. 
Slide 9 highlights results from our Product Care division. Product Care net sales were $415 million, and adjusted EBITDA was $87 million or 21% of net sales. You can see in the EBITDA bridge that compared to last year, higher volumes were offset by a negative mix and price/cost spread. Product Care margins improved sequentially by 100 basis points. This improvement was primarily related to higher volume, yield on our pricing actions and cost management. 
North America and EMEA accounted for approximately 85% of Product Care sales and were up 4% and 7%, respectively. APAC had another strong quarter with 15% growth led by China and Japan. Our advanced product portfolio, including inflatable, I-Pack, sales wrap and FloWrap continue to gain significant traction as our e-commerce and fulfillment customers optimize and automate their distribution channels. In Western Europe, I want to highlight that in the third quarter, we benefited from accelerated execution of automated solutions, volume growth of our consumables after record level of equipment installed over the last 12 months and pockets of strength across some of the industrial segments. With the acquisition of Fagerdala, we triple our manufacturing footprint in China and as you would expect, there are synergies to leverage and meaningful cross-selling opportunities. 
For the full year of 2017, we expect Product Care to increase sales approximately 6% on a constant dollar basis, which would include $20 million in sales from Fagerdala. 
Adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to be approximately 20%, and this implies a Q4 constant dollar year-over-year growth of approximately 10% and adjusted EBITDA margin of 21%. 
Let me now turn the call over to Bill to review our overall sales and EBITDA bridges and outlook heading into year-end. Bill?"

Slide 11 and 12 provide the net sales and EBITDA bridges for Q3 and 9 months ending September 30. My comments will focus on Slide 11, which highlights our third quarter results from continuing operations on a year-over-year basis. You can see that our topline performance was primarily led by higher volumes of $55 million and favorable currency of $13 million. Adjusted EBITDA was $217 million or 19% of sales. Volume contributed $23 million in Q3, which was partially offset by unfavorable mix and price/cost spread of $16 million. Operating expenses decreased $10 million and restructuring savings were $4 million. Currency had a favorable impact on adjusted EBITDA of $3 million. 
Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.46 in the third quarter compared to $0.41 in Q3 of 2016. Our adjusted tax rate for continuing operations was 31%. 
On Slide 12, we present our sales and EBITDA bridges for the 9-month ending September 30. In the EBITDA bridge, we see that higher volumes were essentially offset by unfavorable mix and price/cost spread. 
Turning to Slide 13. Free cash flow is presented on a consolidated basis, which includes the results from continuing and discontinued operations. For the 9 months ended September 30, consolidated free cash flow, excluding payments related to the sale of Diversey, was a source of cash of $267 million. CapEx was $127 million. Cash interest payments were $153 million and restructuring costs were $49 million. Aligned with our typical free cash flow seasonality, working capital and other assets and liabilities were a use of cash of $70 million. 
Turning to our outlook on Slide 14. For topline, we now expect sales to be approximately $4.4 billion, an increase of 6% on an as-reported basis. Favorable FX is expected to have an impact of approximately $40 million. Constant dollar growth is expected to be approximately 4.5%, including sales from Fagerdala of $20 million. Our major currency exposures include the euro, which was approximately 13% of net sales in Q3; the Australian dollar, 5%; and the Mexican peso, British pound, Canadian dollars, and Brazilian real, were each approximately 3% of net sales. 2017 adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations is expected to be approximately $830 million, which includes $7 million from favorable FX. Corporate expenses are now estimated to be $115 million. Our net interest expense for 2017 is estimated at $185 million. Depreciation and amortization is forecasted to be $160 million. We now expect our adjusted tax rate to be 30% for the full year 2017. 
Our outlook for adjusted earnings per share is unchanged at $1.75 to $1.80. Our adjusted EPS outlook is based on 190 million shares, which reflects the weighted average full year effect of share repurchases through September 30. 
Let's now turn to Slide 15 and review our free cash flow outlook. As a reminder, we present free cash flow on a consolidated basis, which includes our outlook for continuing operations and results from discontinued operations. We continue to expect free cash flow to be approximately $400 million. This forecast excludes cash payments related to the sale of Diversey. To calculate our free cash flow outlook, we start with an estimated consolidated adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1 billion, which includes our full year 2017 outlook from continuing operations of $830 million. We anticipate cash interest payments to be $200 million and cash tax payments to be $160 million. Restructuring cash costs, excluding efforts dedicated to reducing separation-related costs, are estimated to be $55 million. Capital expenditures are forecasted to be $175 million, of which $165 million represents Sealed Air continuing operations. Restructuring-related CapEx is expected to be $20 million in 2017 and is included in the $175 million CapEx estimate. Working capital and other assets and liabilities is now expected to be a use of cash of approximately $40 million as compared to our previous guidance of a use of cash of $65 million. As you know, a large portion of our free cash flow is typically generated in the second half of the year with the fourth quarter being our strongest quarter for cash generation. 
I would like to now pass the call over to Ted, who will provide us with early insights and thoughts on our future opportunities and strategic direction. On behalf of the senior leadership team and our employees, we would like to welcome you to Sealed Air and congratulate you on your new role."

As Jerome indicated, I started at Sealed Air mid-September and my short story is that I like the company even more looking inside than I did analyzing it from the outside. I've been traveling the world to meet with employees and customers and have also had the opportunity to visit some of our facilities, including spending time with the talented team from Fagerdala in China. My previous experience has been with 2 iconic and market-leading companies in the equipment, service and solution space. When I was approached about the opportunity with Sealed Air, I saw another iconic company that has successfully transformed over these past 5 years from a product-driven to a market-driven company. As I learn more about Sealed Air, I see that we have an exciting opportunity to now move from being a leading company in the packaging industry to being a world-class company solving the most complex challenges in packaging with automated solutions. Sealed Air's reputation of being a true innovative leader within the global packaging segment is impressive, and our pipeline of automation in both Product Care and Food Care is creating even more opportunity to further reimagine the business and think outside the box and maybe even outside the package. In 2018, we'll build off our sales growth in 2017 and gain share in the markets we serve. We will execute our strategy with both sales and profit growth as well as the operational excellence that will demonstrate incremental margin improvement over 2017. We'll continue to allocate capital as we outlined with share buybacks and strategic M&A. With $1.4 billion remaining under the authorized share buyback program, we'll continue to be active in the market with open market and accelerated share repurchases. On M&A, we'll focus on companies that expand our market presence geographically and take our innovations to adjacent markets. We look for technology and automation companies that further enhance our Food Care and Product Care businesses could solve our customers' toughest packaging challenges. Our organic growth, M&A strategy and focus on operational excellence will take our business to the next level of performance. 
We plan on sharing our 2018 and long-term profitable growth plans with you in the coming months, including an Investor Day later next year.

I'm not talking about nylon, I'm not talking about other raw materials, which went up in a very steep way. So this is in light of us having in Food Care a sizable part of our business, which is formula driven. And remember also that in the month of July and before, we were thinking -- and not only us, everybody was thinking that because of the capacity additions coming on stream, prices were not going to go up. They were going to come down. So yes, we did have margin squeezed. I would call it margin compression. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we are seeing that this is temporary and that as a result of that, we are going to do what we have done in the last round when resin prices went down, we are going to recoup our -- the quality of our business. So I'm really not worried. And we are going to start seeing this in my mind, definitely in 2018, depending on the pace again at which resins are going to be coming down."

My question is sort of really on price mix and just sort of the lack of lift there. I guess, I would've thought by now, we'd start to see some of the formula-based pricing from earlier in the year when resin started to move up, kick in. I'm just wondering if there's some offsetting factors on there on the mix side of things. And maybe you could just comment on the overall pricing environment outside of the moves in resin. We've heard from a couple of other guys in the industry about some pricing pressure just in response to weak and demand and some other food-related products to be customer margins. Are you seeing any pressure to pass through some of that deflation that we're seeing in food these days? And these price increases that you've announced for September 1 and October 1, are you getting any significant customer pushback to those so far?"

Our October non-formula pricing, Food Care price increase went in fully. Why? Because we had PE margins and nylon and so on, margin compression and we also had other type of inflation, including freight. And for those of you who don't know that post Harvey had consequences on freight cost, availability of trucks needed to -- needing to buy resins on the spot market and all of those kind of things because our priority #1 was to delight our customers who were in difficult times for supplies and sellers, et cetera. And we did not spare any efforts nor any money in making sure that we would have absolutely no disruption. Did that cost money? Absolutely. But what absolutely important to understand is what I said exactly 5 years ago or in January in 2012 when I said we are the market leader. The market leader has a responsibility, and the responsibility for the market leader is to be disciplined and to lead on price. Yes, we do need to be leading on price. We have led on price, which is why we stood extraordinary firm. Yes, we did hear that some competitors were not as disciplined that's their problem.
We -- in order to keep investing, the amount of money we're investing in innovation in order to bring them, our customers, the revolutionary solutions that we're bringing them and surprise them by adding value, tremendous new value to them, we need to be able to have the funds and the resources and, therefore, keep investing at the pace we're investing and, by the way, accelerating to bring those solutions in automation, in new product, et cetera, et cetera. So that is the context. Next to that, you do have -- and this is why we are already slightly improving on our margins compared to the first half of the year as a result of having this September 1 price increase in Product Care [indiscernible]. So do we have competition? Yes, we do have competition. But you have customers who are price-driven customers, which are not the ones we want. And you have customers who are value customers, which is those we want. And we are absolutely committed to continue, thanks to our solutions, to add new additional and much higher value than they could get from a slight price concession. Do we have market skirmishes here and there? Of course, but not very much more than before, depending on the country, including the U.S. we have some competitors who are a bit desperate in taking business, but this is normal."

I wanted to come back to the margin question a little bit differently. Can you tell us maybe in rank order priority what gives you confidence that in 2018, that you'll be able to leverage the very, very good volume growth to date and presumably positive volume growth into 2018 into stronger EBITDA? Will it be more from the pricing? Will it be more from the formula lags turning more favorably?

Thanks, George. I'll start and Ted will continue. George, all of the above ends our innovation, which means that you saw that we have renewed with constant currency growth in the fourth quarter of 2016 and since then, it's been on and on and accelerating. The comparables are going to get a little bit tougher, but it is our innovation, which is fueling all of this. The success of the strategy that we have embarked into in Product Care moving to automation, the very successful B+ acquisition of August of 2015 continues at a fast pace. The deployment of those automation technologies in Japan, in China, in Europe and in North America adds a tremendous success. And also, our automation in Food Care with Cogni Link (sic) [ CogniPRO Link ] and CogniPRO; and on the other end, our case-ready, which is really starting to take hold. So we're very confident that we are exactly on the pace to do and execute on what we said back in June of 2015 when we gave the '16 to 2018 look during our Analyst Day. It is actually amazing to see how what we said at that time is happening. Going back to your question on margin, we have formulas in Food Care and they've been a little bit slower to kick in because they would have kicked in -- they were supposed to kick in from the third quarter as resins were coming down and as formulas was coming up, leading to margin expansion. And as resins came up, you see that this phenomenon is slightly delayed. And we have proven to you in the past that in an environment like the one we're going to live through, probably through the end of this year and into early next year, we are going to restore our margins. You had a quick follow-up, but Ted is on the operational excellence, maybe?"

On the pricing, just to make a comment, Jerome, has just done a tremendous job. And one thing I just want to let you, George, and everybody know that I'll be taking over as the Chief Pricing Officer from Jerome. So -- and feel comfortable with that, some of the pricing opportunities we have I think are in the business that we need to look at and push pricing for certain options, other things that are there. So we have some pricing opportunity going forward. On the innovations side, as Jerome highlighted, that's been really exciting for me and just my first 6 weeks to see how we're at the table, not a with itty-bitty but with the big players. Jerome's introduced me. I got to meet some of the major players and we're there talking about their biggest problems. If we stay in that commodity base where some of our competitors are, then we have to live with the pricing and that will bring up operational excellence. We got to continue to drive our cost down. But with these innovations, for instance, your statistics on flat screen TVs going to the Internet. Over half of them are being shipped. The number one problem this major e-commerce customers are having is damage. How can we fix that? We're at the table to do that. The second problem is making it easy and environmentally friendly for where it shows up. So we're on conversation, not what is the price of your product, can you help us solve this problem, bring that solution across. And we have some really cool innovative technology that we're talking about the solution and there's no conversation what was rigid A versus rigid B last year. So that tight innovation in the pricing and the margin that you want to see. The third piece is the operational excellence, I think we have an opportunity to really drive the business to world-class level and operational excellence. We've had a huge disruption in the business with the sale of Diversey, really bringing the team together, looking at our facilities around the world. What can we do to bring some operational excellence to the bottom line in 2018? I think we have some opportunities there and it gives you bridgeable items. We're not giving any guidance on 2018, but just give you some thoughts on what we're looking at."

But you see our total business being very solid and you know that our rates, our meats, our cattle, beef prices or beef products are only a part of the whole thing and we are having success with our case-ready solutions all over. And there is a change in the market places, including in North America with our case-ready solutions because the market is changing because of the need for sustainability because, for example, California having banned phone trace and those kind of things. And therefore, you have MAP, modifiable atmosphere packaging, and you have our Darfresh, which is kicking in very nicely. So we're confident. 2018, you're going to see that there is -- that the comparable there will be easier.

There are some very big foreign companies who launch new products, and they have our solution as the product that in which their phones are packed to the Internet. And this is big business and it is this innovation, and it is this need for not only addressing dimensional weight, which is the #1 cash cost operation in the cost to serve of e-commerce, number one, is dimensional weight, which means freight cost; the number two is labor productivity, it's labor; number three damage when the items are fragile. Number one it is the cost of packaging. What we do is reducing freight costs, is improving labor productivity, eliminating damage and we do that with the little slowest, smallest cost component, which is our packaging costs and the solution, which adds total value to our customers. So yes, this e-commerce and 3PL business is growing much faster and the margins are improving quarter after quarter as we address our -- as we introduce our innovation and our solution.

That means that we're going to be shipping most of this stuff and extending the shelf life that has made Food Care the dominant player in the industry. Now the shelf life has to go to the truck life, to the plane life, and so they're having to solve these problems with us. So the problems that we're bringing in are actually in the solutions. In the Product Care, to the point of where we get e-commerce quickly because that's moving -- everybody sees these products showing up at their homes. You don't want to see the polystyrene or -- I'm being trained by Jerome, or the Styrofoam all over your house. It's a problem. You don't want to see these packages that you're unpacking. You can even hurt yourself. So we're working on some innovative designs and I mentioned the flat screen TV, over half are now being purchased on the Internet. So our solutions that we're working on when you pull it out-of-the-box, make it nice and pretty. Maybe do you really need the box? Do you need that Styrofoam which you're throwing away? So the margins, to answer your questions, have to be in line with our portfolio, higher than our portfolio as we bring these new innovations. How we're doing it? We're saving our customers a tremendous amount of money that's pulling the solution. So short answer, the new innovations for Product Care have to be at higher margins than the existing portfolio."

That is really very important. And on top of that, we bought an extraordinary efficient fabricator.

Instead of us selling the polyethylene to an integrator and letting them do their value add, this is what they do and they do really, really well. And as Jerome said, they win in China, and I got to witness this. I got to meet with their 3 largest customers who happen to be the 3 largest PC manufacturers in the world in China. So they're at the table. They're talking what they can do to be their committed supplier in these areas. And also, those suppliers are asking them, can we move that now to the other facilities around the world? So not only does it have geographic growth potential for integrated packaging, it also has the potential to go outside. The second piece on there is the China piece that being in China, I wish I didn't have so much experience on China, that you have to be in China, you have to be Chinese to win in China. And I was extremely impressed with their management team. Three full days from the top watching the people on the shop floor, seeing their facilities where they do things very, very different than we do. I think the complement there is going to be exciting for us, but they win in China. And the customers, these major PC manufacturers, they're asking, ""Can we bring that solution outside of China as we grow this business?"" So pretty exciting opportunity for us."

Ted and I have actually been meeting quite a bit, working together on our specific plans to address these stranded costs as well as unallocated cost going forward, and we'll continue to support the growth initiatives while at the same time addressing stranded costs. Relative to the types of costs, we've said that we have $20 million of unallocated cost and they're actually going to be offset by transition services agreement revenue. That TSA revenue actually began on September 6 when we closed the Diversey transaction, and they will go forward on a 12- to an 18-month period beginning in September of '17 and will also then give us time to specifically reduce those unallocated costs. Meanwhile, for the $20 million of stranded costs, we are absolutely on track and we're very confident that our 24-month target, which is 24 months since the separation, is achievable and we will work towards that goal."

You will have also the opportunity to hear from Ted Doheny, who will be taking over as CEO from me on January 1; and Bill Stiehl, our Acting Chief Financial Officer. But before all and relevant to my retirement, I take this opportunity to let you know that I ran my first New York -- my first marathon in New York last Sunday, thanks to my son, Alexi, and my friend, Allen. For those of you who are up to the challenge, you will be rewarded for life. But don't worry, I will not turn into Forrest Gump in my retirement.
Back to business. You can see that in the third quarter, net sales growth accelerated to 6% on an as-reported basis and 5% in constant dollars. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 19%. Our performance in the third quarter continued to improve compared to the first half of the year when we delivered 3% constant dollar top line growth and 18% margin. And this momentum is continuing into the fourth quarter, and we have been -- and we are delivering on our 2017 outlook as a result of our higher sales and our pricing and cost discipline. In fact, we are executing on our long-term profitable growth strategy that we outlined at the Analyst Day in June 2015. Remember, at that time, we set a 3-year sales growth target of 4% to 5% for each of those 2 divisions. We said that we expect sales growth to accelerate throughout the period of 2016 to 2018 and that this growth would be led by volume, thanks to our market maker innovative strategy.
In 2016, we didn't see much movement on the top line and exited the year with an increase of just 1% constant dollar sales growth. However, our growth have been improving each quarter since the fourth quarter of 2016. In the fourth quarter of last year, we started delivering one -- in constant currency 1% sales growth. In the first quarter of this year in constant dollars, we delivered 3% growth. In the second quarter, we delivered 4% growth, and now in the third quarter, we are reporting 5% constant currency sales growth. And should the temporary and incredibly steep PE resin cost increases of 13% or $0.10 per pound since August and $0.15 year-to-date not have surprised all our industry, those sales gains would've translated into the bottom line already. The good news is that I said temporary cost increases and also, that we have fully implemented our announced Product Care and Food Care price increases on September 1 and October 1, respectively. This is where our confidence comes in as we head into year-end. We are seeing rapid adoption of our game-changing solutions. We're seeing healthy end market demand, particularly in North America and Asia, and our now famous operational disciplines are taking hold.
On September 6, we closed the Diversey sale. When we announced the transaction in March 2017, we increased our share repurchase program, and we said that we would pay down debt, address stranded costs and target selective M&A that was aligned with our strategic direction. Through September 30, we repurchased approximately 15.5 million shares valued at $677 million through a combination of open-market and accelerated share repurchase programs, including an ASR that is currently ongoing. We paid down $1.1 billion in debt, bringing our total debt balance down to $3.3 billion. We have already made progress on our cost structure and we'll continue to do so heading into next year.
We also closed 2 acquisitions, a small strategic food packaging company in Brazil, Deltaplam, which closed in August. And then in October, we closed the Fagerdala acquisition, a Protective Packaging company based in Singapore that significantly expands our presence in Asia.
As all of you know, on September 9, I announced my retirement effective December 31, 2017. I have really enjoyed my time at Sealed Air, and I'm extremely proud of what we have become, thanks to the vision and determination of our management team and our 14,000 global employees, who I want to recognize here. We have built a winning culture, a culture that is obsessed with creating new value for our customers. We take the responsibility of being the industry leader and the market maker by creating new markets with disruptive innovations and instilling discipline throughout the industries we serve. Our long-term profitable growth strategy is well under way, and we continue to gain traction globally as you could see from our sales growth, focusing all of our efforts on some very key mega trends. Our journey as a knowledge-based company continues with many exciting opportunities ahead. And I am very confident that under Ted, Bill and the entire leadership team, the organization will continue to thrive and generate significant value for our customers, shareholders and employees.
Bill join Sealed Air in 2013 and has been on this journey alongside our senior leadership team. Ted and I continue to work closely together to ensure a seamless and successful transition. We have been spending time in Charlotte, North Carolina and have also -- and are also traveling around the world with our senior team to meet with customers and employees.
Let me now move back to our third quarter results in more detail and turning to Slide 6, where we highlight our results by region. We experienced constant dollar year-over-year growth across all regions. North America once again was our fastest-growing region at 7%, with sales up 9% in Food Care and up 4% in Product Care. Sales in EMEA, Asia-Pacific and Latin America increased in the range of 2% to 3%. I want to highlight that Product Care sales in Asia-Pacific were up 15% in the third quarter led by volume growth.
On Slide 7, you can see our volume and price mix trends by division and by region. As we anticipated, top line performance was primarily driven by 5% volume growth with positive trends across all regions. Food Care volumes were up 5% with 9% growth in North America and positive trends in both Latin America and EMEA. Product Care volumes were up 6% driven by our largest regions: North America and EMEA increasing 4% and 7%, respectively. Overall price mix was relatively neutral to our top line results. Keep in mind that our pricing actions in Product Care went into effect as of September 1, and in Food Care for our non-formula customers effective October 1.
And now let's turn to Slide 8 and review Food Care results in more detail. Food Care sales were $716 million, and adjusted EBITDA was $158 million or 22% of sales. Sales were up 4% in constant dollars compared to last year due to higher volumes. Our margin compressed year-over-year primarily due to timing of raw material cost pass-throughs and higher input cost. It is important to note, however, that sequentially, EBITDA margin improved 60 basis points, as formula started to align better with higher input costs and we continued to focus our focus on expense management.
Our performance in North America, which accounted for 51% of Food Care sales, was driven by the ongoing adoption of our case-ready platform across all proteins, including seafood and higher equipment sales. We capitalize on end market demand in all protein segments led by an increase in slaughter rates of more than 5% in the beef sector. We expect our business in North America to continue outpacing the market in Q4, although keep in mind, we have tougher year-over-year comparables on volumes to come.
EMEA, which accounted for 22% of Food Care sales, was essentially flat compared with last year. We are continuing to see adoption of our new products in an environment where the protein market is growing modestly, but this was offset by timing of equipment sales. Heading into year-end, we anticipate improving top line trends with growing coming -- with growth coming from both equipment and new product sales.
APAC accounted for 15% of Food Care with Australia and New Zealand accounting for close to 70% of our sales in this region. Australia and New Zealand declined in the quarter as a result of further deterioration in the dairy market. But an encouraging data point to share is that for the first time in over a year, slaughter rates in Australia were relatively flat with prior year. The beef cycle is now near bottom, and we expect growth to return late 2018.
Latin America represented the remaining 12% of sales with Mexico, Brazil and Argentina accounting for approximately 80% of Food Care sales. Constant dollar sales were up 3% led by growth in Argentina and stabilizing trends in Brazil. This was offset by a temporary decline in Mexico, where our business was impacted by the earthquake late in the quarter. But heading into year-end, we anticipate improving trends in both Brazil and Mexico, albeit slow, with continued growth in Central America.
For the full year 2017, we expect Food Care to increase sales approximately 3.5% in constant dollars. Adjusted EBITDA margin are expected to be approximately 22%.
Slide 9 highlights results from our Product Care division. Product Care net sales were $415 million, and adjusted EBITDA was $87 million or 21% of net sales. You can see in the EBITDA bridge that compared to last year, higher volumes were offset by a negative mix and price/cost spread. Product Care margins improved sequentially by 100 basis points. This improvement was primarily related to higher volume, yield on our pricing actions and cost management.
North America and EMEA accounted for approximately 85% of Product Care sales and were up 4% and 7%, respectively. APAC had another strong quarter with 15% growth led by China and Japan. Our advanced product portfolio, including inflatable, I-Pack, sales wrap and FloWrap, continue to gain significant traction as our e-commerce and fulfillment customers optimize and automate their distribution channels. In Western Europe, I want to highlight that in the third quarter, we benefited from accelerated execution of automated solutions, volume growth of our consumables after record level of equipment installed over the last 12 months and pockets of strength across some of the industrial segments. With the acquisition of Fagerdala, we triple our manufacturing footprint in China and as you would expect, there are synergies to leverage and meaningful cross-selling opportunities.
For the full year of 2017, we expect Product Care to increase sales approximately 6% on a constant dollar basis, which would include $20 million in sales from Fagerdala.
Adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to be approximately 20%, and this implies a Q4 constant dollar year-over-year growth of approximately 10% and adjusted EBITDA margin of 21%.
Let me now turn the call over to Bill to review our overall sales and EBITDA bridges and outlook heading into year-end. Bill?"

Slides 11 and 12 provide the net sales and EBITDA bridges for Q3 and 9 months ending September 30. My comments will focus on Slide 11, which highlights our third quarter results from continuing operations on a year-over-year basis. You can see that our top line performance was primarily led by higher volumes of $55 million and favorable currency of $13 million. Adjusted EBITDA was $217 million or 19% of sales. Volume contributed $23 million in Q3, which was partially offset by unfavorable mix and price/cost spread of $16 million. Operating expenses decreased $10 million, and restructuring savings were $4 million. Currency had a favorable impact on adjusted EBITDA of $3 million.
Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.46 in the third quarter compared to $0.41 in Q3 of 2016. Our adjusted tax rate for continuing operations was 31%.
On Slide 12, we present our sales and EBITDA bridges for the 9 months ending September 30. In the EBITDA bridge, we see that higher volumes were essentially offset by unfavorable mix and price/cost spread.
Turning to Slide 13. Free cash flow is presented on a consolidated basis, which includes the results from continuing and discontinued operations. For the 9 months ended September 30, consolidated free cash flow excluding payments related to the sale of Diversey was a source of cash of $267 million. CapEx was $127 million. Cash interest payments were $153 million, and restructuring costs were $49 million. Aligned with our typical free cash flow seasonality, working capital and other assets and liabilities were a use of cash of $70 million.
Turning to our outlook on Slide 14. For top line, we now expect sales to be approximately $4.4 billion, an increase of 6% on an as-reported basis. Favorable FX is expected to have an impact of approximately $40 million. Constant dollar growth is expected to be approximately 4.5%, including sales from Fagerdala of $20 million. Our major currency exposures include the euro, which was approximately 13% of net sales in Q3; the Australian dollar, 5%; and the Mexican peso, British pound, Canadian dollar and Brazilian real were each approximately 3% of net sales. 2017 adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations is expected to be approximately $830 million, which includes $7 million from favorable FX. Corporate expenses are now estimated to be $115 million. Our net interest expense for 2017 is estimated at $185 million. Depreciation and amortization is forecasted to be $160 million. We now expect our adjusted tax rate to be 30% for the full year 2017.
Our outlook for adjusted earnings per share is unchanged at $1.75 to $1.80. Our adjusted EPS outlook is based on 190 million shares, which reflects the weighted average full year effect of share repurchases through September 30.
Let's now turn to Slide 15 and review our free cash flow outlook. As a reminder, we present free cash flow on a consolidated basis, which includes our outlook for continuing operations and results from discontinued operations. We continue to expect free cash flow to be approximately $400 million. This forecast excludes cash payments related to the sale of Diversey. To calculate our free cash flow outlook, we start with an estimated consolidated adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1 billion, which includes our full year 2017 outlook from continuing operations of $830 million. We anticipate cash interest payments to be $200 million and cash tax payments to be $160 million. Restructuring cash costs, excluding efforts dedicated to reducing separation-related costs, are estimated to be $55 million. Capital expenditures are forecasted to be $175 million, of which $165 million represents Sealed Air continuing operations. Restructuring-related CapEx is expected to be $20 million in 2017 and is included in the $175 million CapEx estimate. Working capital and other assets and liabilities is now expected to be a use of cash of approximately $40 million as compared to our previous guidance of a use of cash of $65 million. As you know, a large portion of our free cash flow is typically generated in the second half of the year with the fourth quarter being our strongest quarter for cash generation.
I would like to now pass the call over to Ted, who will provide us with early insights and thoughts on our future opportunities and strategic direction. On behalf of the senior leadership team and our employees, we would like to welcome you to Sealed Air and congratulate you on your new role."

As Jerome indicated, I started at Sealed Air mid-September, and my short story is that I like the company even more looking inside than I did analyzing it from the outside. I've been traveling the world to meet with employees and customers and have also had the opportunity to visit some of our facilities, including spending time with the talented team from Fagerdala in China.
My previous experience has been with 2 iconic and market-leading companies in the equipment, service and solution space. When I was approached about the opportunity with Sealed Air, I saw another iconic company that has successfully transformed over these past 5 years from a product-driven to a market-driven company.
As I learn more about Sealed Air, I see that we have an exciting opportunity to now move from being a leading company in the packaging industry to being a world-class company solving the most complex challenges in packaging with automated solutions. Sealed Air's reputation of being a true innovative leader within the global packaging segment is impressive, and our pipeline of automation in both Product Care and Food Care is creating even more opportunity to further reimagine the business and think outside the box and maybe even outside the package. In 2018, we'll build off our sales growth in 2017 and gain share in the markets we serve. We will execute our strategy with both sales and profit growth as well as operational excellence that will demonstrate incremental margin improvement over 2017.
We'll continue to allocate capital as we outlined with share buybacks and strategic M&A. With $1.4 billion remaining under the authorized share buyback program, we'll continue to be active in the market with open market and accelerated share repurchases. On M&A, we'll focus on companies that expand our market presence geographically and take our innovations to adjacent markets. We'll look for technology and automation companies that further enhance our Food Care and Product Care businesses that solve our customers' toughest packaging challenges. Our organic growth, M&A strategy and focus on operational excellence will take our business to the next level of performance.
We plan on sharing our 2018 and long-term profitable growth plans with you in the coming months, including an Investor Day later next year.
Before we open up the call for questions, I'd like to remind you our first fourth quarter earnings call is tentatively scheduled for Thursday, February 8.

I'm not talking about nylon, I'm not talking about other raw materials, which went up in a very steep way. So this is in light of us having in Food Care a sizable part of our business which is formula driven. And remember also that in the month of July and before, we were thinking -- and not only us, everybody was thinking that because of the capacity additions coming on stream, prices were not going to go up. They were going to come down. So yes, we did have margin squeezed. I would call it margin compression. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we are seeing that this is temporary and that as a result of that, we are going to do what we have done in the last round when resin prices went down, we are going to recoup our -- the quality of our business. So I'm really not worried. And we are going to start seeing this in my mind, definitely in 2018, depending on the pace again at which resins are going to be coming down."

And we did not spare any efforts nor any money in making sure that we would have absolutely no disruption. Did that cost money? Absolutely. But what is absolutely important to understand is what I said exactly 5 years ago or in January in 2012 when I said we are the market leader. The market leader has a responsibility, and the responsibility for the market leader is to be disciplined and to lead on price. Yes, we do need to be leading on price. We have led on price, which is why we stood extraordinarily firm. Yes, we did hear that some competitors were not as disciplined. That's their problem. We -- in order to keep investing, the amount of money we're investing in innovation in order to bring them, our customers, the revolutionary solutions that we're bringing them and surprise them by adding value, tremendous new value to them, we need to be able to have the funds and the resources and, therefore, keep investing at the pace we're investing and, by the way, accelerating to bring those solutions in automation, in new product, et cetera, et cetera. So that is the context. Next to that, you do have -- and this is why we are already slightly improving on our margins compared to the first half of the year as a result of having the September 1 price increase in Product Care [indiscernible]. So do we have competition? Yes, we do have competition. But you have customers who are price-driven customers, which are not the ones we want. And you have customers who are value customers, which is those we want. And we are absolutely committed to continue, thanks to our solutions, to add new additional and much higher value than they could get from a slight price concession. Do we have market skirmishes here and there? Of course, but not very much more than before, depending on the country, including the U.S. we have some competitors who are a bit desperate in taking business, but this is normal."

Can you tell us maybe in rank order priority what gives you confidence that in 2018, that you'll be able to leverage the very, very good volume growth to date and presumably positive volume growth into 2018 into stronger EBITDA? Will it be more from the pricing? Will it be more from the formula lags turning more favorably?

Thanks, George. I'll start and Ted will continue. George, all of the above ends our innovation, which means that you saw that we have renewed with constant currency growth in the fourth quarter of 2016 and since then, it's been on and on and accelerating. The comparables are going to get a little bit tougher, but it is our innovation, which is fueling all of this. The success of the strategy that we have embarked into in Product Care moving to automation, the very successful B+ acquisition of August of 2015 continues at a fast pace. The deployment of those automation technologies in Japan, in China, in Europe and in North America adds a tremendous success. And also, our automation in Food Care with Cogni Link (sic) [ CogniPRO Link ] and Cogni Link PRO; and on the other end, our case-ready, which is really starting to take hold. So we're very confident that we are exactly on the pace to do and execute on what we said back in June of 2015 when we gave the '16 to 2018 look during our Analyst Day. It is actually amazing to see how what we said at that time is happening. Going back to your question on margin, we have formulas in Food Care, and they've been a little bit slower to kick in because they would have kicked in -- they were supposed to kick in from the third quarter as resins were coming down and as formulas was coming up, leading to margin expansion. And as resins came up, you see that this phenomenon is slightly delayed. And we have proven to you in the past that in an environment like the one we're going to live through, probably through the end of this year and into early next year, we are going to restore our margins. You had a quick follow-up, but Ted, on the operational excellence, maybe?"

Well, let me segue those 2 going into 3 because you're talking about '18. And internally, that's the one that I'm possessive about. On the pricing, just to make a comment, Jerome has just done a tremendous job. And one thing I just want to let you, George, and everybody know that I'll be taking over as the Chief Pricing Officer from Jerome. So -- and feel comfortable with that, some of the pricing opportunities we have I think are in the business that we need to look at and push pricing for certain options, other things that are there. So we have some pricing opportunity going forward. On the innovations side, as Jerome highlighted, that's been really exciting for me in just my first 6 weeks to see how we're at the table, not with itty-bitty but with the big players. Jerome's introduced me. I got to meet some of the major players, and we're there talking about their biggest problems. If we stay in that commodity base where some of our competitors are, then we have to live with the pricing, and that will bring up operational excellence. We got to continue to drive our cost down. But with these innovations, for instance, the statistics on flat screen TVs going through the Internet. Over half of them are being shipped. The number one problem this major e-commerce customers are having is damage. How can we fix that? We're at the table to do that. The second problem is making it easy and environmentally friendly for where it shows up. So we're on conversation, not what is the price of your product, can you help us solve this problem, bring that solution across. And we have some really cool innovative technology that we're talking about the solution and there's no conversation what was widget A versus widget B last year. So that ties innovation into the pricing and the margin that you want to see. The third piece is the operational excellence, I think we have an opportunity to really drive the business to world-class level in operational excellence. We've had a huge disruption in the business with the sale of Diversey, really bringing the team together, looking at our facilities around the world. What can we do to bring some operational excellence to the bottom line in 2018. I think we have some opportunities there and it gives you bridgeable items. We're not giving any guidance on 2018, but just give you some thoughts on what we're looking at."

And the reason why we are -- and it is as successful and you'll hear about the beef cattle cycle at 5% slaughter rate increase. But you see our total business being very solid, and you know that our rates, our meats, our cattle, beef prices or beef products are only a part of the whole thing and we are having success with our case-ready solutions all over. And there is a change in the marketplaces, including in North America, with our case-ready solutions because the market is changing because of the need for sustainability because, for example, California having banned foam trays and those kind of things. And therefore, you have MAP, modifiable atmosphere packaging, and you have our Darfresh, which is kicking in very nicely. So we're confident. 2018, you're going to see that there is -- that the comparable there will be easier. But when Ted is going to give you guidance for the company and by businesses in February, this momentum is there. And this is not the commodity business. The momentum is there."

I can't say day after day, but month after month as we are introducing our automation solutions and innovation, which are not only automation solutions. There are some very big foreign companies who launch new products, and they have our solution as the product that in which their phones are packed to the Internet. And this is big business and it is this innovation, and it is this need for not only addressing dimensional weight, which is the #1 cash cost operation in the cost to serve of e-commerce, number one, is dimensional weight, which means freight cost; the number two is labor productivity, it's labor; number three damage when the items are fragile. Number one it is the cost of packaging. What we do is reducing freight costs, is improving labor productivity, eliminating damage and we do that with the little slowest, smallest cost component, which is our packaging costs and the solution, which adds total value to our customers. So yes, this e-commerce and 3PL business is growing much faster, and the margins are improving quarter after quarter as we address our -- as we introduce our innovation and our solution.

That means that we're going to be shipping most of this stuff and extending the shelf life that has made Food Care the dominant player in the industry. Now the shelf life has to go to the truck life, to the plane life, and so they're having to solve these problems with us. So the problems that we're bringing in are actually in the solutions. In the Product Care, to the point of where we get e-commerce quickly because that's moving -- everybody sees these products showing up at their homes. You don't want to see the polystyrene or -- I'm being trained by Jerome, or the Styrofoam all over your house. It's a problem. You don't want to see these packages that you're unpacking. You can even hurt yourself. So we're working on some innovative designs and I mentioned the flat screen TV, over half are now being purchased on the Internet. So our solutions that we're working on when you pull it out-of-the-box, make it nice and pretty. Maybe do you really need the box? Do you need that Styrofoam that you're throwing away? So the margins, to answer your questions, have to be in line with our portfolio, higher than our portfolio as we bring these new innovations. How we're doing it? We're saving our customers a tremendous amount of money that's pulling the solution. So short answer, the new innovations for Product Care have to be at higher margins than the existing portfolio."

That is really very important. And on top of that, we bought an extraordinary efficient fabricator. And Ted has traveled with Ken to see their operations and will make comments and he -- this was a story that he was very impressed with what we intended to do.

Instead of us selling the polyethylene to an integrator and letting them do that value add, this is what they do and they do really, really well. And as Jerome said, they win in China, and I got to witness this. I got to meet with their 3 largest customers who happen to be the 3 largest PC manufacturers in the world in China. So they're at the table. They're talking what they can do to be their committed supplier in these areas. And also, those suppliers are asking them, can we move that now to the other facilities around the world? So not only does it have geographic growth potential for integrated packaging, it also has the potential to go outside. The second piece on there is the China piece that being in China, I wish I didn't have so much experience on China, that you have to be in China, you have to be Chinese to win in China. And I was extremely impressed with their management team. Three full days from the top watching the people on the shop floor, seeing their facilities where they do things very, very different than we do. I think the complement there is going to be exciting for us, but they win in China. And the customers, these major PC manufacturers, they're asking, ""Can we bring that solution outside of China as we grow this business?"" So pretty exciting opportunity for us."

Ted and I have actually been meeting quite a bit, working together on our specific plans to address these stranded costs as well as unallocated cost going forward, and we'll continue to support the growth initiatives while at the same time addressing stranded costs. Relative to the types of costs, we've said that we have $20 million of unallocated cost and they're actually going to be offset by transition services agreement revenue. That TSA revenue actually began September 6 when we closed the Diversey transaction, and they will go forward on a 12- to an 18-month period beginning in September of '17 and will also then give us time to specifically reduce those unallocated costs.

On our call today, we will cover our third quarter results, outlook for the year-end and provide an update on our capital allocation strategy post the close of the Diversey sale. You will have also the opportunity to hear from Ted Doheny, who will be taking over as CEO from me on January 1; and Bill Stiehl, our Acting Chief Financial Officer. But before all and relevant to my retirement, I take this opportunity to let you know that I ran my first New York -- my first marathon in New York last Sunday, thanks to my son, Alexi, and my friend, Allen. For those of you who are up to the challenge, you will be rewarded for life. But don't worry, I will not turn into Forrest Gump in my retirement.
Back to business. You can see that in the third quarter, net sales growth accelerated to 6% on an as-reported basis and 5% in constant dollars. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 19%. Our performance in the third quarter continued to improve compared to the first half of the year when we delivered 3% constant dollar top line growth and 18% margin. And this momentum is continuing into the fourth quarter, and we have been -- and we are delivering on our 2017 outlook as a result of our higher sales and our pricing and cost discipline. In fact, we are executing on our long-term profitable growth strategy that we outlined at the Analyst Day in June 2015. Remember, at that time, we set a 3-year sales growth target of 4% to 5% for each of those 2 divisions. We said that we expect sales growth to accelerate throughout the period of 2016 to 2018 and that this growth would be led by volume, thanks to our market maker innovative strategy.
In 2016, we didn't see much movement on the top line and exited the year with an increase of just 1% constant dollar sales growth. However, our growth have been improving each quarter since the fourth quarter of 2016. In the fourth quarter of last year, we started delivering one -- in constant currency 1% sales growth. In the first quarter of this year in constant dollars, we delivered 3% growth. In the second quarter, we delivered 4% growth, and now in the third quarter, we are reporting 5% constant currency sales growth. And should the temporary and incredibly steep PE resin cost increases of 13% or $0.10 per pound since August and $0.15 year-to-date not have surprised all our industry, those sales gains would've translated into the bottom line already. The good news is that I said temporary cost increases and also, that we have fully implemented our announced Product Care and Food Care price increases on September 1 and October 1, respectively. This is where our confidence comes in as we head into year-end. We are seeing rapid adoption of our game-changing solutions. We're seeing healthy end-market demand, particularly in North America and Asia, and our now famous operational disciplines are taking hold.
On September 6, we closed the Diversey sale. When we announced the transaction in March 2017, we increased our share repurchase program, and we said that we would pay down debt, address stranded costs and target selective M&A that was aligned with our strategic direction. Through September 30, we repurchased approximately 15.5 million shares valued at $677 million through a combination of open-market and accelerated share repurchase programs, including an ASR that is currently ongoing. We paid down $1.1 billion in debt, bringing our total debt balance down to $3.3 billion. We have already made progress on our cost structure and we'll continue to do so heading into next year.
We also closed 2 acquisitions, a small strategic food packaging company in Brazil, Deltaplam, which closed in August. And then in October, we closed the Fagerdala acquisition, a Protective Packaging company based in Singapore that significantly expands our presence in Asia.
As all of you know, on September 9, I announced my retirement effective December 31, 2017. I have really enjoyed my time at Sealed Air, and I'm extremely proud of what we have become, thanks to the vision and determination of our management team and our 14,000 global employees, who I want to recognize here. We have built a winning culture, a culture that is obsessed with creating new value for our customers. We take the responsibility of being the industry leader and the market maker by creating new markets with disruptive innovations and instilling discipline throughout the industries we serve. Our long-term profitable growth strategy is well under way, and we continue to gain traction globally as you could see from our sales growth, focusing all of our efforts on some very key mega trends. Our journey as a knowledge-based company continues with many exciting opportunities ahead. And I am very confident that under Ted, Bill and the entire leadership team, the organization will continue to thrive and generate significant value for our customers, shareholders and employees.
Bill join Sealed Air in 2013 and has been on this journey alongside our senior leadership team. Ted and I continue to work closely together to ensure a seamless and successful transition. We have been spending time in Charlotte, North Carolina and have also -- and are also traveling around the world with our senior team to meet with customers and employees.
Let me now move back to our third quarter results in more detail and turning to Slide 6, where we highlight our results by region. We experienced constant dollar year-over-year growth across all regions. North America once again was our fastest-growing region at 7%, with sales up 9% in Food Care and up 4% in Product Care. Sales in EMEA, Asia-Pacific and Latin America increased in the range of 2% to 3%. I want to highlight that Product Care sales in Asia-Pacific were up 15% in the third quarter led by volume growth.
On Slide 7, you can see our volume and price mix trends by division and by region. As we anticipated, top line performance was primarily driven by 5% volume growth with positive trends across all regions. Food Care volumes were up 5% with 9% growth in North America and positive trends in both Latin America and EMEA. Product Care volumes were up 6% driven by our largest regions: North America and EMEA increasing 4% and 7%, respectively. Overall price mix was relatively neutral to our top line results. Keep in mind that our pricing actions in Product Care went into effect as of September 1, and in Food Care for our non-formula customers effective October 1.
And now let's turn to Slide 8 and review Food Care results in more detail. Food Care sales were $716 million, and adjusted EBITDA was $158 million or 22% of sales. Sales were up 4% in constant dollars compared to last year due to higher volumes. Our margin compressed year-over-year primarily due to timing of raw material cost pass-throughs and higher input cost. It is important to note, however, that sequentially, EBITDA margin improved 60 basis points, as formula started to align better with higher input costs and we continued to focus our focus on expense management.
Our performance in North America, which accounted for 51% of Food Care sales, was driven by the ongoing adoption of our case-ready platform across all proteins, including seafood and higher equipment sales. We capitalize on end market demand in all protein segments led by an increase in slaughter rates of more than 5% in the beef sector. We expect our business in North America to continue outpacing the market in Q4, although keep in mind, we have tougher year-over-year comparables on volumes to come.
EMEA, which accounted for 22% of Food Care sales, was essentially flat compared with last year. We are continuing to see adoption of our new products in an environment where the protein market is growing modestly, but this was offset by timing of equipment sales. Heading into year-end, we anticipate improving top line trends with growing coming -- with growth coming from both equipment and new product sales.
APAC accounted for 15% of Food Care with Australia and New Zealand accounting for close to 70% of our sales in this region. Australia and New Zealand declined in the quarter as a result of further deterioration in the dairy market. But an encouraging data point to share is that for the first time in over a year, slaughter rates in Australia were relatively flat with prior year. The beef cycle is now near bottom, and we expect growth to return late 2018.
Latin America represented the remaining 12% of sales with Mexico, Brazil and Argentina accounting for approximately 80% of Food Care sales. Constant dollar sales were up 3% led by growth in Argentina and stabilizing trends in Brazil. This was offset by a temporary decline in Mexico, where our business was impacted by the earthquake late in the quarter. But heading into year-end, we anticipate improving trends in both Brazil and Mexico, albeit slow, with continued growth in Central America.
For the full year 2017, we expect Food Care to increase sales approximately 3.5% in constant dollars. Adjusted EBITDA margin are expected to be approximately 22%.
Slide 9 highlights results from our Product Care division. Product Care net sales were $415 million, and adjusted EBITDA was $87 million or 21% of net sales. You can see in the EBITDA bridge that compared to last year, higher volumes were offset by a negative mix and price/cost spread. Product Care margins improved sequentially by 100 basis points. This improvement was primarily related to higher volume, yield on our pricing actions and cost management.
North America and EMEA accounted for approximately 85% of Product Care sales and were up 4% and 7%, respectively. APAC had another strong quarter with 15% growth led by China and Japan. Our advanced product portfolio, including inflatable, I-Pack, sales wrap and FloWrap, continue to gain significant traction as our e-commerce and fulfillment customers optimize and automate their distribution channels. In Western Europe, I want to highlight that in the third quarter, we benefited from accelerated execution of automated solutions, volume growth of our consumables after record level of equipment installed over the last 12 months and pockets of strength across some of the industrial segments. With the acquisition of Fagerdala, we triple our manufacturing footprint in China and as you would expect, there are synergies to leverage and meaningful cross-selling opportunities.
For the full year of 2017, we expect Product Care to increase sales approximately 6% on a constant dollar basis, which would include $20 million in sales from Fagerdala.
Adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to be approximately 20%, and this implies a Q4 constant dollar year-over-year growth of approximately 10% and adjusted EBITDA margin of 21%.
Let me now turn the call over to Bill to review our overall sales and EBITDA bridges and outlook heading into year-end. Bill?"

Slides 11 and 12 provide the net sales and EBITDA bridges for Q3 and 9 months ending September 30. My comments will focus on Slide 11, which highlights our third quarter results from continuing operations on a year-over-year basis. You can see that our top line performance was primarily led by higher volumes of $55 million and favorable currency of $13 million. Adjusted EBITDA was $217 million or 19% of sales. Volume contributed $23 million in Q3, which was partially offset by unfavorable mix and price/cost spread of $16 million. Operating expenses decreased $10 million, and restructuring savings were $4 million. Currency had a favorable impact on adjusted EBITDA of $3 million.
Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.46 in the third quarter compared to $0.41 in Q3 of 2016. Our adjusted tax rate for continuing operations was 31%.
On Slide 12, we present our sales and EBITDA bridges for the 9 months ending September 30. In the EBITDA bridge, we see that higher volumes were essentially offset by unfavorable mix and price/cost spread.
Turning to Slide 13. Free cash flow is presented on a consolidated basis, which includes the results from continuing and discontinued operations. For the 9 months ended September 30, consolidated free cash flow excluding payments related to the sale of Diversey was a source of cash of $267 million. CapEx was $127 million. Cash interest payments were $153 million, and restructuring costs were $49 million. Aligned with our typical free cash flow seasonality, working capital and other assets and liabilities were a use of cash of $70 million.
Turning to our outlook on Slide 14. For top line, we now expect sales to be approximately $4.4 billion, an increase of 6% on an as-reported basis. Favorable FX is expected to have an impact of approximately $40 million. Constant dollar growth is expected to be approximately 4.5%, including sales from Fagerdala of $20 million. Our major currency exposures include the euro, which was approximately 13% of net sales in Q3; the Australian dollar, 5%; and the Mexican peso, British pound, Canadian dollar and Brazilian real were each approximately 3% of net sales. 2017 adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations is expected to be approximately $830 million, which includes $7 million from favorable FX. Corporate expenses are now estimated to be $115 million. Our net interest expense for 2017 is estimated at $185 million. Depreciation and amortization is forecasted to be $160 million. We now expect our adjusted tax rate to be 30% for the full year 2017.
Our outlook for adjusted earnings per share is unchanged at $1.75 to $1.80. Our adjusted EPS outlook is based on 190 million shares, which reflects the weighted average full year effect of share repurchases through September 30.
Let's now turn to Slide 15 and review our free cash flow outlook. As a reminder, we present free cash flow on a consolidated basis, which includes our outlook for continuing operations and results from discontinued operations. We continue to expect free cash flow to be approximately $400 million. This forecast excludes cash payments related to the sale of Diversey. To calculate our free cash flow outlook, we start with an estimated consolidated adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1 billion, which includes our full year 2017 outlook from continuing operations of $830 million. We anticipate cash interest payments to be $200 million and cash tax payments to be $160 million. Restructuring cash costs, excluding efforts dedicated to reducing separation-related costs, are estimated to be $55 million. Capital expenditures are forecasted to be $175 million, of which $165 million represents Sealed Air continuing operations. Restructuring-related CapEx is expected to be $20 million in 2017 and is included in the $175 million CapEx estimate. Working capital and other assets and liabilities is now expected to be a use of cash of approximately $40 million as compared to our previous guidance of a use of cash of $65 million. As you know, a large portion of our free cash flow is typically generated in the second half of the year with the fourth quarter being our strongest quarter for cash generation.
I would like to now pass the call over to Ted, who will provide us with early insights and thoughts on our future opportunities and strategic direction. On behalf of the senior leadership team and our employees, we would like to welcome you to Sealed Air and congratulate you on your new role."

As Jerome indicated, I started at Sealed Air mid-September, and my short story is that I like the company even more looking inside than I did analyzing it from the outside. I've been traveling the world to meet with employees and customers and have also had the opportunity to visit some of our facilities, including spending time with the talented team from Fagerdala in China.
My previous experience has been with 2 iconic and market-leading companies in the equipment, service and solution space. When I was approached about the opportunity with Sealed Air, I saw another iconic company that has successfully transformed over these past 5 years from a product-driven to a market-driven company.
As I learn more about Sealed Air, I see that we have an exciting opportunity to now move from being a leading company in the packaging industry to being a world-class company solving the most complex challenges in packaging with automated solutions. Sealed Air's reputation of being a true innovative leader within the global packaging segment is impressive, and our pipeline of automation in both Product Care and Food Care is creating even more opportunity to further reimagine the business and think outside the box and maybe even outside the package. In 2018, we'll build off our sales growth in 2017 and gain share in the markets we serve. We will execute our strategy with both sales and profit growth as well as operational excellence that will demonstrate incremental margin improvement over 2017.
We'll continue to allocate capital as we outlined with share buybacks and strategic M&A. With $1.4 billion remaining under the authorized share buyback program, we'll continue to be active in the market with open market and accelerated share repurchases. On M&A, we'll focus on companies that expand our market presence geographically and take our innovations to adjacent markets. We'll look for technology and automation companies that further enhance our Food Care and Product Care businesses that solve our customers' toughest packaging challenges. Our organic growth, M&A strategy and focus on operational excellence will take our business to the next level of performance.
We plan on sharing our 2018 and long-term profitable growth plans with you in the coming months, including an Investor Day later next year.
Before we open up the call for questions, I'd like to remind you our first fourth quarter earnings call is tentatively scheduled for Thursday, February 8.

I'm not talking about nylon, I'm not talking about other raw materials, which went up in a very steep way. So this is in light of us having in Food Care a sizable part of our business which is formula driven. And remember also that in the month of July and before, we were thinking -- and not only us, everybody was thinking that because of the capacity additions coming on stream, prices were not going to go up. They were going to come down. So yes, we did have margin squeezed. I would call it margin compression. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we are seeing that this is temporary and that as a result of that, we are going to do what we have done in the last round when resin prices went down, we are going to recoup our -- the quality of our business. So I'm really not worried. And we are going to start seeing this in my mind, definitely in 2018, depending on the pace again at which resins are going to be coming down."

I'm just wondering if there's some offsetting factors on there on the mix side of things. And maybe you could just comment on the overall pricing environment outside of the moves in resin. We've heard from a couple of other guys in the industry about some pricing pressure just in response to weak end demand in some other food-related products, weak customer margins.

Our October non-formula pricing, Food Care price increase went in fully. Why? Because we had PE margins and nylon and so on, margin compression and we also had other type of inflation, including freight. And for those of you who don't know that post Harvey had consequences on freight cost, availability of trucks needed to -- needing to buy resins on the spot market and all of those kind of things because our priority #1 was to delight our customers who were in difficult times for supplies and sellers, et cetera. And we did not spare any efforts nor any money in making sure that we would have absolutely no disruption. Did that cost money? Absolutely. But what is absolutely important to understand is what I said exactly 5 years ago or in January in 2012 when I said we are the market leader. The market leader has a responsibility, and the responsibility for the market leader is to be disciplined and to lead on price. Yes, we do need to be leading on price. We have led on price, which is why we stood extraordinarily firm. Yes, we did hear that some competitors were not as disciplined. That's their problem. We -- in order to keep investing, the amount of money we're investing in innovation in order to bring them, our customers, the revolutionary solutions that we're bringing them and surprise them by adding value, tremendous new value to them, we need to be able to have the funds and the resources and, therefore, keep investing at the pace we're investing and, by the way, accelerating to bring those solutions in automation, in new product, et cetera, et cetera. So that is the context. Next to that, you do have -- and this is why we are already slightly improving on our margins compared to the first half of the year as a result of having the September 1 price increase in Product Care [indiscernible]. So do we have competition? Yes, we do have competition. But you have customers who are price-driven customers, which are not the ones we want. And you have customers who are value customers, which is those we want. And we are absolutely committed to continue, thanks to our solutions, to add new additional and much higher value than they could get from a slight price concession. Do we have market skirmishes here and there?

I wanted to come back to the margin question a little bit differently. Can you tell us maybe in rank order priority what gives you confidence that in 2018, that you'll be able to leverage the very, very good volume growth to date and presumably positive volume growth into 2018 into stronger EBITDA? Will it be more from the pricing? Will it be more from the formula lags turning more favorably? And what, Ted, do you think at this juncture can operational excellence add to the margin picture for 2018?"

Thanks, George. I'll start and Ted will continue. George, all of the above ends our innovation, which means that you saw that we have renewed with constant currency growth in the fourth quarter of 2016 and since then, it's been on and on and accelerating. The comparables are going to get a little bit tougher, but it is our innovation, which is fueling all of this. The success of the strategy that we have embarked into in Product Care moving to automation, the very successful B+ acquisition of August of 2015 continues at a fast pace. The deployment of those automation technologies in Japan, in China, in Europe and in North America adds a tremendous success. And also, our automation in Food Care with Cogni Link (sic) [ CogniPRO Link ] and Cogni Link PRO; and on the other end, our case-ready, which is really starting to take hold. So we're very confident that we are exactly on the pace to do and execute on what we said back in June of 2015 when we gave the '16 to 2018 look during our Analyst Day. It is actually amazing to see how what we said at that time is happening. Going back to your question on margin, we have formulas in Food Care, and they've been a little bit slower to kick in because they would have kicked in -- they were supposed to kick in from the third quarter as resins were coming down and as formulas was coming up, leading to margin expansion. And as resins came up, you see that this phenomenon is slightly delayed. And we have proven to you in the past that in an environment like the one we're going to live through, probably through the end of this year and into early next year, we are going to restore our margins. You had a quick follow-up, but Ted, on the operational excellence, maybe?"

Well, let me segue those 2 going into 3 because you're talking about '18. And internally, that's the one that I'm possessive about. On the pricing, just to make a comment, Jerome has just done a tremendous job. And one thing I just want to let you, George, and everybody know that I'll be taking over as the Chief Pricing Officer from Jerome. So -- and feel comfortable with that, some of the pricing opportunities we have I think are in the business that we need to look at and push pricing for certain options, other things that are there. So we have some pricing opportunity going forward. On the innovations side, as Jerome highlighted, that's been really exciting for me in just my first 6 weeks to see how we're at the table, not with itty-bitty but with the big players. Jerome's introduced me. I got to meet some of the major players, and we're there talking about their biggest problems. If we stay in that commodity base where some of our competitors are, then we have to live with the pricing, and that will bring up operational excellence. We got to continue to drive our cost down. But with these innovations, for instance, the statistics on flat-screen TVs going through the Internet. Over half of them are being shipped. The number one problem this major e-commerce customers are having is damage. How can we fix that? We're at the table to do that. The second problem is making it easy and environmentally friendly for where it shows up. So we're on conversation, not what is the price of your product, can you help us solve this problem, bring that solution across. And we have some really cool innovative technology that we're talking about the solution and there's no conversation what was widget A versus widget B last year. So that ties innovation into the pricing and the margin that you want to see. The third piece is the operational excellence, I think we have an opportunity to really drive the business to world-class level in operational excellence. We've had a huge disruption in the business with the sale of Diversey, really bringing the team together, looking at our facilities around the world. What can we do to bring some operational excellence to the bottom line in 2018. I think we have some opportunities there and it gives you bridgeable items. We're not giving any guidance on 2018, but just give you some thoughts on what we're looking at."

And the reason why we are -- and it is as successful and you'll hear about the beef cattle cycle at 5% slaughter rate increase. But you see our total business being very solid, and you know that our rates, our meats, our cattle, beef prices or beef products are only a part of the whole thing and we are having success with our case-ready solutions all over. And there is a change in the marketplaces, including in North America, with our case-ready solutions because the market is changing because of the need for sustainability because, for example, California having banned foam trays and those kind of things. And therefore, you have MAP, modifiable atmosphere packaging, and you have our Darfresh, which is kicking in very nicely. So we're confident. 2018, you're going to see that there is -- that the comparable there will be easier. But when Ted is going to give you guidance for the company and by businesses in February, this momentum is there. And this is not the commodity business. The momentum is there."

I can't say day after day, but month after month as we are introducing our automation solutions and innovation, which are not only automation solutions. There are some very big foreign companies who launch new products, and they have our solution as the product that in which their phones are packed to the Internet. And this is big business and it is this innovation, and it is this need for not only addressing dimensional weight, which is the #1 cash cost operation in the cost to serve of e-commerce, number one, is dimensional weight, which means freight cost; the number two is labor productivity, it's labor; number three damage when the items are fragile. Number one it is the cost of packaging. What we do is reducing freight costs, is improving labor productivity, eliminating damage and we do that with the little slowest, smallest cost component, which is our packaging costs and the solution, which adds total value to our customers. So yes, this e-commerce and 3PL business is growing much faster, and the margins are improving quarter after quarter as we address our -- as we introduce our innovation and our solution.

That means that we're going to be shipping most of this stuff and extending the shelf life that has made Food Care the dominant player in the industry. Now the shelf life has to go to the truck life, to the plane life, and so they're having to solve these problems with us. So the problems that we're bringing in are actually in the solutions. In the Product Care, to the point of where we get e-commerce quickly because that's moving -- everybody sees these products showing up at their homes. You don't want to see the polystyrene or -- I'm being trained by Jerome, or the Styrofoam all over your house. It's a problem. You don't want to see these packages that you're unpacking. You can even hurt yourself. So we're working on some innovative designs and I mentioned the flat screen TV, over half are now being purchased on the Internet. So our solutions that we're working on when you pull it out-of-the-box, make it nice and pretty. Maybe do you really need the box? Do you need that Styrofoam that you're throwing away? So the margins, to answer your questions, have to be in line with our portfolio, higher than our portfolio as we bring these new innovations. How we're doing it? We're saving our customers a tremendous amount of money that's pulling the solution. So short answer, the new innovations for Product Care have to be at higher margins than the existing portfolio."

That is really very important. And on top of that, we bought an extraordinary efficient fabricator. And Ted has traveled with Ken to see their operations and will make comments and he -- this was a story that he was very impressed with what we intended to do.

Instead of us selling the polyethylene to an integrator and letting them do that value add, this is what they do and they do really, really well. And as Jerome said, they win in China, and I got to witness this. I got to meet with their 3 largest customers who happen to be the 3 largest PC manufacturers in the world in China. So they're at the table. They're talking what they can do to be their committed supplier in these areas. And also, those suppliers are asking them, can we move that now to the other facilities around the world? So not only does it have geographic growth potential for integrated packaging, it also has the potential to go outside. The second piece on there is the China piece that being in China, I wish I didn't have so much experience on China, that you have to be in China, you have to be Chinese to win in China. And I was extremely impressed with their management team. Three full days from the top watching the people on the shop floor, seeing their facilities where they do things very, very different than we do. I think the complement there is going to be exciting for us, but they win in China. And the customers, these major PC manufacturers, they're asking, ""Can we bring that solution outside of China as we grow this business?"" So pretty exciting opportunity for us."

Ted and I have actually been meeting quite a bit, working together on our specific plans to address these stranded costs as well as unallocated cost going forward, and we'll continue to support the growth initiatives while at the same time addressing stranded costs. Relative to the types of costs, we've said that we have $20 million of unallocated cost and they're actually going to be offset by transition services agreement revenue. That TSA revenue actually began September 6 when we closed the Diversey transaction, and they will go forward on a 12- to an 18-month period beginning in September of '17 and will also then give us time to specifically reduce those unallocated costs. Meanwhile, for the $20 million of stranded costs, we are absolutely on track and we're very confident that our 24-month target, which is 24 months since the separation, is achievable, and we will work towards that goal."
