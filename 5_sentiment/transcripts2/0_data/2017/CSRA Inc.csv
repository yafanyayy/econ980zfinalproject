The clear highlights for the third quarter were superb cash flow and another set of large, strategic new business wins. In addition, revenue was in line with consensus, and EBITDA and EPS were both a little bit ahead of consensus. Our EBITDA margin of 17.3% still leads the industry and is above our long-term target. I'll leave the financial results for Dave to do in detail so I can focus on 4 key points. Point number one, to prepare for our fiscal year 2018, we crafted a clear and differentiated strategy to drive growth in our public sector markets supported by a new brand and tagline, Think Next. Now. And the 3 remaining points are that the key enablers of this strategy are all in place and all working today. So point number two, our growth engine continues to lead the industry. Point number three, our technology leadership is creating key differentiators in the market; and point number four, our talent management approach is building a motivated workforce to execute our strategy. 
Let me go a little bit deeper. Point number one on strategy. For a year, we've just been heads down and focused on the tasks in front of us, executing on programs, delivering on the synergy case, integrating 2 companies and 2 cultures, writing proposals and yes, each and every day, collecting cash. I am product of the team's hard work and tremendous accomplishments on all of these fronts. We are stronger today than we were a year ago as a result of the determination, the energy and the creativity of all 18,000 employees who show up to work every day with a passion for our customers' missions. In particular, we now have a much better balance sheet and a backlog of new programs that provides us strategic flexibility and growth momentum. Over the last few months, we've taken the time to look beyond the horizon and chart our direction for the next 3 years. It's been a very collaborative effort across both line organizations and leverage teams, with a board both fully engaged and rolling up their sleeves to help. We now have a holistic view of strategy and vision, and our cultures and values are aligned, and we're gaining buy-in throughout the company. Strategy is all about where you compete, how you compete and how you measure success. Our strategy is to drive sustainable industry-leading organic growth across our federal and state local markets through customer intimacy, rapid innovation and an outcome-based experience. Let me unpack the statement a bit. Our primary focus is profitably growing the company. We are the most efficient company in our space, and we will remain so, but this is a dramatic shift. We have moved from the legacy mindset of only improving the bottom line by cutting costs to one centered around and devoted to a growth culture. We will measure our success, first and foremost, through revenue growth, which provides better opportunities for our employees, more solutions that we can provide to our customers and greater returns to our shareholders. Next, we will remain focused on our current markets where we have about a 3% market share. The federal government and related state and local and international markets provide plenty of opportunities for us, and the market dynamics are improving after years of government budget cuts. We will support the United States and the vital interest of our allies across the globe. We are well positioned with many of the new administration's priorities, including defense, border security and the critical care for our veterans. We will compete through 3 primary differentiators: first, customer intimacy; second, innovation; and third, outcome-based delivery. Our customer intimacy derives from talented teams who deliver flawlessly, who build trust-based relationships with our customers and provide mission and technology thought leadership. We deliver rapid innovation through partnerships, shared delivery models and cross-agency capabilities. Our customers are looking to move towards paying for outcomes instead of inputs, and we are the industry leader in delivering outcome-based experiences through developing, bidding and executing the shared delivery methodologies. Our mission, vision, strategy and importantly, our culture and values are then encapsulated by our brand of Think Next. Now. This message is one the entire company created and can rally behind, enabling us to approach the market with a unified purpose and direction. It imagines a better future and delivers it today for our customers, our partners and ultimately, all the people our mission has touched. 
Point number two, our business development engine continues to rev at high RPMs. We posted our eighth straight quarter with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.0 or greater. In what is typically the slowest quarter for awards, we achieved $1.9 billion in bookings for a book-to-bill ratio of 1.5. Our trailing 12-month book-to-bill ratio was still tracking at 1.3. Our backlog of signed business orders at the end of the quarter was $15.8 billion, which increased 3% year-over-year. I firmly believe that if we continue to post industry-leading book-to-bill rates, we will lead our industry in organic growth, which is our goal. The $1.9 billion in awards were rich with new business. 73% of bookings in the quarter were for new business, and our win rate on new business was 46%. Again, well above our target rate of 25%. So far this year, we've won $3.1 billion in new business, ahead of our target run rate of $4 billion each year even though we are just now seeing the full effect of our accelerated bids submissions. Our bid pipeline remains robust. At the end of the quarter, we have $12 billion in submits outstanding. Looking only at new business, we had about $5.7 billion awaiting decision, including 15 opportunities that are each greater than $100 million in total value. This quarter's awards showcase how we are combining deep domain knowledge of the customers' mission, expertise in our IT enterprise and next-generation capabilities and partners to deliver compelling solutions for our customers. 
Let me highlight just a few of the major wins in the quarter to give you a sense of what I mean. Our largest win was the $744 million award that was in protest at the time of our last call. With that protest resolved in December, we are now supporting the Army's communication electronics command, providing a wide range of mission essential logistics, maintenance and sustainment work for current and future C4ISR systems around the world in support of this administration's priorities. Building on the delivery excellence of our program manager, Larry Crop, our General Manager for this business, Alan Smith, was instrumental in crafting the strategy for this consolidated procurement. We expect our work growing from current revenue levels of $30 million a year to well over $100 million each year as we ramp over the next few quarters. 
In another consolidating contract, led a team that engineered a wonderful technical solution on a $323 million program called HIGLAS to host, operate and maintain the general ledger system for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Our world-class database team has been working on the application side for 5 years, but taking over the infrastructure work was a tall task, one that was perfect for Rebecca Miller, our civil group BD lead overseeing the capture. We were able the team well with Oracle to engineer a compelling solution using the Oracle exit data that is low-risk, innovative and cost-efficient and improved performance by a factor of 10. On this program, we'll introduce and implement dev op methodologies and potentially migrate the application to a cloud environment. 
Final example, we received a new single award blank purchase agreement -- blanket purchase agreement with $150 million ceiling to help the Department of Commerce reduce costs, enhance customer service quality and prepare for the 2020 census. Under the leadership of Chris SRA will develop and implement cloud-based services in the areas of acquisition, financial management, human resources and information technology. This is a shared service deal with a foundation and a solution that leverages both service now and our own Integrated Technology Center in Bossier City, Louisiana. 
These wins are largely driven by next-generation thinking enabled by strong technology partnerships, which takes me to my third key point: CSRA works really hard to obtain technology leadership. The breadth and adept of our partnerships with key technology innovators is unmatched because we offer unmatched access to the federal government IT enterprise, and we bring a focus and a passion for technology insertion that will help missions be successful. With a full involvement of our line organizations, we develop and invest in our partner relationships, especially our 7 strategic alliance partners: Amazon Web Services, Cisco, Microsoft, Oracle, Salesforce, SAP and Service Now. For example, our recent Greenway submission under Leigh Palmer's leadership with the intelligence group leveraged 6 of these strategic partners in the bid and clearly differentiates our technical offering. We are already a premier consulting partner in the AWS partner network. And this quarter, we successfully completed the independent third-party audit to join their elite managed services program. That enables us to deliver added value to cloud solutions by offering proactive monitoring, automation and management of our customers' environments. We also recently added Amazon's commercial and Amazon's cloud services to the GSA IT schedule 70, which is the largest most widely used acquisition vehicle across the federal government. These added qualifications and channels will even further our leadership in cloud migration, especially within health and civil group whose customers are often the most forward leaning in adopting next-generation technologies. 
Now our other strategic partner in the cloud, Microsoft, we just signed with them a 3-year enterprise agreement to use their products for the Azure cloud platform. We are proud to be a gold partner in the Microsoft partner network, and we're now the first government systems integrator to migrate its own workload to the Azure government cloud platform. By investing in ourselves, we minimize risk and then accelerate solutions for our customers as we act this customer's We believe that the market for Microsoft's cloud services will expand rapidly, especially within the Department of Defense. The DoD just granted level 5 accreditation for Azure and Office 365, making them the only commercial cloud provider at that level of security and trust. Ken Deutsch and his defense group team are working hand-in-hand with Microsoft on many large and strategic bids that could be major drivers for both of us in this critical market. Microsoft was also the major sponsor along with Splunk of a hackathon that we hosted in December. Led by Sally Sullivan's Homeland Security Group, this hands-on competition style training event brought together technologists from across the company to engage in collaborative computing, challenge conventional thinking and solve real-world problems in the cloud and really leverage data analytics, which brings me to my fourth key point: our talent. This is the driver behind really improving customer intimacy, earning trust-based relationships and delivering flawless execution. We continue to up our game in hiring, retaining and developing our workforce. In the third quarter, we had more job applicants than we've ever had, and 42% of our new hires are millennials. Our voluntary attrition rate in the quarter was the lowest we've had since going public. Employees are seeing enhanced opportunities through growth, and the culture is evolving in all sorts of positive ways. Our employees like the opportunity for continued technical education, and more than 400 of these employees added new technical and professional certifications in the quarter. 
Before I turn it over to Dave, let me briefly address how we're thinking about the market under President Trump's administration. For context, let's keep in mind that we're less than 3 weeks into the new administration so we're in the very early stages. For example, just 7 members of President Trump's team have been confirmed by the Senate, which means we've only got 1,235 to go. Transitions after 2-term presidents are generally a little chaotic, and they all take time, so I expect industry book to bills for the March quarter to be a bit dampened, but all of us remain convinced this is a growth opportunity for the marketplace. We've seen a steady flow of forceful executive orders, tweets and interviews. Nothing has changed our fundamental view that the market for our services and solutions will grow in the coming years. The administration has signaled a willingness to engage in deficit spending to fund a strong commitment to the military and the border security. And with the freeze in hiring for nonmilitary government personnel, service contractors stand ready to enable mission success. Given our efficient onshore staffing model, CSRA can be an engine for American job growth, clearly a key priority for President Trump. We may face headwinds in some areas, such as our support for the EPA but on balance, we believe we are well positioned for future growth with this administration. Perhaps most importantly, CSRA should benefit from a more businesslike approach to contracts with more fixed-price contracts and a greater focus on cost efficiency, both major advantages for us. Ultimately, this environment will favor those who are ready to move quickly, who are agile and act like a business, and we're doing that on all cylinders. 
Now, Dave will provide more detail on the financial results and the forward outlook."

As Larry said, we had another strong quarter across the board but especially around cash flow, which is the life blood of the company. Turning to Slide 5. Revenue for the quarter was $1.22 billion, down 3% se",1472,"Thanks, Larry, and good afternoon, everyone. As Larry said, we had another strong quarter across the board but especially around cash flow, which is the life blood of the company. 
Turning to Slide 5. Revenue for the quarter was $1.22 billion, down 3% sequentially and down 4% from pro forma revenue in the third quarter of fiscal year 2015 [ph] . The sequential decline was consistent with normal seasonal leave-taking patterns and was in line with our expectations. Our contract mix continues to exhibit a high concentration of fixed-price work, which is a key driver of our profitability. As a percentage of total revenue, 46% was on fixed-price contracts, 21% on time and material contracts and 33% on cost-plus contracts. There were a few unique items impacting the expense and earnings lines but for the most part, they affected the GAAP treatment, not the adjusted numbers, and we were able to preview most of the larger items in our last call. I'll now walk through these major drivers as I progress through the income statement.
First, we extended a voluntary offer to former employees who participated in qualified pension plans to receive immediate lump sum payments. Based on participant elections, in the third quarter of fiscal year 2017, we made lump sum payments of $320 million and reduced pension obligations by $333 million, so a net improvement of $13 million in the pension funding status. This roughly 10% change in the overall size of the pension program necessitated a pension plan remeasurement as of December 1, 2016. We recorded a noncash mark-to-market benefit of $101 million in the quarter. We do not project making any meaningful contributions to the pension program in the foreseeable future, and we reduced the GAAP underfunding of the program by about $136 million. With the lower asset base and higher projected interest rate, the remeasurement costs recurring noncash pension income to fall from $24 million in the second quarter to $23 million in the third quarter and a $21 million quarterly run rate thereafter, although this could change again with our usual annual remeasurement in the fourth quarter. 
Second, GAAP stock compensation expense during the quarter was $18 million. $14 million of that was a noncash charge from performance-based awards for former CSRA shareholders. The performance targets for the awards were met when Providence equity partners, formerly CSRA's majority shareholder sold its CSRA Holdings after our second quarter earnings call. We were delighted that our existing and new shareholders purchased more than 15 million shares with no visible disruption to the market. Compared to the time of the spin, we believe our investor base is now much more focused on CSRA as a long-term holding.
Third, pretax merger and integration costs were $5 million, down $3 million from last quarter. Despite relatively modest EAC adjustments in the quarter, profitability continues to be strong with an EBITDA margin of 17.3%. This is down from last quarter's record margin and consistent with the view that we've laid out for some time that EBITDA margin as we've defined them would end up in the low to mid-17% range for FY '17 and over the longer term, land in the 16% to 17% range as we dragged top line growth. On a volume basis, adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $211 million. Below EBITDA, the quarterly variances were more muted. We completed the repricing of our term loans, consistent with the plans we laid out on our last call. In connection with the repricing, we incurred a noncash charge of $8 million for a write-off of deferred financing costs in the third quarter. Going forward, the repricing will reduce interest expense by approximately $5 million annually. Excluding the charge, interest expense was $28 million in the quarter, down about $1 million from last quarter. Depreciation and amortization, excluding the intangibles amortization expense associated with SRA's funded contract backlog, was $50 million or $3 million more than last quarter. The intangible amortization expense associated with SRA's funded contract backlog, which is included in GAAP earnings per share but not adjusted EPS, was $11 million or $5 million less than last quarter, and it will go to 0 in Q4. Our effective tax rate was 37%, which is close to our long-term target rate but up about 2 percentage points from last quarter. With that, adjusted diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.48, unchanged compared to the third quarter of fiscal year 2016.
Now turning to Slide 6. Cash flow performance was our best as a public company. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $227 million, and free cash flow was $191 million or more than 2.4x adjusted net income. 
My thanks go out to our entire team of invoicers and collectors for their hard work in generating this tremendous outcome for the company. In addition, we did not make a $30 million intellectual property maintenance payment to see CSC in the third quarter as anticipated under our original separation agreement. We currently are in discussions with CSC regarding a variety of matters related to our separation agreements. Note that during the question-and-answer period, we will now take questions regarding these discussions with CSC. 
Days sales outstanding were 57 days in Q3, which is unchanged from last quarter. We will look to shave a couple of days off DSOs over time through continued strong collections performance. We followed our balanced capital allocation program in Q3, deploying $50 million to pay down debt and $38 million to return to shareholders, $17 million in dividends and $21 million in share repurchases. As of December 30, 2016, we had $162 million in cash and cash equivalents and $2.6 billion in debt. 
Now on to the forward outlook. As we approach the end of our fiscal year, we have modified guidance as shown on Slide 7. Specifically, we now project fiscal year 2017 revenue between $4.96 billion and $5.01 billion. Including the lower noncash pension income, we project adjusted EBITDA between $857 million and $867 million and adjusted diluted earnings per share between $1.98 and $2.02. Our free cash flow guidance remains between $300 million and $350 million. For adjusted EPS, specifically, this guidance equates to fourth quarter performance of $0.44 to $0.48. Compared to our original guidance ranges, we expect to land near the low end for revenue and adjusted EBITDA and near the high end of our adjusted earnings per share range. The pension remeasurement has lowered our FY '17 adjusted EBITDA guidance by about $4 million and our adjusted EPS guidance by about $0.02. 
Our fourth quarter outlook reflects slow startups on some large programs, such as the OPM background investigation contract and a large Army C4ISR program as well as potential interruptions on current contracts at a few agencies and fewer Q4 awards as a result of the administration transition, but it does not change our fundamental view of an improving picture for CSRA. It takes some time for new wins to reach their ultimate revenue run rate, especially during an administration change. When they do, our growth will surely follow. 
We continue to see an opportunity for FY '18 to produce organic growth in line with our long-term model of 2% to 3% and EBITDA margin slightly below current levels but on the high side of our long-term model of 16% to 17%, including pension income, which brings me to my closing point. As we introduce guidance for fiscal year 2018 on our call in May, we plan to exclude recurring pension income from adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS. Pension income will still be in our GAAP numbers and the adjusted numbers defined in our credit agreement. Many of you have requested that we remove pension income from what we report in our non-GAAP measures, and we want to enhance the comparability with our peers' results and limit confusion for potential new investors. As we've said repeatedly, pension income is noncash in nature and should not change the fundamental valuation of the company. By way of comparison, our updated fiscal year 2017 guidance assumes $92 million of pension income within adjusted EBITDA, which equates to about $0.35 of adjusted diluted earnings per share. So if we hit the midpoint of our guidance, fiscal year 2017 performance excluding pension would be $769 million for adjusted EBITDA and $1.65 for adjusted earnings per share, which should be the basis of comparison when we introduce FY '18 guidance. Another point of consideration is our long-term EBITDA margin target, which translates to 14% to 15% excluding pension income. Naturally, there would be no impact to our free cash flow guidance. We hope that signaling this change now will help all of our analysts and investors prepare their models going forward and avoid any confusion.
With that, operator, we're now ready to take questions."

There is a little bit of noise. There was a week where EPA was freezing contracts on a Monday and then freeing them up by a Friday. We put that in the category of ""Yes, we had administration for 8 years, and there's always going to be growth pains.""

I think you've heard the right signals on our call today in terms of what we're seeing today, which is, in our scripted comments, the fact that we see revenue inflicting toward growth. So far this year, we've been hovering in that minus 4% to minus 5% range, Q3 now a little better than minus 4 and our Q4 guidance, roughly minus 1 to minus 5, so you're seeing that gradual inflection. We see, as we pointed out earlier, the opportunity for growth in  '18 to reach the long-term range of 2% to 3% that we've mentioned. That will take the form of gradual sequential growth over time. The compares got a little bit easier when we get into Q1, and that will certainly help as well. At the end of the day, it's about the pace of new business award activity continuing, the really strong book-to-bills that we've produced over the last 3, 4 quarters continuing into FY '18 and our ability to ramp up each of those as well as we have today. So on the bottom line, as you pointed out, we've got confidence that as revenue and flex toward growth that, that should lead toward earnings growth as well. Even if in a year where EBITDA is flat, we should see EPS growing. If EBITDA grows, we should see EPS grow even faster. So that's the kind of the dynamic that we should look at going forward, given net interest and other lines between EBITDA and EPS should be helpful."

The clear highlights for the third quarter were superb cash flow and another set of large, strategic new business wins. In addition, revenue was in line with consensus, and EBITDA and EPS were both a little bit ahead of consensus. Our EBITDA margin of 17.3% still leads the industry and is above our long-term target. I'll leave the financial results for Dave to do in detail, so I can focus on 4 key points. 
Point number one, to prepare for our fiscal year 2018, we crafted a clear and differentiated strategy to drive growth in our public sector markets supported by a new brand and tagline, Think Next. Now. And the 3 remaining points are that the key enablers of this strategy are all in place and all working today. 
So point number two, our growth engine continues to lead the industry. Point number three, our technology leadership is creating key differentiators in the market. And point number four, our talent management approach is building a motivated workforce to execute our strategy. 
Let me go a little bit deeper. Point number one on strategy. For a year, we've just been heads down and focused on the tasks in front of us, executing on programs, delivering on the synergy case, integrating 2 companies and 2 cultures, writing proposals and yes, each and every day, collecting cash. I am proud of the team's hard work and tremendous accomplishments on all of these fronts. We are stronger today than we were a year ago as a result of the determination, the energy and the creativity of all 18,000 employees who show up to work every day with a passion for our customers' missions. 
In particular, we now have a much better balance sheet and a backlog of new programs that provides us strategic flexibility and growth momentum. Over the last few months, we've taken the time to look beyond the horizon and chart our direction for the next 3 years. It's been a very collaborative effort across both line organizations and leverage teams, with a board both fully engaged and rolling up their sleeves to help. We now have a holistic view of strategy and vision, and our cultures and values are aligned, and we're gaining buy-ins throughout the company. 
Strategy is all about where you compete, how you compete and how you measure success. Our strategy is to drive sustainable industry-leading organic growth across our federal and state local markets through customer intimacy, rapid innovation and an outcome-based experience. Let me unpack this statement a bit. 
Our primary focus is profitably growing the company. We are the most efficient company in our space, and we will remain so, but this is a dramatic shift. We have moved from the legacy mindset of only improving the bottom line by cutting costs to one centered around and devoted to a growth culture. We will measure our success, first and foremost, through revenue growth, which provides better career opportunities for our employees, more solutions that we can provide to our customers and greater returns to our shareholders. 
Next, we will remain focused on our current markets where we have about a 3% market share. The federal government and related state and local and international markets provide plenty of opportunities for us, and the market dynamics are improving after years of government budget cuts. We will support the United States and the vital interest of her allies across the globe. We are well positioned with many of the new administration's priorities, including defense, border security and the critical care for our veterans. 
We will compete through 3 primary differentiators: first, customer intimacy; second, innovation; and third, outcome-based delivery. Our customer intimacy derives from talented teams who deliver flawlessly, who build trust-based relationships with our customers and provide mission and technology thought leadership. We deliver rapid innovation through partnerships, share delivery models and cross-agency capabilities. Our customers are looking to move towards paying for outcomes instead of inputs, and we are the industry leader in delivering outcome-based experiences through developing, bidding and executing the shared delivery methodologies. 
Our mission, vision, strategy and importantly, our culture and values are then encapsulated by our brand of Think Next. Now. This message is one the entire company created and can rally behind, enabling us to approach the market with a unified purpose and direction. It imagines a better future and delivers it today for our customers, our partners and ultimately, all the people our mission has touched. 
 
Point number two, our business development engine continues to rev at high RPMs. We posted our eighth straight quarter with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.0 or greater. In what is typically the slowest quarter for awards, we achieved $1.9 billion in bookings for a book-to-bill ratio of 1.5. Our trailing 12-month book-to-bill ratio was still tracking at 1.3. Our backlog of signed business orders at the end of the quarter was $15.8 billion, which increased 3% year-over-year. I firmly believe that if we continue to post industry-leading book-to-bill rates, we will lead our industry in organic growth, which is our goal. 
The $1.9 billion in awards were rich with new business. 73% of bookings in the quarter were for new business, and our win rate on new business was 46%. Again, well above our target rate of 25%. So far this year, we've won $3.1 billion in new business, ahead of our target run rate of $4 billion each year even though we are just now seeing the full effect of our accelerated bid submissions. 
Our bid pipeline remains robust. At the end of the quarter, we have $12 billion in submits outstanding. Looking only at new business, we had about $5.7 billion awaiting decision, including 15 opportunities that are each greater than $100 million in total value. This quarter's awards showcase how we are combining deep domain knowledge of the customers' mission, expertise in their IT enterprise and next-generation capabilities and partners to deliver compelling solutions for our customers. 
 
Let me highlight just a few of the major wins in the quarter to give you a sense of what I mean. Our largest win was the $744 million award that was in protest at the time of our last call. With that protest resolved in December, we are now supporting the army's Communications-Electronics Command, providing a wide range of mission-essential logistics, maintenance and sustainment work for current and future C4ISR systems around the world in support of this administration's priorities. 
Building on the delivery excellence of our Program Manager, Larry Cropp, our General Manager for this business, Alan Smith, was instrumental in crafting the strategy for this consolidated procurement. We expect our work growing from current revenue levels of $30 million a year to well over $100 million each year as we ramp over the next few quarters. 
 
In another consolidating contract, Kamal Narang led a team that engineered a wonderful technical solution on a $323 million program called HIGLAS to host, operate and maintain the general ledger system for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Our world-class database team has been working on the application side for 5 years, but taking over the infrastructure work was a tall task, one that was perfect for Rebecca Miller, our Civil Group BD lead overseeing the capture. We were able to team well with Oracle to engineer a compelling solution using the Oracle Exadata that was low-risk, innovative and cost-efficient, and improved performance by a factor of 10. On this program, we'll introduce and implement dev op methodologies and potentially migrate the application to a cloud environment. 
 
Final example, we received a new single-award blank purchase agreement -- blanket purchase agreement with $150 million ceiling to help the Department of Commerce reduce costs, enhance customer service quality and prepare for the 2020 Census. Under the leadership of Chris Hegedus, SRA will develop and implement cloud-based services in the areas of acquisition, financial management, human resources and information technology. This is a shared service deal with a foundation and a solution that leverages both ServiceNow and our own Integrated Technology Center in Bossier City, Louisiana. 
 
These wins are largely driven by next-generation thinking enabled by strong technology partnerships, which takes me to my third key point: CSRA works really hard to attain technology leadership. The breadth and the depth of our partnerships with key technology innovators is unmatched because we offer unmatched access to the federal government IT enterprise, and we bring a focus and a passion for technology insertion that will help missions be successful. With a full involvement of our line organizations, we develop and invest in our partner relationships, especially our 7 strategic alliance partners: Amazon Web Services, Cisco, Microsoft, Oracle, Salesforce, SAP and ServiceNow. For example, our recent Greenway submission under Leigh Palmer's leadership with the Intelligence Group leveraged 6 of these strategic partners in the bid and clearly differentiates our technical offering. We are already a premier consulting partner in the AWS partner network. And this quarter, we successfully completed the independent third-party audit to join their elite managed services program. That enables us to deliver added value to cloud solutions by offering proactive monitoring, automation and management of our customers' environments. 
We also recently added Amazon's commercial and Amazon's GovCloud services to the GSA IT Schedule 70, which is the largest most widely used acquisition vehicle across the federal government. These added qualifications and channels will even further our leadership in cloud migration, especially with Paul Nedzbala's Health and Civil Group, whose customers are often the most forward-leaning in adopting next-generation technologies. 
   
Now our other strategic partner in the cloud, Microsoft, we just signed with them a 3-year enterprise agreement to use their products for the Azure cloud platform. We are proud to be a gold partner in the Microsoft Partner Network, and we're now the first government systems integrator to migrate its own workload to the Azure government cloud platform. By investing in ourselves, we minimize risk and then accelerate solutions for our customers as we act as customer zero. 
We believe that the market for Microsoft's cloud services will expand rapidly, especially within the Department of Defense. The DoD just granted level 5 accreditation for Azure and Office 365, making them the only commercial cloud provider at that level of security and trust. Ken Deutsch and his Defense Group team are working hand-in-hand with Microsoft on many large and strategic bids that could be major drivers for both of us in this critical market. Microsoft was also the major sponsor, along with Splunk, of a hackathon that we hosted in December. Led by Sally Sullivan's Homeland Security Group, this hands-on, competition-style training event brought together technologists from across the company to engage in collaborative computing, challenge conventional thinking and solve real-world problems in the cloud and really leverage data analytics, which brings me to my fourth key point: our talent. 
This is the driver behind really improving customer intimacy, earning trust-based relationships and delivering flawless execution. We continue to up our game in hiring, retaining and developing our workforce. In the third quarter, we had more job applicants than we've ever had, and 42% of our new hires are millennials. Our voluntary attrition rate in the quarter was the lowest we've had since going public. Employees are seeing enhanced opportunities through growth, and the culture is evolving in all sorts of positive ways. Our employees like the opportunity for continued technical education, and more than 400 of these employees added new technical and professional certifications in the quarter. 
 
Before I turn it over to Dave, let me briefly address how we're thinking about the market under President Trump's administration. For context, let's keep in mind that we're less than 3 weeks into the new administration, so we're in the very early stages. For example, just 7 members of President Trump's team have been confirmed by the Senate, which means we've only got 1,235 to go. Transitions after 2-term presidents are generally a little chaotic, and they all take time, so I expect industry book-to-bills for the March quarter to be a bit dampened, but all of us remain convinced this is a growth opportunity for the marketplace. We've seen a steady flow of forceful executive orders, tweets and interviews. Nothing has changed our fundamental view that the market for our services and solutions will grow in the coming years. 
The administration has signaled a willingness to engage in deficit spending to fund a strong commitment to the military and the border security. And with the freeze in hiring for nonmilitary government personnel, service contractors stand ready to enable mission success. Given our efficient onshore staffing model, CSRA can be an engine for American job growth, clearly a key priority for President Trump. We may face headwinds in some areas, such as our support for the EPA but on balance, we believe we are well positioned for future growth with this administration. Perhaps most importantly, CSRA should benefit from a more businesslike approach to contracts with more fixed-price contracts and a greater focus on cost efficiency, both major advantages for us. Ultimately, this environment will favor those who are ready to move quickly, who are agile and act like a business, and we're doing that on all cylinders. 
 
Now Dave will provide more detail on the financial results and the forward outlook."
301669938,417875403,1126211,"CSRA Inc., Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Feb 07, 2017",2017-02-07,"Earnings Calls","CSRA Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Larry, and good afternoon, everyone. As Larry said, we had another strong quarter across the board but especially around cash flow, which is the life blood of the company.  Turning to Slide 5. Revenue for the quarter was $1.22 billion, down 3%",1470,"Thanks, Larry, and good afternoon, everyone. As Larry said, we had another strong quarter across the board but especially around cash flow, which is the life blood of the company. 
 
Turning to Slide 5. Revenue for the quarter was $1.22 billion, down 3% sequentially and down 4% from pro forma revenue in the third quarter of fiscal year 2016. The sequential decline was consistent with normal seasonal leave-taking patterns and was in line with our expectations. Our contract mix continues to exhibit a high concentration of fixed-price work, which is a key driver of our profitability. As a percentage of total revenue, 46% was on fixed-price contracts, 21% on time and material contracts and 33% on cost-plus contracts. There were a few unique items impacting the expense and earnings lines though for the most part, they affected the GAAP treatment, not the adjusted numbers, and we were able to preview most of the larger items on our last call. I'll now walk through these major drivers as I progress through the income statement.
 
First, we extended a voluntary offer to former employees, who participated in qualified pension plans, to receive immediate lump sum payments. Based on participant selections, in the third quarter of fiscal year 2017, we made lump sum payments of $320 million and reduced pension obligations by $333 million, so a net improvement of $13 million in the pension funding status. This roughly 10% change in the overall size of the pension program necessitated a pension plan remeasurement as of December 1, 2016. We recorded a noncash mark-to-market benefit of $101 million in the quarter. We do not project making any meaningful contributions to the pension program in the foreseeable future, and we reduced the GAAP underfunding of the program by about $136 million. With the lower asset base and higher projected interest rate, the remeasurement costs recurring noncash pension income to fall from $24 million in the second quarter to $23 million in the third quarter and a $21 million quarterly run rate thereafter, although this could change again with our usual annual remeasurement in the fourth quarter. 
 
Second, GAAP stock compensation expense during the quarter was $18 million. $14 million of that was a noncash charge from performance-based awards for former SRA shareholders. The performance targets for the awards were met when Providence Equity Partners, formerly CSRA's majority shareholder, sold its CSRA holdings after our second quarter earnings call. We were delighted that our existing and new shareholders purchased more than 15 million shares with no visible disruption to the market. Compared to the time of the spin, we believe our investor base is now much more focused on CSRA as a long-term holding.
 
Third, pretax merger and integration costs were $5 million, down $3 million from last quarter. Despite relatively modest EAC adjustments in the quarter, profitability continues to be strong with an EBITDA margin of 17.3%. This is down from last quarter's record margin and consistent with the view that we've laid out for some time that EBITDA margin, as we've defined them, would end up in the low to mid-17% range for FY '17 and over the longer term, land in the 16% to 17% range as we drive top line growth. On a volume basis, adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $211 million. Below EBITDA, the quarterly variances were more muted. We completed the repricing of our term loans, consistent with the plans we laid out on our last call. In connection with the repricing, we incurred a noncash charge of $8 million for a write-off of deferred financing costs in the third quarter. Going forward, the repricing will reduce interest expense by approximately $5 million annually. Excluding the charge, interest expense was $28 million in the quarter, down about $1 million from last quarter. Depreciation and amortization, excluding the intangibles amortization expense associated with SRA's funded contract backlog, was $50 million or $3 million more than last quarter. The intangible's amortization expense associated with SRA's funded contract backlog, which is included in GAAP earnings per share but not adjusted EPS, was $11 million or $5 million less than last quarter, and it will go to 0 in Q4. Our effective tax rate was 37%, which is close to our long-term target rate, but up about 2 percentage points from last quarter. With that, adjusted diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.48, unchanged compared to the third quarter of fiscal year 2016.
 
Now turning to Slide 6. Cash flow performance was our best as a public company. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $227 million, and free cash flow was $191 million or more than 2.4x adjusted net income. 
 
My thanks go out to our entire team of invoicers and collectors for their hard work in generating this tremendous outcome for the company. In addition, we did not make a $30 million intellectual property maintenance payment to see CSC in the third quarter as anticipated under our original separation agreement. We're currently in discussions with CSC regarding a variety of matters related to our separation agreements. Note that during the question-and-answer period, we will not take questions regarding these discussions with CSC. 
 
Days sales outstanding were 57 days in Q3, which is unchanged from last quarter. We will look to shave a couple of days off DSOs over time through continued strong collections performance. We followed our balanced capital allocation program in Q3, deploying $50 million to pay down debt and $38 million to return to shareholders, $17 million in dividends and $21 million in share repurchases. As of December 30, 2016, we had $162 million in cash and cash equivalents and $2.6 billion in debt. 
 
Now on to the forward outlook. As we approach the end of our fiscal year, we have modified guidance as shown on Slide 7. Specifically, we now project fiscal year 2017 revenue between $4.96 billion and $5.01 billion. Including the lower noncash pension income, we project adjusted EBITDA between $857 million and $867 million and adjusted diluted earnings per share between $1.98 and $2.02. Our free cash flow guidance remains between $300 million and $350 million. For adjusted EPS, specifically, this guidance equates to fourth quarter performance of $0.44 to $0.48. Compared to our original guidance ranges, we expect to land near the low end for revenue and adjusted EBITDA, and near the high end of our adjusted earnings per share range. The pension remeasurement has lowered our FY '17 adjusted EBITDA guidance by about $4 million and our adjusted EPS guidance by about $0.02. 
 
Our fourth quarter outlook reflects slow startups on some large programs, such as the OPM background investigation contract and the large army C4ISR program as well as potential interruptions on current contracts at a few agencies and fewer Q4 awards as a result of the administration transition, but it does not change our fundamental view of an improving picture for CSRA. It takes some time for new wins to reach their ultimate revenue run rate, especially during an administration change. When they do, our growth will surely follow. 
 
We continue to see an opportunity for FY '18 to produce organic growth in line with our long-term model of 2% to 3%. And the EBITDA margin, slightly below current levels but on the high side of our long-term model of 16% to 17%, including pension income, which brings me to my closing point. 
As we introduce guidance for fiscal year 2018 on our call in May, we plan to exclude recurring pension income from adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS. Pension income will still be in our GAAP numbers and the adjusted numbers defined in our credit agreement. Many of you have requested that we remove pension income from what we report in our non-GAAP measures, and we want to enhance the comparability with our peers' results and limit confusion for potential new investors. As we've said repeatedly, pension income is noncash in nature and should not change the fundamental valuation of the company. By way of comparison, our updated fiscal year 2017 guidance assumes $92 million of pension income within adjusted EBITDA, which equates to about $0.35 of adjusted diluted earnings per share. So if we hit the midpoint of our guidance, fiscal year 2017 performance, excluding pension, would be $769 million for adjusted EBITDA and $1.65 for adjusted earnings per share, which should be the basis of comparison when we introduce FY '18 guidance. Another point of consideration is our long-term EBITDA margin target, which translates to 14% to 15%, excluding pension income. Naturally, there would be no impact to our free cash flow guidance. We hope that signaling this change now will help all of our analysts and investors prepare their models going forward and avoid any confusion.

So obviously, we're 3 months away from providing our '18 guidance. I think you've heard the right signals on our call today in terms of what we're seeing today, which is, in our scripted comments, the fact that we see revenue inflecting toward growth. So far this year, we've been hovering in that minus 4% to minus 5% range, Q3 now a little better than minus 4% and our Q4 guidance, roughly minus 1% to minus 5%. So you're seeing that gradual inflection. We see, as we pointed out earlier, the opportunity for our growth in  '18 to reach the long-term range of 2% to 3% that we've mentioned. That will take the form of gradual sequential growth over time. I think compares got a little bit easier when we get into Q1, and that will certainly help as well. At the end of the day, it's about the pace of new business award activity continuing, the really strong book-to-bills that we've produced over the last 3, 4 quarters continuing into FY '18 and our ability to ramp up each of those as well as we have today. So on the bottom line, as you pointed out, we've got confidence that as revenue inflects toward growth that, that should lead toward earnings growth as well. Even if in a year where EBITDA is flat, we should see EPS growing. If EBITDA grows, we should see grow -- EPS grow even faster. So that's the kind of the dynamic that we should look at going forward, given net interest and other lines between EBITDA and EPS should be helpful."

The clear highlights for the third quarter were superb cash flow and another set of large, strategic new business wins. In addition, revenue was in line with consensus, and EBITDA and EPS were both a little bit ahead of consensus. Our EBITDA margin of 17.3% still leads the industry and is above our long-term target. I'll leave the financial results for Dave to do in detail, so I can focus on 4 key points. 
Point number one, to prepare for our fiscal year 2018, we crafted a clear and differentiated strategy to drive growth in our public sector markets supported by a new brand and tagline, Think Next. Now. And the 3 remaining points are that the key enablers of this strategy are all in place and all working today. 
So point number two, our growth engine continues to lead the industry. Point number three, our technology leadership is creating key differentiators in the market. And point number four, our talent management approach is building a motivated workforce to execute our strategy. 
Let me go a little bit deeper. Point number one on strategy. For a year, we've just been heads down and focused on the tasks in front of us, executing on programs, delivering on the synergy case, integrating 2 companies and 2 cultures, writing proposals and yes, each and every day, collecting cash. I am proud of the team's hard work and tremendous accomplishments on all of these fronts. We are stronger today than we were a year ago as a result of the determination, the energy and the creativity of all 18,000 employees who show up to work every day with a passion for our customers' missions. 
In particular, we now have a much better balance sheet and a backlog of new programs that provides us strategic flexibility and growth momentum. Over the last few months, we've taken the time to look beyond the horizon and chart our direction for the next 3 years. It's been a very collaborative effort across both line organizations and leverage teams, with a board both fully engaged and rolling up their sleeves to help. We now have a holistic view of strategy and vision, and our cultures and values are aligned, and we're gaining buy-ins throughout the company. 
Strategy is all about where you compete, how you compete and how you measure success. Our strategy is to drive sustainable industry-leading organic growth across our federal and state local markets through customer intimacy, rapid innovation and an outcome-based experience. Let me unpack this statement a bit. 
Our primary focus is profitably growing the company. We are the most efficient company in our space, and we will remain so, but this is a dramatic shift. We have moved from the legacy mindset of only improving the bottom line by cutting costs to one centered around and devoted to a growth culture. We will measure our success, first and foremost, through revenue growth, which provides better career opportunities for our employees, more solutions that we can provide to our customers and greater returns to our shareholders. 
Next, we will remain focused on our current markets where we have about a 3% market share. The federal government and related state and local and international markets provide plenty of opportunities for us, and the market dynamics are improving after years of government budget cuts. We will support the United States and the vital interest of her allies across the globe. We are well positioned with many of the new administration's priorities, including defense, border security and the critical care for our veterans. 
We will compete through 3 primary differentiators: first, customer intimacy; second, innovation; and third, outcome-based delivery. Our customer intimacy derives from talented teams who deliver flawlessly, who build trust-based relationships with our customers and provide mission and technology thought leadership. We deliver rapid innovation through partnerships, share delivery models and cross-agency capabilities. Our customers are looking to move towards paying for outcomes instead of inputs, and we are the industry leader in delivering outcome-based experiences through developing, bidding and executing the shared delivery methodologies. 
Our mission, vision, strategy and importantly, our culture and values are then encapsulated by our brand of Think Next. Now. This message is one the entire company created and can rally behind, enabling us to approach the market with a unified purpose and direction. It imagines a better future and delivers it today for our customers, our partners and ultimately, all the people our mission has touched. 
 
Point number two, our business development engine continues to rev at high RPMs. We posted our eighth straight quarter with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.0 or greater. In what is typically the slowest quarter for awards, we achieved $1.9 billion in bookings for a book-to-bill ratio of 1.5. Our trailing 12-month book-to-bill ratio was still tracking at 1.3. Our backlog of signed business orders at the end of the quarter was $15.8 billion, which increased 3% year-over-year. I firmly believe that if we continue to post industry-leading book-to-bill rates, we will lead our industry in organic growth, which is our goal. 
The $1.9 billion in awards were rich with new business. 73% of bookings in the quarter were for new business, and our win rate on new business was 46%. Again, well above our target rate of 25%. So far this year, we've won $3.1 billion in new business, ahead of our target run rate of $4 billion each year even though we are just now seeing the full effect of our accelerated bid submissions. 
Our bid pipeline remains robust. At the end of the quarter, we have $12 billion in submits outstanding. Looking only at new business, we had about $5.7 billion awaiting decision, including 15 opportunities that are each greater than $100 million in total value. This quarter's awards showcase how we are combining deep domain knowledge of the customers' mission, expertise in their IT enterprise and next-generation capabilities and partners to deliver compelling solutions for our customers. 
 
Let me highlight just a few of the major wins in the quarter to give you a sense of what I mean. Our largest win was the $744 million award that was in protest at the time of our last call. With that protest resolved in December, we are now supporting the army's Communications-Electronics Command, providing a wide range of mission-essential logistics, maintenance and sustainment work for current and future C4ISR systems around the world in support of this administration's priorities. 
Building on the delivery excellence of our Program Manager, Larry Cropp, our General Manager for this business, Alan Smith, was instrumental in crafting the strategy for this consolidated procurement. We expect our work growing from current revenue levels of $30 million a year to well over $100 million each year as we ramp over the next few quarters. 
 
In another consolidating contract, Kamal Narang led a team that engineered a wonderful technical solution on a $323 million program called HIGLAS to host, operate and maintain the general ledger system for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Our world-class database team has been working on the application side for 5 years, but taking over the infrastructure work was a tall task, one that was perfect for Rebecca Miller, our Civil Group BD lead overseeing the capture. We were able to team well with Oracle to engineer a compelling solution using the Oracle Exadata that was low-risk, innovative and cost-efficient, and improved performance by a factor of 10. On this program, we'll introduce and implement dev op methodologies and potentially migrate the application to a cloud environment. 
 
Final example, we received a new single-award blank purchase agreement -- blanket purchase agreement with $150 million ceiling to help the Department of Commerce reduce costs, enhance customer service quality and prepare for the 2020 Census. Under the leadership of Chris Hegedus, SRA will develop and implement cloud-based services in the areas of acquisition, financial management, human resources and information technology. This is a shared service deal with a foundation and a solution that leverages both ServiceNow and our own Integrated Technology Center in Bossier City, Louisiana. 
 
These wins are largely driven by next-generation thinking enabled by strong technology partnerships, which takes me to my third key point: CSRA works really hard to attain technology leadership. The breadth and the depth of our partnerships with key technology innovators is unmatched because we offer unmatched access to the federal government IT enterprise, and we bring a focus and a passion for technology insertion that will help missions be successful. With a full involvement of our line organizations, we develop and invest in our partner relationships, especially our 7 strategic alliance partners: Amazon Web Services, Cisco, Microsoft, Oracle, Salesforce, SAP and ServiceNow. For example, our recent Greenway submission under Leigh Palmer's leadership with the Intelligence Group leveraged 6 of these strategic partners in the bid and clearly differentiates our technical offering. We are already a premier consulting partner in the AWS partner network. And this quarter, we successfully completed the independent third-party audit to join their elite managed services program. That enables us to deliver added value to cloud solutions by offering proactive monitoring, automation and management of our customers' environments. 
We also recently added Amazon's commercial and Amazon's GovCloud services to the GSA IT Schedule 70, which is the largest most widely used acquisition vehicle across the federal government. These added qualifications and channels will even further our leadership in cloud migration, especially with Paul Nedzbala's Health and Civil Group, whose customers are often the most forward-leaning in adopting next-generation technologies. 
   
Now our other strategic partner in the cloud, Microsoft, we just signed with them a 3-year enterprise agreement to use their products for the Azure cloud platform. We are proud to be a gold partner in the Microsoft Partner Network, and we're now the first government systems integrator to migrate its own workload to the Azure government cloud platform. By investing in ourselves, we minimize risk and then accelerate solutions for our customers as we act as customer zero. 
We believe that the market for Microsoft's cloud services will expand rapidly, especially within the Department of Defense. The DoD just granted level 5 accreditation for Azure and Office 365, making them the only commercial cloud provider at that level of security and trust. Ken Deutsch and his Defense Group team are working hand-in-hand with Microsoft on many large and strategic bids that could be major drivers for both of us in this critical market. Microsoft was also the major sponsor, along with Splunk, of a hackathon that we hosted in December. Led by Sally Sullivan's Homeland Security Group, this hands-on, competition-style training event brought together technologists from across the company to engage in collaborative computing, challenge conventional thinking and solve real-world problems in the cloud and really leverage data analytics, which brings me to my fourth key point: our talent. 
This is the driver behind really improving customer intimacy, earning trust-based relationships and delivering flawless execution. We continue to up our game in hiring, retaining and developing our workforce. In the third quarter, we had more job applicants than we've ever had, and 42% of our new hires are millennials. Our voluntary attrition rate in the quarter was the lowest we've had since going public. Employees are seeing enhanced opportunities through growth, and the culture is evolving in all sorts of positive ways. Our employees like the opportunity for continued technical education, and more than 400 of these employees added new technical and professional certifications in the quarter. 
 
Before I turn it over to Dave, let me briefly address how we're thinking about the market under President Trump's administration. For context, let's keep in mind that we're less than 3 weeks into the new administration, so we're in the very early stages. For example, just 7 members of President Trump's team have been confirmed by the Senate, which means we've only got 1,235 to go. Transitions after 2-term presidents are generally a little chaotic, and they all take time, so I expect industry book-to-bills for the March quarter to be a bit dampened, but all of us remain convinced this is a growth opportunity for the marketplace. We've seen a steady flow of forceful executive orders, tweets and interviews. Nothing has changed our fundamental view that the market for our services and solutions will grow in the coming years. 
The administration has signaled a willingness to engage in deficit spending to fund a strong commitment to the military and the border security. And with the freeze in hiring for nonmilitary government personnel, service contractors stand ready to enable mission success. Given our efficient onshore staffing model, CSRA can be an engine for American job growth, clearly a key priority for President Trump. We may face headwinds in some areas, such as our support for the EPA but on balance, we believe we are well positioned for future growth with this administration. Perhaps most importantly, CSRA should benefit from a more businesslike approach to contracts with more fixed-price contracts and a greater focus on cost efficiency, both major advantages for us. Ultimately, this environment will favor those who are ready to move quickly, who are agile and act like a business, and we're doing that on all cylinders. 
 
Now Dave will provide more detail on the financial results and the forward outlook."
301669938,417875403,1126234,"CSRA Inc., Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Feb 07, 2017",2017-02-07,"Earnings Calls","CSRA Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Larry, and good afternoon, everyone. As Larry said, we had another strong quarter across the board but especially around cash flow, which is the life blood of the company.  Turning to Slide 5. Revenue for the quarter was $1.22 billion, down 3%",1470,"Thanks, Larry, and good afternoon, everyone. As Larry said, we had another strong quarter across the board but especially around cash flow, which is the life blood of the company. 
 
Turning to Slide 5. Revenue for the quarter was $1.22 billion, down 3% sequentially and down 4% from pro forma revenue in the third quarter of fiscal year 2016. The sequential decline was consistent with normal seasonal leave-taking patterns and was in line with our expectations. Our contract mix continues to exhibit a high concentration of fixed-price work, which is a key driver of our profitability. As a percentage of total revenue, 46% was on fixed-price contracts, 21% on time and material contracts and 33% on cost-plus contracts. There were a few unique items impacting the expense and earnings lines, though for the most part, they affected the GAAP treatment, not the adjusted numbers, and we were able to preview most of the larger items on our last call. I'll now walk through these major drivers as I progress through the income statement.
 
First, we extended a voluntary offer to former employees, who participated in qualified pension plans, to receive immediate lump sum payments. Based on participant selections, in the third quarter of fiscal year 2017, we made lump sum payments of $320 million and reduced pension obligations by $333 million, so a net improvement of $13 million in the pension funding status. This roughly 10% change in the overall size of the pension program necessitated a pension plan remeasurement as of December 1, 2016. We recorded a noncash mark-to-market benefit of $101 million in the quarter. We do not project making any meaningful contributions to the pension program in the foreseeable future, and we reduced the GAAP underfunding of the program by about $136 million. With the lower asset base and higher projected interest rate, the remeasurement caused recurring noncash pension income to fall from $24 million in the second quarter to $23 million in the third quarter and a $21 million quarterly run rate thereafter, although this could change again with our usual annual remeasurement in the fourth quarter. 
 
Second, GAAP stock compensation expense during the quarter was $18 million. $14 million of that was a noncash charge from performance-based awards for former SRA shareholders. The performance targets for the awards were met when Providence Equity Partners, formerly SRA's majority shareholder, sold its CSRA holdings after our second quarter earnings call. We were delighted that our existing and new shareholders purchased more than 15 million shares with no visible disruption to the market. Compared to the time of the spin, we believe our investor base is now much more focused on CSRA as a long-term holding.
 
Third, pretax merger and integration costs were $5 million, down $3 million from last quarter. Despite relatively modest EAC adjustments in the quarter, profitability continues to be strong with an EBITDA margin of 17.3%. This is down from last quarter's record margin and consistent with the view that we've laid out for some time that EBITDA margin, as we've defined them, would end up in the low to mid-17% range for FY '17 and over the longer term, land in the 16% to 17% range as we drive top line growth. On a volume basis, adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $211 million. Below EBITDA, the quarterly variances were more muted. We completed the repricing of our term loans, consistent with the plans we laid out on our last call. In connection with the repricing, we incurred a noncash charge of $8 million for a write-off of deferred financing costs in the third quarter. Going forward, the repricing will reduce interest expense by approximately $5 million annually. Excluding the charge, interest expense was $28 million in the quarter, down about $1 million from last quarter. Depreciation and amortization, excluding the intangibles amortization expense associated with SRA's funded contract backlog, was $50 million or $3 million more than last quarter. The intangible's amortization expense associated with SRA's funded contract backlog, which is included in GAAP earnings per share but not adjusted EPS, was $11 million or $5 million less than last quarter, and it will go to 0 in Q4. Our effective tax rate was 37%, which is close to our long-term target rate, but up about 2 percentage points from last quarter. With that, adjusted diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.48, unchanged compared to the third quarter of fiscal year 2016.
 
Now turning to Slide 6. Cash flow performance was our best as a public company. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $227 million, and free cash flow was $191 million or more than 2.4x adjusted net income. 
 
My thanks go out to our entire team of invoicers and collectors for their hard work in generating this tremendous outcome for the company. In addition, we did not make a $30 million intellectual property maintenance payment to see CSC in the third quarter as anticipated under our original separation agreement. We're currently in discussions with CSC regarding a variety of matters related to our separation agreements. Note that during the question-and-answer period, we will not take questions regarding these discussions with CSC. 
 
Days sales outstanding were 57 days in Q3, which is unchanged from last quarter. We will look to shave a couple of days off DSOs over time through continued strong collections performance. We followed our balanced capital allocation program in Q3, deploying $50 million to pay down debt and $38 million to return to shareholders $17 million in dividends and $21 million in share repurchases. As of December 30, 2016, we had $162 million in cash and cash equivalents and $2.6 billion in debt. 
 
Now on to the forward outlook. As we approach the end of our fiscal year, we have modified guidance as shown on Slide 7. Specifically, we now project fiscal year 2017 revenue between $4.96 billion and $5.01 billion. Including the lower noncash pension income, we project adjusted EBITDA between $857 million and $867 million and adjusted diluted earnings per share between $1.98 and $2.02. Our free cash flow guidance remains between $300 million and $350 million. For adjusted EPS, specifically, this guidance equates to fourth quarter performance of $0.44 to $0.48. Compared to our original guidance ranges, we expect to land near the low end for revenue and adjusted EBITDA, and near the high end of our adjusted earnings per share range. The pension remeasurement has lowered our FY '17 adjusted EBITDA guidance by about $4 million and our adjusted EPS guidance by about $0.02. 
 
Our fourth quarter outlook reflects slow startups on some large programs, such as the OPM background investigation contract and the large army C4ISR program as well as potential interruptions on current contracts at a few agencies and fewer Q4 awards as a result of the administration transition, but it does not change our fundamental view of an improving picture for CSRA. It takes some time for new wins to reach their ultimate revenue run rate, especially during an administration change. When they do, our growth will surely follow. 
 
We continue to see an opportunity for FY '18 to produce organic growth in line with our long-term model of 2% to 3%. And the EBITDA margin, slightly below current levels but on the high side of our long-term model of 16% to 17%, including pension income, which brings me to my closing point. 
As we introduce guidance for fiscal year 2018 on our call in May, we plan to exclude recurring pension income from adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS. Pension income will still be in our GAAP numbers and the adjusted numbers defined in our credit agreement. Many of you have requested that we remove pension income from what we report in our non-GAAP measures, and we want to enhance the comparability with our peers' results and limit confusion for potential new investors. As we've said repeatedly, pension income is noncash in nature and should not change the fundamental valuation of the company. By way of comparison, our updated fiscal year 2017 guidance assumes $92 million of pension income within adjusted EBITDA, which equates to about $0.35 of adjusted diluted earnings per share. So if we hit the midpoint of our guidance, fiscal year 2017 performance, excluding pension, would be $769 million for adjusted EBITDA and $1.65 for adjusted earnings per share, which should be the basis of comparison when we introduce FY '18 guidance. Another point of consideration is our long-term EBITDA margin target, which translates to 14% to 15%, excluding pension income. Naturally, there would be no impact to our free cash flow guidance. We hope that signaling this change now will help all of our analysts and investors prepare their models going forward and avoid any confusion.

So obviously, we're 3 months away from providing our '18 guidance. I think you've heard the right signals on our call today in terms of what we're seeing today, which is, in our scripted comments, the fact that we see revenue inflecting toward growth. So far this year, we've been hovering in that minus 4% to minus 5% range, Q3 now a little better than minus 4% and our Q4 guidance, roughly minus 1% to minus 5%. So you're seeing that gradual inflection. We see, as we pointed out earlier, the opportunity for our growth in '18 to reach the long-term range of 2% to 3% that we've mentioned. That will take the form of gradual sequential growth over time. I think compares got a little bit easier when we get into Q1, and that will certainly help as well. At the end of the day, it's about the pace of new business award activity continuing, the really strong book-to-bills that we've produced over the last 3, 4 quarters continuing into FY '18 and our ability to ramp up each of those as well as we have today. So on the bottom line, as you pointed out, we've got confidence that as revenue inflects toward growth that, that should lead toward earnings growth as well. Even if in a year where EBITDA is flat, we should see EPS growing. If EBITDA grows, we should see grow -- EPS grow even faster. So that's the kind of the dynamic that we should look at going forward, given that interest in other lines between EBITDA and EPS should be helpful."

The clear highlights for the third quarter were superb cash flow and another set of large, strategic new business wins. In addition, revenue was in line with consensus, and EBITDA and EPS were both a little bit ahead of consensus. Our EBITDA margin of 17.3% still leads the industry and is above our long-term target. I'll leave the financial results for Dave to do in detail, so I can focus on 4 key points. 
Point number one, to prepare for our fiscal year 2018, we crafted a clear and differentiated strategy to drive growth in our public sector markets supported by a new brand and tagline, Think Next. Now. And the 3 remaining points are that the key enablers of this strategy are all in place and all working today. 
So point number two, our growth engine continues to lead the industry. Point number three, our technology leadership is creating key differentiators in the market. And point number four, our talent management approach is building a motivated workforce to execute our strategy. 
Let me go a little bit deeper. Point number one on strategy. For a year, we've just been heads down and focused on the tasks in front of us, executing on programs, delivering on the synergy case, integrating 2 companies and 2 cultures, writing proposals and yes, each and every day, collecting cash. I am proud of the team's hard work and tremendous accomplishments on all of these fronts. We are stronger today than we were a year ago as a result of the determination, the energy and the creativity of all 18,000 employees who show up to work every day with a passion for our customers' missions. 
In particular, we now have a much better balance sheet and a backlog of new programs that provides us strategic flexibility and growth momentum. Over the last few months, we've taken the time to look beyond the horizon and chart our direction for the next 3 years. It's been a very collaborative effort across both line organizations and leverage teams, with a board both fully engaged and rolling up their sleeves to help. We now have a holistic view of strategy and vision, and our cultures and values are aligned, and we're gaining buy-ins throughout the company. 
Strategy is all about where you compete, how you compete and how you measure success. Our strategy is to drive sustainable industry-leading organic growth across our federal and state local markets through customer intimacy, rapid innovation and an outcome-based experience. Let me unpack this statement a bit. 
Our primary focus is profitably growing the company. We are the most efficient company in our space, and we will remain so, but this is a dramatic shift. We have moved from the legacy mindset of only improving the bottom line by cutting costs to one centered around and devoted to a growth culture. We will measure our success, first and foremost, through revenue growth, which provides better career opportunities for our employees, more solutions that we can provide to our customers and greater returns to our shareholders. 
Next, we will remain focused on our current markets where we have about a 3% market share. The federal government and related state and local and international markets provide plenty of opportunities for us, and the market dynamics are improving after years of government budget cuts. We will support the United States and the vital interest of her allies across the globe. We are well positioned with many of the new administration's priorities, including defense, border security and the critical care for our veterans. 
We will compete through 3 primary differentiators: first, customer intimacy; second, innovation; and third, outcome-based delivery. Our customer intimacy derives from talented teams who deliver flawlessly, who build trust-based relationships with our customers and provide mission and technology thought leadership. We deliver rapid innovation through partnerships, share delivery models and cross-agency capabilities. Our customers are looking to move towards paying for outcomes instead of inputs, and we are the industry leader in delivering outcome-based experiences through developing, bidding and executing the shared delivery methodologies. 
Our mission, vision, strategy and importantly, our culture and values are then encapsulated by our brand of Think Next. Now. This message is one the entire company created and can rally behind, enabling us to approach the market with a unified purpose and direction. It imagines a better future and delivers it today for our customers, our partners and ultimately, all the people our mission has touched. 
 
Point number two, our business development engine continues to rev at high RPMs. We posted our eighth straight quarter with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.0 or greater. In what is typically the slowest quarter for awards, we achieved $1.9 billion in bookings for a book-to-bill ratio of 1.5. Our trailing 12-month book-to-bill ratio was still tracking at 1.3. Our backlog of signed business orders at the end of the quarter was $15.8 billion, which increased 3% year-over-year. I firmly believe that if we continue to post industry-leading book-to-bill rates, we will lead our industry in organic growth, which is our goal. 
The $1.9 billion in awards were rich with new business. 73% of bookings in the quarter were for new business, and our win rate on new business was 46%. Again, well above our target rate of 25%. So far this year, we've won $3.1 billion in new business, ahead of our target run rate of $4 billion each year even though we are just now seeing the full effect of our accelerated bid submissions. 
Our bid pipeline remains robust. At the end of the quarter, we have $12 billion in submits outstanding. Looking only at new business, we had about $5.7 billion awaiting decision, including 15 opportunities that are each greater than $100 million in total value. This quarter's awards showcase how we are combining deep domain knowledge of the customers' mission, expertise in their IT enterprise and next-generation capabilities and partners to deliver compelling solutions for our customers. 
 
Let me highlight just a few of the major wins in the quarter to give you a sense of what I mean. Our largest win was the $744 million award that was in protest at the time of our last call. With that protest resolved in December, we are now supporting the army's Communications-Electronics Command, providing a wide range of mission-essential logistics, maintenance and sustainment work for current and future C4ISR systems around the world in support of this administration's priorities. 
Building on the delivery excellence of our Program Manager, Larry Cropp, our General Manager for this business, Alan Smith, was instrumental in crafting the strategy for this consolidated procurement. We expect our work growing from current revenue levels of $30 million a year to well over $100 million each year as we ramp over the next few quarters. 
 
In another consolidating contract, Kamal Narang led a team that engineered a wonderful technical solution on a $323 million program called HIGLAS to host, operate and maintain the general ledger system for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Our world-class database team has been working on the application side for 5 years, but taking over the infrastructure work was a tall task, one that was perfect for Rebecca Miller, our Civil Group BD lead overseeing the capture. We were able to team well with Oracle to engineer a compelling solution using the Oracle Exadata that was low-risk, innovative and cost-efficient, and improved performance by a factor of 10. On this program, we'll introduce and implement dev op methodologies and potentially migrate the application to a cloud environment. 
 
Final example, we received a new single-award blank purchase agreement -- blanket purchase agreement with $150 million ceiling to help the Department of Commerce reduce costs, enhance customer service quality and prepare for the 2020 Census. Under the leadership of Chris Hegedus, SRA will develop and implement cloud-based services in the areas of acquisition, financial management, human resources and information technology. This is a shared service deal with a foundation and a solution that leverages both ServiceNow and our own Integrated Technology Center in Bossier City, Louisiana. 
 
These wins are largely driven by next-generation thinking enabled by strong technology partnerships, which takes me to my third key point: CSRA works really hard to attain technology leadership. The breadth and the depth of our partnerships with key technology innovators is unmatched because we offer unmatched access to the federal government IT enterprise, and we bring a focus and a passion for technology insertion that will help missions be successful. With a full involvement of our line organizations, we develop and invest in our partner relationships, especially our 7 strategic alliance partners: Amazon Web Services, Cisco, Microsoft, Oracle, Salesforce, SAP and ServiceNow. For example, our recent Greenway submission under Leigh Palmer's leadership with the Intelligence Group leveraged 6 of these strategic partners in the bid and clearly differentiates our technical offering. We are already a premier consulting partner in the AWS partner network. And this quarter, we successfully completed the independent third-party audit to join their elite managed services program. That enables us to deliver added value to cloud solutions by offering proactive monitoring, automation and management of our customers' environments. 
We also recently added Amazon's commercial and Amazon's GovCloud services to the GSA IT Schedule 70, which is the largest most widely used acquisition vehicle across the federal government. These added qualifications and channels will even further our leadership in cloud migration, especially with Paul Nedzbala's Health and Civil Group, whose customers are often the most forward-leaning in adopting next-generation technologies. 
   
Now our other strategic partner in the cloud, Microsoft, we just signed with them a 3-year enterprise agreement to use their products for the Azure cloud platform. We are proud to be a gold partner in the Microsoft Partner Network, and we're now the first government systems integrator to migrate its own workload to the Azure government cloud platform. By investing in ourselves, we minimize risk and then accelerate solutions for our customers as we act as customer zero. 
We believe that the market for Microsoft's cloud services will expand rapidly, especially within the Department of Defense. The DoD just granted level 5 accreditation for Azure and Office 365, making them the only commercial cloud provider at that level of security and trust. Ken Deutsch and his Defense Group team are working hand-in-hand with Microsoft on many large and strategic bids that could be major drivers for both of us in this critical market. Microsoft was also the major sponsor, along with Splunk, of a hackathon that we hosted in December. Led by Sally Sullivan's Homeland Security Group, this hands-on, competition-style training event brought together technologists from across the company to engage in collaborative computing, challenge conventional thinking and solve real-world problems in the cloud and really leverage data analytics, which brings me to my fourth key point: our talent. 
This is the driver behind really improving customer intimacy, earning trust-based relationships and delivering flawless execution. We continue to up our game in hiring, retaining and developing our workforce. In the third quarter, we had more job applicants than we've ever had, and 42% of our new hires are millennials. Our voluntary attrition rate in the quarter was the lowest we've had since going public. Employees are seeing enhanced opportunities through growth, and the culture is evolving in all sorts of positive ways. Our employees like the opportunity for continued technical education, and more than 400 of these employees added new technical and professional certifications in the quarter. 
 
Before I turn it over to Dave, let me briefly address how we're thinking about the market under President Trump's administration. For context, let's keep in mind that we're less than 3 weeks into the new administration, so we're in the very early stages. For example, just 7 members of President Trump's team have been confirmed by the Senate, which means we've only got 1,235 to go. Transitions after 2-term presidents are generally a little chaotic, and they all take time, so I expect industry book-to-bills for the March quarter to be a bit dampened, but all of us remain convinced this is a growth opportunity for the marketplace. We've seen a steady flow of forceful executive orders, tweets and interviews. Nothing has changed our fundamental view that the market for our services and solutions will grow in the coming years. 
The administration has signaled a willingness to engage in deficit spending to fund a strong commitment to the military and the border security. And with the freeze in hiring for nonmilitary government personnel, service contractors stand ready to enable mission success. Given our efficient onshore staffing model, CSRA can be an engine for American job growth, clearly a key priority for President Trump. We may face headwinds in some areas, such as our support for the EPA but on balance, we believe we are well positioned for future growth with this administration. Perhaps most importantly, CSRA should benefit from a more businesslike approach to contracts with more fixed-price contracts and a greater focus on cost efficiency, both major advantages for us. Ultimately, this environment will favor those who are ready to move quickly, who are agile and act like a business, and we're doing that on all cylinders. 
 
Now Dave will provide more detail on the financial results and the forward outlook."
301669938,417875403,1127514,"CSRA Inc., Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Feb 07, 2017",2017-02-07,"Earnings Calls","CSRA Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Larry, and good afternoon, everyone. As Larry said, we had another strong quarter across the board but especially around cash flow, which is the life blood of the company.  Turning to Slide 5. Revenue for the quarter was $1.22 billion, down 3%",1470,"Thanks, Larry, and good afternoon, everyone. As Larry said, we had another strong quarter across the board but especially around cash flow, which is the life blood of the company. 
 
Turning to Slide 5. Revenue for the quarter was $1.22 billion, down 3% sequentially and down 4% from pro forma revenue in the third quarter of fiscal year 2016. The sequential decline was consistent with normal seasonal leave-taking patterns and was in line with our expectations. Our contract mix continues to exhibit a high concentration of fixed-price work, which is a key driver of our profitability. As a percentage of total revenue, 46% was on fixed-price contracts, 21% on time and material contracts and 33% on cost-plus contracts. There were a few unique items impacting the expense and earnings lines, though for the most part, they affected the GAAP treatment, not the adjusted numbers, and we were able to preview most of the larger items on our last call. I'll now walk through these major drivers as I progress through the income statement.
 
First, we extended a voluntary offer to former employees, who participated in qualified pension plans, to receive immediate lump sum payments. Based on participant selections, in the third quarter of fiscal year 2017, we made lump sum payments of $320 million and reduced pension obligations by $333 million, so a net improvement of $13 million in the pension funding status. This roughly 10% change in the overall size of the pension program necessitated a pension plan remeasurement as of December 1, 2016. We recorded a noncash mark-to-market benefit of $101 million in the quarter. We do not project making any meaningful contributions to the pension program in the foreseeable future, and we reduced the GAAP underfunding of the program by about $136 million. With the lower asset base and higher projected interest rate, the remeasurement caused recurring noncash pension income to fall from $24 million in the second quarter to $23 million in the third quarter and a $21 million quarterly run rate thereafter, although this could change again with our usual annual remeasurement in the fourth quarter. 
 
Second, GAAP stock compensation expense during the quarter was $18 million. $14 million of that was a noncash charge from performance-based awards for former SRA shareholders. The performance targets for the awards were met when Providence Equity Partners, formerly SRA's majority shareholder, sold its CSRA holdings after our second quarter earnings call. We were delighted that our existing and new shareholders purchased more than 15 million shares with no visible disruption to the market. Compared to the time of the spin, we believe our investor base is now much more focused on CSRA as a long-term holding.
 
Third, pretax merger and integration costs were $5 million, down $3 million from last quarter. Despite relatively modest EAC adjustments in the quarter, profitability continues to be strong with an EBITDA margin of 17.3%. This is down from last quarter's record margin and consistent with the view that we've laid out for some time that EBITDA margin, as we've defined them, would end up in the low to mid-17% range for FY '17 and over the longer term, land in the 16% to 17% range as we drive top line growth. On a volume basis, adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $211 million. Below EBITDA, the quarterly variances were more muted. We completed the repricing of our term loans, consistent with the plans we laid out on our last call. In connection with the repricing, we incurred a noncash charge of $8 million for a write-off of deferred financing costs in the third quarter. Going forward, the repricing will reduce interest expense by approximately $5 million annually. Excluding the charge, interest expense was $28 million in the quarter, down about $1 million from last quarter. Depreciation and amortization, excluding the intangibles amortization expense associated with SRA's funded contract backlog, was $50 million or $3 million more than last quarter. The intangible's amortization expense associated with SRA's funded contract backlog, which is included in GAAP earnings per share but not adjusted EPS, was $11 million or $5 million less than last quarter, and it will go to 0 in Q4. Our effective tax rate was 37%, which is close to our long-term target rate, but up about 2 percentage points from last quarter. With that, adjusted diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.48, unchanged compared to the third quarter of fiscal year 2016.
 
Now turning to Slide 6. Cash flow performance was our best as a public company. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $227 million, and free cash flow was $191 million or more than 2.4x adjusted net income. 
 
My thanks go out to our entire team of invoicers and collectors for their hard work in generating this tremendous outcome for the company. In addition, we did not make a $30 million intellectual property maintenance payment to see CSC in the third quarter as anticipated under our original separation agreement. We're currently in discussions with CSC regarding a variety of matters related to our separation agreements. Note that during the question-and-answer period, we will not take questions regarding these discussions with CSC. 
 
Days sales outstanding were 57 days in Q3, which is unchanged from last quarter. We will look to shave a couple of days off DSOs over time through continued strong collections performance. We followed our balanced capital allocation program in Q3, deploying $50 million to pay down debt and $38 million to return to shareholders $17 million in dividends and $21 million in share repurchases. As of December 30, 2016, we had $162 million in cash and cash equivalents and $2.6 billion in debt. 
 
Now on to the forward outlook. As we approach the end of our fiscal year, we have modified guidance as shown on Slide 7. Specifically, we now project fiscal year 2017 revenue between $4.96 billion and $5.01 billion. Including the lower noncash pension income, we project adjusted EBITDA between $857 million and $867 million and adjusted diluted earnings per share between $1.98 and $2.02. Our free cash flow guidance remains between $300 million and $350 million. For adjusted EPS, specifically, this guidance equates to fourth quarter performance of $0.44 to $0.48. Compared to our original guidance ranges, we expect to land near the low end for revenue and adjusted EBITDA, and near the high end of our adjusted earnings per share range. The pension remeasurement has lowered our FY '17 adjusted EBITDA guidance by about $4 million and our adjusted EPS guidance by about $0.02. 
 
Our fourth quarter outlook reflects slow startups on some large programs, such as the OPM background investigation contract and the large army C4ISR program as well as potential interruptions on current contracts at a few agencies and fewer Q4 awards as a result of the administration transition, but it does not change our fundamental view of an improving picture for CSRA. It takes some time for new wins to reach their ultimate revenue run rate, especially during an administration change. When they do, our growth will surely follow. 
 
We continue to see an opportunity for FY '18 to produce organic growth in line with our long-term model of 2% to 3%. And the EBITDA margin, slightly below current levels but on the high side of our long-term model of 16% to 17%, including pension income, which brings me to my closing point. 
As we introduce guidance for fiscal year 2018 on our call in May, we plan to exclude recurring pension income from adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS. Pension income will still be in our GAAP numbers and the adjusted numbers defined in our credit agreement. Many of you have requested that we remove pension income from what we report in our non-GAAP measures, and we want to enhance the comparability with our peers' results and limit confusion for potential new investors. As we've said repeatedly, pension income is noncash in nature and should not change the fundamental valuation of the company. By way of comparison, our updated fiscal year 2017 guidance assumes $92 million of pension income within adjusted EBITDA, which equates to about $0.35 of adjusted diluted earnings per share. So if we hit the midpoint of our guidance, fiscal year 2017 performance, excluding pension, would be $769 million for adjusted EBITDA and $1.65 for adjusted earnings per share, which should be the basis of comparison when we introduce FY '18 guidance. Another point of consideration is our long-term EBITDA margin target, which translates to 14% to 15%, excluding pension income. Naturally, there would be no impact to our free cash flow guidance. We hope that signaling this change now will help all of our analysts and investors prepare their models going forward and avoid any confusion.

The second was working through the protest for the C4ISR work and getting through that and doing the ramp, both are slowed a bit relative to what we thought the planning would be. There is a little bit of noise. There was a week where EPA was freezing contracts on a Monday and then freeing them up by a Friday. We put that in the category of ""Yes, we had administration for 8 years, and there's always going to be growth pains."" The good news is they didn't steal the Ts off the typewriter, so I think we're in better shape than the last one."

So obviously, we're 3 months away from providing our '18 guidance. I think you've heard the right signals on our call today in terms of what we're seeing today, which is, in our scripted comments, the fact that we see revenue inflecting toward growth. So far this year, we've been hovering in that minus 4% to minus 5% range, Q3 now a little better than minus 4% and our Q4 guidance, roughly minus 1% to minus 5%. So you're seeing that gradual inflection. We see, as we pointed out earlier, the opportunity for our growth in '18 to reach the long-term range of 2% to 3% that we've mentioned. That will take the form of gradual sequential growth over time. I think compares got a little bit easier when we get into Q1, and that will certainly help as well. At the end of the day, it's about the pace of new business award activity continuing, the really strong book-to-bills that we've produced over the last 3, 4 quarters continuing into FY '18 and our ability to ramp up each of those as well as we have today. So on the bottom line, as you pointed out, we've got confidence that as revenue inflects toward growth that, that should lead toward earnings growth as well. Even if in a year where EBITDA is flat, we should see EPS growing. If EBITDA grows, we should see grow -- EPS grow even faster. So that's the kind of the dynamic that we should look at going forward, given that interest in other lines between EBITDA and EPS should be helpful."

We're excited to finish this year on a strong note and even more excited about what's to come in fiscal year 2018. The fourth quarter was highlighted by superb earnings, with adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS both well ahead of plan, and we again had robust bookings. These achievements are the direct result of building brilliant teams, something I've been talking about since we launched. On earnings, it's all about program execution by dedicated project teams, working tough technical challenges and being aligned to around delivering shareholder value is a really important strategic imperative. The bookings are delivered by really good proposal teams that bring together customer insight and technology understanding to create innovative solutions under really tight time pressure. Our people really make a positive difference each and every single day. I simply couldn't be prouder of the efforts of the entire company, and I thank every employee for all their hard work this last year.
Most importantly, the successes of last year give us confidence that we'll achieve our organic growth in revenue in fiscal year 2018 while also maintaining strong profitability and free cash flow generation. With our first full fiscal year now on the books, I want to take a fresh look at where we are on the 3 major points of our investment thesis that we laid out when we formed. Specifically, I'll address our views: first, on our end market; second, revenue growth profile; and then third, our capital allocation. I'll then ask Dave to speak to our guidance for next year and our long-term earnings growth outlook. 
First, our view of the market. We remain focused on the federal government and the state and local and international government markets related to it. At the time of the spin, our view was that the federal spending would grow very slowly, maybe 1% or so per year. We now expect a slight improvement in the level of spend, and we're more optimistic about the long-term market opportunity for CSRA. We are well-positioned with many of the new administration's priorities, including defense, border security, cybersecurity, care for our veterans and driving efficiencies through technology and shared service delivery. To that point, we won major new business in FY '17 in each of these areas that are so important to the Trump administration. Earlier this month, President Trump signed into law a $1.1 trillion spending bill to fund the government through September, the end of its fiscal year.
The budget adds $15 billion towards defense and $1.5 billion for border security. Noticeably absent were the $18 billion in cuts for domestic spending that the administration had initially proposed, with discretionary budgets for the civil agencies now being generally flat. This is positive for CSRA and it's positive for our industry. Certainty around budgets and increased spending levels should lead to stronger-than-usual award activity in the June and September quarters. Our customers have relatively little time to put money under contract, so we are proactively reaching out to our customers with white papers and solutions that meet their mission needs and using existing contracts and available contract sealing to cover. The quick-turn nature of the services market makes it the primary beneficiary in an environment of this type.
Just yesterday, the administration published its budget request for government fiscal year 2018, which generally follows the outline of the skinny budget laid out in March. I see the FY '17 funding negotiations as a blueprint for the way forward in FY '18. The administration has called for increases in funding for its priorities, and Congress will likely work compromises that address portions of those priorities without serious cuts to other agencies. We'll continue to see dramatic headlines and dramatic policy statements, but the Congress has turned to governing, and we expect the budgets won't change as dramatically as the headlines might suggest. We'll probably begin fiscal year 2018 with a little drama, given how much work needs to be done. I expect that we will begin the year with a continuing resolution but will be off of a higher FY '17 budget, and we do not expect a government shut down. At some point in the fall, Congress will also have to increase the debt ceiling and reach another spending compromise to avoid the sequestration caps, but there are strong bipartisan consensus around both of these actions. In total, compared to the time of the spin, we expect a more positive macro environment for CSRA in our industry with more budget certainty, increased spending on national security and then protected budgets in the civil agencies as we see the Senate engage in the process, which brings me to the second point, our revenue outlook. At the spin, we spoke of long-term organic revenue growth rate of about 2% to 3%, meeting a point or 2 better than the market growth rate.
We've been working through some of the churn that was built in at the spin, and portions of that will continue, but we are forecasting organic growth in 2018, and we're now more bullish on the long-term growth outlook than we've ever been. Business development is the foundation for growth, and and his BD team working hand-in-hand with our group leaders have been putting up strong numbers all year. In the fourth quarter, we booked $1.3 billion in awards for a book-to-bill ratio of 1.1x, our ninth straight quarter with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.0 or greater. Through the hard work of our go-to-market teams over the past year, we were able to overcome the slowdowns from administration transition and budget uncertainty that we have previewed on the last call. 56% of the bookings in the quarter were for new business, and our win rate on new business was once again above our target rate of 25%. Over the full year, we booked $6.9 billion in awards for a book-to-bill ratio of 1.4x. Moreover, we won $3.8 billion in new business during the year, which should yield north of $700 million in annual revenue when we're fully ramped.
Bidding remains at a furious pace. At the end of the quarter, we had $11 billion in submits outstanding. In the first quarter, we expect to submit another $7 billion in bids, and we could have about $6 billion adjudicated. Looking only at new business, we have about $6.5 billion waiting decision, including 16 opportunities that are each greater than $100 million in total value.
This quarter, our 2 largest new awards were with the Environmental Protection Agency. The first is a $266 million 5-year contract to develop and operate EPA's infrastructure and application platforms. Key tasks on this effort include data center management, application hosting, application deployment and maintenance, geospatial service support, network security, cybersecurity and cloud computing.
The second win is a 5-year $58 million contract to provision, maintain and support the EPA's high-performance computing environment as well as its scientific visualization hardware and software. who lead our science and engineering business within the civil group has done great job in positioning us with the EPA under its changing mandate. We get many questions from investors about the potential for reductions to our EPA business. While we do have some policy related work that could be at risk, most of our work with the EPA and throughout our portfolio is around enterprise and next-generation IT. In fact, these 2 new contracts are both takeaways and are essential to agency operations, plus IT an enabler for cost savings. We expect to grow our EPA business based on the compelling value proposition that we offer. Competitive excellence generally trumps market pressure. A key part of our revenue growth outlook derives from adoption of next-generation IT across government. As the technology bridge to the government, we leverage our alliance in emerging technology partners investments in R&D and next-generation products to improve our clients' mission, productivity and cost efficiency. We have master service agreements in place with both Microsoft and Amazon Web Services as well as the capability to resell Azure and AWS services on GSA schedule 70. This reach allows us to select the right solution at the right cost point that meets our clients' missions. Another developing growth area centers around background investigation, insider threat and continuous monitoring. This is an area that's ripe for technology innovation. In addition to our recent OPM win, which is ramping nicely, we are performing work in this area in all 4 of our groups, and we recently received a new award in our intelligence group with more awards expected shortly. The demand for these services is massive as evidenced by the number of our peer companies who cited the shortage of cleared staff most recent earnings calls. I believe that CSRA is the company that can best attack this problem and address the huge market opportunity with a technology edge. We're also seeing a slight pickup in downrange activity, consistent with the increase in defense spending and the current global threat environment. We will manage our risk well as we support our defense and intelligence customers in the theater. Across all of our markets, we're seeing more large and consolidated opportunities. We're focusing more of our resources on these larger deals, which generally have less competition and higher returns. Given our scale, there's really no services contract that is too large for us to bid, to win and to execute. Last year, we had 2 adjudications north of $500 million in contract value for new work, and we won both of them. We are currently targeting 16 bids for new work in excess of $500 million each that the government is expected to award in fiscal year 2018, 4 of which are already pending. Our team is truly energized about the investments in these opportunities, and we expect to win more than our fair share of these megadeals and further accelerate revenue growth as we look at FY '18. Revenue growth translates into more opportunities for our people, enhancing our culture, improving morale and enabling investments in continuous learning and development. We continue to have success in staffing as we pivot towards growth. In the fourth quarter, we had our highest number of hires to date, including large numbers of talented millennials, attracted to next-generation technology. We've grown headcount over our last 2 quarters and expect that trend to strengthen in fiscal year 2018.
So fiscal year 2017 set the foundation for our return to growth. Every quarter, we got a little better in year-over-year revenue compares, and we won substantial new business. In fiscal year 2018, we expect to be in our 2% to 3% organic growth target range. And looking further out when we win our Greenway and TSA impact recompetes and our share of new megadeals, we have the opportunity to do even better than our original growth target. In terms of competitive positioning, I wouldn't trade places with any company in our industry today.
That brings me to my third and final point. I see allocating capital as one of our key strategic responsibilities. At the spin, we had $3.1 billion in total debt, and we laid out at that time a balanced capital allocation plan of 50% debt paydown, 40% shareholder return and 10% M&A. Since the spin, we actually spent 79% on debt paydown and 21% on shareholder returns with no M&A. Over the next few years, we'll likely take down debt a little bit slowly, gradually dedicating less than half of our free cash flow towards debt reduction and bringing our capital allocation more into balance.
Within that context, I'm pleased to report that we're signed a definitive agreement on our first acquisition as a public company.  NES Associates will bring us strong competitive advantage as we compete for large network opportunities in upcoming years. Another example of how we live our tagline Think Next. Now.
Though small, NES provides a very specific expertise in defense telecom, infrastructure and applications architecture as well as implementation services. NES has hands-on expertise with nearly every military base network infrastructure, both and and this experience can directly translate to other security sensitive customers such as Homeland Security as well as the intelligence community. NES founder and CEO Andy Gomer has built an outstanding company and will be an important part of our network business going forward. Andy is a real roll-up-your-sleeves leader acting as chief network engineer and working directly with customers to design high-performance, low-cost network solutions. There's a great team at NES. We can't wait to have all of the employees join us, and we're looking forward to competing together. We expect this acquisition to be slightly accretive to our fiscal year 2018 results, but the real upside potential is in driving organic revenue growth. Deeply understanding the network that connects the mission to compute will enable us to eliminate many of the barriers to adoption of next-generation IT. Digital transformation efforts rely on the availability of secure high-bandwidth highly resilient and low-latency network infrastructures that can enable hyperscale functionality accelerate cloud operating models. Becoming this network transformation leader will accelerate the adoption of CSRA's next-gen digital solution offerings. Even more simply, we believe the key capabilities, the innovations and the past performance from NES will significantly improve our win probability on several very large pursuits across the company beginning almost immediately.
Now Dave will provide more detail on our financial results and our forward outlook."

As Larry said, we had a strong quarter across the board and completed a very productive year in the life of our company. We met Q4 consensus for revenue and significantly exceeded our plan and expectations for profitability. I'm pleased to post such strong earnings growth in the quarter and the year, underscoring CSRA's commitment to long-term earnings growth.
Turning to Slide 5, let me hit the high points of the income statement. Revenue for the quarter was $1.25 billion or $8 million above the midpoint of guidance given on the last call. Quarterly revenue was up 3% sequentially and down 3% from revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016. The year-over-year decline was our lowest going back several years. And in every quarter this year, the year-over-year revenue comparisons improved.
Revenue for fiscal year 2017 was $5.0 billion, down 4% compared to pro forma revenue for fiscal year 2016.
Our contract mix was relatively unchanged with 45% of quarterly revenue on fixed price contracts, 21% on time and material contracts and 34% on cost-plus contracts. 
As I walk through the earnings performance, please keep in mind that as laid out in our Form 8-K filing on April 10, 2017, we've taken recurring pension income out of adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets out of adjusted EPS. For reference, fiscal year 2017 included $92 million of recurring pension income and $50 million of acquisition-related intangibles amortization, excluding the amortization related to SRA contract backlog. The Q4 amounts were $20 million and $11 million, respectively.
Adjusted EBITDA was $207 million for the quarter, which was up 5% year-over-year. The adjusted EBITDA margin of 16.5% was consistent with our high watermark in Q2, driven by strong contract performance and disciplined cost management as well as some non-recurring pickups. You'll see in the 10-K tomorrow that net EAC adjustments on fixed price contracts for the quarter totaled $8 million, which was several million dollars above our expectation and our view of the sustainable performance level. In addition, SG&A in the fourth quarter was several million dollars lower than our sustainable level due to some onetime offsets. For the year, adjusted EBITDA margin was 15.9%, an improvement of 80 basis points compared to fiscal year 2016 and substantially above our long-term margin target, which I'll address later in my remarks.
Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.49, up 7% compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016. Our effective tax rate in the quarter was 36%, which was down about 3 percentage points from the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016. Our tax rate for the full year was also 36%, which is 1 to 2 points below our expected long-term rate. For the full year, adjusted diluted EPS was $1.91, which was up 10% compared to fiscal year 2016. Using our previous definitions, adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter would've been $227 million or $18 million above the top end of guidance from the last call. Similarly, adjusted diluted EPS would have been $0.54 or about $0.06 above the top end of our prior guidance. Beyond the pension income and acquisition amortization that I noted earlier, key Q4 GAAP expenses included $16 million from the mark-to-market of the pension plans and $72 million in separation and merger costs, the majority of which was a $61 million expense related to our IP matters agreement with CSC.
Now turning to Slide 6. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $50 million, and free cash flow was $62 million. Free cash flow exceeded operating cash flow because the IP Matters Agreement payment is excluded from free cash flow as a non-recurring separation-related payment. Days sales outstanding were 54 days, which is an improvement of 1 day compared to the third quarter of 2017. In Q4, we deployed $20 million to pay down debt and $16 million in dividends. As of March 31, 2017, we had $126 million in cash and cash equivalents and $2.6 billion in debt.
On to the forward outlook. With a year of strong bookings success, we are forecasting organic growth in revenue and free cash flow and robust performance in adjusted EBITDA and adjusted diluted earnings per share. As shown on Slide 7, we now project fiscal year 2018 revenue between $5 billion and $5.2 billion, adjusted EBITDA between $770 million and $800 million, adjusted diluted earnings per share between $1.88 and $2 and free cash flow between $330 million and $380 million. At the mid points of guidance, revenue growth would be 2.1% with adjusted EBITDA margin of 15.4%. Earnings would be relatively flat as a result of significant outperformance in fiscal year 2017, especially in the fourth quarter. Compared to the midpoint of our prior guidance for FY '17, which better reflect sustainable profitability, FY '18 guidance implies EPS growth for the year of about 5%. Free cash flow is up 8% at the midpoint of our guidance, driven in part by the $25 million reimbursement from the 2013 divestiture of assets that we referenced on our Q2 call. We expect to receive that payment in the first half of our fiscal year.
In terms of revenue visibility, at the midpoint of guidance, we expect that about 85% of our revenue would come from existing business. Of the remaining 15%, over half would come from recompetes with the remainder from new business. On the recompetes and new business, we expect profitability to generally be below our corporate average for the first year or so and then to rise as we complete startup activities, introduce innovation and deliver more efficiently. The expectation that we built into our guidance for fiscal year 2018 for new business revenue is lower than in the guidance range we originally gave for fiscal year 2017 even though our new business momentum is significantly higher today than a year ago.
We're still ramping up some of our larger FY '17 wins so we expect quarterly revenue and earnings to step up through the year with the first quarter being slightly below the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017, driven by the continued wind-downs of our STRATCOM and LMP contracts and some equipment purchases that were pulled forward into the fourth quarter. The year-over-year comparison for the first quarter will also be our toughest as a result of the pickup on a DHS program that were discussed on our prior Q1 call. Looking over the rest of the year, we see strong year-over-year performance in the back half of the year, leading to organic growth of -- for the full year. Margins have stayed relatively confident over the course of the year.
Let me touch on some of the key assumptions underlying our guidance. First, we're assuming that we win both of our major recompetes. On that topic, the timing on Greenway seems to be holding around late summer or early fall, but the decision on TSA impact has pushed out, and we're still awaiting the award announcement. On all other recompetes, we're assuming win rates consistent with our experience in fiscal year 2017. Second, we're assuming adjudications of new work follow the time lines we've seen over the last 2 years so we're building in a reasonable amount of time for normal delays and protests. We're also assuming a 25% win rate on new business though we were at 35% for last year.
And third, we assume that we close on the NES acquisition in the second quarter. The acquisition contributes relatively little to our guidance, assuming no top line synergies. If we're able to leverage NES into some large program wins, we'll update guidance as appropriate. 
To close my section, I'll pick up on what Larry started and provide an update on our views in adjusted EBITDA margins and adjusted EPS growth. Our long-term adjusted EBITDA margin target at the time of the spin was 16% to 17%. Of that, pension accounts for about 180 basis points. So on an apples-to-apples basis, we're currently guiding for our margins to be above our long-term target again in FY '18. As you look to the future, we will balance our demonstrated commitment to sustain high margins with a rising likelihood of acquiring companies and winning large programs to grow our earnings. We are firmly committed to both growing our EBITDA and delivering industry-leading profitability. All other factors that Larry and I discuss today support our long-term objective of high single-digit earnings growth. Compared to the original model, relatively more of that will come from revenue growth and capital deployment, which is well supported by our business development trends and the opportunities we see on the M&A front.
Now back to Larry for some closing remarks."

As we stood at this company, there were several items that were mandated by the complex nature of the transaction. In each case, we've taken concrete actions to improve them. We renegotiated the terms of our original IP Matters Agreement with CSC, eliminating $55 million of future payments and acquiring the rights to certain technologies. We expect to complete the sale and leaseback transaction in FY '18 with our corporate headquarters facility that will provide a small influx of cash and upgrade our employees' work environment. We've substantially lowered our debt load so that our balance sheet can be used to our advantage. We've lowered and, in many cases, fixed the interest rate in our debt to simultaneously reduce expense and risk. We changed some of our non-GAAP measures so that the cash attributes of the business are more transparent and comparable to our peers.
We've lowered our unfunded pension liability by offering and paying lump sum buyout packages for eligible participants.
All of these financial management moves are in addition to the primary thrust of the company, including deepening our partnerships with our key strategic partners like AWS and Microsoft, forging new relationships with emerging technology companies and developing new solutions that can be sold across our customer base. You can count on this team to relentlessly address the elements that are in our control for the benefit of shareholders including making a market for next-generation IT, aggressively targeting new work, appropriately controlling our costs and actively investing in talent.
With that, operator, we're now ready to take questions."

We're excited to finish this year on a strong note and even more excited about what's to come in fiscal year 2018. The fourth quarter was highlighted by superb earnings, with adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS both well ahead of plan, and we, again, had robust bookings. These achievements are the direct result of building brilliant teams, something I've been talking about since we launched. 
On earnings, it's all about program execution by dedicated project teams, working tough technical challenges and being aligned to around delivering shareholder value is a really important strategic imperative. The bookings are delivered by really good proposal teams that bring together customer insight and technology understanding to create innovative solutions under really tight time pressure. Our people really make a positive difference each and every single day. I simply couldn't be prouder of the efforts of the entire company, and I thank every employee for all their hard work this last year.
Most importantly, the successes of last year give us confidence that we'll achieve organic growth in revenue in fiscal year 2018 while also maintaining strong profitability and free cash flow generation. 
With our first full fiscal year now on the books, I want to take a fresh look at where we are on the 3 major points of our investment thesis that we laid out when we formed. Specifically, I'll address our views: first, on our end market; second, revenue growth profile; and then third, our capital allocation. I'll then ask Dave to speak to our guidance for next year and our long-term earnings growth outlook. 
First, our view of the market. We remain focused on the federal government and the state and local and international government markets related to it. At the time of the spin, our view was that the federal spending would grow very slowly, maybe 1% or so per year. We now expect a slight improvement in the level of spend, and we're more optimistic about the long-term market opportunity for CSRA. We're well positioned with many of the new administration's priorities, including defense, border security, cybersecurity, care for our veterans and driving efficiencies through technology and shared service delivery. To that point, we won major new business in FY '17 in each of these areas that are so important to the Trump administration. 
Earlier this month, President Trump signed into law a $1.1 trillion spending bill to fund the government through September, the end of its fiscal year. The budget adds $15 billion towards defense and $1.5 billion for border security. Noticeably absent were the $18 billion in cuts for domestic spending that the administration had initially proposed, with discretionary budgets for the civil agencies now being generally flat. This is positive for CSRA and it's positive for our industry. 
Certainty around budgets and increased spending levels should lead to stronger-than-usual award activity in the June and September quarters. Our customers have relatively little time to put money under contract, so we are proactively reaching out to our customers with white papers and solutions that meet their mission needs and using existing contracts and available contract sealing to cover. The quick-turn nature of the services market makes it the primary beneficiary in an environment of this type.
Just yesterday, the administration published its budget request for government fiscal year 2018, which generally follows the outline of the skinny budget laid out in March. I see the FY '17 funding negotiations as a blueprint for the way forward in FY '18. The administration has called for increases in funding for its priorities, and Congress will likely work compromises that address portions of those priorities without serious cuts to other agencies. We'll continue to see dramatic headlines and dramatic policy statements, but the Congress has turned to governing, and we expect the budgets won't change as dramatically as the headlines might suggest. 
We'll probably begin fiscal year 2018 with a little drama given how much work needs to be done. I expect that we will begin the year with a continuing resolution but will be off of a higher FY '17 budget and we do not expect a government shutdown. At some point in the fall, Congress will also have to increase the debt ceiling and reach another spending compromise to avoid the sequestration caps, but there are strong bipartisan consensus around both of these actions. 
In total, compared to the time of the spin, we expect a more positive macro environment for CSRA in our industry, with more budget certainty, increased spending on national security and then protected budgets in the civil agencies as we see the Senate engage in the process, which brings me to the second point, our revenue outlook. 
At the spin, we spoke of long-term organic revenue growth rate of about 2% to 3%, meeting a point or 2 better than the market growth rate. We've been working through some of the churn that was built in at the spin and portions of that will continue, but we are forecasting organic growth in 2018 and we're now more bullish on the long-term growth outlook than we've ever been. 
Business development is the foundation for growth, and George Batsakis and his BD team, working hand-in-hand with our group leaders, have been putting up strong numbers all year. In the fourth quarter, we booked $1.3 billion in awards for a book-to-bill ratio of 1.1x, our ninth straight quarter with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.0 or greater. 
Through the hard work of our go-to-market teams over the past year, we were able to overcome the slowdowns from administration transition and budget uncertainty that we had previewed on the last call. 56% of the bookings in the quarter were for new business, and our win rate on new business was once again above our target rate of 25%. Over the full year, we booked $6.9 billion in awards for a book-to-bill ratio of 1.4x. Moreover, we won $3.8 billion in new business during the year, which should yield north of $700 million in annual revenue when we're fully ramped.
Bidding remains at a furious pace. At the end of the quarter, we had $11 billion in submits outstanding. In the first quarter, we expect to submit another $7 billion in bids and we could have about $6 billion adjudicated. Looking only at new business, we have about $6.5 billion awaiting decision, including 16 opportunities that are each greater than $100 million in total value. 
This quarter, our 2 largest new awards were with the Environmental Protection Agency. The first is a $266 million 5-year contract to develop and operate the EPA's infrastructure and application platforms. Key tasks on this effort include data center management, application hosting, application deployment and maintenance, geospatial service support, network security, cybersecurity and cloud computing.
The second win is a 5-year $58 million contract to provision, maintain and support the EPA's high-performance computing environment as well as its scientific visualization hardware and software. Kevin Connell, who leads our science and engineering business within the civil group, has done a great job in positioning us with the EPA under its changing mandate. 
We get many questions from investors about the potential for reductions to our EPA business. While we do have some policy-related work that could be at risk, most of our work with the EPA and throughout our portfolio is around enterprise and next-generation IT. In fact, these 2 new contracts are both takeaways and are essential to agency operations, plus IT is seen as an enabler for cost savings. 
We expect to grow our EPA business based on the compelling value proposition that we offer. Competitive excellence generally trumps market pressure. 
A key part of our revenue growth outlook derives from adoption of next-generation IT across government. As the technology bridge to the government, we leverage our alliance in emerging technology partners' investments in R&D and next-generation products to improve our clients' mission, productivity and cost efficiency. We have master service agreements in place with both Microsoft and Amazon Web Services as well as the capability to resell Azure and AWS services on GSA schedule 70. This reach allows us to select the right solution at the right cost point that meets our clients' missions. 
Another developing growth area centers around background investigation, insider threat and continuous monitoring. This is an area that is ripe for technology innovation. In addition to our recent OPM win, which is ramping nicely, we are performing work in this area in all 4 of our groups, and we recently received a new award in our intelligence group with more awards expected shortly. The demand for these services is massive, as evidenced by the number of our peer companies who cited the shortage of cleared staff on their most recent earnings calls. I believe that CSRA is the company that can best attack this problem and address the huge market opportunity with a technology edge. 
We're also seeing a slight pickup in downrange activity, consistent with the increase in defense spending and the current global threat environment. We will manage our risk well as we support our defense and intelligence customers in the theater. 
Across all of our markets, we're seeing more large and consolidated opportunities. We're focusing more of our resources on these larger deals, which generally have less competition and higher returns. Given our scale, there's really no services contract that is too large for us to bid, to win and to execute. 
Last year, we had 2 adjudications north of $500 million in contract value for new work and we won both of them. We are currently targeting 16 bids for new work in excess of $500 million each that the government is expected to award in fiscal year 2018, 4 of which are already pending. Our team is truly energized about the investments in these opportunities, and we expect to win more than our fair share of these megadeals and further accelerate revenue growth as we look at FY '18. 
Revenue growth translates into more opportunities for our people, enhancing our culture, improving morale and enabling investments in continuous learning and development. We continue to have success in staffing as we pivot towards growth. In the fourth quarter, we had a highest number of hires to date, including large numbers of talented millennials attracted to next-generation technology. We've grown headcount over our last 2 quarters and expect that trend to strengthen in fiscal year 2018.
So fiscal year 2017 set the foundation for our return to growth. Every quarter, we got a little better in year-over-year revenue compares and we won substantial new business. In fiscal year 2018, we expect to be in our 2% to 3% organic growth target range. And looking further out when we win our Greenway and TSA impact recompetes and our share of new megadeals, we have the opportunity to do even better than our original growth target. In terms of competitive positioning, I wouldn't trade places with any company in our industry today.
That brings me to my third and final point. I see allocating capital as one of our key strategic responsibilities. At the spin, we had $3.1 billion in total debt and we laid out at that time a balanced capital allocation plan of 50% debt paydown, 40% shareholder return and 10% M&A. Since the spin, we actually spent 79% on debt paydown and 21% on shareholder returns with no M&A. Over the next few years, we'll likely take down debt a little bit slowly, gradually dedicating less than half of our free cash flow towards debt reduction and bringing our capital allocation more into balance.
Within that context, I'm pleased to report that we're -- signed a definitive agreement on our first acquisition as a public company. NES Associates will bring us strong competitive advantage as we compete for large network opportunities in upcoming years, another example of how we live our tagline Think next. Now.
Though small, NES provides very specific expertise in defense telecom, infrastructure and applications architecture as well as implementation services. NES has hands-on expertise with nearly every military base network infrastructure, both CONUS and OCONUS, and this experience can directly translate to other security-sensitive customers, such as Homeland Security as well as the intelligence community. 
NES Founder and CEO Andy Gomer has built an outstanding company and will be an important part of our network business going forward. Andy is a real roll-up-your-sleeves leader, acting as chief network engineer and working directly with customers to design high-performance, low-cost network solutions. 
There's a great team at NES. We can't wait to have all of the employees join us, and we're looking forward to competing together. 
We expect this acquisition to be slightly accretive to our fiscal year 2018 results, but the real upside potential is in driving organic revenue growth. 
Deeply understanding the network that connects the mission to compute will enable us to eliminate many of the barriers to adoption of next-generation IT. Digital transformation efforts rely on the availability of secure, high-bandwidth highly resilient and low-latency network infrastructures that can enable hyperscale functionality to accelerate cloud operating models. Becoming this network-transformation leader will accelerate the adoption of CSRA's next-gen digital solution offerings. Even more simply, we believe the key capabilities, the innovations and the past performance from NES will significantly improve our win probability on several very large pursuits across the company beginning almost immediately.
Now Dave will provide more detail on our financial results and our forward outlook."

As Larry said, we had a strong quarter across the board and completed a very productive year in the life of our company. We met Q4 consensus for revenue and significantly exceeded our plan and expectations for",1459,"Thanks, Larry, and good afternoon, everyone. As Larry said, we had a strong quarter across the board and completed a very productive year in the life of our company. We met Q4 consensus for revenue and significantly exceeded our plan and expectations for profitability. I'm pleased to post such strong earnings growth in the quarter and the year, underscoring CSRA's commitment to long-term earnings growth.
Turning to Slide 5, let me hit the high points of the income statement. Revenue for the quarter was $1.25 billion or $8 million above the midpoint of guidance given on the last call. Quarterly revenue was up 3% sequentially and down 3% from revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016. The year-over-year decline was our lowest, going back several years. And in every quarter this year, the year-over-year revenue comparisons improved.
Revenue for fiscal year 2017 was $5.0 billion, down 4% compared to pro forma revenue for fiscal year 2016.
Our contract mix was relatively unchanged, with 45% of quarterly revenue on fixed-price contracts, 21% on time and material contracts and 34% on cost-plus contracts. 
As I walk through the earnings performance, please keep in mind that as laid out in our Form 8-K filing on April 10, 2017, we've taken recurring pension income out of adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets out of adjusted EPS. 
For reference, fiscal year 2017 included $92 million of recurring pension income and $50 million of acquisition-related intangibles amortization, excluding the amortization related to SRA contract backlog. The Q4 amounts were $20 million and $11 million, respectively.
Adjusted EBITDA was $207 million for the quarter, which was up 5% year-over-year. The adjusted EBITDA margin of 16.5% was consistent with our high watermark in Q2, driven by strong contract performance and disciplined cost management as well as some non-recurring pickups. 
You'll see in the 10-K tomorrow that net EAC adjustments on fixed-price contracts for the quarter totaled $8 million, which was several million dollars above our expectation and our view of the sustainable performance level. In addition, SG&A in the fourth quarter was several million dollars lower than our sustainable level due to some onetime offsets. 
For the year, adjusted EBITDA margin was 15.9%, an improvement of 80 basis points compared to fiscal year 2016 and substantially above our long-term margin target, which I'll address later in my remarks.
Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.49, up 7% compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016. 
Our effective tax rate in the quarter was 36%, which was down about 3 percentage points from the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016. Our tax rate for the full year was also 36%, which is 1 to 2 points below our expected long-term rate. 
For the full year, adjusted diluted EPS was $1.91, which was up 10% compared to fiscal year 2016. 
Using our previous definitions, adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter would've been $227 million or $18 million above the top end of guidance from the last call. Similarly, adjusted diluted EPS would have been $0.54 or about $0.06 above the top end of our prior guidance. 
Beyond the pension income and acquisition amortization that I noted earlier, key Q4 GAAP expenses included $16 million from the mark-to-market of the pension plans and $72 million in separation and merger costs, the majority of which was a $61 million expense related to our IP Matters Agreement with CSC.
Now turning to Slide 6. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $50 million, and free cash flow was $62 million. Free cash flow exceeded operating cash flow because the IP Matters Agreement payment is excluded from free cash flow as a non-recurring separation-related payment. 
Days sales outstanding were 54 days, which is an improvement of 1 day compared to the third quarter of 2017. 
In Q4, we deployed $20 million to pay down debt and $16 million in dividends. 
As of March 31, 2017, we had $126 million in cash and cash equivalents and $2.6 billion in debt.
On to the forward outlook. With a year of strong bookings success, we are forecasting organic growth in revenue and free cash flow and robust performance in adjusted EBITDA and adjusted diluted earnings per share. 
As shown on Slide 7, we now project fiscal year 2018 revenue between $5 billion and $5.2 billion, adjusted EBITDA between $770 million and $800 million, adjusted diluted earnings per share between $1.88 and $2 and free cash flow between $330 million and $380 million. 
At the midpoint of guidance, revenue growth would be 2.1% with adjusted EBITDA margin of 15.4%. Earnings would be relatively flat as the result of significant outperformance in fiscal year 2017, especially in the fourth quarter. Compared to the midpoint of our prior guidance for FY '17, which better reflects sustainable profitability, FY '18 guidance implies EPS growth for the year of about 5%. Free cash flow is up 8% at the midpoint of our guidance, driven in part by the $25 million reimbursement from the 2013 divestiture of assets that we referenced on our Q2 call. We expect to receive that payment in the first half of our fiscal year.
In terms of revenue visibility, at the midpoint of guidance, we expect that about 85% of our revenue would come from existing business. Of the remaining 15%, over half would come from recompetes with the remainder from new business. 
On the recompetes and new business, we expect profitability to generally be below our corporate average for the first year or so and then to rise as we complete startup activities, introduce innovation and deliver more efficiently. 
The expectation that we've built into our guidance for fiscal year 2018 for new business revenue is lower than in the guidance range we originally gave for fiscal year 2017 even though our new business momentum is significantly higher today than a year ago.
We're still ramping up some of our larger FY '17 wins, so we expect quarterly revenue and earnings to step up through the year, with the first quarter being slightly below the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017, driven by the continued wind-downs of our STRATCOM and LMP contracts and some equipment purchases that were pulled forward into the fourth quarter. The year-over-year comparison for the first quarter will also be our toughest as a result of the pickup on a DHS program that we've discussed on our prior Q1 call. 
Looking over the rest of the year, we see strong year-over-year performance in the back half of the year, leading to organic growth for the full year. 
Margins have stayed relatively constant over the course of the year.
Let me touch on some of the key assumptions underlying our guidance. First, we're assuming that we win both of our major recompetes. On that topic, the timing on Greenway seems to be holding around late summer or early fall, but the decision on TSA impacts has pushed out, and we're still awaiting the award announcement. On all other recompetes, we're assuming win rates consistent with our experience in fiscal year 2017. 
Second, we're assuming adjudications of new work follow the time lines we've seen over the last 2 years, so we're building in a reasonable amount of time for normal delays and protests. We're also assuming a 25% win rate on new business, though we were at 35% for last year.
And third, we assume that we close on the NES acquisition in the second quarter. The acquisition contributes relatively little to our guidance, assuming no top line synergies. If we're able to leverage NES into some large program wins, we'll update guidance as appropriate. 
To close my section, I'll pick up on what Larry started and provide an update on our views on adjusted EBITDA margins and adjusted EPS growth. 
Our long-term adjusted EBITDA margin target at the time of the spin was 16% to 17%. Of that, pension accounts for about 180 basis points. So on an apples-to-apples basis, we're currently guiding for our margins to be above our long-term target again in FY '18. 
As we look to the future, we will balance our demonstrated commitment to sustain high margins, with a rising likelihood of acquiring companies and winning large programs to grow our earnings. We are firmly committed to both growing our EBITDA and delivering industry-leading profitability. 
All of the factors that Larry and I discussed today support our long-term objective of high single-digit earnings growth. Compared to the original model, relatively more of that will come from revenue growth and capital deployment, which is well supported by our business-development trends and the opportunities we see on the M&A front.
Now back to Larry for some closing remarks."

In closing, I want to communicate the commitment of this management team and recognize the energy and creativity of our CSRA employees to address the challenges and to take advantage of the opportunities that arise in our business. 
As we stood at this company, there were several items that were mandated by the complex nature of the transaction. In each case, we've taken concrete actions to improve them. We renegotiated the terms of our original IP Matters Agreement with CSC, eliminating $55 million of future payments and acquiring the rights to certain technologies. We expect to complete a sale and leaseback transaction in FY '18 with our corporate headquarters facility that will provide a small influx of cash and upgrade our employees' work environment. We've substantially lowered our debt load so that our balance sheet can be used to our advantage. We've lowered and, in many cases, fixed the interest rate on our debt to simultaneously reduce expense and risk. We've changed some of our non-GAAP measures so that the cash attributes of the business are more transparent and comparable to our peers. We've lowered our unfunded pension liability by offering and paying lump sum buyout packages for eligible participants.
All of these financial management moves are in addition to the primary thrust of the company, including deepening our partnerships with our key strategic partners like AWS and Microsoft, forging new relationships with emerging technology companies and developing new solutions that can be sold across our customer base. 
You can count on this team to relentlessly address the elements that are in our control for the benefit of shareholders, including making a market for next-generation IT, aggressively targeting new work, appropriately controlling our costs and actively investing in talent.
With that, operator, we're now ready to take questions."

So when Dave talked about the 15% of the work both, half about recompete, half new, you'll see that one with our conservative estimation of the ramps for those, and that's what tends to drive the second half performance."

We're excited to finish this year on a strong note and even more excited about what's to come in fiscal year 2018. The fourth quarter was highlighted by superb earnings, with adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS both well ahead of plan, and we, again, had robust bookings. These achievements are the direct result of building brilliant teams, something I've been talking about since we launched. 
On earnings, it's all about program execution by dedicated project teams, working tough technical challenges and being aligned to around delivering shareholder value is a really important strategic imperative. The bookings are delivered by really good proposal teams that bring together customer insight and technology understanding to create innovative solutions under really tight time pressure. Our people really make a positive difference each and every single day. I simply couldn't be prouder of the efforts of the entire company, and I thank every employee for all their hard work this last year.
Most importantly, the successes of last year give us confidence that we'll achieve organic growth in revenue in fiscal year 2018 while also maintaining strong profitability and free cash flow generation. 
With our first full fiscal year now on the books, I want to take a fresh look at where we are on the 3 major points of our investment thesis that we laid out when we formed. Specifically, I'll address our views: first, on our end market; second, revenue growth profile; and then third, our capital allocation. I'll then ask Dave to speak to our guidance for next year and our long-term earnings growth outlook. 
First, our view of the market. We remain focused on the federal government and the state and local and international government markets related to it. At the time of the spin, our view was that the federal spending would grow very slowly, maybe 1% or so per year. We now expect a slight improvement in the level of spend, and we're more optimistic about the long-term market opportunity for CSRA. We're well positioned with many of the new administration's priorities, including defense, border security, cybersecurity, care for our veterans and driving efficiencies through technology and shared service delivery. To that point, we won major new business in FY '17 in each of these areas that are so important to the Trump administration. 
Earlier this month, President Trump signed into law a $1.1 trillion spending bill to fund the government through September, the end of its fiscal year. The budget adds $15 billion towards defense and $1.5 billion for border security. Noticeably absent were the $18 billion in cuts for domestic spending that the administration had initially proposed, with discretionary budgets for the civil agencies now being generally flat. This is positive for CSRA and it's positive for our industry. 
Certainty around budgets and increased spending levels should lead to stronger-than-usual award activity in the June and September quarters. Our customers have relatively little time to put money under contract, so we are proactively reaching out to our customers with white papers and solutions that meet their mission needs and using existing contracts and available contract sealing to cover. The quick-turn nature of the services market makes it the primary beneficiary in an environment of this type.
Just yesterday, the administration published its budget request for government fiscal year 2018, which generally follows the outline of the skinny budget laid out in March. I see the FY '17 funding negotiations as a blueprint for the way forward in FY '18. The administration has called for increases in funding for its priorities, and Congress will likely work compromises that address portions of those priorities without serious cuts to other agencies. We'll continue to see dramatic headlines and dramatic policy statements, but the Congress has turned to governing, and we expect the budgets won't change as dramatically as the headlines might suggest. 
We'll probably begin fiscal year 2018 with a little drama given how much work needs to be done. I expect that we will begin the year with a continuing resolution but will be off of a higher FY '17 budget and we do not expect a government shutdown. At some point in the fall, Congress will also have to increase the debt ceiling and reach another spending compromise to avoid the sequestration caps, but there are strong bipartisan consensus around both of these actions. 
In total, compared to the time of the spin, we expect a more positive macro environment for CSRA in our industry, with more budget certainty, increased spending on national security and then protected budgets in the civil agencies as we see the Senate engage in the process, which brings me to the second point, our revenue outlook. 
At the spin, we spoke of long-term organic revenue growth rate of about 2% to 3%, meeting a point or 2 better than the market growth rate. We've been working through some of the churn that was built in at the spin and portions of that will continue, but we are forecasting organic growth in 2018 and we're now more bullish on the long-term growth outlook than we've ever been. 
Business development is the foundation for growth, and George Batsakis and his BD team, working hand-in-hand with our group leaders, have been putting up strong numbers all year. In the fourth quarter, we booked $1.3 billion in awards for a book-to-bill ratio of 1.1x, our ninth straight quarter with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.0 or greater. 
Through the hard work of our go-to-market teams over the past year, we were able to overcome the slowdowns from administration transition and budget uncertainty that we had previewed on the last call. 56% of the bookings in the quarter were for new business, and our win rate on new business was once again above our target rate of 25%. Over the full year, we booked $6.9 billion in awards for a book-to-bill ratio of 1.4x. Moreover, we won $3.8 billion in new business during the year, which should yield north of $700 million in annual revenue when we're fully ramped.
Bidding remains at a furious pace. At the end of the quarter, we had $11 billion in submits outstanding. In the first quarter, we expect to submit another $7 billion in bids and we could have about $6 billion adjudicated. Looking only at new business, we have about $6.5 billion awaiting decision, including 16 opportunities that are each greater than $100 million in total value. 
This quarter, our 2 largest new awards were with the Environmental Protection Agency. The first is a $266 million 5-year contract to develop and operate the EPA's infrastructure and application platforms. Key tasks on this effort include data center management, application hosting, application deployment and maintenance, geospatial service support, network security, cybersecurity and cloud computing.
The second win is a 5-year $58 million contract to provision, maintain and support the EPA's high-performance computing environment as well as its scientific visualization hardware and software. Kevin Connell, who leads our science and engineering business within the civil group, has done a great job in positioning us with the EPA under its changing mandate. 
We get many questions from investors about the potential for reductions to our EPA business. While we do have some policy-related work that could be at risk, most of our work with the EPA and throughout our portfolio is around enterprise and next-generation IT. In fact, these 2 new contracts are both takeaways and are essential to agency operations, plus IT is seen as an enabler for cost savings. 
We expect to grow our EPA business based on the compelling value proposition that we offer. Competitive excellence generally trumps market pressure. 
A key part of our revenue growth outlook derives from adoption of next-generation IT across government. As the technology bridge to the government, we leverage our alliance in emerging technology partners' investments in R&D and next-generation products to improve our clients' mission, productivity and cost efficiency. We have master service agreements in place with both Microsoft and Amazon Web Services as well as the capability to resell Azure and AWS services on GSA schedule 70. This reach allows us to select the right solution at the right cost point that meets our clients' missions. 
Another developing growth area centers around background investigation, insider threat and continuous monitoring. This is an area that is ripe for technology innovation. In addition to our recent OPM win, which is ramping nicely, we are performing work in this area in all 4 of our groups, and we recently received a new award in our intelligence group with more awards expected shortly. The demand for these services is massive, as evidenced by the number of our peer companies who cited the shortage of cleared staff on their most recent earnings calls. I believe that CSRA is the company that can best attack this problem and address the huge market opportunity with a technology edge. 
We're also seeing a slight pickup in downrange activity, consistent with the increase in defense spending and the current global threat environment. We will manage our risk well as we support our defense and intelligence customers in the theater. 
Across all of our markets, we're seeing more large and consolidated opportunities. We're focusing more of our resources on these larger deals, which generally have less competition and higher returns. Given our scale, there's really no services contract that is too large for us to bid, to win and to execute. 
Last year, we had 2 adjudications north of $500 million in contract value for new work and we won both of them. We are currently targeting 16 bids for new work in excess of $500 million each that the government is expected to award in fiscal year 2018, 4 of which are already pending. Our team is truly energized about the investments in these opportunities, and we expect to win more than our fair share of these megadeals and further accelerate revenue growth as we look at FY '18. 
Revenue growth translates into more opportunities for our people, enhancing our culture, improving morale and enabling investments in continuous learning and development. We continue to have success in staffing as we pivot towards growth. In the fourth quarter, we had a highest number of hires to date, including large numbers of talented millennials attracted to next-generation technology. We've grown headcount over our last 2 quarters and expect that trend to strengthen in fiscal year 2018.
So fiscal year 2017 set the foundation for our return to growth. Every quarter, we got a little better in year-over-year revenue compares and we won substantial new business. In fiscal year 2018, we expect to be in our 2% to 3% organic growth target range. And looking further out when we win our Greenway and TSA impact recompetes and our share of new megadeals, we have the opportunity to do even better than our original growth target. In terms of competitive positioning, I wouldn't trade places with any company in our industry today.
That brings me to my third and final point. I see allocating capital as one of our key strategic responsibilities. At the spin, we had $3.1 billion in total debt and we laid out at that time a balanced capital allocation plan of 50% debt paydown, 40% shareholder return and 10% M&A. Since the spin, we actually spent 79% on debt paydown and 21% on shareholder returns with no M&A. Over the next few years, we'll likely take down debt a little bit slowly, gradually dedicating less than half of our free cash flow towards debt reduction and bringing our capital allocation more into balance.
Within that context, I'm pleased to report that we're -- signed a definitive agreement on our first acquisition as a public company. NES Associates will bring us strong competitive advantage as we compete for large network opportunities in upcoming years, another example of how we live our tagline Think next. Now.
Though small, NES provides very specific expertise in defense telecom, infrastructure and applications architecture as well as implementation services. NES has hands-on expertise with nearly every military base network infrastructure, both CONUS and OCONUS, and this experience can directly translate to other security-sensitive customers, such as Homeland Security as well as the intelligence community. 
NES Founder and CEO Andy Gomer has built an outstanding company and will be an important part of our network business going forward. Andy is a real roll-up-your-sleeves leader, acting as chief network engineer and working directly with customers to design high-performance, low-cost network solutions. 
There's a great team at NES. We can't wait to have all of the employees join us, and we're looking forward to competing together. 
We expect this acquisition to be slightly accretive to our fiscal year 2018 results, but the real upside potential is in driving organic revenue growth. 
Deeply understanding the network that connects the mission to compute will enable us to eliminate many of the barriers to adoption of next-generation IT. Digital transformation efforts rely on the availability of secure, high-bandwidth highly resilient and low-latency network infrastructures that can enable hyperscale functionality to accelerate cloud operating models. Becoming this network-transformation leader will accelerate the adoption of CSRA's next-gen digital solution offerings. Even more simply, we believe the key capabilities, the innovations and the past performance from NES will significantly improve our win probability on several very large pursuits across the company beginning almost immediately.
Now Dave will provide more detail on our financial results and our forward outlook."

As Larry said, we had a strong quarter across the board and completed a very productive year in the life of our company. We met Q4 consensus for revenue and significantly exceeded our plan and expectations for profitability. I'm pleased to post such strong earnings growth in the quarter and the year, underscoring CSRA's commitment to long-term earnings growth.
Turning to Slide 5, let me hit the high points of the income statement. Revenue for the quarter was $1.25 billion or $8 million above the midpoint of guidance given on the last call. Quarterly revenue was up 3% sequentially and down 3% from revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016. The year-over-year decline was our lowest, going back several years. And in every quarter this year, the year-over-year revenue comparisons improved.
Revenue for fiscal year 2017 was $5.0 billion, down 4% compared to pro forma revenue for fiscal year 2016.
Our contract mix was relatively unchanged, with 45% of quarterly revenue on fixed-price contracts, 21% on time and material contracts and 34% on cost-plus contracts. 
As I walk through the earnings performance, please keep in mind that as laid out in our Form 8-K filing on April 10, 2017, we've taken recurring pension income out of adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets out of adjusted EPS. 
For reference, fiscal year 2017 included $92 million of recurring pension income and $50 million of acquisition-related intangibles amortization, excluding the amortization related to SRA contract backlog. The Q4 amounts were $20 million and $11 million, respectively.
Adjusted EBITDA was $207 million for the quarter, which was up 5% year-over-year. The adjusted EBITDA margin of 16.5% was consistent with our high watermark in Q2, driven by strong contract performance and disciplined cost management as well as some non-recurring pickups. 
You'll see in the 10-K tomorrow that net EAC adjustments on fixed-price contracts for the quarter totaled $8 million, which was several million dollars above our expectation and our view of the sustainable performance level. In addition, SG&A in the fourth quarter was several million dollars lower than our sustainable level due to some onetime offsets. 
For the year, adjusted EBITDA margin was 15.9%, an improvement of 80 basis points compared to fiscal year 2016 and substantially above our long-term margin target, which I'll address later in my remarks.
Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.49, up 7% compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016. 
Our effective tax rate in the quarter was 36%, which was down about 3 percentage points from the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016. Our tax rate for the full year was also 36%, which is 1 to 2 points below our expected long-term rate. 
For the full year, adjusted diluted EPS was $1.91, which was up 10% compared to fiscal year 2016. 
Using our previous definitions, adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter would've been $227 million or $18 million above the top end of guidance from the last call. Similarly, adjusted diluted EPS would have been $0.54 or about $0.06 above the top end of our prior guidance. 
Beyond the pension income and acquisition amortization that I noted earlier, key Q4 GAAP expenses included $16 million from the mark-to-market of the pension plans and $72 million in separation and merger costs, the majority of which was a $61 million expense related to our IP Matters Agreement with CSC.
Now turning to Slide 6. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $50 million, and free cash flow was $62 million. Free cash flow exceeded operating cash flow because the IP Matters Agreement payment is excluded from free cash flow as a non-recurring separation-related payment. 
Days sales outstanding were 54 days, which is an improvement of 1 day compared to the third quarter of 2017. 
In Q4, we deployed $20 million to pay down debt and $16 million in dividends. 
As of March 31, 2017, we had $126 million in cash and cash equivalent and $2.6 billion in debt.
On to the forward outlook. With a year of strong bookings success, we are forecasting organic growth in revenue and free cash flow and robust performance in adjusted EBITDA and adjusted diluted earnings per share. 
As shown on Slide 7, we now project fiscal year 2018 revenue between $5 billion and $5.2 billion, adjusted EBITDA between $770 million and $800 million, adjusted diluted earnings per share between $1.88 and $2 and free cash flow between $330 million and $380 million. 
At the midpoint of guidance, revenue growth would be 2.1% with adjusted EBITDA margin of 15.4%. Earnings would be relatively flat as the result of significant outperformance in fiscal year 2017, especially in the fourth quarter. Compared to the midpoint of our prior guidance for FY '17, which better reflects sustainable profitability, FY '18 guidance implies EPS growth for the year of about 5%. Free cash flow is up 8% at the midpoint of our guidance, driven in part by the $25 million reimbursement from the 2013 divestiture of assets that we referenced on our Q2 call. We expect to receive that payment in the first half of our fiscal year.
In terms of revenue visibility, at the midpoint of guidance, we expect that about 85% of our revenue would come from existing business. Of the remaining 15%, over half would come from recompetes with the remainder from new business. 
On the recompetes and new business, we expect profitability to generally be below our corporate average for the first year or so and then to rise as we complete startup activities, introduce innovation and deliver more efficiently. 
The expectation that we've built into our guidance for fiscal year 2018 for new business revenue is lower than in the guidance range we originally gave for fiscal year 2017 even though our new business momentum is significantly higher today than a year ago.
We're still ramping up some of our larger FY '17 wins, so we expect quarterly revenue and earnings to step up through the year, with the first quarter being slightly below the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017, driven by the continued wind-downs of our STRATCOM and LMP contracts and some equipment purchases that were pulled forward into the fourth quarter. The year-over-year comparison for the first quarter will also be our toughest as a result of the pickup on a DHS program that we've discussed on our prior Q1 call. 
Looking over the rest of the year, we see strong year-over-year performance in the back half of the year, leading to organic growth for the full year. 
Margins have stayed relatively constant over the course of the year.
Let me touch on some of the key assumptions underlying our guidance. First, we're assuming that we win both of our major recompetes. On that topic, the timing on Greenway seems to be holding around late summer or early fall, but the decision on TSA impacts has pushed out, and we're still awaiting the award announcement. On all other recompetes, we're assuming win rates consistent with our experience in fiscal year 2017. 
Second, we're assuming adjudications of new work follow the time lines we've seen over the last 2 years, so we're building in a reasonable amount of time for normal delays and protests. We're also assuming a 25% win rate on new business, though we were at 35% for last year.
And third, we assume that we close on the NES acquisition in the second quarter. The acquisition contributes relatively little to our guidance, assuming no top line synergies. If we're able to leverage NES into some large program wins, we'll update guidance as appropriate. 
To close my section, I'll pick up on what Larry started and provide an update on our views on adjusted EBITDA margins and adjusted EPS growth. 
Our long-term adjusted EBITDA margin target at the time of the spin was 16% to 17%. Of that, pension accounts for about 180 basis points. So on an apples-to-apples basis, we're currently guiding for our margins to be above our long-term target again in FY '18. 
As we look to the future, we will balance our demonstrated commitment to sustain high margins, with a rising likelihood of acquiring companies and winning large programs to grow our earnings. We are firmly committed to both growing our EBITDA and delivering industry-leading profitability. 
All of the factors that Larry and I discussed today support our long-term objective of high single-digit earnings growth. Compared to the original model, relatively more of that will come from revenue growth and capital deployment, which is well supported by our business-development trends and the opportunities we see on the M&A front.
Now back to Larry for some closing remarks."

In closing, I want to communicate the commitment of this management team and recognize the energy and creativity of our CSRA employees to address the challenges and to take advantage of the opportunities that arise in our business. 
As we [stood] at this company, there were several items that were mandated by the complex nature of the transaction. In each case, we've taken concrete actions to improve them. We renegotiated the terms of our original IP Matters Agreement with CSC, eliminating $55 million of future payments and acquiring the rights to certain technologies. We expect to complete a sale and leaseback transaction in FY '18 with our corporate headquarters facility that will provide a small influx of cash and upgrade our employees' work environment. We've substantially lowered our debt load so that our balance sheet can be used to our advantage. We've lowered and, in many cases, fixed the interest rate on our debt to simultaneously reduce expense and risk. We've changed some of our non-GAAP measures so that the cash attributes of the business are more transparent and comparable to our peers. We've lowered our unfunded pension liability by offering and paying lump sum buyout packages for eligible participants.
All of these financial management moves are in addition to the primary thrust of the company, including deepening our partnerships with our key strategic partners like AWS and Microsoft, forging new relationships with emerging technology companies and developing new solutions that can be sold across our customer base. 
You can count on this team to relentlessly address the elements that are in our control for the benefit of shareholders, including making a market for next-generation IT, aggressively targeting new work, appropriately controlling our costs and actively investing in talent.
With that, operator, we're now ready to take questions."

We're actively out there with customers, working on great IT ideas to help them with that. And there was an explanation for it. When the Trump administration put out there an executive order on cybersecurity, there's a real emphasis on looking at the infrastructure, the new hardware, the new software just to bring yourself up to a modicum of capability to defend the network and then an emphasis on moving shared services.

We're excited to finish this year on a strong note and even more excited about what's to come in fiscal year 2018. The fourth quarter was highlighted by superb earnings, with adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS both well ahead of plan, and we, again, had robust bookings. These achievements are the direct result of building brilliant teams, something I've been talking about since we launched. 
On earnings, it's all about program execution by dedicated project teams, working tough technical challenges and being aligned to around delivering shareholder value is a really important strategic imperative. The bookings are delivered by really good proposal teams that bring together customer insight and technology understanding to create innovative solutions under really tight time pressure. Our people really make a positive difference each and every single day. I simply couldn't be prouder of the efforts of the entire company, and I thank every employee for all their hard work this last year.
Most importantly, the successes of last year give us confidence that we'll achieve organic growth in revenue in fiscal year 2018 while also maintaining strong profitability and free cash flow generation. 
With our first full fiscal year now on the books, I want to take a fresh look at where we are on the 3 major points of our investment thesis that we laid out when we formed. Specifically, I'll address our views: first, on our end market; second, revenue growth profile; and then third, our capital allocation. I'll then ask Dave to speak to our guidance for next year and our long-term earnings growth outlook. 
First, our view of the market. We remain focused on the federal government and the state and local and international government markets related to it. At the time of the spin, our view was that the federal spending would grow very slowly, maybe 1% or so per year. We now expect a slight improvement in the level of spend, and we're more optimistic about the long-term market opportunity for CSRA. We're well positioned with many of the new administration's priorities, including defense, border security, cybersecurity, care for our veterans and driving efficiencies through technology and shared service delivery. To that point, we won major new business in FY '17 in each of these areas that are so important to the Trump administration. 
Earlier this month, President Trump signed into law a $1.1 trillion spending bill to fund the government through September, the end of its fiscal year. The budget adds $15 billion towards defense and $1.5 billion for border security. Noticeably absent were the $18 billion in cuts for domestic spending that the administration had initially proposed, with discretionary budgets for the civil agencies now being generally flat. This is positive for CSRA and it's positive for our industry. 
Certainty around budgets and increased spending levels should lead to stronger-than-usual award activity in the June and September quarters. Our customers have relatively little time to put money under contract, so we are proactively reaching out to our customers with white papers and solutions that meet their mission needs and using existing contracts and available contract sealing to cover. The quick-turn nature of the services market makes it the primary beneficiary in an environment of this type.
Just yesterday, the administration published its budget request for government fiscal year 2018, which generally follows the outline of the skinny budget laid out in March. I see the FY '17 funding negotiations as a blueprint for the way forward in FY '18. The administration has called for increases in funding for its priorities, and Congress will likely work compromises that address portions of those priorities without serious cuts to other agencies. We'll continue to see dramatic headlines and dramatic policy statements, but the Congress has turned to governing, and we expect the budgets won't change as dramatically as the headlines might suggest. 
We'll probably begin fiscal year 2018 with a little drama given how much work needs to be done. I expect that we will begin the year with a continuing resolution but will be off of a higher FY '17 budget and we do not expect a government shutdown. At some point in the fall, Congress will also have to increase the debt ceiling and reach another spending compromise to avoid the sequestration caps, but there are strong bipartisan consensus around both of these actions. 
In total, compared to the time of the spin, we expect a more positive macro environment for CSRA in our industry, with more budget certainty, increased spending on national security and then protected budgets in the civil agencies as we see the Senate engage in the process, which brings me to the second point, our revenue outlook. 
At the spin, we spoke of long-term organic revenue growth rate of about 2% to 3%, meeting a point or 2 better than the market growth rate. We've been working through some of the churn that was built in at the spin and portions of that will continue, but we are forecasting organic growth in 2018 and we're now more bullish on the long-term growth outlook than we've ever been. 
Business development is the foundation for growth, and George Batsakis and his BD team, working hand-in-hand with our group leaders, have been putting up strong numbers all year. In the fourth quarter, we booked $1.3 billion in awards for a book-to-bill ratio of 1.1x, our ninth straight quarter with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.0 or greater. 
Through the hard work of our go-to-market teams over the past year, we were able to overcome the slowdowns from administration transition and budget uncertainty that we had previewed on the last call. 56% of the bookings in the quarter were for new business, and our win rate on new business was once again above our target rate of 25%. Over the full year, we booked $6.9 billion in awards for a book-to-bill ratio of 1.4x. Moreover, we won $3.8 billion in new business during the year, which should yield north of $700 million in annual revenue when we're fully ramped.
Bidding remains at a furious pace. At the end of the quarter, we had $11 billion in submits outstanding. In the first quarter, we expect to submit another $7 billion in bids and we could have about $6 billion adjudicated. Looking only at new business, we have about $6.5 billion awaiting decision, including 16 opportunities that are each greater than $100 million in total value. 
This quarter, our 2 largest new awards were with the Environmental Protection Agency. The first is a $266 million 5-year contract to develop and operate the EPA's infrastructure and application platforms. Key tasks on this effort include data center management, application hosting, application deployment and maintenance, geospatial service support, network security, cybersecurity and cloud computing.
The second win is a 5-year $58 million contract to provision, maintain and support the EPA's high-performance computing environment as well as its scientific visualization hardware and software. Kevin Connell, who leads our science and engineering business within the civil group, has done a great job in positioning us with the EPA under its changing mandate. 
We get many questions from investors about the potential for reductions to our EPA business. While we do have some policy-related work that could be at risk, most of our work with the EPA and throughout our portfolio is around enterprise and next-generation IT. In fact, these 2 new contracts are both takeaways and are essential to agency operations, plus IT is seen as an enabler for cost savings. 
We expect to grow our EPA business based on the compelling value proposition that we offer. Competitive excellence generally trumps market pressure. 
A key part of our revenue growth outlook derives from adoption of next-generation IT across government. As the technology bridge to the government, we leverage our alliance in emerging technology partners' investments in R&D and next-generation products to improve our clients' mission, productivity and cost efficiency. We have master service agreements in place with both Microsoft and Amazon Web Services as well as the capability to resell Azure and AWS services on GSA schedule 70. This reach allows us to select the right solution at the right cost point that meets our clients' missions. 
Another developing growth area centers around background investigation, insider threat and continuous monitoring. This is an area that is ripe for technology innovation. In addition to our recent OPM win, which is ramping nicely, we are performing work in this area in all 4 of our groups, and we recently received a new award in our intelligence group with more awards expected shortly. The demand for these services is massive, as evidenced by the number of our peer companies who cited the shortage of cleared staff on their most recent earnings calls. I believe that CSRA is the company that can best attack this problem and address the huge market opportunity with a technology edge. 
We're also seeing a slight pickup in downrange activity, consistent with the increase in defense spending and the current global threat environment. We will manage our risk well as we support our defense and intelligence customers in the theater. 
Across all of our markets, we're seeing more large and consolidated opportunities. We're focusing more of our resources on these larger deals, which generally have less competition and higher returns. Given our scale, there's really no services contract that is too large for us to bid, to win and to execute. 
Last year, we had 2 adjudications north of $500 million in contract value for new work and we won both of them. We are currently targeting 16 bids for new work in excess of $500 million each that the government is expected to award in fiscal year 2018, 4 of which are already pending. Our team is truly energized about the investments in these opportunities, and we expect to win more than our fair share of these megadeals and further accelerate revenue growth as we look at FY '18. 
Revenue growth translates into more opportunities for our people, enhancing our culture, improving morale and enabling investments in continuous learning and development. We continue to have success in staffing as we pivot towards growth. In the fourth quarter, we had a highest number of hires to date, including large numbers of talented millennials attracted to next-generation technology. We've grown headcount over our last 2 quarters and expect that trend to strengthen in fiscal year 2018.
So fiscal year 2017 set the foundation for our return to growth. Every quarter, we got a little better in year-over-year revenue compares and we won substantial new business. In fiscal year 2018, we expect to be in our 2% to 3% organic growth target range. And looking further out when we win our Greenway and TSA impact recompetes and our share of new megadeals, we have the opportunity to do even better than our original growth target. In terms of competitive positioning, I wouldn't trade places with any company in our industry today.
That brings me to my third and final point. I see allocating capital as one of our key strategic responsibilities. At the spin, we had $3.1 billion in total debt and we laid out at that time a balanced capital allocation plan of 50% debt paydown, 40% shareholder return and 10% M&A. Since the spin, we actually spent 79% on debt paydown and 21% on shareholder returns with no M&A. Over the next few years, we'll likely take down debt a little bit slowly, gradually dedicating less than half of our free cash flow towards debt reduction and bringing our capital allocation more into balance.
Within that context, I'm pleased to report that we're -- signed a definitive agreement on our first acquisition as a public company. NES Associates will bring us strong competitive advantage as we compete for large network opportunities in upcoming years, another example of how we live our tagline Think next. Now.
Though small, NES provides very specific expertise in defense telecom, infrastructure and applications architecture as well as implementation services. NES has hands-on expertise with nearly every military base network infrastructure, both CONUS and OCONUS, and this experience can directly translate to other security-sensitive customers, such as Homeland Security as well as the intelligence community. 
NES Founder and CEO Andy Gomer has built an outstanding company and will be an important part of our network business going forward. Andy is a real roll-up-your-sleeves leader, acting as chief network engineer and working directly with customers to design high-performance, low-cost network solutions. 
There's a great team at NES. We can't wait to have all of the employees join us, and we're looking forward to competing together. 
We expect this acquisition to be slightly accretive to our fiscal year 2018 results, but the real upside potential is in driving organic revenue growth. 
Deeply understanding the network that connects the mission to compute will enable us to eliminate many of the barriers to adoption of next-generation IT. Digital transformation efforts rely on the availability of secure, high-bandwidth highly resilient and low-latency network infrastructures that can enable hyperscale functionality to accelerate cloud operating models. Becoming this network-transformation leader will accelerate the adoption of CSRA's next-gen digital solution offerings. Even more simply, we believe the key capabilities, the innovations and the past performance from NES will significantly improve our win probability on several very large pursuits across the company beginning almost immediately.
Now Dave will provide more detail on our financial results and our forward outlook."

As Larry said, we had a strong quarter across the board and completed a very productive year in the life of our company.

As Larry said, we had a strong quarter across the board and completed a very productive year in the life of our company. We met Q4 consensus for revenue and significantly exceeded our plan and expectations for profitability. I'm pleased to post such strong earnings growth in the quarter and the year, underscoring CSRA's commitment to long-term earnings growth.
Turning to Slide 5, let me hit the high points of the income statement. Revenue for the quarter was $1.25 billion or $8 million above the midpoint of guidance given on the last call. Quarterly revenue was up 3% sequentially and down 3% from revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016. The year-over-year decline was our lowest, going back several years. And in every quarter this year, the year-over-year revenue comparisons improved.
Revenue for fiscal year 2017 was $5.0 billion, down 4% compared to pro forma revenue for fiscal year 2016.
Our contract mix was relatively unchanged, with 45% of quarterly revenue on fixed-price contracts, 21% on time and material contracts and 34% on cost-plus contracts. 
As I walk through the earnings performance, please keep in mind that as laid out in our Form 8-K filing on April 10, 2017, we've taken recurring pension income out of adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets out of adjusted EPS. 
For reference, fiscal year 2017 included $92 million of recurring pension income and $50 million of acquisition-related intangibles amortization, excluding the amortization related to SRA contract backlog. The Q4 amounts were $20 million and $11 million, respectively.
Adjusted EBITDA was $207 million for the quarter, which was up 5% year-over-year. The adjusted EBITDA margin of 16.5% was consistent with our high watermark in Q2, driven by strong contract performance and disciplined cost management as well as some non-recurring pickups. 
You'll see in the 10-K tomorrow that net EAC adjustments on fixed-price contracts for the quarter totaled $8 million, which was several million dollars above our expectation and our view of the sustainable performance level. In addition, SG&A in the fourth quarter was several million dollars lower than our sustainable level due to some onetime offsets. 
For the year, adjusted EBITDA margin was 15.9%, an improvement of 80 basis points compared to fiscal year 2016 and substantially above our long-term margin target, which I'll address later in my remarks.
Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.49, up 7% compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016. 
Our effective tax rate in the quarter was 36%, which was down about 3 percentage points from the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016. Our tax rate for the full year was also 36%, which is 1 to 2 points below our expected long-term rate. 
For the full year, adjusted diluted EPS was $1.91, which was up 10% compared to fiscal year 2016. 
Using our previous definitions, adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter would've been $227 million or $18 million above the top end of guidance from the last call. Similarly, adjusted diluted EPS would have been $0.54 or about $0.06 above the top end of our prior guidance. 
Beyond the pension income and acquisition amortization that I noted earlier, key Q4 GAAP expenses included $16 million from the mark-to-market of the pension plans and $72 million in separation and merger costs, the majority of which was a $61 million expense related to our IP Matters Agreement with CSC.
Now turning to Slide 6. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $50 million, and free cash flow was $62 million. Free cash flow exceeded operating cash flow because the IP Matters Agreement payment is excluded from free cash flow as a non-recurring separation-related payment. 
Days sales outstanding were 54 days, which is an improvement of 1 day compared to the third quarter of 2017. 
In Q4, we deployed $20 million to pay down debt and $16 million in dividends. 
As of March 31, 2017, we had $126 million in cash and cash equivalent and $2.6 billion in debt.
On to the forward outlook. With a year of strong bookings success, we are forecasting organic growth in revenue and free cash flow and robust performance in adjusted EBITDA and adjusted diluted earnings per share. 
As shown on Slide 7, we now project fiscal year 2018 revenue between $5 billion and $5.2 billion, adjusted EBITDA between $770 million and $800 million, adjusted diluted earnings per share between $1.88 and $2 and free cash flow between $330 million and $380 million. 
At the midpoint of guidance, revenue growth would be 2.1% with adjusted EBITDA margin of 15.4%. Earnings would be relatively flat as the result of significant outperformance in fiscal year 2017, especially in the fourth quarter. Compared to the midpoint of our prior guidance for FY '17, which better reflects sustainable profitability, FY '18 guidance implies EPS growth for the year of about 5%. Free cash flow is up 8% at the midpoint of our guidance, driven in part by the $25 million reimbursement from the 2013 divestiture of assets that we referenced on our Q2 call. We expect to receive that payment in the first half of our fiscal year.
In terms of revenue visibility, at the midpoint of guidance, we expect that about 85% of our revenue would come from existing business. Of the remaining 15%, over half would come from recompetes with the remainder from new business. 
On the recompetes and new business, we expect profitability to generally be below our corporate average for the first year or so and then to rise as we complete startup activities, introduce innovation and deliver more efficiently. 
The expectation that we've built into our guidance for fiscal year 2018 for new business revenue is lower than in the guidance range we originally gave for fiscal year 2017 even though our new business momentum is significantly higher today than a year ago.
We're still ramping up some of our larger FY '17 wins, so we expect quarterly revenue and earnings to step up through the year, with the first quarter being slightly below the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017, driven by the continued wind-downs of our STRATCOM and LMP contracts and some equipment purchases that were pulled forward into the fourth quarter. The year-over-year comparison for the first quarter will also be our toughest as a result of the pickup on a DHS program that we've discussed on our prior Q1 call. 
Looking over the rest of the year, we see strong year-over-year performance in the back half of the year, leading to organic growth for the full year. 
Margins have stayed relatively constant over the course of the year.
Let me touch on some of the key assumptions underlying our guidance. First, we're assuming that we win both of our major recompetes. On that topic, the timing on Greenway seems to be holding around late summer or early fall, but the decision on TSA impacts has pushed out, and we're still awaiting the award announcement. On all other recompetes, we're assuming win rates consistent with our experience in fiscal year 2017. 
Second, we're assuming adjudications of new work follow the time lines we've seen over the last 2 years, so we're building in a reasonable amount of time for normal delays and protests. We're also assuming a 25% win rate on new business, though we were at 35% for last year.
And third, we assume that we close on the NES acquisition in the second quarter. The acquisition contributes relatively little to our guidance, assuming no top line synergies. If we're able to leverage NES into some large program wins, we'll update guidance as appropriate. 
To close my section, I'll pick up on what Larry started and provide an update on our views on adjusted EBITDA margins and adjusted EPS growth. 
Our long-term adjusted EBITDA margin target at the time of the spin was 16% to 17%. Of that, pension accounts for about 180 basis points. So on an apples-to-apples basis, we're currently guiding for our margins to be above our long-term target again in FY '18. 
As we look to the future, we will balance our demonstrated commitment to sustain high margins, with a rising likelihood of acquiring companies and winning large programs to grow our earnings. We are firmly committed to both growing our EBITDA and delivering industry-leading profitability. 
All of the factors that Larry and I discussed today support our long-term objective of high single-digit earnings growth. Compared to the original model, relatively more of that will come from revenue growth and capital deployment, which is well supported by our business-development trends and the opportunities we see on the M&A front.
Now back to Larry for some closing remarks."

In closing, I want to communicate the commitment of this management team and recognize the energy and creativity of our CSRA employees to address the challenges and to take advantage of the opportunities that arise in our business. 
As we [stood] at this company, there were several items that were mandated by the complex nature of the transaction. In each case, we've taken concrete actions to improve them. We renegotiated the terms of our original IP Matters Agreement with CSC, eliminating $55 million of future payments and acquiring the rights to certain technologies. We expect to complete a sale and leaseback transaction in FY '18 with our corporate headquarters facility that will provide a small influx of cash and upgrade our employees' work environment. We've substantially lowered our debt load so that our balance sheet can be used to our advantage. We've lowered and, in many cases, fixed the interest rate on our debt to simultaneously reduce expense and risk. We've changed some of our non-GAAP measures so that the cash attributes of the business are more transparent and comparable to our peers. We've lowered our unfunded pension liability by offering and paying lump sum buyout packages for eligible participants.
All of these financial management moves are in addition to the primary thrust of the company, including deepening our partnerships with our key strategic partners like AWS and Microsoft, forging new relationships with emerging technology companies and developing new solutions that can be sold across our customer base. 
You can count on this team to relentlessly address the elements that are in our control for the benefit of shareholders, including making a market for next-generation IT, aggressively targeting new work, appropriately controlling our costs and actively investing in talent.
With that, operator, we're now ready to take questions."

When the Trump administration put out there an executive order on cybersecurity, there's a real emphasis on looking at the infrastructure, the new hardware, the new software just to bring yourself up to a modicum of capability to defend the network and then an emphasis on moving shared services.

We began fiscal year 2018 with strong performance across the business that sets the stage for us to meet all our guided metrics for the year. We continue to execute on the twin hallmarks of CSRA: excellent",1980,"Thank you, Stuart, and good afternoon, everyone. We began fiscal year 2018 with strong performance across the business that sets the stage for us to meet all our guided metrics for the year. We continue to execute on the twin hallmarks of CSRA: excellent profitability and business development success. 
Adjusted EBITDA was up 5% year-over-year, and adjusted EBITDA and EPS both exceeded consensus estimates. We also achieved a book-to-bill ratio of 1.3x, anchored by the Defense Department's milCloud win, a $498 million cloud development and migration award that underscores our leadership position in next-generation IT. 
Dave will do a deeper dive on the financials, and I'll focus on 4 key topics: first, our view on the market; second, our leadership on next-generation IT; third, our success in business development; and fourth and really important, employee engagement.
First, our view of the market. We remain convinced that the federal government market will support our growth objectives over our planning horizon. The Appropriations Committees in the House and Senate are working their process for the coming government fiscal year, which begins October 1. So far we've seen some increases in spending and some decreases, but none of these decreases were of the magnitude proposed in the President's budget. We think the most likely outcome and scenario is that the government will begin the fiscal year with a continuing resolution that extends FY '17's robust funding. Congress will also need to raise the debt ceiling in the fall. The talks to avoid a government shutdown and the credit default will surely grab the headlines, but our customers are continuing to operate and focus on their missions. Procurements are moving through the system, and programs are ramping normally. 
Even with a divided Congress, there are some areas of strong bipartisan support, and IT monetization is one of them. For example, in May, the House passed the Modernizing Government Technology Act, which would establish and authorize $500 million for a government-wide technology modernization fund. Large agencies would be authorized to set up their own IT working capital funds that could be used to replace legacy systems, move to the cloud and invest in cybersecurity. Our entire industry is solidly behind this bill, which is being championed by Congressman Will Hurd from Texas. Congressman Hurd served in the CIA for nearly a decade. He's worked in the private sector advising on cybersecurity. He knows our industry. CSRA welcomes the efforts of members of Congress like Will who will work across the aisle to forward good common sense ideas that further the mission of government. 
Second, the employees of CSRA are a next-generation IT leaders for this federal government. A few weeks ago, we were excited to demonstrate our next-generation thought leadership through a conference call with investors on cloud adoption in the federal government space. Our Chief Technology Officer, Yogesh Khanna, with great support from our partners both Microsoft and Service Now discussed the specific drivers in the federal market and the important trends that we see going forward. The call was well attended, and the feedback has been really positive. We plan to hold similar calls in the future working together with our partners to shine a light on additional next-generation technologies and how they can further the mission of our customers.
One of the key messages from the call was our approach to working with technology partners, especially to identify and apply advances in technology. Public sector organizations increasingly require new and creative approaches to fulfill their complex missions. That's why from our inception, we've looked to continually expand our circle of partners to include companies focused on next-generation innovation and agility. 
Over the past year, we've partnered with 19 emerging tech companies from Silicon Valley and beyond to deliver innovative solutions to public sector organizations. And be clear, our search continues. In May, we showcased 8 new contenders for more than 120 companies considered at our third emerging technology day, which showcased artificial intelligence and automation. Our emerging technology initiative is designed to foster ideas, make connections and hasten adoption. Representatives from the featured companies presented their solutions to an audience of more than 50 government customers and 200 of our own CSRA project managers. We matched our deep mission understanding and experience working with the federal government with a groundbreaking innovation to create positive mission outcomes quickly for our customers. 
Our thought leadership is also evident in the work that our customers entrust to us. As I mentioned earlier, our largest win in the quarter was the $498 million milCloud award. On this contract, we'll provide the Defense Department with a robust and resilient private cloud infrastructure for a variety of highly protected workloads and prepare essential business processes for later, broader use in the Defense Department's IT cloud portfolio. This win was a great team effort with John Anderson and Damon Bramble bringing the customer perspective, Dan Prestel, architecting the solution and Donald Robinson providing technical leadership, truly a great success for the company and a game changer. 
We're now positioned as the industry leader for cloud and military IT. With stringent security concerns, the Defense Department has lagged a bit compared to other government organizations in movement to the cloud. Now the department is ready to take the next step in its IT transformation. And we're excited to continue this partnership with the military and provide our experts and resources to meet or exceed their demands. 
Initially, we'll be installing cloud infrastructure at 2 DISA data centers in Alabama and Oklahoma. During the startup phase, security is a major imperative. We will take the appropriate time to achieve the authority to operate so that our fiscal year 2019 will show us the ability to ramp the program aggressively as we move workloads to the milCloud. 
The contract will also allow us to expand our alliance partner offerings, including public cloud, storage, service providers, database and more. CSRA's winning cloud solution also provided a much lower total cost of ownership and allows the department to consolidate their computer infrastructure through the as a service model. This will engender greater efficiencies for onboarding DoD consumers, reducing their cost, increasing the efficiency of computing platforms and increase the overall IT security posture of the United States government. The contract will also leverage talent and capabilities out of our own Integrated Technology Center in Bossier City, Louisiana. 
To conclude on this point, technical thought leadership is central to our strategy. It is the linchpin to the 3 primary competitive differentiators that we have described as core to our company: customer intimacy, innovation and outcome-based delivery. It helps us engage with our customers around their future direction. It enables us to innovate for our customers for better outcomes. And it helps us drive to an as a service solution where customers reward us for outcomes instead of inputs. Thought leadership doesn't just happen. We invest in it because we see it as integral to our future and part of just who we are. 
That brings me to my third point. Our business development results continue to demonstrate the competitiveness of our strategy and our offerings. milCloud was the largest win, but we had solid business development performance across the board. We achieved $1.6 billion in bookings for a book-to-bill ratio of 1.3x. This marks the tenth straight quarter with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.0 or greater. Our trailing 12 months book-to-bill ratio increased to 1.5x. Total backlog at the end of the quarter was $15.6 billion, which is up 3% sequentially. And funded backlog was $2.5 billion, which was up 2% sequentially. Our submit volume for the quarter, it was massive, $7.4 billion in total and $5.1 billion of that in new work. As a result, at the end of the quarter, we had $14 billion in submits outstanding. And looking only at new business, we had about $8.4 billion awaiting decision, including 22 opportunities that are each greater than $100 million in total value. This volume supports our view that the second quarter could be even more robust than is normal for the end of the government fiscal year. 
Finally, I want to update you all on our 2 large outstanding recompetes: Greenway and impact. The decision on our prime Greenway bid known GES continues to track for late August or early September. Remember that there are 3 pieces to Greenway. The first of the regional infrastructure support contracts known as is likely to be awarded first, followed shortly by GES with the contract likely delayed several months after GES is awarded. On impact, as reported in the press and filed on website, we filed a preaward protest because TSA was not following the process that they had laid out for the procurement as required by regulation. TSA now has indicated that they plan to reopen discussions and seek another round of proposal submissions to address the concerns that we raised. We've had preliminary indications from TSA and are looking forward to receiving the details of TSA's corrective actions to include timing of revised submissions and projected award date. We are now operating on a bridge contract that extends our performance on the contract potentially through June of 2018. We are working well with the end customer. We remain dedicated to the TSA mission. And we continue to receive new casting on this important mission.
Fourth, our employees are engaged, and we are committed to strike on that engagement. In Q1, we conducted our first employee engagement survey. With excellent participation and candid responses, we now have a solid baseline of employee sentiment. In identifying what is resonating well and what needs to be better, stronger and more compelling, we can continue to build a CSRA culture that inspires a sense of pride and engagement for all employees. Going forward, we can make even more informed decisions about where to focus, where to improve. We achieved an engagement score out of the gate of 72% favorable, a positive result that we can build upon. We came shining through was a shared commitment to and recognition of our cultures and values, with scores approaching and into the 90s across the board. Our employees almost uniformly see that CSRA enable them to perform meaningful work for our customers in an environment where we hold ourselves accountable for delivering service excellence where we operate with integrity, where we set the highest standards for honesty and ethical behavior and where we treat people with dignity, respect regardless of their position. 
This is exactly how I see CSRA as well. In fact, I've joined the CEO Action for Diversity and Inclusion Coalition and have committed to CSRA to cultivate a workplace where perspective and experiences are welcome and respected and where employees feel encouraged to discuss diversity and inclusion. CSRA is committed to a point of view on diversity and inclusion that shapes our decisions, shapes our actions, improves the employee experience and motivates us to provide innovation and next generations for our customers. In taking the pledge to advance diversity and inclusion practices, both within our own wells and outside of them, we take the next step in our commitment to building an inclusive culture at CSRA in which all employees can bring their whole selves and have the opportunity to thrive. 
While we're encouraged to see that employees are engaged and we score higher than our core culture and values, we've got more work to do around improving career development paths and strengthening the ties across organizational boundaries. We're implementing specific programs to address these areas as part of our goal of becoming an employer of choice. Achieving and sustaining that goal will require continued effort and leadership in every level of the company.
Now Dave will provide more detail on the financial results and the forward outlook. And then I'll come back with some closing remarks."
301669938,530052680,1275266,"CSRA Inc., Q1 2018 Earnings Call, Aug 09, 2017",2017-08-09,"Earnings Calls","CSRA Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Larry, and good afternoon, everyone. As Larry said, we had another strong quarter across the board. Revenue and cash performance were essentially in line with our plan, and earnings performance was excellent.Turning to Slide 5, let me hit the hi",989,"Thanks, Larry, and good afternoon, everyone. As Larry said, we had another strong quarter across the board. Revenue and cash performance were essentially in line with our plan, and earnings performance was excellent.
Turning to Slide 5, let me hit the high points of the income statement. Revenue for the quarter was $1.23 billion, down 2% compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2017. Following the pattern, we established last year, the year-over-year revenue decline continues to improve. And we expect the comparison to turn positive in our second or third quarter. 
Civil segment revenues increased 3% compared to revenues from the same period of the prior year, driven by the expansion of several recent program wins, including OPM background investigations, HIGLAS and SEC. Defense and Intelligence segment revenues decreased 8% year-over-year. The primary drivers of this decline were the army and logistics organization programs and the STRATCOM IT capabilities contract. Recent new business wins in the Defense and Intelligence segment, including the CECOM logistics support, the and joint service provider contracts are continuing to ramp. And the segment should show positive growth later this year. 
Our contract mix was relatively unchanged with 45% of quarterly revenue on fixed-price contracts, 21% on time and material contacts and 34% on cost-plus contracts. 
Earnings performance was very strong in the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $204 million, which was up 5% year-over-year. The adjusted EBITDA margin of 16.6% was higher even than last quarter and above what we expect for the year, which reflected great work throughout the company, especially our program managers delivering excellent performance. 
Net EAC adjustments on fixed-price contracts for the quarter totaled $12 million, which was up $9 million from last year's Q1 EACs. We see the $3 million to $5 million range as our normal level of quarterly EACs, which primarily result from changes in the risk reserves on fixed-price contracts. 
Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.48, unchanged from the first quarter of fiscal year 2017. Our effective tax rate this quarter was 36.5%, which was about 0.8 percentage points higher than in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017 and a little below our expected long-term rate. 
D&A has come up a bit from where it had been running, based primarily on additional capital leases to support growth on our flight school 21 program and some additional enterprise software costs. GAAP D&A shows a year-over-year decline from $65 million to $60 million. Removing the acquisition-related intangible amortization in both periods including the amortization of the SRA contract backlog in Q1 of FY '17 shows an increase in D&A included in our adjusted EPS from $34 million to $43 million. The shift from operating to capitalized expenses had the effect of leaving EPS in line with our model and EBITDA running a little ahead. 
The key items to reconcile to GAAP include pension income of $21 million, acquisition-related intangibles amortization of $17 million and pretax merger and integration costs of $5 million. As noted in our press release, the acquisition-related intangible amortizations includes a $5 million amortization expense related to the write-off of software that came over to us as part of the spin. 
In the first quarter, we completed integration of our human resources systems. We expect to complete integration of our finance and accounting systems by the end of our fiscal year, at which time the merger and integration cost would be minimal.
Now turning to Slide 6. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $87 million, and free cash flow was $76 million. In Q1, we returned $31 million to shareholders, including $17 million in dividends and $14 million in share repurchases. As of June 30, 2017, we have $194 million in cash and cash equivalents and $2.6 billion in debt, excluding our capital lease obligations. The balance sheet and cash flow statements for the quarter are complicated by 2 factors: the repricing of some of our term loans and the NES acquisition. In June, we were able to amend our term loan B facility and reduced the interest rate by 0.5 percentage points. With the spread between our term loan A1 and B rates now being so low, we shifted about $184 million from the term loan A1 loan facility to the amended term loan B facility to extend the duration by 4 years. As part of that transaction, we wrote off $1.7 million of deferred financing fees related to an earlier amendment and recorded an additional $1.5 million of deferred financing fees related to this amendment. 
At the end of June, we drew $55 million in our revolving credit facility to fund the NES acquisition. The full purchase payment of $105 million will be reflected in our Q2 financial statements.
Now on to the forward outlook. As shown on Slide 7, we're reaffirming our guidance for fiscal year 2018, including revenue between $5 billion and $5.2 billion, adjusted EBITDA between $770 million and $800 million, adjusted diluted earnings per share between $1.88 and $2 and free cash flow between $330 million and $380 million. Revenue visibility has improved since our last call. At the midpoint of guidance, we now expect that about 91% of revenue would come from existing business, which is up from about 85%. Of the remaining 9%, more than 5% would come from recompetes, with the remainder from new business. 
Walking through the rest of the year, we expect sequential revenue growth in every quarter with year-over-year growth beginning in the second or third quarter. This is a major milestone for us, and we've turned the corner on revenue with recent wins starting to kick in and some of our headwinds starting to fade. Our EBITDA margin obviously ran hot in Q1. With more normal EAC performance, we expect adjusted EBITDA to decline in Q2 and to benefit from new business wins as the year progresses.
Now back to Larry for some closing remarks."

And we've also -- I think we're doing great with shared services both e-commerce and at NASA. So Paul and his leadership team with Kevin Connell and others, they are just doing great. And as Dave pointed out, you can see in the Q, we had real growth in what is supposed to be our most stressed segment. So what we're looking for is continue to bid and see that pipeline expand while then taking advantage of what the markets are allowing in Defense and Intelligence where we need to flip to a growth model as we begin to work our way through some of those headwinds. They're beginning to pay."

And everybody works to security in the cloud. But for example, we work with Red Hat and have an open environment in our softcore stack for our FISMA High cloud. And it's one wear if there's ever, God forbid, a cyber event, the government forensic experts would have 100% access and visibility anywhere in our stack and we would welcome them to go below the control plane and really have unfettered access to our cloud inside their firewall, inside their DISA deck. And our mindset was security first and then think about how we can scale with them to make it useful as they think about both compute and data. But then how do we really be thoughtful about the business model and one that aligns with how Azure or Amazon think about the future and making that palatable and easy for the defense customer. So I think it was our alignment and passion for working with our partners but the recognition that if you didn't have that private cloud focused on security inside the deck, you'll never expand an ATO to the wonderful public cloud work that Amazon or Azure are doing for a different environment, a safer environment or future environment."

We began fiscal year 2018 with strong performance across the business that sets the stage for us to meet all our guided metrics for the year. We continue to execute on the twin hallmarks of CSRA: excellent",1981,"Thank you, Stuart, and good afternoon, everyone. We began fiscal year 2018 with strong performance across the business that sets the stage for us to meet all our guided metrics for the year. We continue to execute on the twin hallmarks of CSRA: excellent profitability and business development success. 
Adjusted EBITDA was up 5% year-over-year, and adjusted EBITDA and EPS both exceeded consensus estimates. We also achieved a book-to-bill ratio of 1.3x, anchored by the Defense Department's milCloud win, a $498 million cloud development and migration award that underscores our leadership position in next-generation IT. 
Dave will do a deeper dive on the financials, and I'll focus on 4 key topics: first, our view on the market; second, our leadership in next-generation IT; third, our success in business development; and fourth and really important, employee engagement.
First, our view of the market. We remain convinced that the federal government market will support our growth objectives over our planning horizon. The Appropriations Committees in the House and Senate are working their process for the coming government fiscal year, which begins October 1. So far we've seen some increases in spending and some decreases, but none of these decreases were of the magnitude proposed in the President's budget. We think the most likely outcome and scenario is that the government will begin the fiscal year with a continuing resolution that extends FY '17's robust funding. Congress will also need to raise the debt ceiling in the fall. The talks to avoid a government shutdown and the credit default will surely grab the headlines, but our customers are continuing to operate and focus on their missions. Procurements are moving through the system, and programs are ramping normally. 
Even with a divided Congress, there are some areas of strong bipartisan support, and IT modernization is one of them. For example, in May, the House passed the Modernizing Government Technology Act, which would establish and authorize $500 million for a government-wide technology modernization fund. Large agencies would be authorized to set up their own IT working capital funds that could be used to replace legacy systems, move to the cloud and invest in cybersecurity. Our entire industry is solidly behind this bill, which is being championed by Congressman Will Hurd from Texas. Congressman Hurd served in the CIA for nearly a decade. He's worked in the private sector advising on cybersecurity. He knows our industry. CSRA welcomes the efforts of members of Congress like Will who will work across the aisle to forward good common sense ideas that further the mission of government. 
Second, the employees of CSRA are a next-generation IT leaders for this federal government. A few weeks ago, we were excited to demonstrate our next-generation thought leadership through a conference call with investors on cloud adoption in the federal government space. Our Chief Technology Officer, Yogesh Khanna, with great support from our partners both Microsoft and Service Now discussed the specific drivers in the federal market and the important trends that we see going forward. The call was well attended, and the feedback has been really positive. We plan to hold similar calls in the future working together with our partners to shine a light on additional next-generation technologies and how they can further the mission of our customers.
One of the key messages from the call was our approach to working with technology partners, especially to identify and apply advances in technology. Public sector organizations increasingly require new and creative approaches to fulfill their complex missions. That's why from our inception, we've looked to continually expand our circle of partners to include companies focused on next-generation innovation and agility. 
Over the past year, we've partnered with 19 emerging tech companies from Silicon Valley and beyond to deliver innovative solutions to public sector organizations. And be clear, our search continues. In May, we showcased 8 new contenders for more than 120 companies considered at our third emerging technology day, which showcased artificial intelligence and automation. Our emerging technology initiative is designed to foster ideas, make connections and hasten adoption. Representatives from the featured companies presented their solutions to an audience of more than 50 government customers and 200 of our own CSRA project managers. We matched our deep mission understanding and experience working with the federal government with a groundbreaking innovation to create positive mission outcomes quickly for our customers. 
Our thought leadership is also evident in the work that our customers entrust to us. As I mentioned earlier, our largest win in the quarter was the $498 million milCloud award. On this contract, we'll provide the Defense Department with a robust and resilient private cloud infrastructure for a variety of highly protected workloads and prepare essential business processes for later, broader use in the Defense Department's IT cloud portfolio. This win was a great team effort with John Anderson and Damon Bramble bringing the customer perspective, Dan Prestel, architecting the solution and Donald Robinson providing technical leadership, truly a great success for the company and a game changer. 
We're now positioned as the industry leader for cloud and military IT. With stringent security concerns, the Defense Department has lagged a bit compared to other government organizations in movement to the cloud. Now the department is ready to take the next step in its IT transformation. And we're excited to continue this partnership with the military and provide our experts and resources to meet or exceed their demands. 
Initially, we'll be installing cloud infrastructure at 2 DISA data centers in Alabama and Oklahoma. During this startup phase, security is a major imperative. We will take the appropriate time to achieve the authority to operate so that our fiscal year 2019 will show us the ability to ramp the program aggressively as we move workloads to the milCloud. 
The contract will also allow us to expand our alliance partner offerings, including public cloud, storage, service providers, database and more. CSRA's winning cloud solution also provided a much lower total cost of ownership and allows the department to consolidate their computer infrastructure through the as-a-service model. This will engender greater efficiencies for onboarding DoD consumers, reducing their cost, increasing the efficiency of computing platforms and increase the overall IT security posture of the United States government. The contract will also leverage talent and capabilities out of our own Integrated Technology Center in Bossier City, Louisiana. 
To conclude on this point, technical thought leadership is central to our strategy. It is the linchpin to the 3 primary competitive differentiators that we have described as core to our company: customer intimacy, innovation and outcome-based delivery. It helps us engage with our customers around their future direction. It enables us to innovate for our customers for better outcomes. And it helps us drive to an as-a-service solution where customers reward us for outcomes instead of inputs. Thought leadership doesn't just happen. We invest in it because we see it as integral to our future and part of just who we are. 
That brings me to my third point. Our business development results continue to demonstrate the competitiveness of our strategy and our offerings. milCloud was the largest win, but we had solid business development performance across the board. We achieved $1.6 billion in bookings for a book-to-bill ratio of 1.3x. This marks the tenth straight quarter with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.0 or greater. Our trailing 12 months book-to-bill ratio increased to 1.5x. Total backlog at the end of the quarter was $15.6 billion, which is up 3% sequentially. And funded backlog was $2.5 billion, which was up 2% sequentially. Our submit volume for the quarter, it was massive, $7.4 billion in total and $5.1 billion of that in new work. As a result, at the end of the quarter, we had $14 billion in submits outstanding. And looking only at new business, we had about $8.4 billion awaiting decision, including 22 opportunities that are each greater than $100 million in total value. This volume supports our view that the second quarter could be even more robust than is normal for the end of the government fiscal year. 
Finally, I want to update you all on our 2 large outstanding recompetes: Greenway and impact. The decision on our prime Greenway bid known GES continues to track for late August or early September. Remember that there are 3 pieces to Greenway. The first of the regional infrastructure support contracts, known as RIS 1, is likely to be awarded first, followed shortly by GES with the RIS 2 contract likely delayed several months after GES is awarded. On impact, as reported in the press and filed on GIO website, we filed a pre-award protest because TSA was not following the process that they had laid out for the procurement as required by regulation. TSA now has indicated that they plan to reopen discussions and seek another round of proposal submissions to address the concerns that we raised. We've had preliminary indications from TSA and are looking forward to receiving the details of TSA's corrective actions to include timing of revised submissions and projected award date. We are now operating on a bridge contract that extends our performance on the contract potentially through June of 2018. We are working well with the end customer. We remain dedicated to the TSA mission. And we continue to receive new casting on this important mission.
Fourth, our employees are engaged, and we are committed to strike on that engagement. In Q1, we conducted our first employee engagement survey. With excellent participation and candid responses, we now have a solid baseline of employee sentiment. In identifying what is resonating well and what needs to be better, stronger and more compelling, we can continue to build a CSRA culture that inspires a sense of pride and engagement for all employees. Going forward, we can make even more informed decisions about where to focus, where to improve. We achieved an engagement score out of the gate of 72% favorable, a positive result that we can build upon. What came shining through was a shared commitment to and recognition of our cultures and values, with scores approaching and into the 90s across the board. Our employees almost uniformly see that CSRA enabled them to perform meaningful work for our customers in an environment where we hold ourselves accountable for delivering service excellence where we operate with integrity, where we set the highest standards for honesty and ethical behavior and where we treat people with dignity, respect regardless of their position. 
This is exactly how I see CSRA as well. In fact, I've joined the CEO Action for Diversity and Inclusion Coalition and have committed CSRA to cultivate a workplace where perspectives and experiences are welcomed and respected and where employees feel encouraged to discuss diversity and inclusion. CSRA is committed to a point of view on diversity and inclusion that shapes our decisions, shapes our actions, improves the employee experience and motivates us to provide innovation and imaginative next generations for our customers. In taking the pledge to advance diversity and inclusion practices, both within our own walls and outside of them, we take the next step in our commitment to building an inclusive culture at CSRA in which all employees can bring their whole selves and have the opportunity to thrive. 
While we're encouraged to see that employees are engaged and we score higher on our core culture and values, we've got more work to do around improving career development paths and strengthening the ties across organizational boundaries. We're implementing specific programs to address these areas as part of our goal of becoming an employer of choice. Achieving and sustaining that goal will require continued effort and leadership in every level of the company.
Now Dave will provide more detail on the financial results and the forward outlook. And then I'll come back with some closing remarks."
301669938,530052680,1275546,"CSRA Inc., Q1 2018 Earnings Call, Aug 09, 2017",2017-08-09,"Earnings Calls","CSRA Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Larry, and good afternoon, everyone. As Larry said, we had another strong quarter across the board. Revenue and cash performance were essentially in line with our plan, and earnings performance was excellent.Turning to Slide 5, let me hit the hi",990,"Thanks, Larry, and good afternoon, everyone. As Larry said, we had another strong quarter across the board. Revenue and cash performance were essentially in line with our plan, and earnings performance was excellent.
Turning to Slide 5, let me hit the high points of the income statement. Revenue for the quarter was $1.23 billion, down 2% compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2017. Following the pattern we established last year, the year-over-year revenue decline continues to improve. And we expect the comparison to turn positive in our second or third quarter. 
Civil segment revenues increased 3% compared to revenues from the same period of the prior year, driven by the expansion of several recent program wins, including OPM background investigations, HIGLAS and SEC. Defense and Intelligence segment revenues decreased 8% year-over-year. The primary drivers of this decline were the army and logistics organization programs and the STRATCOM IT capabilities contract. Recent new business wins in the Defense and Intelligence segment, including the CECOM logistics support, DIA ESOC and joint service provider contracts are continuing to ramp. And the segment should show positive growth later this year. 
Our contract mix was relatively unchanged with 45% of quarterly revenue on fixed-price contracts, 21% on time and material contracts and 34% on cost-plus contracts. 
Earnings performance was very strong in the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $204 million, which was up 5% year-over-year. The adjusted EBITDA margin of 16.6% was higher even than last quarter and above what we expect for the year, which reflected great work throughout the company, especially our program managers delivering excellent performance. 
Net EAC adjustments on fixed-price contracts for the quarter totaled $12 million, which was up $9 million from last year's Q1 EACs. We see the $3 million to $5 million range as our normal level of quarterly EACs, which primarily result from changes in the risk reserves on fixed-price contracts. 
Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.48, unchanged from the first quarter of fiscal year 2017. Our effective tax rate this quarter was 36.5%, which was about 0.8 percentage points higher than in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017 and a little below our expected long-term rate. 
D&A has come up a bit from where it had been running, based primarily on additional capital leases to support growth on our flight school 21 program and some additional enterprise software costs. GAAP D&A shows a year-over-year decline from $65 million to $60 million. Removing the acquisition-related intangible amortization in both periods including the amortization of the SRA contract backlog in Q1 of FY '17 shows an increase in D&A included in our adjusted EPS from $34 million to $43 million. The shift from operating to capitalized expenses had the effect of leaving EPS in line with our model and EBITDA running a little ahead. 
The key items to reconcile to GAAP include pension income of $21 million, acquisition-related intangibles amortization of $17 million and pretax merger and integration costs of $5 million. As noted in our press release, the acquisition-related intangible amortizations includes a $5 million amortization expense related to the write-off of software that came over to us as part of the spin. 
In the first quarter, we completed integration of our human resources systems. We expect to complete integration of our finance and accounting systems by the end of our fiscal year, at which time the merger and integration costs would be minimal.
Now turning to Slide 6. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $87 million, and free cash flow was $76 million. In Q1, we returned $31 million to shareholders, including $17 million in dividends and $14 million in share repurchases. As of June 30, 2017, we have $194 million in cash and cash equivalents and $2.6 billion in debt, excluding our capital lease obligations. The balance sheet and cash flow statements for the quarter are complicated by 2 factors: the repricing of some of our term loans and the NES acquisition. In June, we were able to amend our term loan B facility and reduced the interest rate by 0.5 percentage points. With the spread between our term loan A1 and B rates now being so low, we shifted about $184 million from the term loan A1 loan facility to the amended term loan B facility to extend the duration by 4 years. As part of that transaction, we wrote off $1.7 million of deferred financing fees related to an earlier amendment and recorded an additional $1.5 million of deferred financing fees related to this amendment. 
At the end of June, we drew $55 million in our revolving credit facility to fund the NES acquisition. The full purchase payment of $105 million will be reflected in our Q2 financial statements.
Now on to the forward outlook. As shown on Slide 7, we're reaffirming our guidance for fiscal year 2018, including revenue between $5 billion and $5.2 billion, adjusted EBITDA between $770 million and $800 million, adjusted diluted earnings per share between $1.88 and $2 and free cash flow between $330 million and $380 million. Revenue visibility has improved since our last call. At the midpoint of guidance, we now expect that about 91% of revenue would come from existing business, which is up from about 85%. Of the remaining 9%, more than 5% would come from recompetes, with the remainder from new business. 
Walking through the rest of the year, we expect sequential revenue growth in every quarter with year-over-year growth beginning in the second or third quarter. This is a major milestone for us, and we've turned the corner on revenue with recent wins starting to kick in and some of our headwinds starting to fade. Our EBITDA margin obviously ran hot in Q1. With more normal EAC performance, we expect adjusted EBITDA to decline in Q2 and to benefit from new business wins as the year progresses.
Now back to Larry for some closing remarks."

We began fiscal year 2018 with strong performance across the business that sets the stage for us to meet all our guided metrics for the year. We continue to execute on the twin hallmarks of CSRA: excellent",1983,"Thank you, Stuart, and good afternoon, everyone. We began fiscal year 2018 with strong performance across the business that sets the stage for us to meet all our guided metrics for the year. We continue to execute on the twin hallmarks of CSRA: excellent profitability and business development success. 
Adjusted EBITDA was up 5% year-over-year, and adjusted EBITDA and EPS both exceeded consensus estimates. We also achieved a book-to-bill ratio of 1.3x, anchored by the Defense Department's milCloud win, a $498 million cloud development and migration award that underscores our leadership position in next-generation IT. 
Dave will do a deeper dive on the financials, and I'll focus on 4 key topics: first, our view on the market; second, our leadership in next-generation IT; third, our success in business development; and fourth and really important, employee engagement.
First, our view of the market. We remain convinced that the federal government market will support our growth objectives over our planning horizon. The Appropriations Committees in the House and Senate are working their process for the coming government fiscal year, which begins October 1. So far we've seen some increases in spending and some decreases, but none of these decreases were of the magnitude proposed in the President's budget. We think the most likely outcome and scenario is that the government will begin the fiscal year with a continuing resolution that extends FY '17's robust funding. Congress will also need to raise the debt ceiling in the fall. The talks to avoid a government shutdown and the credit default will surely grab the headlines, but our customers are continuing to operate and focus on their missions. Procurements are moving through the system, and programs are ramping normally. 
Even with a divided Congress, there are some areas of strong bipartisan support, and IT modernization is one of them. For example, in May, the House passed the Modernizing Government Technology Act, which would establish and authorize $500 million for a government-wide technology modernization fund. Large agencies would be authorized to set up their own IT working capital funds that could be used to replace legacy systems, move to the cloud and invest in cybersecurity. Our entire industry is solidly behind this bill, which is being championed by Congressman Will Hurd from Texas. Congressman Hurd served in the CIA for nearly a decade. He's worked in the private sector advising on cybersecurity. He knows our industry. CSRA welcomes the efforts of members of Congress like Will who will work across the aisle to forward good common sense ideas that further the mission of government. 
Second, the employees of CSRA are a next-generation IT leaders for this federal government. A few weeks ago, we were excited to demonstrate our next-generation thought leadership through a conference call with investors on cloud adoption in the federal government space. Our Chief Technology Officer, Yogesh Khanna, with great support from our partners both Microsoft and Service Now, discussed the specific drivers in the federal market and the important trends that we see going forward. The call was well attended, and the feedback has been really positive. We plan to hold similar calls in the future, working together with our partners to shine a light on additional next-generation technologies and how they can further the mission of our customers.
One of the key messages from the call was our approach to working with technology partners, especially to identify and apply advances in technology. Public sector organizations increasingly require new and creative approaches to fulfill their complex missions. That's why from our inception, we've looked to continually expand our circle of partners to include companies focused on next-generation innovation and agility. 
Over the past year, we've partnered with 19 emerging tech companies from Silicon Valley and beyond to deliver innovative solutions to public sector organizations. And be clear, our search continues. In May, we showcased 8 new contenders for more than 120 companies considered at our third emerging technology day, which showcased artificial intelligence and automation. Our emerging technology initiative is designed to foster ideas, make connections and hasten adoption. Representatives from the featured companies presented their solutions to an audience of more than 50 government customers and 200 of our own CSRA project managers. We matched our deep mission understanding and experience working with the federal government with a groundbreaking innovation to create positive mission outcomes quickly for our customers. 
Our thought leadership is also evident in the work that our customers entrust to us. As I mentioned earlier, our largest win in the quarter was the $498 million milCloud award. On this contract, we'll provide the Defense Department with a robust and resilient private cloud infrastructure for a variety of highly protected workloads and prepare essential business processes for later, broader use in the Defense Department's IT cloud portfolio. This win was a great team effort with John Anderson and Damon Bramble bringing the customer perspective, Dan Prestel, architecting the solution and Donald Robinson providing technical leadership, truly a great success for the company and a game changer. 
We're now positioned as the industry leader for cloud and military IT. With stringent security concerns, the Defense Department has lagged a bit compared to other government organizations in movement to the cloud. Now the department is ready to take the next step in its IT transformation. And we're excited to continue this partnership with the military and provide our experts and resources to meet or exceed their demands. 
Initially, we'll be installing cloud infrastructure at 2 DISA data centers in Alabama and Oklahoma. During this startup phase, security is a major imperative. We will take the appropriate time to achieve the authority to operate so that our fiscal year 2019 will show us the ability to ramp the program aggressively as we move workloads to the milCloud. 
The contract will also allow us to expand our alliance partner offerings, including public cloud, storage, service providers, database and more. CSRA's winning FISMA cloud solution also provided a much lower total cost of ownership and allows the department to consolidate their computer infrastructure through the as-a-service model. This will engender greater efficiencies for onboarding DoD consumers, reducing their cost, increasing the efficiency of computing platforms and increase the overall IT security posture of the United States government. The contract will also leverage talent and capabilities out of our own Integrated Technology Center in Bossier City, Louisiana. 
To conclude on this point, technical thought leadership is central to our strategy. It is the linchpin to the 3 primary competitive differentiators that we have described as core to our company: customer intimacy, innovation and outcome-based delivery. It helps us engage with our customers around their future direction. It enables us to innovate for our customers for better outcomes. And it helps us drive to an as-a-service solution where customers reward us for outcomes instead of inputs. Thought leadership doesn't just happen. We invest in it because we see it as integral to our future and part of just who we are. 
That brings me to my third point. Our business development results continue to demonstrate the competitiveness of our strategy and our offerings. milCloud was the largest win, but we had solid business development performance across the board. We achieved $1.6 billion in bookings for a book-to-bill ratio of 1.3x. This marks the tenth straight quarter with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.0 or greater. Our trailing 12 months book-to-bill ratio increased to 1.5x. Total backlog at the end of the quarter was $15.6 billion, which is up 3% sequentially. And funded backlog was $2.5 billion, which was up 2% sequentially. Our submit volume for the quarter, it was massive, $7.4 billion in total and $5.1 billion of that in new work. As a result, at the end of the quarter, we had $14 billion in submits outstanding. And looking only at new business, we had about $8.4 billion awaiting decision, including 22 opportunities that are each greater than $100 million in total value. This volume supports our view that the second quarter could be even more robust than is normal for the end of the government fiscal year. 
Finally, I want to update you all on our 2 large outstanding recompetes: Greenway and impact. The decision on our prime Greenway bid known as GES continues to track for late August or early September. Remember that there are 3 pieces to Greenway. The first of the regional infrastructure support contracts, known as RIS 1, is likely to be awarded first, followed shortly by GES with the RIS 2 contract likely delayed several months after GES is awarded. On impact, as reported in the press and filed on GIO's website, we filed a pre-award protest because TSA was not following the process that they had laid out for the procurement as required by regulation. TSA now has indicated that they plan to reopen discussions and seek another round of proposal submissions to address the concerns that we raised. We've had preliminary indications from TSA and are looking forward to receiving the details of TSA's corrective actions to include timing of revised submissions and projected award date. We are now operating on a bridge contract that extends our performance on the contract potentially through June of 2018. We are working well with the end customer. We remain dedicated to the TSA mission. And we continue to receive new tasking on this important mission.
Fourth, our employees are engaged, and we are committed to strengthen that engagement. In Q1, we conducted our first employee engagement survey. With excellent participation and candid responses, we now have a solid baseline of employee sentiment. In identifying what is resonating well and what needs to be better, stronger and more compelling, we can continue to build a CSRA culture that inspires a sense of pride and engagement for all employees. Going forward, we can make even more informed decisions about where to focus, where to improve. We achieved an engagement score out of the gate of 72% favorable, a positive result that we can build upon. What came shining through was a shared commitment to and recognition of our cultures and values, with scores approaching and into the 90s across the board. Our employees almost uniformly see that CSRA enabled them to perform meaningful work for our customers in an environment where we hold ourselves accountable for delivering service excellence where we operate with integrity, where we set the highest standards for honesty and ethical behavior and where we treat people with dignity, respect regardless of their position. 
This is exactly how I see CSRA as well. In fact, I've joined the CEO Action for Diversity and Inclusion Coalition and have committed CSRA to cultivate a workplace where perspectives and experiences are welcomed and respected and where employees feel encouraged to discuss diversity and inclusion. CSRA is committed to a point of view on diversity and inclusion that shapes our decisions, shapes our actions, improves the employee experience and motivates us to provide innovation and imaginative next generation solutions for our customers. In taking the pledge to advance diversity and inclusion practices, both within our own walls and outside of them, we take the next step in our commitment to building an inclusive culture at CSRA in which all employees can bring their whole selves and have the opportunity to thrive. 
While we're encouraged to see that employees are engaged and we score high on our core culture and values, we've got more work to do around improving career development paths and strengthening the ties across organizational boundaries. We're implementing specific programs to address these areas as part of our goal of becoming an employer of choice. Achieving and sustaining that goal will require continued effort and leadership in every level of the company.
Now Dave will provide more detail on the financial results and the forward outlook. And then I'll come back with some closing remarks."
301669938,530052680,1275616,"CSRA Inc., Q1 2018 Earnings Call, Aug 09, 2017",2017-08-09,"Earnings Calls","CSRA Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Larry, and good afternoon, everyone. As Larry said, we had another strong quarter across the board. Revenue and cash performance were essentially in line with our plan, and earnings performance was excellent.Turning to Slide 5, let me hit the hi",989,"Thanks, Larry, and good afternoon, everyone. As Larry said, we had another strong quarter across the board. Revenue and cash performance were essentially in line with our plan, and earnings performance was excellent.
Turning to Slide 5, let me hit the high points of the income statement. Revenue for the quarter was $1.23 billion, down 2% compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2017. Following the pattern we established last year, the year-over-year revenue decline continues to improve. And we expect the comparison to turn positive in our second or third quarter. 
Civil segment revenues increased 3% compared to revenues from the same period of the prior year, driven by the expansion of several recent program wins, including OPM background investigations, HIGLAS and SEC. Defense and Intelligence segment revenues decreased 8% year-over-year. The primary drivers of this decline were the army and logistics modernization programs and the STRATCOM IT capabilities contract. Recent new business wins in the Defense and Intelligence segment, including the CECOM logistics support, DIA ESOC and joint service provider contracts are continuing to ramp. And the segment should show positive growth later this year. 
Our contract mix was relatively unchanged with 45% of quarterly revenue on fixed-price contracts, 21% on time and material contracts and 34% on cost-plus contracts. 
Earnings performance was very strong in the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $204 million, which was up 5% year-over-year. The adjusted EBITDA margin of 16.6% was higher even than last quarter and above what we expect for the year, which reflected great work throughout the company, especially our program managers delivering excellent performance. 
Net EAC adjustments on fixed-price contracts for the quarter totaled $12 million, which was up $9 million from last year's Q1 EACs. We see the $3 million to $5 million range as our normal level of quarterly EACs, which primarily result from changes in the risk reserves on fixed-price contracts. 
Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.48, unchanged from the first quarter of fiscal year 2017. Our effective tax rate this quarter was 36.5%, which was about 0.8 percentage points higher than in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017 and a little below our expected long-term rate. 
D&A has come up a bit from where it had been running, based primarily on additional capital leases to support growth on our flight school 21 program and some additional enterprise software costs. GAAP D&A shows a year-over-year decline from $65 million to $60 million. Removing the acquisition-related intangible amortization in both periods, including the amortization of the SRA contract backlog in Q1 of FY '17, shows an increase in D&A included in our adjusted EPS from $34 million to $43 million. The shift from operating to capitalized expenses had the effect of leaving EPS in line with our model and EBITDA running a little ahead. 
The key items to reconcile to GAAP include pension income of $21 million, acquisition-related intangibles amortization of $17 million and pretax merger and integration costs of $5 million. As noted in our press release, the acquisition-related intangible amortizations includes a $5 million amortization expense related to the write-off of software that came over to us as part of the spin. 
In the first quarter, we completed integration of our human resources systems. We expect to complete integration of our finance and accounting systems by the end of our fiscal year, at which time the merger and integration costs would be minimal.
Now turning to Slide 6. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $87 million, and free cash flow was $76 million. In Q1, we returned $31 million to shareholders, including $17 million in dividends and $14 million in share repurchases. As of June 30, 2017, we have $194 million in cash and cash equivalents and $2.6 billion in debt, excluding our capital lease obligations. The balance sheet and cash flow statements for the quarter are complicated by 2 factors: the repricing of some of our term loans and the NES acquisition. In June, we were able to amend our term loan B facility and reduced the interest rate by 0.5 percentage points. With the spread between our term loan A1 and B rates now being so low, we shifted about $184 million from the term loan A1 facility to the amended term loan B facility to extend the duration by 4 years. As part of that transaction, we wrote off $1.7 million of deferred financing fees related to an earlier amendment and recorded an additional $1.5 million of deferred financing fees related to this amendment. 
At the end of June, we drew $55 million in our revolving credit facility to fund the NES acquisition. The full purchase payment of $105 million will be reflected in our Q2 financial statements.
Now on to the forward outlook. As shown on Slide 7, we're reaffirming our guidance for fiscal year 2018, including revenue between $5 billion and $5.2 billion, adjusted EBITDA between $770 million and $800 million, adjusted diluted earnings per share between $1.88 and $2 and free cash flow between $330 million and $380 million. Revenue visibility has improved since our last call. At the midpoint of guidance, we now expect that about 91% of revenue would come from existing business, which is up from about 85%. Of the remaining 9%, more than 5% would come from recompetes, with the remainder from new business. 
Walking through the rest of the year, we expect sequential revenue growth in every quarter with year-over-year growth beginning in the second or third quarter. This is a major milestone for us, and we've turned the corner on revenue with recent wins starting to kick in and some of our headwinds starting to fade. Our EBITDA margin obviously ran hot in Q1. With more normal EAC performance, we expect adjusted EBITDA to decline in Q2 and to benefit from new business wins as the year progresses.
Now back to Larry for some closing remarks."

To help you understand the strength of this board and their commitment to responsible governance, we've begun a series of board interviews, and all of our board members will have their interview be posted to our website. So far, we've captured Billy Williamson, our Audit Committee chair, Sean O'Keefe, our Compensation Committee chair, Michelle Flournoy who chairs non-gov and Mark Franz, known in the venture community as well as serving on our comp committee. They're real assets to CSRA. And I recommend you take a couple of minutes to watch the videos, get to know the board better and appreciate the strong team that we're building here at CSRA.

And my guess is we're going to experience some of that. We've been planning for it with all of our transition planning for the new work. But that's going to be a good challenge and a good problem for us to have as we scale the business and then begin this discovery process. Now don't get me wrong, any time you get a big recompete, there's pressure on profitability. But you also think of how long these contracts age and you look for opportunities as you begin them to bring in new capabilities around cloud that might not have been present in the original RFP. So as we look at our bid model versus our execution model, we'll look to understand the enterprise and improve profitability over the life of a contract."

But then how do we really be thoughtful about the business model and one that aligns with how Azure or Amazon think about the future and making that palatable and easy for the defense customer.

We began fiscal year 2018 with strong performance across the business that sets the stage for us to meet all our guided metrics for the year. We continue to execute on the twin hallmarks of CSRA: excellent",1983,"Thank you, Stuart, and good afternoon, everyone. We began fiscal year 2018 with strong performance across the business that sets the stage for us to meet all our guided metrics for the year. We continue to execute on the twin hallmarks of CSRA: excellent profitability and business development success. 
Adjusted EBITDA was up 5% year-over-year, and adjusted EBITDA and EPS both exceeded consensus estimates. We also achieved a book-to-bill ratio of 1.3x, anchored by the Defense Department's milCloud win, a $498 million cloud development and migration award that underscores our leadership position in next-generation IT. 
Dave will do a deeper dive on the financials, and I'll focus on 4 key topics: first, our view on the market; second, our leadership in next-generation IT; third, our success in business development; and fourth and really important, employee engagement.
First, our view of the market. We remain convinced that the federal government market will support our growth objectives over our planning horizon. The Appropriations Committees in the House and Senate are working their process for the coming government fiscal year, which begins October 1. So far we've seen some increases in spending and some decreases, but none of these decreases were of the magnitude proposed in the President's budget. We think the most likely outcome and scenario is that the government will begin the fiscal year with a continuing resolution that extends FY '17's robust funding. Congress will also need to raise the debt ceiling in the fall. The talks to avoid a government shutdown and the credit default will surely grab the headlines, but our customers are continuing to operate and focus on their missions. Procurements are moving through the system, and programs are ramping normally. 
Even with a divided Congress, there are some areas of strong bipartisan support, and IT modernization is one of them. For example, in May, the House passed the Modernizing Government Technology Act, which would establish and authorize $500 million for a government-wide technology modernization fund. Large agencies would be authorized to set up their own IT working capital funds that could be used to replace legacy systems, move to the cloud and invest in cybersecurity. Our entire industry is solidly behind this bill, which is being championed by Congressman Will Hurd from Texas. Congressman Hurd served in the CIA for nearly a decade. He's worked in the private sector advising on cybersecurity. He knows our industry. CSRA welcomes the efforts of members of Congress like Will who will work across the aisle to forward good common sense ideas that further the mission of government. 
Second, the employees of CSRA are a next-generation IT leaders for this federal government. A few weeks ago, we were excited to demonstrate our next-generation thought leadership through a conference call with investors on cloud adoption in the federal government space. Our Chief Technology Officer, Yogesh Khanna, with great support from our partners both Microsoft and Service Now, discussed the specific drivers in the federal market and the important trends that we see going forward. The call was well attended, and the feedback has been really positive. We plan to hold similar calls in the future, working together with our partners to shine a light on additional next-generation technologies and how they can further the mission of our customers.
One of the key messages from the call was our approach to working with technology partners, especially to identify and apply advances in technology. Public sector organizations increasingly require new and creative approaches to fulfill their complex missions. That's why from our inception, we've looked to continually expand our circle of partners to include companies focused on next-generation innovation and agility. 
Over the past year, we've partnered with 19 emerging tech companies from Silicon Valley and beyond to deliver innovative solutions to public sector organizations. And be clear, our search continues. In May, we showcased 8 new contenders for more than 120 companies considered at our third emerging technology day, which showcased artificial intelligence and automation. Our emerging technology initiative is designed to foster ideas, make connections and hasten adoption. Representatives from the featured companies presented their solutions to an audience of more than 50 government customers and 200 of our own CSRA project managers. We matched our deep mission understanding and experience working with the federal government with a groundbreaking innovation to create positive mission outcomes quickly for our customers. 
Our thought leadership is also evident in the work that our customers entrust to us. As I mentioned earlier, our largest win in the quarter was the $498 million milCloud award. On this contract, we'll provide the Defense Department with a robust and resilient private cloud infrastructure for a variety of highly protected workloads and prepare essential business processes for later, broader use in the Defense Department's IT cloud portfolio. This win was a great team effort with John Anderson and Damon Bramble bringing the customer perspective, Dan Prestel, architecting the solution and Donald Robinson providing technical leadership, truly a great success for the company and a game changer. 
We're now positioned as the industry leader for cloud and military IT. With stringent security concerns, the Defense Department has lagged a bit compared to other government organizations in movement to the cloud. Now the department is ready to take the next step in its IT transformation. And we're excited to continue this partnership with the military and provide our experts and resources to meet or exceed their demands. 
Initially, we'll be installing cloud infrastructure at 2 DISA data centers in Alabama and Oklahoma. During this startup phase, security is a major imperative. We will take the appropriate time to achieve the authority to operate so that our fiscal year 2019 will show us the ability to ramp the program aggressively as we move workloads to the milCloud. 
The contract will also allow us to expand our alliance partner offerings, including public cloud, storage, service providers, database and more. CSRA's winning FISMA cloud solution also provided a much lower total cost of ownership and allows the department to consolidate their computer infrastructure through the as-a-service model. This will engender greater efficiencies for onboarding DoD consumers, reducing their cost, increasing the efficiency of computing platforms and increase the overall IT security posture of the United States government. The contract will also leverage talent and capabilities out of our own Integrated Technology Center in Bossier City, Louisiana. 
To conclude on this point, technical thought leadership is central to our strategy. It is the linchpin to the 3 primary competitive differentiators that we have described as core to our company: customer intimacy, innovation and outcome-based delivery. It helps us engage with our customers around their future direction. It enables us to innovate for our customers for better outcomes. And it helps us drive to an as-a-service solution where customers reward us for outcomes instead of inputs. Thought leadership doesn't just happen. We invest in it because we see it as integral to our future and part of just who we are. 
That brings me to my third point. Our business development results continue to demonstrate the competitiveness of our strategy and our offerings. milCloud was the largest win, but we had solid business development performance across the board. We achieved $1.6 billion in bookings for a book-to-bill ratio of 1.3x. This marks the tenth straight quarter with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.0 or greater. Our trailing 12 months book-to-bill ratio increased to 1.5x. Total backlog at the end of the quarter was $15.6 billion, which is up 3% sequentially. And funded backlog was $2.5 billion, which was up 2% sequentially. Our submit volume for the quarter, it was massive, $7.4 billion in total and $5.1 billion of that in new work. As a result, at the end of the quarter, we had $14 billion in submits outstanding. And looking only at new business, we had about $8.4 billion awaiting decision, including 22 opportunities that are each greater than $100 million in total value. This volume supports our view that the second quarter could be even more robust than is normal for the end of the government fiscal year. 
Finally, I want to update you all on our 2 large outstanding recompetes: Greenway and impact. The decision on our prime Greenway bid known as GES continues to track for late August or early September. Remember that there are 3 pieces to Greenway. The first of the regional infrastructure support contracts, known as RIS 1, is likely to be awarded first, followed shortly by GES with the RIS 2 contract likely delayed several months after GES is awarded. On impact, as reported in the press and filed on GIO's website, we filed a pre-award protest because TSA was not following the process that they had laid out for the procurement as required by regulation. TSA now has indicated that they plan to reopen discussions and seek another round of proposal submissions to address the concerns that we raised. We've had preliminary indications from TSA and are looking forward to receiving the details of TSA's corrective actions to include timing of revised submissions and projected award date. We are now operating on a bridge contract that extends our performance on the contract potentially through June of 2018. We are working well with the end customer. We remain dedicated to the TSA mission. And we continue to receive new tasking on this important mission.
Fourth, our employees are engaged, and we are committed to strengthen that engagement. In Q1, we conducted our first employee engagement survey. With excellent participation and candid responses, we now have a solid baseline of employee sentiment. In identifying what is resonating well and what needs to be better, stronger and more compelling, we can continue to build a CSRA culture that inspires a sense of pride and engagement for all employees. Going forward, we can make even more informed decisions about where to focus, where to improve. We achieved an engagement score out of the gate of 72% favorable, a positive result that we can build upon. What came shining through was a shared commitment to and recognition of our cultures and values, with scores approaching and into the 90s across the board. Our employees almost uniformly see that CSRA enabled them to perform meaningful work for our customers in an environment where we hold ourselves accountable for delivering service excellence where we operate with integrity, where we set the highest standards for honesty and ethical behavior and where we treat people with dignity, respect regardless of their position. 
This is exactly how I see CSRA as well. In fact, I've joined the CEO Action for Diversity and Inclusion Coalition and have committed CSRA to cultivate a workplace where perspectives and experiences are welcomed and respected and where employees feel encouraged to discuss diversity and inclusion. CSRA is committed to a point of view on diversity and inclusion that shapes our decisions, shapes our actions, improves the employee experience and motivates us to provide innovation and imaginative next generation solutions for our customers. In taking the pledge to advance diversity and inclusion practices, both within our own walls and outside of them, we take the next step in our commitment to building an inclusive culture at CSRA in which all employees can bring their whole selves and have the opportunity to thrive. 
While we're encouraged to see that employees are engaged and we score high on our core culture and values, we've got more work to do around improving career development paths and strengthening the ties across organizational boundaries. We're implementing specific programs to address these areas as part of our goal of becoming an employer of choice. Achieving and sustaining that goal will require continued effort and leadership in every level of the company.
Now Dave will provide more detail on the financial results and the forward outlook. And then I'll come back with some closing remarks."
301669938,530052680,1279348,"CSRA Inc., Q1 2018 Earnings Call, Aug 09, 2017",2017-08-09,"Earnings Calls","CSRA Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Larry, and good afternoon, everyone. As Larry said, we had another strong quarter across the board. Revenue and cash performance were essentially in line with our plan, and earnings performance was excellent.Turning to Slide 5, let me hit the hi",989,"Thanks, Larry, and good afternoon, everyone. As Larry said, we had another strong quarter across the board. Revenue and cash performance were essentially in line with our plan, and earnings performance was excellent.
Turning to Slide 5, let me hit the high points of the income statement. Revenue for the quarter was $1.23 billion, down 2% compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2017. Following the pattern we established last year, the year-over-year revenue decline continues to improve. And we expect the comparison to turn positive in our second or third quarter. 
Civil segment revenues increased 3% compared to revenues from the same period of the prior year, driven by the expansion of several recent program wins, including OPM background investigations, HIGLAS and SEC. Defense and Intelligence segment revenues decreased 8% year-over-year. The primary drivers of this decline were the army and logistics modernization programs and the STRATCOM IT capabilities contract. Recent new business wins in the Defense and Intelligence segment, including the CECOM logistics support, DIA ESOC and joint service provider contracts are continuing to ramp. And the segment should show positive growth later this year. 
Our contract mix was relatively unchanged with 45% of quarterly revenue on fixed-price contracts, 21% on time and material contracts and 34% on cost-plus contracts. 
Earnings performance was very strong in the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $204 million, which was up 5% year-over-year. The adjusted EBITDA margin of 16.6% was higher even than last quarter and above what we expect for the year, which reflected great work throughout the company, especially our program managers delivering excellent performance. 
Net EAC adjustments on fixed-price contracts for the quarter totaled $12 million, which was up $9 million from last year's Q1 EACs. We see the $3 million to $5 million range as our normal level of quarterly EACs, which primarily result from changes in the risk reserves on fixed-price contracts. 
Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.48, unchanged from the first quarter of fiscal year 2017. Our effective tax rate this quarter was 36.5%, which was about 0.8 percentage points higher than in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017 and a little below our expected long-term rate. 
D&A has come up a bit from where it had been running, based primarily on additional capital leases to support growth on our flight school 21 program and some additional enterprise software costs. GAAP D&A shows a year-over-year decline from $65 million to $60 million. Removing the acquisition-related intangible amortization in both periods, including the amortization of the SRA contract backlog in Q1 of FY '17, shows an increase in D&A included in our adjusted EPS from $34 million to $43 million. The shift from operating to capitalized expenses had the effect of leaving EPS in line with our model and EBITDA running a little ahead. 
The key items to reconcile to GAAP include pension income of $21 million, acquisition-related intangibles amortization of $17 million and pretax merger and integration costs of $5 million. As noted in our press release, the acquisition-related intangible amortizations includes a $5 million amortization expense related to the write-off of software that came over to us as part of the spin. 
In the first quarter, we completed integration of our human resources systems. We expect to complete integration of our finance and accounting systems by the end of our fiscal year, at which time the merger and integration costs would be minimal.
Now turning to Slide 6. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $87 million, and free cash flow was $76 million. In Q1, we returned $31 million to shareholders, including $17 million in dividends and $14 million in share repurchases. As of June 30, 2017, we have $194 million in cash and cash equivalents and $2.6 billion in debt, excluding our capital lease obligations. The balance sheet and cash flow statements for the quarter are complicated by 2 factors: the repricing of some of our term loans and the NES acquisition. In June, we were able to amend our term loan B facility and reduced the interest rate by 0.5 percentage points. With the spread between our term loan A1 and B rates now being so low, we shifted about $184 million from the term loan A1 facility to the amended term loan B facility to extend the duration by 4 years. As part of that transaction, we wrote off $1.7 million of deferred financing fees related to an earlier amendment and recorded an additional $1.5 million of deferred financing fees related to this amendment. 
At the end of June, we drew $55 million in our revolving credit facility to fund the NES acquisition. The full purchase payment of $105 million will be reflected in our Q2 financial statements.
Now on to the forward outlook. As shown on Slide 7, we're reaffirming our guidance for fiscal year 2018, including revenue between $5 billion and $5.2 billion, adjusted EBITDA between $770 million and $800 million, adjusted diluted earnings per share between $1.88 and $2 and free cash flow between $330 million and $380 million. Revenue visibility has improved since our last call. At the midpoint of guidance, we now expect that about 91% of revenue would come from existing business, which is up from about 85%. Of the remaining 9%, more than 5% would come from recompetes, with the remainder from new business. 
Walking through the rest of the year, we expect sequential revenue growth in every quarter with year-over-year growth beginning in the second or third quarter. This is a major milestone for us, and we've turned the corner on revenue with recent wins starting to kick in and some of our headwinds starting to fade. Our EBITDA margin obviously ran hot in Q1. With more normal EAC performance, we expect adjusted EBITDA to decline in Q2 and to benefit from new business wins as the year progresses.
Now back to Larry for some closing remarks."

Yes, there's stress in the D.C. area, and your time to fill creeps up 10 days or so. But we're also bringing in interns. We've got 110, 111 interns this year, all excited about the company. A good set of them down at Bossier City, Louisiana where we continue to really get rewards from the investment that we've made and the growth in leverage services there. So for us, it's an outlet to give us a bit of balance as we try to grow talent, but I think it's within the normal range of what I've experienced over the last 20, 30 years and we're going to continue to compete based on the quality of the work we do, the excitement of what a next-generation career means for these people and the ability to do mission and be rewarded by it."

And everybody works to security in the cloud. But for example, we work with Red Hat and have an open environment in our software stack for our FISMA High cloud. And it's one where if there's ever, God forbid, a cyber event, the government forensic experts would have 100% access and visibility anywhere in our stack and we would welcome them to go below the control plane and really have unfettered access to our cloud inside their firewall, inside their DISA deck. And our mindset was security first and then think about how we can scale with them to make it useful as they think about both compute and data. But then how do we really be thoughtful about the business model and one that aligns with how Azure or Amazon think about the future and making that palatable and easy for the defense customer. So I think it was our alignment and passion for working with our partners but the recognition that if you didn't have that private cloud focused on security inside the deck, you'll never expand an ATO to the wonderful public cloud work that Amazon or Azure are doing for a NIPR environment, a SIPR environment or future JWICS environment."

With today's earnings announcement, we celebrate a major milestone in the history of CSRA, our first quarter of year-over-year revenue growth. Our team has been building the foundation for growth through susta",2139,"Thank you, Stuart. Good afternoon, everybody. With today's earnings announcement, we celebrate a major milestone in the history of CSRA, our first quarter of year-over-year revenue growth. Our team has been building the foundation for growth through sustained business development excellence, and we posted another strong bookings quarter, highlighted by the successful defense of our largest recompete. Together with last quarter's milCloud 2.0 win, we secured our position as the preeminent platform for cloud and next-generation IT services to the national security market for the next decade. In addition, we're deploying our strong cash flow to accelerate our growth with strategic acquisitions that position us to take share in priority national security markets.
I'll now drill down in each of the 4 statements I just gave to offer insight into how we see our performance, positioning and outlook.
First, we've turned the corner on revenue growth. In the second quarter, revenue was $1.27 billion for our first year-over-year increase and our largest quarter-over-quarter increase since we reformed in November of 2015. We've been building for this moment for some time, and you can feel the additional energy around the company. Growth enables us to invest in our people, expand our opportunities for current employees, invest in next-generation technology differentiators and take on broader missions for our customers. Our year-over-year growth will accelerate through the back half of the year up to and perhaps beyond our long-term target of 2% to 3%, due in part to the critical near-term work we're doing for FEMA that I'll describe in a moment. 
Our market should support continued organic growth over the long term. We're optimistic that Congress will reach agreement to avoid a government shutdown and will override the Budget Control Act caps. As congress reconciles the National Defense Authorization Act, we expect they'll include the Modernizing Government Technology Act, which has now passed both the House and the Senate and will create a 2-year $500 million industrial fund for technology modernization.
Though each next-generation IT program is slow to ramp with a careful, security-first approach to achieving an authority to operate, and investment in the control is essential to the government's certification and accreditation teams, the backdrop for IT modernization and the adoption of cloud technologies is positive, and it's building momentum. Second, business development remains robust. Business development success is the key to revenue growth, and we've prioritized BD investments since our IPO. We've achieved $4.2 billion in bookings in the quarter for a book-to-bill ratio of 3.3, our 11th straight quarter with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.0 or greater. Our trailing 12-month book-to-bill ratio is now up to 1.8. As a result, total backlog at the end of the quarter was $17.7 billion, which was up 14% sequentially. And funded backlog was $2.7 billion, up 11% sequentially. These totals exclude $125 million in wins that were subsequently protested, virtually all of which is new work for CSRA. The key win in the quarter was in the recompete of our largest contract. Under the new 10-year $2.4 billion program, we'll provide enterprise IT for a major Department of Defense agency. We're through the protest period so we've now secured our position as the go-to infrastructure provider for another decade. This was the result of a lot of hard work by an amazing delivery and proposal team led by Leigh Palmer and Ben Gianni. The key differentiator for the win was our elegant technical solution featuring a hybrid infrastructure built with our strategic partners, including Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, Service Now and Cisco as well as dedicated VMware and Oracle stacks. The award of our companion program is currently under protest and until that protest is resolved, we'll meet critical customer needs under our legacy program. Once resolved, we stand ready to introduce innovation and next-generation solutions rapidly to enhance mission success and, of course, to introduce program efficiency. 
Even excluding this large recompete, business development performance was solid across the board with a book-to-bill of 1.4. New business wins in the quarter totaled about $900 million or over $1 billion including the protested wins. And Q3, traditionally the slowest award quarter in our industry, is off to a blazing start, including a $238 million managed services takeaway win at the Department of Veterans Affairs. As is typical, the award was protested, but this is a great win for our health and civil team on a very competitive opportunity. We're optimistic that the substantial new business opportunities scheduled to award in the second half of the year will continue to strengthen our momentum heading into fiscal year 2019. 
Our view is bolstered by the level of proposal and award activity. Submit volume for the quarter was ahead of plan, $6 billion in total and $5 billion in new work. At the end of the quarter, we had $10 billion in submits outstanding, including about $8 billion in new work awaiting decision. 
I'll highlight 2 of our key awards for the quarter to give you an idea of what this team is capable of. The first is $164 million takeaway contract to secure more than 3 million endpoints for the Defense Information System Agency, or DISA. Jim architected a next-generation solution and road map that leverages the cyber talent from NES. We'll work closely with our Microsoft and McAfee partners to enhance this endpoint security and cyber strategy and to protect the Defense Department from internal and external cyber threats. This win exemplifies our leadership position in cyber, especially within the Department of Defense. We have industry-leading experience in moving agencies to a shared service model and training people through our cyber institute, which serves as a prime contractor for the Department of Defense's Defense Cyber Investigative Training Academy, or DCITA, and is an authorized delivery partner of COMPTIA, the Computing Technology Industrial Association. We secure all defense networks and the Pentagon through the joint service provider defensive cyber ops program, and we lead customers through the development and execution of critical IT security best practices such as information assurance, implementing IT security processes and tools and managing security operations centers.
Just last week, we launched the cyber center of excellence led by Dr. Matt McFadden to bring together our next-generation technology and world-renowned cyber experts to provide access to the latest threat intelligence, trends and resources to defend against persistent threats.
This is a virtual center operating out of Columbia, Maryland and our ITC in Bossier City, Louisiana. It leverages our extensive alliance partner network to develop rapid prototype technologies and then test them in our cyber range. These partnerships allow CSRA to provide quick access to the latest cyber innovations and tailor them for government customers. 
The second win that I mentioned that I'd like to highlight is our search support to FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, to provide assistance for survivors of recent disasters, including hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria as well as the California wildfires. This has been an all hands on deck effort under the great leadership of John and Jay Johnson. We submitted our proposal 3 days after the RFP was issued and stood up a fully operational center within a week. The nature of search support will make for some lumpy quarters, but it's the right thing to do, and we're really proud of our team. We care deeply for those affected, and FEMA is a great customer who really gets mission. 
Our recent wins bring me to my third point. The move to next-generation IT is beginning to accelerate, and we are well-positioned to take advantage. Over the last 2 quarters, the combination of wins on milCloud 2.0 and our large IT engineering recompete gave us 8-year and 10 years of prime real estate across both the defense and intelligence community customer sets and helps us create the platform to help lead a transition to managed services using cloud and other next-generation technologies. More customers are looking to adopt cloud solutions, and we are working closely with our strategic partners. 
For example, the Navy R&D community just awarded us a 3-year $35 million contract to provide advanced cloud migration engineering and maintenance services for both Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure. In addition, many customers are looking to accelerate cloud adoption. One great example led by Stone from NES has our company working with Microsoft to enhance the design created and deployed for the Air Force Office 365 cloud-hosted enterprise services or the contract. Our new 0-stack des leverages Azure for Office 365 supporting services typically hosted on premise. The solution minimizes the U.S. Air Force data center footprint while providing a proven rapid path for the Air Force and other government agencies to migrate from legacy on-premise systems to a secure cloud-based Office 365 Azure solution. 
On milCloud 2.0, we are working with DISA to achieve an authority to operate earlier than planned. At DISA, the Navy and elsewhere, we're helping blaze many new trails with the help of great customers to improve the security architectures of cloud-based systems. We also continue to seek out the latest technologies from small, innovative, venture-backed tech firms. We just held our fourth Emerging Technology Day at the end of October featuring 8 companies focused on artificial intelligence, machine learning and predictive analytics that we selected from an initial screen more than 100 companies. We had excellent participation again, including 50 of our government customers. We're actively seeking engagements with participants such as Cylance who uses artificial intelligence to provide cybersecurity that predicts, prevents and protects the enterprise prior to an attack and Data Robot who provides a cloud hosted platform that allows data scientists and business analysts alike to mine open source algorithms to develop accurate predictive models in support of mission need. Cloud storage and compute enabled the power of artificial intelligence to improve and transform enterprises, giving customers better ability to forecast and predict as well as to leverage automation for labor-based cost savings. For example, we're partnering with emerging technology vendors like and Science Logic to forecast system outages and suggested preventive maintenance for our data centers and Pandora to tap a wide variety of data sources to root out and prevent Medicare fraud before it happens. 
CSRA's commitments to next-gen and our broad set of cloud contracts makes us of the platform of choice for integrating Silicon Valley solutions throughout government to increase innovation, efficiency, agility, resiliency, all the while reducing costs. At the same time, each cloud migration program offers startup challenges and requires investment. For example, on milCloud 2.0, we're working closely with our customers to enable adoption, shorten time lines and continue to accelerate cloud transformation for the government's unique risk posture. We're also investing to make cloud adoption easier, leveraging the innovation freedoms provided on the milCloud 2.0 contract. We're investing to ensure success and to create a full complement of next-generation services available from our commercial strategic partners. This will reduce friction in cloud adoption that will accelerate our robust cloud ecosystem for the special needs and the special missions of the Department of Defense. 
Fourth, we're using our balance sheet to spur growth through compelling acquisitions. In the first quarter, we acquired NES for their specific expertise in the defense telecom network fabric infrastructure as well as the applications architecture and implementation. They bring us the trifecta of deep technology discriminators, strong customer relationships and the ability to target near-term opportunities and improve our win. For example, under Jack Curran's great leadership, the NES team continues to upgrade large portions of the Department of Defense network with MPLS in crucial places like South Korea. This will improve network resilience for our forces in Korea, and increased capacity enables better access to cloud-based services. 
Last month, we signed a definitive agreement to acquire Praxis Engineering. The acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions and approvals, and we expect it will be completed late in our third quarter. I see Praxis as another trifecta with robust capabilities and relationships that we can apply towards near-term pursuits. Praxis is squarely focused on mission applications development for the intelligence community. The vast majority of its 350 employees are cleared software and system engineers. Praxis is a great cultural fit for us with a focus on mission success in IT innovation with the best idea wins mindset. Bill Donahue and Jerry and the whole Praxis team are excited to take on a greater portfolio of contracts and customers and lead all CSRA mission works for the intelligence community. 
In closing, acquisitions that fit our criteria don't come along very often, so I'm happy to have found 2 gems back to back, but don't expect this acquisition pace to keep up over the next couple of quarters. Now Dave will provide more detail on the financial results and our forward outlook."

Turning to Slide 5 of the income statement. As Larry said, the highlight of the quarter was our return to revenue growth. Revenue for the quarter was $1.27 billion, up 1% compared to the second quarter of fisca",1470,"Thanks, Larry, and good afternoon, everyone. Turning to Slide 5 of the income statement. As Larry said, the highlight of the quarter was our return to revenue growth. Revenue for the quarter was $1.27 billion, up 1% compared to the second quarter of fiscal year 2017 and up 3% compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. We expect even more year-over-year revenue growth in both the third and fourth quarters. 
Civil segment revenues increased 4% compared to revenues from the same period of the prior year, driven by the expansion of several recent program wins, including OPM background investigations, CMS HIGLAS and our work with the EPA. The FEMA awards that Larry referenced was only a minimum contributor in the second quarter as it had just begun to ramp. 
Defense and Intelligence segment revenues decreased to 3% year-over-year, significantly improved from last quarter. The primary drivers of the decline were again the Army logistics modernization program and the STRATCOM IT capabilities contract. Recent new business wins in the Defense and Intelligence segment including the CECOM logistics support, and joint service provider contracts continued to ramp, and the NES acquisition contributed as well.
Our contract mix was relatively constant. 44% of second quarter revenue was on fixed-price contracts, 21% on timing material contracts and 35% on cost-plus contracts. Adjusted EBITDA was $198 million, which was down 2% year-over-year. The adjusted EBITDA margin of 15.6% was still above our long-term target although below last year's Q2 and this year's Q1 margins. The drivers of the decline included several factors such as investments in early-stage programs and the lower margins on NES revenue. 
Net EAC adjustments on fixed-price contracts for the quarter totaled $8 million, down sequentially and unchanged from last year's Q2 EACs. We still see the $3 million to $5 million range as our normal level of net quarterly EACs, which primarily result from changes in the risk reserves on fixed-price contracts. 
Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.46, down 10% from the second quarter of fiscal year 2017. Our effective tax rate in the quarter was 36.6%, which was about 1.1 percentage point higher than in the second quarter of fiscal year 2017 and a little below our expected long-term rate. 
GAAP D&A shows a year-over-year declined from $63 million to $56 million. Removing the acquisition-related intangible amortization in both periods including the amortization of the SRA contract backlog in Q2 of FY '17 shows an increase in D&A included in our adjusted EPS from $34 million to $42 million. The shift from operating to capitalized expenses, including capital leases to support growth is the primary driver of year-to-date EBITDA running a little ahead and EPS running a bit below the midpoint of our guidance ranges. 
The key items to reconcile to GAAP include pension income of $20 million, acquisition-related intangible amortization of $14 million and pretax merger and integration costs of $9 million.
Now turning to Slide 6. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $72 million, and free cash flow was $14 million. Days sales outstanding for the quarter were 54 days, a sequential improvement of 2 days. 
In Q2, we used $21 million to pay down debt and returned $18 million to shareholders including $16 million in dividends and $2 million in share repurchases. We also completed the NES acquisition for $104 million, including $101 million in cash. The purchase price was funded from cash on hand and $55 million from our revolving credit facility. As of September 29, 2017, we had $91 million in cash and cash equivalents and $2.6 billion in debt, excluding capital lease obligations. 
I'd like to address 3 items that are not on our Q2 balance sheet or statement of cash flows but are important to the story going forward. First, during the third quarter, we'll make a payment of approximately $235 million for Praxis, which we could choose to fund through our $700 million revolver. However, the debt market conditions are very appealing right now, and we're evaluating plans to secure additional financing to fund the acquisition and refinance our shortest duration term loans. Consistent with what Larry said, we remain committed to a balanced capital allocation model and plan to continue to pay down debt and return cash to shareholders. 
Second, as we spun off from CSC, we took ownership of the property in Falls Church that housed CSC's headquarters. We now occupy about 2/3 of the total space as our headquarters with the remainder mostly unoccupied since CSC left shortly after the spin. Last week, we completed a sale-leaseback transaction in which we received $33 million of gross cash proceeds and took on a 12-year operating lease. We'll incur a book loss of approximately $10 million on the transaction and have a favorable loss for tax purposes as well. The book loss will be excluded from our non-GAAP metrics in Q3. 
And third, you won't see any changes in this quarter's financial statements stemming from the 8-K we filed in September related to the dispute with the State of Maryland on the Medicaid enterprise restructuring project, otherwise known as MERP. We will soon appeal the absurd and speculative decision by the State Department of Health, and the case will proceed to the Maryland State Board of Contract Appeals for a fresh review. 
We currently have about $28 million in deferred revenue and $60 million of deferred costs on our balance sheet. No reserve or other change to our accounting is merited under GAAP as we continue to feel very positively about our chances of success in the court proceedings.
Now on to the forward outlook. As shown on Slide 7, we're maintaining our guidance for fiscal year 2018, including revenue between $5 billion and $5.2 billion, adjusted EBITDA between $770 million and $800 million, adjusted diluted earnings per share between $1.88 and $2 and free cash flow between $330 million and $380 million.
Let me give you a little color on where we're trending in each of those ranges. With the successful defense of our largest recompete and another quarter of important new business wins, we expect year-over-year organic growth in the second half of the year, and revenue visibility should continue to improve. At the midpoint of guidance, we now expect that about 98% of our revenue would come from existing business, which is up from about 91% last quarter. Of the remaining 2%, more than half would come from recompetes. We'll also begin to get contribution from Praxis in the back half of the third quarter. Like NES, the Praxis revenue run rate is about equal to its purchase price. So all in, we now expect to be near the top end of our revenue guidance range. 
On EBITDA, after 2 quarters, we're a little more than halfway to the top end of the range. We expect our EBITDA margin to be lower in the second half than the first. Praxis is mostly a cost-plus business so its margins are in the single digits. The additional EBITDA from Praxis puts us closer to the top or potentially slightly above our EBITDA guidance range. 
On EPS, our run rate after 2 quarters puts us at the low end of guidance. After the usual Q3 sequential decline driven by holiday leave taking, we expect EPS performance to accelerate in the fourth quarter as the investments in milCloud 2.0 and other early-stage programs begin to tail off ending up the year in the lower part of the guidance range. Praxis will likely be awash in FY '18 if we end up securing additional debt financing, presumably trading off higher short-term interest cost for more flexibility and lower long-term rate risk. 
Finally, we expect cash flow to follow the same pattern as FY '17 and accelerate in the back half of the year to land us within our guidance range. One cash flow benefit we've generated already in Q3 is our reimbursement for the $25 million payment we made last year related to a CSC divestiture. 
As you think about quarterly revenue progression for the year, the ramp on FEMA and other programs should allow us to overcome most of the usual drop in the December quarter, which has been between 3% and 4% in each of the last 2 years. We should then have even stronger year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter, particularly with the full quarter of Praxis. 
On the adjusted EBITDA and EPS lines, the third quarter will probably be down from Q2 levels due to the usual seasonality and then rebound in the fourth quarter. We're not forecasting any material drop-off in revenue or earnings from the transition on our large recompete win based on the outstanding protest on the companion program.
And with that, operator, we're now ready to take questions."

First, Larry, I just wanted to drill down on what you were saying about next-gen IT contract activity and brewing contract activity building momentum.

So I haven't looked at it as losing market share around C4ISR. It's still important to the department, and you see continued investment around the UAVs especially and through a whole variety of -- from large to small.

You can't do that if you don't have the data storage and the compute and really in the cloud. And what we've seen with the new leadership at the Pentagon is it's just a real forcing function to accelerate adoption with the memo, an RFI on cloud, and we experienced positive acceleration and really great teamwork with customer for milCloud 2.0. So I think there's a realization that you want to take advantage of all of the data that's created by this platforms and be way more creative in having the right algorithms that give an improvement in legality where C4ISR with great data analytics and AI provided by cloud power, it's a weapon. And I think the department recognizes and is supporting it."

We do have some key recompetes. We're  ecstatic to have the next 10 years of runway for that critical intelligence customer. As we're asked earlier, the TSA recompete process is still ongoing as well as the large provider focused recompete which is ongoing in terms of changes in timing and structure, and so we're following that very carefully. The FEMA work that is significant to the second half of this year, we'll see what its long-term implications are. On the flip side, we're ecstatic about the pace of new business we've been able to generate over the past 18 months. We have 25 pending opportunities of $100 million or more, and we feel like we're really well positioned for long-term growth. So hopefully, that gives you a sense for where we are over the next several years where any one year falls in that mix remains to be seen.

With today's earnings announcement, we celebrate a major milestone in the history of CSRA, our first quarter of year-over-year revenue growth. Our team has been building the foundation for growth through susta",2153,"Thank you, Stuart. Good afternoon, everybody. With today's earnings announcement, we celebrate a major milestone in the history of CSRA, our first quarter of year-over-year revenue growth. Our team has been building the foundation for growth through sustained business development excellence, and we posted another strong bookings quarter, highlighted by the successful defense of our largest recompete. 
Together with last quarter's milCloud 2.0 win, we secured our position as the preeminent platform for cloud and next-generation IT services to the national security market for the next decade. In addition, we're deploying our strong cash flow to accelerate our growth with strategic acquisitions that position us to take share in priority national security markets.
I'll now drill down in each of the 4 statements I just gave to offer insight into how we see our performance, positioning and outlook.
First, we've turned the corner on revenue growth. In the second quarter, revenue was $1.27 billion for our first year-over-year increase and our largest quarter-over-quarter increase since we were formed in November of 2015. We've been building for this moment for some time, and you can feel the additional energy around the company. 
Growth enables us to invest in our people, expand our opportunities for current employees, invest in next-generation technology differentiators and take on broader missions for our customers. Our year-over-year growth will accelerate through the back half of the year up to and perhaps beyond our long-term target of 2% to 3%, due in part to the critical near-term work we're doing for FEMA that I'll describe in a moment. 
Our market should support continued organic growth over the long term. We're optimistic that Congress will reach agreement to avoid a government shutdown and will override the Budget Control Act caps. As congress reconciles the National Defense Authorization Act, we expect they'll include the Modernizing Government Technology Act, which has now passed both the House and the Senate and will create a 2-year $500 million industrial fund for technology modernization.
Though each next-generation IT program is slow to ramp with a careful, security-first approach to achieving an authority to operate, and investment in the control is essential to the government's certification and accreditation teams, the backdrop for IT modernization and the adoption of cloud technologies is positive, and it's building momentum. Second, business development remains robust. 
Business development success is the key to revenue growth, and we've prioritized BD investments since our IPO. We've achieved $4.2 billion in bookings in the quarter for a book-to-bill ratio of 3.3x, our 11th straight quarter with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.0x or greater. Our trailing 12-month book-to-bill ratio is now up to 1.8x. As a result, total backlog at the end of the quarter was $17.7 billion, which was up 14% sequentially. And funded backlog was $2.7 billion, up 11% sequentially. These totals exclude $125 million in wins that were subsequently protested, virtually all of which is new work for CSRA. 
The key win in the quarter was in the recompete of our largest contract. Under the new 10-year $2.4 billion program, we'll provide enterprise IT for a major Department of Defense agency. We're through the protest period so we've now secured our position as the go-to infrastructure provider for another decade. 
This win was the result of a lot of hard work by an amazing delivery and proposal team led by Leigh Palmer and Ben Gianni. The key differentiator for the win was our elegant technical solution featuring a hybrid infrastructure built with our strategic partners, including Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, ServiceNow and Cisco as well as dedicated VMware and Oracle stacks. The award of our companion program is currently under protest and until that protest is resolved, we'll meet critical customer needs under our legacy program. Once resolved, we stand ready to introduce innovation and next-generation solutions rapidly to enhance mission success and, of course, to introduce program efficiency. 
Even excluding this large recompete, business development performance was solid across the board with a book-to-bill of 1.4x. New business wins in the quarter totaled about $900 million or over $1 billion including the protested wins. And Q3, traditionally the slowest award quarter in our industry, is off to a blazing start, including a $238 million managed services takeaway win at the Department of Veterans Affairs. As is typical, the award was protested, but this is a great win for our health and civil team on a very competitive opportunity. 
We're optimistic that the substantial new business opportunities scheduled to award in the second half of the year will continue to strengthen our momentum heading into fiscal year 2019. 
Our view is bolstered by the level of proposal and award activity. Submit volume for the quarter was ahead of plan, $6 billion in total and $5 billion in new work. At the end of the quarter, we had $10 billion in submits outstanding, including about $8 billion in new work awaiting decision. 
I'll highlight 2 of our key awards for the quarter to give you an idea of what this team is capable of. The first is a $164 million takeaway contract to secure more than 3 million endpoints for the Defense Information System Agency, or DISA. Jim Matney architected a next-generation solution and road map that leverages the cyber talent from NES. 
We'll work closely with our Microsoft and McAfee partners to enhance this endpoint security and cyber strategy and to protect the Defense Department from internal and external cyber threats. This win exemplifies our leadership position in cyber, especially within the Department of Defense. 
We have industry-leading experience in moving agencies to a shared service model and training people through our cyber institute, which serves as a prime contractor for the Department of Defense's Defense Cyber Investigative Training Academy, or DCITA, and is an authorized delivery partner of CompTIA, the Computing Technology Industry Association. We secure all the defense networks and the Pentagon through the Joint Service Provider Defensive Cyber Ops program, and we lead customers through the development and execution of critical IT security best practices such as information assurance, implementing IT security processes and tools and managing security operations centers.
Just last week, we launched the Cyber Center of Excellence led by Dr. Matt McFadden to bring together our next-generation technology and world-renowned cyber experts to provide access to the latest threat intelligence, trends and resources to defend against persistent threats.
This is a virtual center operating out of Columbia, Maryland and our ITC in Bossier City, Louisiana. It leverages our extensive alliance partner network to develop rapid prototype technologies and then test them in our cyber range. These partnerships allow CSRA to provide quick access to the latest cyber innovations and tailor them for government customers. 
The second win that I mentioned that I'd like to highlight is our search support to FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, to provide assistance for survivors of recent disasters, including hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria as well as the California wildfires. This has been an all hands on deck effort under the great leadership of John Xereas and Jay Johnson. We submitted our proposal 3 days after the RFP was issued and stood up a fully operational center within a week. The nature of search support will make for some lumpy quarters, but it's the right thing to do, and we're really proud of our team. We care deeply for those affected, and FEMA is a great customer who really gets mission. 
Our recent wins bring me to my third point. The move to next-generation IT is beginning to accelerate, and we are well-positioned to take advantage. Over the last 2 quarters, the combination of wins on milCloud 2.0 and our large IT engineering recompete gave us 8-year and 10 years of prime real estate across both the defense and intelligence community customer sets and helps us create the platform to help lead the transition to managed services using cloud and other next-generation technologies. 
More customers are looking to adopt cloud solutions, and we are working closely with our strategic partners. For example, the Navy R&D community just awarded us a 3-year $35 million contract to provide advanced cloud migration engineering and maintenance services for both Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure. In addition, many customers are looking to accelerate cloud adoption. One great example led by Stone Baggiano from NES has our company working with Microsoft to enhance the design created and deployed for the Air Force Office 365 cloud-hosted enterprise services or the CHES contract. 
Our new zero-stack design leverages Azure for Office 365 supporting services typically hosted on premise. The solution minimizes the U.S. Air Force data center footprint while providing a proven rapid path for the Air Force and other government agencies to migrate from legacy on-premise [ sim -- ] systems to a secure cloud-based Office 365 Azure solution. 
On milCloud 2.0, we are working with DISA to achieve an authority to operate earlier than planned. At DISA, the Navy and elsewhere, we're helping blaze many new trails with the help of great customers to improve the security architectures of cloud-based systems. 
We also continue to seek out the latest technologies from small, innovative, venture-backed tech firms. We just held our fourth Emerging Technology Day at the end of October featuring 8 companies focused on artificial intelligence, machine learning and predictive analytics that we selected from an initial screen more than 100 companies. 
We had excellent participation again, including 50 of our government customers. We're actively seeking engagements with participants such as Cylance who uses artificial intelligence to provide cybersecurity that predicts, prevents and protects the enterprise prior to an attack, and DataRobot, who provides a cloud hosted platform that allows data scientists and business analysts alike to mine open source algorithms to develop accurate predictive models in support of mission need. 
Cloud storage and compute enable the power of artificial intelligence to improve and transform enterprises, giving customers better ability to forecast and predict as well as to leverage automation for labor-based cost savings. For example, we're partnering with emerging technology vendors like Perspica and ScienceLogic to forecast system outages and suggested preventive maintenance for our data centers and Pondera to tap a wide variety of data sources to root out and prevent Medicare fraud before it happens. 
CSRA's commitments to next-gen and our broad set of cloud contracts makes us of the platform of choice for integrating Silicon Valley solutions throughout government to increase innovation, efficiency, agility, resiliency, all the while reducing costs. 
At the same time, each cloud migration program offers startup challenges and requires investment. For example, on milCloud 2.0, we're working closely with our customers to enable adoption, shorten time lines and continue to accelerate cloud transformation for the government's unique risk posture. We're also investing to make cloud adoption easier, leveraging the innovation freedoms provided on the milCloud 2.0 contract. 
We're investing to ensure success and to create a full complement of next-generation services available from our commercial strategic partners. This will reduce friction in cloud adoption and it will accelerate our robust cloud ecosystem for the special needs and the special missions of the Department of Defense. 
Fourth, we're using our balance sheet to spur growth through compelling acquisitions. In the first quarter, we acquired NES for their specific expertise in the defense telecom network fabric infrastructure as well as the applications, architecture and implementation. They bring us the trifecta of deep technology discriminators, strong customer relationships and the ability to target near-term opportunities and improve our Pwin. 
For example, under Jack Curran's great leadership, the NES team continues to upgrade large portions of the Department of Defense network with MPLS in crucial places like South Korea. This will improve network resilience for our forces in Korea, and the increased capacity enables better access to cloud-based services. 
Last month, we signed a definitive agreement to acquire Praxis Engineering. The acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions and approvals, and we expect it will be completed late in our third quarter. I see Praxis as another trifecta with robust capabilities and relationships that we can apply towards near-term pursuits. 
Praxis is squarely focused on mission applications development for the intelligence community. The vast majority of its 350 employees are TS/CSI cleared software and system engineers. Praxis is a great cultural fit for us with a focus on mission success and IT innovation with the best idea wins mindset. Bill Donahoo and Jerry Schepers and the whole Praxis team are excited to take on a greater portfolio of contracts and customers and lead all CSRA mission work for the intelligence community. 
In closing, acquisitions that fit our criteria don't come along very often, so we're happy to have found 2 gems back to back, but don't expect this acquisition pace to keep up over the next couple of quarters. Now Dave will provide more detail on the financial results and our forward outlook."

Turning to Slide 5 of the income statement. As Larry said, the highlight of the quarter was our return to revenue growth. Revenue for the quarter was $1.27 billion, up 1% compared to the second quarter of fisca",1472,"Thanks, Larry, and good afternoon, everyone. Turning to Slide 5 of the income statement. As Larry said, the highlight of the quarter was our return to revenue growth. Revenue for the quarter was $1.27 billion, up 1% compared to the second quarter of fiscal year 2017 and up 3% compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. We expect even more year-over-year revenue growth in both the third and fourth quarters. 
Civil segment revenues increased 4% compared to revenues from the same period of the prior year, driven by the expansion of several recent program wins, including OPM background investigations, CMS HIGLAS and our work with the EPA. The FEMA awards that Larry referenced was only a minimal contributor in the second quarter as it had just begun to ramp. 
Defense and Intelligence segment revenues decreased 3% year-over-year, significantly improved from last quarter. The primary drivers of the decline were again the Army Logistics Modernization Program and the STRATCOM IT capabilities contract. Recent new business wins in the Defense and Intelligence segment including the CECOM logistics support, DIA, ESOC and joint service provider contracts continued to ramp, and the NES acquisition contributed as well.
Our contract mix was relatively constant. 44% of second quarter revenue was on fixed-price contracts, 21% on time and material contracts and 35% on cost-plus contracts. Adjusted EBITDA was $198 million, which was down 2% year-over-year. The adjusted EBITDA margin of 15.6% was still above our long-term target although below last year's Q2 and this year's Q1 margins. The drivers of the decline included several factors such as investments in early-stage programs and the lower margins on NES revenue. 
Net EAC adjustments on fixed-price contracts for the quarter totaled $8 million, down sequentially and unchanged from last year's Q2 EACs. We still see the $3 million to $5 million range as our normal level of net quarterly EACs, which primarily result from changes in the risk reserves on fixed-price contracts. 
Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.46, down 10% from the second quarter of fiscal year 2017. Our effective tax rate in the quarter was 36.6%, which was about 1.1 percentage point higher than in the second quarter of fiscal year 2017 and a little below our expected long-term rate. 
GAAP D&A shows a year-over-year declined from $63 million to $56 million. Removing the acquisition-related intangible amortization in both periods including the amortization of the SRA contract backlog in Q2 of FY '17 shows an increase in D&A included in our adjusted EPS from $34 million to $42 million. The shift from operating to capitalized expenses, including capital leases to support growth is the primary driver of year-to-date EBITDA running a little ahead and EPS running a bit below the midpoint of our guidance ranges. 
The key items to reconcile to GAAP include pension income of $20 million, acquisition-related intangible amortization of $14 million and pretax merger and integration costs of $9 million.
Now turning to Slide 6. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $72 million, and free cash flow was $14 million. Days sales outstanding for the quarter were 54 days, a sequential improvement of 2 days. 
In Q2, we used $21 million to pay down debt and returned $18 million to shareholders including $16 million in dividends and $2 million in share repurchases. We also completed the NES acquisition for $104 million, including $101 million in cash. The purchase price was funded from cash on hand and $55 million from our revolving credit facility. As of September 29, 2017, we had $91 million in cash and cash equivalents and $2.6 billion in debt, excluding capital lease obligations. 
I'd like to address 3 items that are not on our Q2 balance sheet or statement of cash flows but are important to the story going forward. First, during the third quarter, we'll make a payment of approximately $235 million for Praxis, which we could choose to fund through our $700 million revolver. However, the debt market conditions are very appealing right now, and we're evaluating plans to secure additional financing to fund the acquisition and refinance our shortest duration term loans. Consistent with what Larry said, we remain committed to a balanced capital allocation model and plan to continue to pay down debt and return cash to shareholders. 
Second, as we spun off from CSC, we took ownership of the property in Falls Church that housed CSC's headquarters. We now occupy about 2/3 of the total space as our headquarters with the remainder mostly unoccupied since CSC left shortly after the spin. 
Last week, we completed a sale-leaseback transaction in which we received $33 million of gross cash proceeds and took on a 12-year operating lease. We'll incur a book loss of approximately $10 million on the transaction and have a favorable loss for tax purposes as well. The book loss will be excluded from our non-GAAP metrics in Q3. 
And third, you won't see any changes in this quarter's financial statements stemming from the 8-K we filed in September related to the dispute with the State of Maryland on the Medicaid Enterprise Restructuring Project, otherwise known as MERP. We will soon appeal the absurd and speculative decision by the State Department of Health, and the case will proceed to the Maryland State Board of Contract Appeals for a fresh review. 
We currently have about $28 million in deferred revenue and $60 million of deferred costs on our balance sheet. No reserve or other change to our accounting is merited under GAAP as we continue to feel very positively about our chances of success in the court proceedings.
Now on to the forward outlook. As shown on Slide 7, we're maintaining our guidance for fiscal year 2018, including revenue between $5 billion and $5.2 billion, adjusted EBITDA between $770 million and $800 million, adjusted diluted earnings per share between $1.88 and $2 and free cash flow between $330 million and $380 million.
Let me give you a little color on where we're trending in each of those ranges. With the successful defense of our largest recompete and another quarter of important new business wins, we expect year-over-year organic growth in the second half of the year, and revenue visibility should continue to improve. At the midpoint of guidance, we now expect that about 98% of our revenue would come from existing business, which is up from about 91% last quarter. Of the remaining 2%, more than half would come from recompetes. 
We'll also begin to get contribution from Praxis in the back half of the third quarter. Like NES, the Praxis revenue run rate is about equal to its purchase price. So all in, we now expect to be near the top end of our revenue guidance range. 
On EBITDA, after 2 quarters, we're a little more than halfway to the top end of the range. We expect our EBITDA margin to be lower in the second half than the first. Praxis is mostly a cost-plus business so its margins are in the single digits. The additional EBITDA from Praxis puts us closer to the top or potentially slightly above our EBITDA guidance range. 
On EPS, our run rate after 2 quarters puts us at the low end of guidance. After the usual Q3 sequential decline driven by holiday leave taking, we expect EPS performance to accelerate in the fourth quarter as the investments in milCloud 2.0 and other early-stage programs begin to tail off, ending up the year in the lower part of the guidance range. Praxis will likely be awash in FY '18 if we end up securing additional debt financing, presumably trading off higher short-term interest cost for more flexibility and lower long-term rate risk. 
Finally, we expect cash flow to follow the same pattern as FY '17 and accelerate in the back half of the year to land us within our guidance range. One cash flow benefit we've generated already in Q3 is our reimbursement for the $25 million payment we made last year related to a CSC divestiture. 
As you think about quarterly revenue progression for the year, the ramp on FEMA and other programs should allow us to overcome most of the usual drop in the December quarter, which has been between 3% and 4% in each of the last 2 years. We should then have even stronger year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter, particularly with the full quarter of Praxis. 
On the adjusted EBITDA and EPS lines, the third quarter will probably be down from Q2 levels due to the usual seasonality and then rebound in the fourth quarter. We're not forecasting any material drop-off in revenue or earnings from the transition on our large recompete win based on the outstanding protest on the companion program.
And with that, operator, we're now ready to take questions."

It's still important to the department, and you see continued investment around the UAVs especially and through a whole variety of -- from large to small. But they create massive amounts of data, and you're seeing that as a forcing function where people are trying to do more work with artificial intelligence and automation to try to cue analysts to change detection. You can't do that if you don't have the data storage and the compute and really in the cloud. And what we've seen with the new leadership at the Pentagon is just a real forcing function to accelerate adoption with the def -- Sec Def memo, an RFI on cloud, and we experienced positive acceleration and really great teamwork with customer for milCloud 2.0.

301669938,539879359,1336885,"CSRA Inc., Q2 2018 Earnings Call, Nov 07, 2017",2017-11-07,"Earnings Calls","CSRA Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Stuart. Good afternoon, everybody. With today's earnings announcement, we celebrate a major milestone in the history of CSRA: our first quarter of year-over-year revenue growth. Our team has been building the foundation for growth through susta",2148,"Thank you, Stuart. Good afternoon, everybody. With today's earnings announcement, we celebrate a major milestone in the history of CSRA: our first quarter of year-over-year revenue growth. Our team has been building the foundation for growth through sustained business development excellence, and we posted another strong bookings quarter, highlighted by the successful defense of our largest recompete. 
Together with last quarter's milCloud 2.0 win, we've secured our position as the preeminent platform for cloud and next-generation IT services to the national security market for the next decade. In addition, we're deploying our strong cash flow to accelerate our growth with strategic acquisitions that position us to take share in priority national security markets.
I'll now drill down in each of the 4 statements I just gave to offer insight into how we see our performance, positioning and outlook.
First, we've turned the corner on revenue growth. In the second quarter, revenue was $1.27 billion for our first year-over-year increase and our largest quarter-over-quarter increase since we were formed in November of 2015. We've been building for this moment for some time, and you can feel the additional energy around the company. 
Growth enables us to invest in our people, expand our opportunities for current employees, invest in next-generation technology differentiators and take on broader missions for our customers. Our year-over-year growth will accelerate through the back half of the year up to and perhaps beyond our long-term target of 2% to 3%, due in part to the critical near-term work we're doing for FEMA that I'll describe in a moment. 
Our market should support continued organic growth over the long term. We're optimistic that Congress will reach agreement to avoid a government shutdown and will override the Budget Control Act caps. As congress reconciles the National Defense Authorization Act, we expect they'll include the Modernizing Government Technology Act, which has now passed both the House and the Senate and will create a 2-year $500 million industrial fund for technology modernization.
Though each next-generation IT program is slow to ramp with a careful, security-first approach to achieving an authority to operate, and investment in the control is essential to the government's certification and accreditation teams, the backdrop for IT modernization and the adoption of cloud technologies is positive, and it's building momentum. 
Second, business development remains robust.  Business development success is the key to revenue growth, and we've prioritized BD investments since our IPO. We've achieved $4.2 billion in bookings in the quarter for a book-to-bill ratio of 3.3x, our 11th straight quarter with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.0x or greater. Our trailing 12-month book-to-bill ratio is now up to 1.8x. As a result, total backlog at the end of the quarter was $17.7 billion, which was up 14% sequentially. And funded backlog was $2.7 billion, up 11% sequentially. These totals exclude $125 million in wins that were subsequently protested, virtually all of which is new work for CSRA. 
The key win in the quarter was the recompete of our largest contract. Under the new, 10-year, $2.4 billion program, we'll provide enterprise IT for a major Department of Defense agency. We're through the protest period so we've now secured our position as the go-to infrastructure provider for another decade. 
This win was the result of a lot of hard work by an amazing delivery and proposal team led by Leigh Palmer and Ben Gianni. The key differentiator for the win was our elegant technical solution, featuring a hybrid infrastructure built with our strategic partners, including Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, ServiceNow and Cisco as well as dedicated VMware and Oracle stacks. The award of a companion program is currently under protest, and until that protest is resolved, we'll meet critical customer needs under our legacy program. Once resolved, we stand ready to introduce innovation and next-generation solutions rapidly to enhance mission success and, of course, to introduce program efficiencies. 
Even excluding this large recompete, business development performance was solid across the board with a book-to-bill of 1.4x. New business wins in the quarter totaled about $900 million or over $1 billion including the protested wins. And Q3, traditionally the slowest award quarter in our industry, is off to a blazing start, including a $238 million managed services takeaway win at the Department of Veterans Affairs. As is typical, the award was protested, but this is a great win for our health and civil team on a very competitive opportunity. 
We're optimistic that the substantial new business opportunities scheduled to award in the second half of the year will continue to strengthen our momentum heading into fiscal year 2019. 
Our view is bolstered by the level of proposal and award activity. Submit volume for the quarter was ahead of plan, $6 billion in total and $5 billion in new work. At the end of the quarter, we had $10 billion in submits outstanding, including about $8 billion in new work awaiting decision. 
I'll highlight 2 of our key awards for the quarter to give you an idea of what this team is capable of. The first is a $164 million takeaway contract to secure more than 3 million endpoints for the Defense Information System Agency, or DISA. Jim Matney architected a next-generation solution and road map that leverages the cyber talent from NES. 
We'll work closely with our Microsoft and McAfee partners to enhance this endpoint security and cyber strategy and to protect the Defense Department from internal and external cyber threats. This win exemplifies our leadership position in cyber, especially within the Department of Defense. 
We have industry-leading experience in moving agencies to a shared service model and training people through our cyber institute, which serves as a prime contractor for the Department of Defense's Defense Cyber Investigative Training Academy, or DCITA, and is an authorized delivery partner of CompTIA, the Computing Technology Industry Association. We secure all the defense networks and the Pentagon through the Joint Service Provider Defensive Cyber Ops program, and we lead customers through the development and execution of critical IT security best practices such as information assurance, implementing IT security processes and tools and managing security operations centers.
Just last week, we launched the Cyber Center of Excellence led by Dr. Matt McFadden to bring together our next-generation technology and world-renowned cyber experts to provide access to the latest threat intelligence, trends and resources to defend against persistent threats.
This is a virtual center operating out of Columbia, Maryland and our ITC in Bossier City, Louisiana. It leverages our extensive alliance partner network to develop rapid prototype technologies and then test them in our cyber range. These partnerships allow CSRA to provide quick access to the latest cyber innovations and tailor them for government customers. 
The second win that I mentioned that I'd like to highlight is our [ surge ] support to FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, to provide assistance for survivors of recent disasters, including hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria as well as the California wildfires. This has been an all-hands-on-deck effort under the great leadership of John Xereas and Jay Johnson. We submitted our proposal 3 days after the RFP was issued and stood up a fully operational center within a week. The nature of [ surge ] support will make for some lumpy quarters, but it's the right thing to do, and we're really proud of our team. We care deeply for those affected, and FEMA is a great customer who really gets mission. 
Our recent wins bring me to my third point. The move to next-generation IT is beginning to accelerate, and we are well-positioned to take advantage. Over the last 2 quarters, the combination of wins on milCloud 2.0 and our large IT engineering recompete gave us 8-year and 10 years of prime real estate across both the defense and intelligence community customer sets and helps us create the platform to help lead the transition to managed services using cloud and other next-generation technologies. 
More customers are looking to adopt cloud solutions, and we are working closely with our strategic partners. For example, the Navy R&D community just awarded us a 3-year $35 million contract to provide advanced cloud migration engineering and maintenance services for both Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure. In addition, many customers are looking to accelerate cloud adoption. One great example, led by Stone Baggiano from NES, has our company working with Microsoft to enhance the design created and deployed for the Air Force Office 365 cloud-hosted enterprise services, or the CHES contract. 
Our new zero-stack design leverages Azure for Office 365, supporting services typically hosted on premise. The solution minimizes the U.S. Air Force data center's footprint, while providing a proven rapid path for the Air Force and other government agencies to migrate from legacy on-premise systems to a secure cloud-based Office 365 Azure solution. 
On milCloud 2.0, we are working with DISA to achieve an authority to operate earlier than planned. At DISA, the Navy and elsewhere, we're helping blaze many new trails with the help of great customers to improve the security architectures of cloud-based systems. 
We also continue to seek out the latest technologies from small, innovative, venture-backed tech firms. We just held our fourth Emerging Technology Day at the end of October featuring 8 companies focused on artificial intelligence, machine learning and predictive analytics that we selected from an initial screen of more than 100 companies. 
We had excellent participation again, including 50 of our government customers. We're actively seeking engagements with participants such as Cylance who uses artificial intelligence to provide cybersecurity that predicts, prevents and protects the enterprise prior to an attack; and DataRobot, who provides a cloud hosted platform that allows data scientists and business analysts alike to mine open source algorithms to develop accurate predictive models in support of mission need. 
Cloud storage and compute enable the power of artificial intelligence to improve and transform enterprises, giving customers better ability to forecast and predict as well as to leverage automation for labor-based cost savings. For example, we're partnering with emerging technology vendors like Perspica and ScienceLogic to forecast system outages and suggested preventive maintenance for our data centers; and Pondera, to tap a wide variety of data sources to root out and prevent Medicare fraud before it happens. 
CSRA's commitments to next-gen and our broad set of cloud contracts makes us of the platform of choice for integrating Silicon Valley solutions throughout government to increase innovation, efficiency, agility, resiliency, all the while reducing costs. 
At the same time, each cloud migration program offers startup challenges and requires investment. For example, on milCloud 2.0, we're working closely with our customers to enable adoption, shorten time lines and continue to accelerate cloud transformation for the government's unique risk posture. We're also investing to make cloud adoption easier, leveraging the innovation freedoms provided on the milCloud 2.0 contract. 
We're investing to ensure success and to create a full complement of next-generation services available from our commercial strategic partners. This will reduce friction in cloud adoption and it will accelerate our robust cloud ecosystem for the special needs and the special missions of the Department of Defense. 
Fourth, we're using our balance sheet to spur growth through compelling acquisitions. In the first quarter, we acquired NES for their specific expertise in the defense telecom network fabric infrastructure as well as the applications, architecture and implementation. They bring us the trifecta of deep technology discriminators, strong customer relationships and the ability to target near-term opportunities and improve our Pwin. 
For example, under Jack Curran's great leadership, the NES team continues to upgrade large portions of the Department of Defense network with MPLS in crucial places like South Korea. This will improve network resilience for our forces in Korea, and the increased capacity enables better access to cloud-based services. 
Last month, we signed a definitive agreement to acquire Praxis Engineering. The acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions and approvals, and we expect it'll be completed late in our third quarter. I see Praxis as another trifecta with robust capabilities and relationships that we can apply towards near-term pursuits. 
Praxis is squarely focused on mission applications development for the intelligence community. The vast majority of its 350 employees are TS/CSI-cleared software and system engineers. Praxis is a great cultural fit for us with a focus on mission success and IT innovation with a 'best idea wins' mindset. Bill Donahoo and Jerry Schepers and the whole Praxis team are excited to take on a greater portfolio of contracts and customers and lead all CSRA mission work for the intelligence community. 
In closing, acquisitions that fit our criteria don't come along very often, so we're happy to have found 2 gems back to back, but don't expect this acquisition pace to keep up over the next couple of quarters. 
Now Dave will provide more detail on the financial results and our forward outlook."

As Larry said, the highlight of the quarter was our return to revenue growth. Revenue for the quarter was $1.27 billion, up 1% compared to the second quarter of fiscal year 2017 and up 3% compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. We expect even more year-over-year revenue growth in both the third and fourth quarters. 
Civil segment revenues increased 4% compared to revenues from the same period of the prior year, driven by the expansion of several recent program wins, including OPM background investigations, CMS HIGLAS and our work with the EPA. The FEMA award that Larry referenced was only a minimal contributor in the second quarter, as it had just begun to ramp. 
Defense and Intelligence segment revenues decreased 3% year-over-year, significantly improved from last quarter. The primary drivers of the decline were again the Army Logistics Modernization Program and the STRATCOM IT capabilities contract. Recent new business wins in the Defense and Intelligence segment, including the CECOM logistics support, DIA, ESOC and joint service provider contracts continued to ramp, and the NES acquisition contributed as well.
Our contract mix was relatively constant. 44% of second quarter revenue was on fixed-price contracts, 21% on time and material contracts and 35% on cost-plus contracts. Adjusted EBITDA was $198 million, which was down 2% year-over-year. The adjusted EBITDA margin of 15.6% was still above our long-term target although below last year's Q2 and this year's Q1 margins. The drivers of the decline included several factors, such as investments in early-stage programs and the lower margins on NES revenue. 
Net EAC adjustments on fixed-price contracts for the quarter totaled $8 million, down sequentially and unchanged from last year's Q2 EACs. We still see the $3 million to $5 million range as our normal level of net quarterly EACs, which primarily result from changes in the risk reserves on fixed-price contracts. 
Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.46, down 10% from the second quarter of fiscal year 2017. Our effective tax rate in the quarter was 36.6%, which was about 1.1 percentage point higher than in the second quarter of fiscal year 2017 and a little below our expected long-term rate. 
GAAP D&A shows a year-over-year decline from $63 million to $56 million.  Removing the acquisition-related intangible amortization in both periods, including the amortization of the SRA contract backlog in Q2 of FY '17, shows an increase in D&A included in our adjusted EPS from $34 million to $42 million. The shift from operating to capitalized expenses, including capital leases to support growth is the primary driver of year-to-date EBITDA, running a little ahead, and EPS running a bit below, the midpoint of our guidance ranges. 
The key items to reconcile to GAAP include pension income of $20 million, acquisition-related intangible amortization of $14 million and pretax merger and integration costs of $9 million.
Now turning to Slide 6. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $72 million, and free cash flow was $14 million. Days sales outstanding for the quarter were 54 days, a sequential improvement of 2 days. 
In Q2, we used $21 million to pay down debt and returned $18 million to shareholders including $16 million in dividends and $2 million in share repurchases. We also completed the NES acquisition for $104 million, including $101 million in cash. The purchase price was funded from cash on hand and $55 million from our revolving credit facility. As of September 29, 2017, we had $91 million in cash and cash equivalents and $2.6 billion in debt, excluding capital lease obligations. 
I'd like to address 3 items that are not on our Q2 balance sheet or statement of cash flows, but are important to the story going forward. First, during the third quarter, we'll make a payment of approximately $235 million for Praxis, which we could choose to fund through our $700 million revolver. However, the debt market conditions are very appealing right now, and we're evaluating plans to secure additional financing to fund the acquisition and refinance our shortest duration term loans. Consistent with what Larry said, we remain committed to a balanced capital allocation model and plan to continue to pay down debt and return cash to shareholders. 
Second, as we spun off from CSC, we took ownership of the property in Falls Church that housed CSC's headquarters. We now occupy about 2/3 of the total space as our headquarters with the remainder mostly unoccupied since CSC left shortly after the spin. 
Last week, we completed a sale-leaseback transaction in which we received $33 million of gross cash proceeds and took on a 12-year operating lease. We'll incur a book loss of approximately $10 million on the transaction and have a favorable loss for tax purposes as well. The book loss will be excluded from our non-GAAP metrics in Q3. 
And third, you won't see any changes in this quarter's financial statements, stemming from the 8-K we filed in September related to the dispute with the State of Maryland on the Medicaid Enterprise Restructuring Project, otherwise known as MERP. We will soon appeal the absurd and speculative decision by the State Department of Health, and the case will proceed to the Maryland State Board of Contract Appeals for a fresh review. 
We currently have about $28 million in deferred revenue and $60 million of deferred costs on our balance sheet. No reserve or other change to our accounting is merited under GAAP as we continue to feel very positively about our chances of success in the court proceedings.
Now on to the forward outlook. As shown on Slide 7, we're maintaining our guidance for fiscal year 2018, including revenue between $5 billion and $5.2 billion, adjusted EBITDA between $770 million and $800 million, adjusted diluted earnings per share between $1.88 and $2 and free cash flow between $330 million and $380 million.
Let me give you a little color on where we're trending in each of those ranges. With the successful defense of our largest recompete and another quarter of important new business wins, we expect year-over-year organic growth in the second half of the year, and revenue visibility should continue to improve. At the midpoint of guidance, we now expect that about 98% of our revenue would come from existing business, which is up from about 91% last quarter. Of the remaining 2%, more than half would come from recompetes. 
We'll also begin to get contribution from Praxis in the back half of the third quarter. Like NES, the Praxis revenue run rate is about equal to its purchase price. So all in, we now expect to be near the top end of our revenue guidance range. 
On EBITDA, after 2 quarters, we're a little more than halfway to the top end of the range. We expect our EBITDA margin to be lower in the second half than the first. Praxis is mostly a cost-plus business, so its margins are in the single digits. The additional EBITDA from Praxis puts us closer to the top or potentially slightly above our EBITDA guidance range. 
On EPS, our run rate after 2 quarters puts us at the low end of guidance. After the usual Q3 sequential decline driven by holiday leave-taking, we expect EPS performance to accelerate in the fourth quarter as the investments in milCloud 2.0 and other early-stage programs begin to tail off, ending out the year in the lower part of the guidance range. Praxis will likely be awash in FY '18 if we end up securing additional debt financing, presumably trading off higher short-term interest cost for more flexibility and lowered long-term rate risk. 
Finally, we expect cash flow to follow the same pattern as FY '17 and accelerate in the back half of the year to land us within our guidance range. One cash flow benefit we've generated already in Q3 is our reimbursement for the $25 million payment we made last year related to a CSC divestiture. 
As you think about our quarterly revenue progression for the year, the ramp on FEMA and other programs should allow us to overcome most of the usual drop in the December quarter, which has been between 3% and 4% in each of the last 2 years. We should then have even stronger year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter, particularly with a full quarter of Praxis. 
On the adjusted EBITDA and EPS lines, the third quarter will probably be down from Q2 levels due to the usual seasonality and then rebound in the fourth quarter. We're not forecasting any material drop-off in revenue or earnings from the transition on our large recompete win based on the outstanding protest on the companion program.
And with that, operator, we're now ready to take questions."

You can't do that if you don't have the data storage and the compute and really in the cloud. And what we've seen with the new leadership at the Pentagon is just a real forcing function to accelerate adoption with a [ def -- Sec Def ] memo, an RFI around cloud, and we experienced positive acceleration and really great teamwork with our DISA customer for milCloud 2.0. So I think there's a realization that you want to take advantage of all of the data that's created by these ISR platforms and be way more creative in having the right algorithms that queue you to give an improvement in lethality, where C4ISR, with great data analytics and AI provided by cloud power, it's a weapon.

301669938,539879359,1341389,"CSRA Inc., Q2 2018 Earnings Call, Nov 07, 2017",2017-11-07,"Earnings Calls","CSRA Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Stuart. Good afternoon, everybody. With today's earnings announcement, we celebrate a major milestone in the history of CSRA: our first quarter of year-over-year revenue growth. Our team has been building the foundation for growth through susta",2148,"Thank you, Stuart. Good afternoon, everybody. With today's earnings announcement, we celebrate a major milestone in the history of CSRA: our first quarter of year-over-year revenue growth. Our team has been building the foundation for growth through sustained business development excellence, and we posted another strong bookings quarter, highlighted by the successful defense of our largest recompete. 
Together with last quarter's milCloud 2.0 win, we've secured our position as the preeminent platform for cloud and next-generation IT services to the national security market for the next decade. In addition, we're deploying our strong cash flow to accelerate our growth with strategic acquisitions that position us to take share in priority national security markets.
I'll now drill down in each of the 4 statements I just gave to offer insight into how we see our performance, positioning and outlook.
First, we've turned the corner on revenue growth. In the second quarter, revenue was $1.27 billion for our first year-over-year increase and our largest quarter-over-quarter increase since we were formed in November of 2015. We've been building for this moment for some time, and you can feel the additional energy around the company. 
Growth enables us to invest in our people, expand our opportunities for current employees, invest in next-generation technology differentiators and take on broader missions for our customers. Our year-over-year growth will accelerate through the back half of the year up to and perhaps beyond our long-term target of 2% to 3%, due in part to the critical near-term work we're doing for FEMA that I'll describe in a moment. 
Our market should support continued organic growth over the long term. We're optimistic that Congress will reach agreement to avoid a government shutdown and will override the Budget Control Act caps. As congress reconciles the National Defense Authorization Act, we expect they'll include the Modernizing Government Technology Act, which has now passed both the House and the Senate and will create a 2-year $500 million industrial fund for technology modernization.
Though each next-generation IT program is slow to ramp with a careful, security-first approach to achieving an authority to operate, and investment in the control is essential to the government's certification and accreditation teams, the backdrop for IT modernization and the adoption of cloud technologies is positive, and it's building momentum. 
Second, business development remains robust. Business development success is the key to revenue growth, and we've prioritized BD investments since our IPO. We've achieved $4.2 billion in bookings in the quarter for a book-to-bill ratio of 3.3x, our 11th straight quarter with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.0x or greater. Our trailing 12-month book-to-bill ratio is now up to 1.8x. As a result, total backlog at the end of the quarter was $17.7 billion, which was up 14% sequentially. And funded backlog was $2.7 billion, up 11% sequentially. These totals exclude $125 million in wins that were subsequently protested, virtually all of which is new work for CSRA. 
The key win in the quarter was the recompete of our largest contract. Under the new, 10-year, $2.4 billion program, we'll provide enterprise IT for a major Department of Defense agency. We're through the protest period so we've now secured our position as the go-to infrastructure provider for another decade. 
This win was the result of a lot of hard work by an amazing delivery and proposal team led by Leigh Palmer and Ben Gianni. The key differentiator for the win was our elegant technical solution, featuring a hybrid infrastructure built with our strategic partners, including Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, ServiceNow and Cisco as well as dedicated VMware and Oracle stacks. The award of a companion program is currently under protest, and until that protest is resolved, we'll meet critical customer needs under our legacy program. Once resolved, we stand ready to introduce innovation and next-generation solutions rapidly to enhance mission success and, of course, to introduce program efficiencies. 
Even excluding this large recompete, business development performance was solid across the board with a book-to-bill of 1.4x. New business wins in the quarter totaled about $900 million or over $1 billion including the protested wins. And Q3, traditionally the slowest award quarter in our industry, is off to a blazing start, including a $238 million managed services takeaway win at the Department of Veterans Affairs. As is typical, the award was protested, but this is a great win for our health and civil team on a very competitive opportunity. 
We're optimistic that the substantial new business opportunities scheduled to award in the second half of the year will continue to strengthen our momentum heading into fiscal year 2019. 
Our view is bolstered by the level of proposal and award activity. Submit volume for the quarter was ahead of plan, $6 billion in total and $5 billion in new work. At the end of the quarter, we had $10 billion in submits outstanding, including about $8 billion in new work awaiting decision. 
I'll highlight 2 of our key awards for the quarter to give you an idea of what this team is capable of. The first is a $164 million takeaway contract to secure more than 3 million endpoints for the Defense Information System Agency, or DISA. Jim Matney architected a next-generation solution and road map that leverages the cyber talent from NES. 
We'll work closely with our Microsoft and McAfee partners to enhance this endpoint security and cyber strategy and to protect the Defense Department from internal and external cyber threats. This win exemplifies our leadership position in cyber, especially within the Department of Defense. 
We have industry-leading experience in moving agencies to a shared service model and training people through our cyber institute, which serves as a prime contractor for the Department of Defense's Defense Cyber Investigative Training Academy, or DCITA, and is an authorized delivery partner of CompTIA, the Computing Technology Industry Association. We secure all the defense networks and the Pentagon through the Joint Service Provider Defensive Cyber Ops program, and we lead customers through the development and execution of critical IT security best practices such as information assurance, implementing IT security processes and tools and managing security operations centers.
Just last week, we launched the Cyber Center of Excellence led by Dr. Matt McFadden to bring together our next-generation technology and world-renowned cyber experts to provide access to the latest threat intelligence, trends and resources to defend against persistent threats.
This is a virtual center operating out of Columbia, Maryland and our ITC in Bossier City, Louisiana. It leverages our extensive alliance partner network to develop rapid prototype technologies and then test them in our cyber range. These partnerships allow CSRA to provide quick access to the latest cyber innovations and tailor them for government customers. 
The second win that I mentioned that I'd like to highlight is our [ surge ] support to FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, to provide assistance for survivors of recent disasters, including hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria as well as the California wildfires. This has been an all-hands-on-deck effort under the great leadership of John Xereas and Jay Johnson. We submitted our proposal 3 days after the RFP was issued and stood up a fully operational center within a week. The nature of [ surge ] support will make for some lumpy quarters, but it's the right thing to do, and we're really proud of our team. We care deeply for those affected, and FEMA is a great customer who really gets mission. 
Our recent wins bring me to my third point. The move to next-generation IT is beginning to accelerate, and we are well-positioned to take advantage. Over the last 2 quarters, the combination of wins on milCloud 2.0 and our large IT engineering recompete gave us 8-year and 10 years of prime real estate across both the defense and intelligence community customer sets and helps us create the platform to help lead the transition to managed services using cloud and other next-generation technologies. 
More customers are looking to adopt cloud solutions, and we are working closely with our strategic partners. For example, the Navy R&D community just awarded us a 3-year $35 million contract to provide advanced cloud migration engineering and maintenance services for both Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure. In addition, many customers are looking to accelerate cloud adoption. One great example, led by Stone Baggiano from NES, has our company working with Microsoft to enhance the design created and deployed for the Air Force Office 365 cloud-hosted enterprise services, or the CHES contract. 
Our new zero-stack design leverages Azure for Office 365, supporting services typically hosted on premise. The solution minimizes the U.S. Air Force data center's footprint, while providing a proven rapid path for the Air Force and other government agencies to migrate from legacy on-premise systems to a secure cloud-based Office 365 Azure solution. 
On milCloud 2.0, we are working with DISA to achieve an authority to operate earlier than planned. At DISA, the Navy and elsewhere, we're helping blaze many new trails with the help of great customers to improve the security architectures of cloud-based systems. 
We also continue to seek out the latest technologies from small, innovative, venture-backed tech firms. We just held our fourth Emerging Technology Day at the end of October featuring 8 companies focused on artificial intelligence, machine learning and predictive analytics that we selected from an initial screen of more than 100 companies. 
We had excellent participation again, including 50 of our government customers. We're actively seeking engagements with participants such as Cylance who uses artificial intelligence to provide cybersecurity that predicts, prevents and protects the enterprise prior to an attack; and DataRobot, who provides a cloud hosted platform that allows data scientists and business analysts alike to mine open source algorithms to develop accurate predictive models in support of mission need. 
Cloud storage and compute enable the power of artificial intelligence to improve and transform enterprises, giving customers better ability to forecast and predict as well as to leverage automation for labor-based cost savings. For example, we're partnering with emerging technology vendors like Perspica and ScienceLogic to forecast system outages and suggested preventive maintenance for our data centers; and Pondera, to tap a wide variety of data sources to root out and prevent Medicare fraud before it happens. 
CSRA's commitments to next-gen and our broad set of cloud contracts makes us of the platform of choice for integrating Silicon Valley solutions throughout government to increase innovation, efficiency, agility, resiliency, all the while reducing costs. 
At the same time, each cloud migration program offers startup challenges and requires investment. For example, on milCloud 2.0, we're working closely with our customers to enable adoption, shorten time lines and continue to accelerate cloud transformation for the government's unique risk posture. We're also investing to make cloud adoption easier, leveraging the innovation freedoms provided on the milCloud 2.0 contract. 
We're investing to ensure success and to create a full complement of next-generation services available from our commercial strategic partners. This will reduce friction in cloud adoption and it will accelerate our robust cloud ecosystem for the special needs and the special missions of the Department of Defense. 
Fourth, we're using our balance sheet to spur growth through compelling acquisitions. In the first quarter, we acquired NES for their specific expertise in the defense telecom network fabric infrastructure as well as the applications, architecture and implementation. They bring us the trifecta of deep technology discriminators, strong customer relationships and the ability to target near-term opportunities and improve our Pwin. 
For example, under Jack Curran's great leadership, the NES team continues to upgrade large portions of the Department of Defense network with MPLS in crucial places like South Korea. This will improve network resilience for our forces in Korea, and the increased capacity enables better access to cloud-based services. 
Last month, we signed a definitive agreement to acquire Praxis Engineering. The acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions and approvals, and we expect it'll be completed late in our third quarter. I see Praxis as another trifecta with robust capabilities and relationships that we can apply towards near-term pursuits. 
Praxis is squarely focused on mission applications development for the intelligence community. The vast majority of its 350 employees are TS/CSI-cleared software and system engineers. Praxis is a great cultural fit for us with a focus on mission success and IT innovation with a 'best idea wins' mindset. Bill Donahoo and Jerry Schepers and the whole Praxis team are excited to take on a greater portfolio of contracts and customers and lead all CSRA mission work for the intelligence community. 
In closing, acquisitions that fit our criteria don't come along very often, so we're happy to have found 2 gems back to back, but don't expect this acquisition pace to keep up over the next couple of quarters. 
Now Dave will provide more detail on the financial results and our forward outlook."

Turning to Slide 5 on the income statement. As Larry said, the highlight of the quarter was our return to revenue growth.

As Larry said, the highlight of the quarter was our return to revenue growth. Revenue for the quarter was $1.27 billion, up 1% compared to the second quarter of fiscal year 2017 and up 3% compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. We expect even more year-over-year revenue growth in both the third and fourth quarters. 
Civil segment revenues increased 4% compared to revenues from the same period of the prior year, driven by the expansion of several recent program wins, including OPM background investigations, CMS HIGLAS and our work with the EPA. The FEMA award that Larry referenced was only a minimal contributor in the second quarter, as it had just begun to ramp. 
Defense and Intelligence segment revenues decreased 3% year-over-year, significantly improved from last quarter. The primary drivers of the decline were again the Army Logistics Modernization Program and the STRATCOM IT capabilities contract. Recent new business wins in the Defense and Intelligence segment, including the CECOM logistics support, DIA, ESOC and joint service provider contracts continued to ramp, and the NES acquisition contributed as well.
Our contract mix was relatively constant. 44% of second quarter revenue was on fixed-price contracts, 21% on time and material contracts and 35% on cost-plus contracts. Adjusted EBITDA was $198 million, which was down 2% year-over-year. The adjusted EBITDA margin of 15.6% was still above our long-term target although below last year's Q2 and this year's Q1 margins. The drivers of the decline included several factors, such as investments in early-stage programs and the lower margins on NES revenue. 
Net EAC adjustments on fixed-price contracts for the quarter totaled $8 million, down sequentially and unchanged from last year's Q2 EACs. We still see the $3 million to $5 million range as our normal level of net quarterly EACs, which primarily result from changes in the risk reserves on fixed-price contracts. 
Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.46, down 10% from the second quarter of fiscal year 2017. Our effective tax rate in the quarter was 36.6%, which was about 1.1 percentage point higher than in the second quarter of fiscal year 2017 and a little below our expected long-term rate. 
GAAP D&A shows a year-over-year decline from $63 million to $56 million. Removing the acquisition-related intangible amortization in both periods, including the amortization of the SRA contract backlog in Q2 of FY '17, shows an increase in D&A included in our adjusted EPS from $34 million to $42 million. The shift from operating to capitalized expenses, including capital leases to support growth is the primary driver of year-to-date EBITDA, running a little ahead, and EPS running a bit below, the midpoint of our guidance ranges. 
The key items to reconcile to GAAP include pension income of $20 million, acquisition-related intangible amortization of $14 million and pretax merger and integration costs of $9 million.
Now turning to Slide 6. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $72 million, and free cash flow was $14 million. Days sales outstanding for the quarter were 54 days, a sequential improvement of 2 days. 
In Q2, we used $21 million to pay down debt and returned $18 million to shareholders including $16 million in dividends and $2 million in share repurchases. We also completed the NES acquisition for $104 million, including $101 million in cash. The purchase price was funded from cash on hand and $55 million from our revolving credit facility. As of September 29, 2017, we had $91 million in cash and cash equivalents and $2.6 billion in debt, excluding capital lease obligations. 
I'd like to address 3 items that are not on our Q2 balance sheet or statement of cash flows, but are important to the story going forward. First, during the third quarter, we'll make a payment of approximately $235 million for Praxis, which we could choose to fund through our $700 million revolver. However, the debt market conditions are very appealing right now, and we're evaluating plans to secure additional financing to fund the acquisition and refinance our shortest duration term loans. Consistent with what Larry said, we remain committed to a balanced capital allocation model and plan to continue to pay down debt and return cash to shareholders. 
Second, as we spun off from CSC, we took ownership of the property in Falls Church that housed CSC's headquarters. We now occupy about 2/3 of the total space as our headquarters with the remainder mostly unoccupied since CSC left shortly after the spin. 
Last week, we completed a sale-leaseback transaction in which we received $33 million of gross cash proceeds and took on a 12-year operating lease. We'll incur a book loss of approximately $10 million on the transaction and have a favorable loss for tax purposes as well. The book loss will be excluded from our non-GAAP metrics in Q3. 
And third, you won't see any changes in this quarter's financial statements, stemming from the 8-K we filed in September related to the dispute with the State of Maryland on the Medicaid Enterprise Restructuring Project, otherwise known as MERP. We will soon appeal the absurd and speculative decision by the State Department of Health, and the case will proceed to the Maryland State Board of Contract Appeals for a fresh review. 
We currently have about $28 million in deferred revenue and $60 million of deferred costs on our balance sheet. No reserve or other change to our accounting is merited under GAAP as we continue to feel very positively about our chances of success in the court proceedings.
Now on to the forward outlook. As shown on Slide 7, we're maintaining our guidance for fiscal year 2018, including revenue between $5 billion and $5.2 billion, adjusted EBITDA between $770 million and $800 million, adjusted diluted earnings per share between $1.88 and $2 and free cash flow between $330 million and $380 million.
Let me give you a little color on where we're trending in each of those ranges. With the successful defense of our largest recompete and another quarter of important new business wins, we expect year-over-year organic growth in the second half of the year, and revenue visibility should continue to improve. At the midpoint of guidance, we now expect that about 98% of our revenue would come from existing business, which is up from about 91% last quarter. Of the remaining 2%, more than half would come from recompetes. 
We'll also begin to get contribution from Praxis in the back half of the third quarter. Like NES, the Praxis revenue run rate is about equal to its purchase price. So all in, we now expect to be near the top end of our revenue guidance range. 
On EBITDA, after 2 quarters, we're a little more than halfway to the top end of the range. We expect our EBITDA margin to be lower in the second half than the first. Praxis is mostly a cost-plus business, so its margins are in the single digits. The additional EBITDA from Praxis puts us closer to the top or potentially slightly above our EBITDA guidance range. 
On EPS, our run rate after 2 quarters puts us at the low end of guidance. After the usual Q3 sequential decline driven by holiday leave-taking, we expect EPS performance to accelerate in the fourth quarter as the investments in milCloud 2.0 and other early-stage programs begin to tail off, ending out the year in the lower part of the guidance range. Praxis will likely be awash in FY '18 if we end up securing additional debt financing, presumably trading off higher short-term interest cost for more flexibility and lowered long-term rate risk. 
Finally, we expect cash flow to follow the same pattern as FY '17 and accelerate in the back half of the year to land us within our guidance range. One cash flow benefit we've generated already in Q3 is our reimbursement for the $25 million payment we made last year related to a CSC divestiture. 
As you think about our quarterly revenue progression for the year, the ramp on FEMA and other programs should allow us to overcome most of the usual drop in the December quarter, which has been between 3% and 4% in each of the last 2 years. We should then have even stronger year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter, particularly with a full quarter of Praxis. 
On the adjusted EBITDA and EPS lines, the third quarter will probably be down from Q2 levels due to the usual seasonality and then rebound in the fourth quarter. We're not forecasting any material drop-off in revenue or earnings from the transition on our large recompete win based on the outstanding protest on the companion program.
And with that, operator, we're now ready to take questions."

You can't do that if you don't have the data storage and the compute and really in the cloud. And what we've seen with the new leadership at the Pentagon is just a real forcing function to accelerate adoption with a [ def -- Sec Def ] memo, an RFI around cloud, and we experienced positive acceleration and really great teamwork with our DISA customer for milCloud 2.0. So I think there's a realization that you want to take advantage of all of the data that's created by these ISR platforms and be way more creative in having the right algorithms that queue you to give an improvement in lethality, where C4ISR, with great data analytics and AI provided by cloud power, it's a weapon.

The sale-leaseback would not be included in our free cash flow line. It'll be a cash inflow to the company but outside of the free cash flow definition. So that is excluded but certainly a helpful contributor to our cash position. The $25 million reimbursement for what we paid out last year is really the only onetime item included in that $330 million to $380 million."

So as we talked about earlier, we're looking carefully at our capital structure right now, and we'll look to have the optimal mix of durations in our debt structure going forward as we think about how to finance the Praxis acquisition. And so it's possible we'll have a longer duration mix of debt on our balance sheet before too long here. Certainly, we feel very good about our ability to cover our interest payments and make significant debt reductions each year as we have in each year to date. That'll continue to be a key element of our cash deployment strategy. So generating well over $300 million of free cash flow per year, you should expect that the debt reduction will be a significant use of that cash in each subsequent year."
