Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. Today, we announced 2016 earnings of $2.68 per share compared to core earnings of $2.56 per share for 2015.

Today, we announced 2016 earnings of $2.68 per share compared to core earnings of $2.56 per share for 2015. Once again, we delivered another year of solid earnings growth driven by the successful execution of our strategy. Marty will discuss the drivers of our 2016 earnings results in a few minutes. But first, I want to highlight some of the key actions we took to successfully execute our strategy in 2016 for the benefit of our customers and shareholders. Starting with our strategy to prudently invest in and operate our utilities in a manner consistent with existing regulatory frameworks. We continue to allocate significant amounts of capital to those businesses that are supported by modern constructive regulatory frameworks for the benefit of our customers. In fact, we invested $2.1 billion in utility infrastructure last year with 2/3, over $1.3 billion, going to projects in the FERC regulated electric transmission and Illinois regulated electric and natural gas distribution businesses. A significant portion of the $1.3 billion was invested in the Illinois Rivers project, a new high voltage transmission line, which will span 385 miles across the state of Illinois. This project remains on schedule for completion in 2019 before it's 9 mine segments energize including 2 river crossings and 8 of 10 substations now in service. This strategic allocation of capital and effective project execution, combined with disciplined cost management, meaningfully contributed to the solid financial results I just discussed. 
Turning to Missouri. In order to earn a fair return on our electric business, we filed a rate review request in July with the Missouri Public Service Commission. We were seeking to recover costs related to infrastructure investments made for the benefit of customers and to remove the negative earnings effect of lower sales to the New Madrid smelter. There was a recent development in this rate review and I will provide an important update in a few minutes. Moving down the page, last year, we also continued to work to enhance our regulatory frameworks and advocate for responsible energy and economic policies. I am pleased to report that we've made very good progress on this strategic focus area as well. Notably, Ameren Illinois successfully advocated for the recently enacted Future Energy Jobs Act, which improved the already constructive regulatory framework for electric distribution business in Illinois. This will extend constructive formula ratemaking through 2022, enabling the continuation of our strong infrastructure investment plan to benefit our customers and the state of Illinois. And also meaningfully improved the regulatory framework for energy efficiency programs. The law allows us to capitalize and earn a fair return on our future energy efficiency expenditures which will enable Ameren Illinois to expand its energy efficiency programs for the benefit of our customers. Further, it provides revenue decoupling, eliminating potential sales margin erosion due to, among other things, energy efficiency. Finally, this law will help maintain and create new jobs in our service territory and it contains strong consumer protections. Simply put, it was a win-win for all stakeholders in Illinois. 
And in Missouri, we continued our extensive efforts to enhance the state's regulatory framework for electric service in order to support investment in a smarter energy grid and create jobs. A great deal of time and effort was spent working with key stakeholders after the 2016 legislative session to discuss this important matter for the state of Missouri. I will update you on our ongoing efforts in this area a bit later. The final element of our strategy calls for creating and capitalizing on opportunities for investment for the benefit of our customers and shareholders. As I just mentioned, the Illinois energy legislation enacted in late 2016 enables expansion of energy efficiency programs and allows Ameren Illinois to capitalize and earn a fair return on those investments. Also, the Missouri Public Service Commission approved 2 solar pilot programs that will provide clean energy choices for our customers and increase investment opportunities for Ameren Missouri, should these pilots proved successful and the programs be expanded. Finally, in September of last year, Ameren Missouri filed a plan with the Missouri PSC for potential incremental infrastructure investments of $1 billion over a 5-year period ending in 2022 that would benefit customers should these investments be enabled by an enhanced electric regulatory framework. Ameren Missouri also identified additional potential incremental infrastructure investments over a 10-year period that would modernize its energy grid and facilitate the transition to a cleaner, more diverse generation portfolio for the long-term benefit of its customers and the state of Missouri. 
Turning now to Page 5 and earnings guidance. First, I am pleased to inform you that we expect our 2017 earnings per share to be in the range of $2.65 to $2.85 per share. The midpoint of this guidance reflects strong earnings per share growth of approximately 6.5% compared to weather-normalized 2016 results. Marty will provide you more details on this a bit later. Second, we remain on track to deliver strong long-term earnings growth and continue to expect earnings per share to grow at a 5% to 8% compound annual rate from 2016 to 2020 based on the adjusted 2016 earnings per share guidance midpoint of $2.63 we provided a year ago. We plan to deliver these earnings results in the future through the continued execution of our strategy in 2017 and beyond. 
Turning now to Page 6. A key element of our strategy is to continue to advance our plan for investing in our utilities in a manner consistent with existing regulatory frameworks. The strong earnings growth outlook I just discussed is driven by our rate base growth outlook. Today, we are rolling forward our 5-year investment plan and I am pleased to say that we expect to grow rate base at a strong 6% compound annual rate over the 2016 through 2021 period. As you can see on the right side of this page, we continue to allocate greater levels of capital to those jurisdictions with constructive regulatory frameworks that support investment. Our transmission projects are projected to increase FERC-regulated rate base by 13% compounded annually over the 2016 through 2021 period. In addition, our investments in Illinois Electric Distribution and Illinois Natural Gas are expected to result in 9% compound annual rate base growth for each of these businesses for the same period. I would note that energy efficiency investments made under the Illinois Future Energy Jobs Act are incorporated into this outlook. And finally, our Missouri rate base is expected to grow at a slower 2% compound annual rate. Of course, the expected Missouri rate base growth rate would increase from this level if legislation is enacted that sufficiently enhances the state's regulatory framework to support investment. 
Moving now to Page 7. Another key element of our strategy is to achieve a fair and balanced resolution to our pending Missouri elective rate review. I am pleased to report that as a result of extensive collaboration, all the major parties participating in this rate review, the Ameren Missouri, the staff at the Missouri Public Service Commission, the Office of Public Counsel, industrial consumer groups and others, recently reached an agreement in principle on all the issues in this case. As a result, we expect a stipulation and agreement signed by these parties and possibly others to be filed with the Missouri Public Service Commission very soon, with the request of the agreement be approved by the commission. At this point, the agreement in principle is considered confidential. However, I would note that the earnings guidance we have provided today is consistent with these terms. 
Turning to Page 8 of the presentation. Enhancing Missouri's electric regulatory framework remains a key strategic focus because we strongly believe it would bring significant long-term benefits to our customers and the entire state of Missouri. Consistent with the benefits we have seen in Illinois and around the country, modernized policies to support energy infrastructure investments will lead to a more reliable and smarter energy grid, facilitate the transition to a cleaner and more diverse generation portfolio, provide greater tools for customers to manage their future energy usage, position us to meet our customers' rising energy needs and expectations and create significant quality jobs for Missouri. With these benefits in mind, in December 2016, Senate Bill 190, the Missouri Economic Development and Infrastructure Investment Act was filed. This slide slight outlines the key provisions of the bill. In summary, Senate Bill 190 would implement important regulatory reforms which would drive significant infrastructure investments and result in the benefits I just described. In addition, this legislation contains robust consumer protections including strong oversight by the Missouri Public Service Commission. And finally, Senate Bill 190 includes forward-thinking economic development provisions for our larger energy consumers, which in turn would help create good quality jobs. I would note that enactment of this legislation in its current form will support Ameren Missouri's ability to execute on $1 billion of incremental infrastructure investment over 5 years. Consistent with this filing with the Missouri Public Service Commission last fall, we, along with all the other Missouri investor-owned electric utilities, have continued to actively engage in discussions with customers, legislators, state officials and other stakeholders to build support for this important legislation. I am pleased to report that Senate Bill 190 was approved by the Senate Commerce Committee last week by a bipartisan 8 to 1 vote, is now headed to the full Senate consideration. While good progress is made on Senate Bill 190 to date, we are still very early in the legislative process. Keep in mind that the legislative session ends on May 12. As we move to the session, we will continue our extensive outreach and collaboration with key stakeholders to move Missouri forward on this important energy and economic policy initiative for the long-term benefit of our customers in the entire state of Missouri. 
Turning now to Page 9 of our presentation and a discussion of potential federal corporate income tax reform. I will begin by saying that Ameren supports thoughtful, comprehensive tax reform as we believe that lower corporate tax rates drive economic growth and job creation, benefiting our customers, the communities we serve and other key stakeholders. Recognizing that we are still in the relatively early stages of a tax reform debate, we are focusing our advocacy efforts with some key principles in mind. We want to ensure that tax reform does not negatively impact our key stakeholders, notably our customers as well as appropriately supports our industry's efforts to invest in our nation's critical energy infrastructure in an affordable manner. With these principles in mind, this slide highlights key areas of focus for Ameren and our industry. As I noted, it is still early in this debate and there are many moving parts, but we also recognize that many of you are interested in what impact tax reform could have on Ameren. Based on our current assessment of preliminary tax reform proposals, aside from the expected onetime noncash charge to write-down certain of our deferred tax assets, we do not believe this plan would impact our strong earnings growth guidance through 2020. Marty will address some of the underlying assumptions associated with our assessment in a few moments. Of course, I expect there will be several changes to the tax reform proposals between now and in the end of the debate. That is why Ameren and many of my colleagues in the industry will remain actively engaged with policymakers and key stakeholders on this important economic policy matter in the months ahead. 
Turning out to Page 10. Here you can see that our strategic and disciplined allocation of capital is also being driven by our view that the energy grid will be increasingly more important and valuable to our customers, the communities we serve and our shareholders. We plan to continue to invest to modernize our electric and gas transmission and distribution operations to make them safer, smarter and more resilient. As well as invest in smart meters and new technologies in order to meet our customers' future energy needs and expectations. Right side of this page shows that our allocation of capital is expected to grow these energy delivery businesses to nearly 3/4 of our rate base by the end of 2021. As a result, our investment in coal- and gas-fired generation is expected to decline to a combined 15% of rate base by year-end 2021. We are also advancing our efforts on innovative technologies to increase operating efficiencies, strength in the energy grid and create innovative energy solutions for our customers. Further, we remain focused on transitioning our generation to a cleaner and more diverse portfolio in a responsible fashion. And this transition will continue beyond 2021 with the schedule retirement of Meramec's coal-fired energy center in 2022. In addition, Ameren Missouri is developing its next 20-year Integrated Resource Plan which is scheduled to be filed with the Missouri PSC in October 2017. In this plan, we will continue to appropriately balance our responsibilities to our customers and communities, the environment and of course, our shareholders. 
Moving to Page 11. We anticipate that the execution of our strategy in 2017 and beyond will not only bring superior value to our customers but also to our shareholders. To reiterate, we continue to expect earnings per share to grow at a 5% to 8% compound annual rate from 2016 to 2020, based on the adjusted 2016 guidance midpoint we provided a year ago. Further, as I also discussed, we project rate base growth of 6% compounded annually from 2016 to 2021. We expect these growth rates to compare favorably with our regulated utility peers. Further, Ameren shares offer investors an attractive dividend. The annualized equivalent rate of $1.76 per share incorporates the October 2016 decision by the Board of Directors to increase the dividend for the third consecutive year, reflecting their continued confidence in the outlook for our businesses and our long-term strategy. And we continue to expect our dividend payout ratio to range between 55% and 70% of annual earnings. Of course, future dividend increases will be based on consideration of, among other things, earnings growth, cash flows and economic and other business conditions. 
To summarize, we believe our strong rate base and earnings growth profile, combined with our solid dividend, currently providing a yield of approximately 3.3% results in an attractive total return opportunity for our shareholders compared to our regulated utility peers. We remain focused on executing our strategy and I remain firmly convinced that doing so will deliver superior value to our shareholders, customers and the communities we serve. Again, thank you all for joining us today and I'll now turn the call over to Marty."

I'm turning now to Page 13 of our presentation. As Warner mentioned, we reported 2016 earnings of $2.68 per share compared with core earnings of $2.56 per share for the prior year. And as you can see, there w",2204,"Thank you, Warner, and good morning, everyone. I'm turning now to Page 13 of our presentation. As Warner mentioned, we reported 2016 earnings of $2.68 per share compared with core earnings of $2.56 per share for the prior year. And as you can see, there was no difference between GAAP and core results for 2016. 
On Page 14, we highlight factors that drove the $0.12 per share year-over-year increase in 2016 earnings compared to 2015 core results. As discussed in today's press release, we now consider Ameren to have 4 reportable segments. You can see the 2015 and 2016 comparative earnings per share contributions of these segments graphically at the right where we show Ameren Missouri in green representing all of the operations of Ameren Missouri; Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution in dark blue; Ameren Illinois Natural Gas in light blue; and last, but certainly not least, the Ameren Transmission in orange, which is composed of the FERC-regulated Ameren transmission businesses of Ameren Illinois and ATXI. We believe that analyzing and reporting results in this manner is appropriate given the unique regulatory framework associated with each segment and the manner in which we allocate capital and which to assess performance over time. We hope you find this new segment presentation useful. 
So then diving into the comparative earnings results, let's start with Ameren Transmission where the earnings per share contribution increased from $0.34 in 2015 to $0.48 in 2016. This 41% growth was driven by increased infrastructure investments at both ATXI and Ameren Illinois which both operate under constructive FERC formulaic ratemaking, coupled with higher average earned returns on equity. In 2016, our Transmission segment benefited from a temporarily higher FERC-allowed ROE as a result of the expiration in May of 2016 of the 15-month refund period for the second MISO ROE complaint case. The FERC's order in the first complaint case then lowered the allowed ROE in late September 2016 to 10.82% including our 50 basis point adder for voluntary participation in MISO. 
Moving to Ameren Illinois Natural Gas. In 2016, we saw the earnings contribution of this segment increased 60%, rising from $0.15 per share to $0.24 per share. This growth was again driven by infrastructure investment as well as an updated allowed return on equity, both of which were reflected in rates that became effective in December of 2015, incorporating a 2016 forward test year. 
Turning to our Illinois Electric Distribution business. 2016 results grew by just 2% from $0.51 in 2015 to $0.52 in 2016. Here, the benefits of infrastructure investment in warmer summer weather were partially offset by the temporary impacts of a lower allowed ROE under formulaic ratemaking of 8.4% compared to 8.64% for the year prior. The 2016 allowed ROE was based on the 2016 average 30-year Treasury yield of 2.6%, down from the 2015 average of 2.84%. The year-over-year earnings comparison was also negatively impacted by the absence in 2016 of certain power usage cost recoveries reflected in 2015 results. 
The earnings contribution from Ameren Missouri, our largest segment, declined from $1.63 in 2015 to $1.47 in 2016. Here, the earnings benefits a very warm summer temperatures and disciplined cost management were not enough to overcome the unfavorable impacts of lower sales to the New Madrid smelter and the unfavorable year-over-year comparative earnings impact of the 2013 to 2015 Missouri energy efficiency plan. In 2016, Ameren Missouri recognized a performance incentive award associated with the energy efficiency results achieved over the 3 years ending in 2015, reflecting the tremendous success of this program for our customers. However, this was lower than energy efficiency program benefits recognized in 2015. The earnings comparison was also unfavorably affected by nuclear refueling and maintenance outage expenses at the Callaway Energy Center in 2016 compared to no such outage in the prior year as well as higher depreciation expense. 
Finally, the Ameren parent and other net cost comparison was positively impacted by the first quarter recognition of tax benefits associated with share-based compensation. Before moving on, let me briefly cover 2016 electric sales growth compared to the prior year. Weather-normalized kilowatt-hour sales to residential and commercial customers were up slightly in both Illinois and Missouri, reflecting underlying growth and the leap day sales benefit partially offset by energy efficiency impacts. Kilowatt-hour sales to Illinois industrial customers in 2016 decreased about 1% primarily due to lower sales to several large low-margin Illinois customers, including those in steelmaking, heavy equipment manufacturing, mining and energy. However, we did see year-over-year growth in sales to industrial customers in the second half of the year after a first half decline. Finally, kilowatt-hour sales to Missouri industrial customers declined about 1/2 of 1%, excluding lower sales to the New Madrid smelter. 
Moving to Page 15 of our presentation. I would now like to transition to a discussion of key drivers impacting our 2017 earnings guidance. As Warner stated, we expect 2017 diluted earnings to be in range of $2.65 to $2.85 per share. On this page and the next, we have listed key earnings drivers of and assumptions behind our 2017 earnings guidance broken down by segment and as compared to 2016 results. Ameren Missouri's earnings are expected to rise in 2017 assuming increased electric service rates consistent with the agreement in principle to settle its pending rate review. The new rates would address the negative earnings impacts of reduced sales levels to the New Madrid smelter, adding an estimated $0.12 per share to the year-over-year earnings comparison. The new rates are also expected to reflect infrastructure investments made for the benefit of customers through December 31, 2016 and changes in various operating expense levels. In 2017, we expect Missouri's results to reflect increased depreciation, transmission and property tax expenses. These increases in expense are expected to continue to be a drag on earned returns particularly during the first half of 2017 prior to the date when rates are adjusted. In addition, a return to normal temperatures would reduce Ameren Missouri's earnings by $0.08 per share compared to last year. Further, Ameren Missouri's electric service earnings will be negatively affected by the absence in 2017 of the previously mentioned energy efficiency performance incentive award that was recognized in 2016. Finally, expenses associated with the Callaway nuclear refueling and maintenance outage, scheduled for the fall of this year, are expected to be comparable to those experienced as a result of the spring outage last year. 
Moving now to our Transmission business. Earnings are expected to rise in 2017, benefiting from additional infrastructure investments made in Ameren Illinois and ATXI under formula ratemaking. However, we expect this benefit to be partially offset by a lower projected weighted average allowed ROE in 2017 compared to last year. As I discussed a few minutes ago, our FERC-allowed ROE was temporarily increased for part of 2016, resulting in average allowed ROE of approximately 11.3% for the full year. In late September of last year, our FERC-allowed ROE has been 10.82%. Our guidance reflects a FERC final order in the second MISO ROE complaint case in the second quarter of this year with an ROE consistent with the ALJ's recommendation. Of course, the timing of this decision will depend on when new commissioners are confirmed and a quorum is created at the FERC. 
Moving now to Page 16 and our Illinois Electric Distribution business. We anticipate increased weather-normalized earnings in 2017 compared with 2016 reflecting additional infrastructure investments made under formula ratemaking. Further, Illinois Electric Distribution earnings incorporate a formula-based allowed ROE of 9.1% using a forecasted 3.3% 2017 average yield for the 30-year treasury bond compared to an allowed ROE of 8.4% in 2016. These positive factors are expected to be mitigated by the absence in 2017 of the benefit of warmer-than-normal 2016 summer temperatures as revenue decoupling becomes effective this year. I would also like to mention that we have provided the earnings sensitivity to changes in the allowed ROE for Illinois Electric Distribution on this page. Completing the discussion of our Illinois businesses, natural gas segment earnings are expected to benefit from qualified investments that are included in rates on a timely basis under the state's gas infrastructure rider. I would also like to take a minute to discuss our 2017 electric sales outlook. We expect weather-normalized combined Illinois and Missouri kilowatt-hour sales to residential and commercial customers to be roughly flat compared to last year as underlying growth is expected to be offset by the effects of our energy efficiency programs and the absence of the leap day. Turning to industrial customers, combined Illinois and Missouri kilowatt-hour sales to this group are expected to be up 1% to 2% compared to last year. 
Moving finally to Ameren-wide drivers and assumptions. We expect an effective income tax rate of approximately 38% this year, an increase from last year's rate of 36.7%, reflecting substantially lower expected first quarter 2017 tax benefits associated with share-based compensation as compared to 2016. Of course, this effective tax rate, as well as other elements of our 2017 guidance, assumes no change in federal income tax policy during the year. I will add to the color Warner provided on potential tax legislation in a moment. 
Turning to Page 17. For 2017, we anticipate negative free cash flow of approximately $700 million. On the right side of this page, we provide a breakdown of our $2.2 billion of planned 2017 capital expenditures by business with nearly 2/3 allocated to jurisdictions with modern constructive regulatory frameworks. We expect to fund this year's negative free cash flow and debt maturities with short and long-term borrowings. 
Moving to Page 18 of the presentation. Here we provide an overview of our $10.8 billion of planned capital expenditures for the 2017 through 2021 period. The expected funding sources including substantial income tax deferrals and tax assets for these infrastructure investments are listed on this page. The tax deferrals are driven primarily by our planned capital expenditures including bonus tax depreciation provided in current law. The tax assets include $440 million with the parent company that are not currently earning a return. Given our expected funding sources, we do not expect to issue additional equity over this period. We remain committed to funding our capital expenditures in a manner that maintains solid credit metrics and this is reflected in our capitalization target of around 50% equity. 
Moving now to Page 19. Earlier, Warner discussed our support for thoughtful federal tax reform and some of the key areas of focus for Ameren and the utility industry as a whole. He also mentioned that we believe the debate on tax reform elements is in the early stages and we are far from knowing final tax reform attributes and consequently, the true financial consequences. That said, we know that many of you are attempting to model the potential impacts of known reform considerations. Here, we attempted to provide some key Ameren considerations relative to the pillars of widely discussed tax reform proposals. Overall, I would say we are well positioned to sustain our earnings per share growth rate expectations through 2020. Today, our operations are fully rate regulated and we have relatively little parent company debt after considering that which supports our transmission segment. Further, we have strong balance sheet, credit metrics relative to our current credit ratings and we have a solid infrastructure investment pipeline filled with projects that would benefit customers. We do expect that lowering the federal corporate tax rate would cause us to revalue our Ameren parent tax asset balances as well as certain deferred tax balances of our rate-regulated subsidiaries, causing a onetime noncash charge to earnings to be recognized upon such a tax rate reduction becoming law. However, a lower corporate tax rate favorably impacts customer rates and our tax obligations prospectively. And while near-term negative cash flow impacts may occur relative to forecasted levels between the time when tax rates are reflected in rates and corporate tax obligations are reduced as well as due to the expected gradual flow-back of excess deferred taxes, we expect that cash flow reductions would be mitigated by increased earnings on additional rate base, emanating from comparatively higher NOL balances and lower deferred tax obligations reflected in rate base. Overall, we currently forecast those net cash flow reductions to be manageable in the context of our overall capitalization and long-term cash flow forecast. And to reiterate, we expect no change to our earnings per share growth outlook based on our modeling of current tax reform proposals. But then again the debate is far from over and uncertainty clearly exists. 
Finally, turning to Page 20, I will summarize. In 2016, we again delivered solid earnings growth and continue to successfully execute our strategy. As Warner stated, as we look ahead, we continue to expect strong earnings per share growth driven by strong rate base growth and disciplined financial management. Further, we expect this growth to compare favorably with the growth of our regulated utility peers. And Ameren shares continue to offer investors an attractive dividend. In total, we have an attractive total shareholder return story that we believe compares very favorably to peers. That compare -- that concludes the prepared remarks. We now invite your questions."

Appreciate your question about our plans to fund our capital expenditures and our maturities this year. As we noted on the slides, about $675 million of maturities this year in June. At Ameren Missouri, we've got a $425 million maturity. And then in November, we've got $250 million maturity at Ameren Illinois. And so as we look ahead this year, a few things, we expect that midyear following that maturity at Missouri, we'd likely do a financing there. In late in the year in November, December after that maturity at Ameren Illinois, we also plan to do a financing there. There, I think not only to refinance the maturity but also some of the capital expenditures that we've had through the year in Ameren Illinois. And then of course, as you mentioned, we have been financing the transmission business and the growth there really through the use of parent company debt, long-term and short-term debt. As we move through the year, financing additional infrastructure investment, our short-term debt balances would grow and so it's likely around midyear that we execute some sort of a long-term financing and we'll provide you greater details on our thoughts there as we move through the year but you identified, say, the relevant considerations whether to do that long-term financing at the parent or at the transmission entity down at ATXI. So those are things that we're assessing. We do, like I said, expect that we will do execute on long-term financing around midyear but those details are still being thought through and we'll share more with you later in the year."

Let me start with the Q4 results. With regard to the Q4 results compared to the prior year, weather was a positive, in fact, it was about a $0.06 positive versus prior year, but versus our expectations which revolved around normal weather, weather was a negative about $0.01. We had sort of a warm year last year including a warm fourth quarter, so it was a bit of a negative compared to expectations for the quarter. Of course, we benefited from continued infrastructure investments. Obviously that was a benefit in the fourth quarter versus the prior year. We did have a lower effective tax rate in the fourth quarter versus last year. Though I'll tell you that versus our expectations, it was a little higher than expected, so tax issues or items were a bit of a negative versus in our expectations coming into the fourth quarter. And then again, going back to compared to prior years, we had lower benefits from the energy efficiency programs in Missouri. You'll recall that in 2015, as we were coming to the end of that first energy efficiency program, we had high take rates,  if you will, on the incentives we are providing to customers and that translated into some benefits of being recognized by the company in late 2015 that didn't broker back in 2016. And so those were some of the big things. Then of course, don't forget about the year-over-year impact about the New Madrid smelter load loss which was a negative in 2016 versus 2015. So again, compared to prior years plus on weather, plus on investment returns, plus on the effective tax rate, minus on the energy efficiency impacts and minus in terms of the New Madrid smelter, that's kind of how it all shakes up chicks compared to the prior year but again compared to expectations, I would say a little bit lower than our expectations coming into the quarter due to some tax items and weather. So how we shake all that up. Then I think your second question, we'll turn it over -- back to Michael Moehn."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we announced 2016 earnings of $2.68 per share compared to core earnings of $2.56 per share for 2015.

Today, we announced 2016 earnings of $2.68 per share compared to core earnings of $2.56 per share for 2015. Once again, we delivered another year of solid earnings growth driven by the successful execution of our strategy. Marty will discuss the drivers of our 2016 earnings results in a few minutes. But first, I want to highlight some of the key actions we took to successfully execute our strategy in 2016 for the benefit of our customers and shareholders. 
Starting with our strategy to prudently invest in and operate our utilities in a manner consistent with existing regulatory frameworks. We continue to allocate significant amounts of capital to those businesses that are supported by modern constructive regulatory frameworks for the benefit of our customers. In fact, we invested $2.1 billion in utility infrastructure last year with 2/3, over $1.3 billion, going to projects in the FERC-regulated electric transmission and Illinois-regulated electric and natural gas distribution businesses. A significant portion of the $1.3 billion was invested in the Illinois Rivers project, a new high voltage transmission line, which will span 385 miles across the state of Illinois. This project remains on schedule for completion in 2019, with 4 of its 9 line segments energized, including 2 river crossings and 8 of 10 substations now in service. This strategic allocation of capital and effective project execution, combined with disciplined cost management, meaningfully contributed to the solid financial results I just discussed. 
Turning to Missouri. In order to earn a fair return on our electric business, we filed a rate review request in July with the Missouri Public Service Commission. We were seeking to recover costs related to infrastructure investments made for the benefit of customers and to remove the negative earnings effect of lower sales to the New Madrid smelter. There was a recent development in this rate review, and I will provide an important update in a few minutes. 
Moving down the page, last year, we also continued to work to enhance our regulatory frameworks and advocate for responsible energy and economic policies. I am pleased to report that we made very good progress on this strategic focus area as well. Notably, Ameren Illinois successfully advocated for the recently enacted Future Energy Jobs Act, which improved the already constructive regulatory framework for our electric distribution business in Illinois. This law extends constructive formula ratemaking through 2022, enabling the continuation of our strong infrastructure investment plan to benefit our customers and the state of Illinois. It also meaningfully improved the regulatory framework for energy efficiency programs. The law allows us to capitalize and earn a fair return on our future energy efficiency expenditures, which will enable Ameren Illinois to expand its energy efficiency programs for the benefit of our customers. Further, it provides revenue decoupling, eliminating potential sales margin erosion due to, among other things, energy efficiency. Finally, this law will help maintain and create new jobs in our service territory and it contains strong consumer protections. Simply put, it was a win-win for all stakeholders in Illinois. 
And in Missouri, we continued our extensive efforts to enhance the state's regulatory framework for electric service in order to support investment in a smarter energy grid and create jobs. A great deal of time and effort was spent working with key stakeholders after the 2016 legislative session to discuss this important matter for the state of Missouri. I'll update you on our ongoing efforts in this area a bit later. 
The final element of our strategy calls for creating and capitalizing on opportunities for investment for the benefit of our customers and shareholders. As I just mentioned, the Illinois energy legislation enacted in late 2016 enables expansion of energy efficiency programs and allows Ameren Illinois to capitalize and earn a fair return on those investments. Also, the Missouri Public Service Commission approved 2 solar pilot programs that will provide clean energy choices for our customers and increase investment opportunities for Ameren Missouri, should these pilots proved successful and the programs be expanded. Finally, in September of last year, Ameren Missouri filed a plan with the Missouri PSC for potential incremental infrastructure investments of $1 billion over a 5-year period ending in 2022 that would benefit customers, should these investments be enabled by an enhanced electric regulatory framework. Ameren Missouri also identified additional potential incremental infrastructure investments over a 10-year period that would modernize its energy grid and facilitate the transition to a cleaner, more diverse generation portfolio for the long-term benefit of its customers and the state of Missouri. 
Turning now to Page 5 and earnings guidance. First, I am pleased to inform you that we expect our 2017 earnings per share to be in the range of $2.65 to $2.85 per share. The midpoint of this guidance reflects strong earnings per share growth of approximately 6.5% compared to weather-normalized 2016 results. Marty will provide you more details on this a bit later. Second, we remain on track to deliver strong long-term earnings growth and continue to expect earnings per share to grow at a 5% to 8% compound annual rate from 2016 to 2020 based on the adjusted 2016 earnings per share guidance midpoint of $2.63 we provided a year ago. We plan to deliver these earnings results in the future through the continued execution of our strategy in 2017 and beyond. 
Turning now to Page 6. A key element of our strategy is to continue to advance our plan for investing in our utilities in a manner consistent with existing regulatory frameworks. The strong earnings growth outlook I just discussed is driven by our rate base growth outlook. Today, we are rolling forward our 5-year investment plan and I am pleased to say that we expect to grow rate base at a strong 6% compound annual rate over the 2016 through 2021 period. As you can see on the right side of this page, we continue to allocate greater levels of capital to those jurisdictions with constructive regulatory frameworks that support investment. Our transmission projects are projected to increase FERC-regulated rate base by 13% compounded annually over the 2016 through 2021 period. In addition, our investments in Illinois Electric Distribution and Illinois Natural Gas are expected to result in 9% compound annual rate base growth for each of these businesses for the same period. I would note that energy efficiency investments made under the Illinois Future Energy Jobs Act are incorporated into this outlook. And finally, our Missouri rate base is expected to grow at a slower 2% compound annual rate. Of course, the expected Missouri rate base growth rate would increase from this level if legislation is enacted that sufficiently enhances the state's regulatory framework to support investment. 
Moving now to Page 7. Another key element of our strategy is to achieve a fair and balanced resolution to our pending Missouri elective rate review. I am pleased to report that as a result of extensive collaboration, all the major parties participating in this rate review, the Ameren Missouri, the staff at the Missouri Public Service Commission, the Office of Public Counsel, industrial consumer groups and others, recently reached an agreement in principle on all the issues in this case. As a result, we expect a stipulation and agreement signed by these parties and possibly others to be filed with the Missouri Public Service Commission very soon, with the request of the agreement be approved by the commission. At this point, the agreement in principle is considered confidential. However, I would note that the earnings guidance we have provided today is consistent with these terms. 
Turning to Page 8 of the presentation. Enhancing Missouri's electric regulatory framework remains a key strategic focus because we strongly believe it would bring significant long-term benefits to our customers and the entire state of Missouri. Consistent with the benefits we have seen in Illinois and around the country, modernized policies to support energy infrastructure investments will lead to a more reliable and smarter energy grid, facilitate the transition to a cleaner and more diverse generation portfolio, provide greater tools for customers to manage their future energy usage, position us to meet our customers' rising energy needs and expectations and create significant quality jobs for Missouri. With these benefits in mind, in December 2016, Senate Bill 190, the Missouri Economic Development and Infrastructure Investment Act was filed. This slide slight outlines the key provisions of the bill. In summary, Senate Bill 190 would implement important regulatory reforms which would drive significant infrastructure investments and result in the benefits I just described. In addition, this legislation contains robust consumer protections including strong oversight by the Missouri Public Service Commission. 
And finally, Senate Bill 190 includes forward-thinking economic development provisions for our larger energy consumers, which in turn would help create good quality jobs. I would note that enactment of this legislation in its current form will support Ameren Missouri's ability to execute on $1 billion of incremental infrastructure investment over 5 years. Consistent with this filing with the Missouri Public Service Commission last fall, we, along with all the other Missouri investor-owned electric utilities, have continued to actively engage in discussions with customers, legislators, state officials and other stakeholders to build support for this important legislation. I am pleased to report that Senate Bill 190 was approved by the Senate Commerce Committee last week by a bipartisan 8 to 1 vote, is now headed to the full Senate consideration. While good progress is made on Senate Bill 190 to date, we are still very early in the legislative process. Keep in mind that the legislative session ends on May 12. As we move to the session, we will continue our extensive outreach and collaboration with key stakeholders to move Missouri forward on this important energy and economic policy initiative for the long-term benefit of our customers in the entire state of Missouri. 
Turning now to Page 9 of our presentation and a discussion of potential federal corporate income tax reform. I will begin by saying that Ameren supports thoughtful, comprehensive tax reform as we believe that lower corporate tax rates drive economic growth and job creation, benefiting our customers, the communities we serve and other key stakeholders. Recognizing that we are still in the relatively early stages of a tax reform debate, we are focusing our advocacy efforts with some key principles in mind. We want to ensure that tax reform does not negatively impact our key stakeholders, notably our customers as well as appropriately supports our industry's efforts to invest in our nation's critical energy infrastructure in an affordable manner. 
With these principles in mind, this slide highlights key areas of focus for Ameren and our industry. As I noted, it is still early in this debate and there are many moving parts, but we also recognize that many of you are interested in what impact tax reform could have on Ameren. Based on our current assessment of preliminary tax reform proposals, aside from the expected onetime noncash charge to write-down certain of our deferred tax assets, we do not believe this plan would impact our strong earnings growth guidance through 2020. Marty will address some of the underlying assumptions associated with our assessment in a few moments. Of course, I expect there will be several changes to the tax reform proposals between now and in the end of the debate. That is why Ameren and many of my colleagues in the industry will remain actively engaged with policymakers and key stakeholders on this important economic policy matter in the months ahead. 
Turning now to Page 10. Here you can see that our strategic and disciplined allocation of capital is also being driven by our view that the energy grid will be increasingly more important and valuable to our customers, the communities we serve and our shareholders. We plan to continue to invest to modernize our electric and gas transmission and distribution operations to make them safer, smarter and more resilient. As well as invest in smart meters and new technologies in order to meet our customers' future energy needs and expectations. Right side of this page shows that our allocation of capital is expected to grow these energy delivery businesses to nearly 3/4 of our rate base by the end of 2021. As a result, our investment in coal- and gas-fired generation is expected to decline to a combined 15% of rate base by year-end 2021. 
We are also advancing our efforts on innovative technologies to increase operating efficiencies, strength in the energy grid and create innovative energy solutions for our customers. Further, we remain focused on transitioning our generation to a cleaner and more diverse portfolio in a responsible fashion. And this transition will continue beyond 2021 with the schedule retirement of Meramec's coal-fired energy center in 2022. In addition, Ameren Missouri is developing its next 20-year Integrated Resource Plan which is scheduled to be filed with the Missouri PSC in October 2017. In this plan, we will continue to appropriately balance our responsibilities to our customers and communities, the environment and of course, our shareholders. 
Moving to Page 11. We anticipate that the execution of our strategy in 2017 and beyond will not only bring superior value to our customers but also to our shareholders. To reiterate, we continue to expect earnings per share to grow at a 5% to 8% compound annual rate from 2016 to 2020, based on the adjusted 2016 guidance midpoint we provided a year ago. Further, as I also discussed, we project rate base growth of 6% compounded annually from 2016 to 2021. We expect these growth rates to compare favorably with our regulated utility peers. Further, Ameren shares offer investors an attractive dividend. The annualized equivalent rate of $1.76 per share incorporates the October 2016 decision by the Board of Directors to increase the dividend for the third consecutive year, reflecting their continued confidence in the outlook for our businesses and our long-term strategy. And we continue to expect our dividend payout ratio to range between 55% and 70% of annual earnings. Of course, future dividend increases will be based on consideration of, among other things, earnings growth, cash flows and economic and other business conditions. 
To summarize, we believe our strong rate base and earnings growth profile, combined with our solid dividend, currently providing a yield of approximately 3.3% results in an attractive total return opportunity for our shareholders compared to our regulated utility peers. We remain focused on executing our strategy and I remain firmly convinced that doing so will deliver superior value to our shareholders, customers and the communities we serve. Again, thank you all for joining us today and I'll now turn the call over to Marty."

As Warner mentioned, we reported 2016 earnings of $2.68 per share compared with core earnings of $2.56 per share for the prior year. And as you can see, there was no difference between GAAP and core results for 2016. 
On Page 14, we highlight factors that drove the $0.12 per share year-over-year increase in 2016 earnings compared to 2015 core results. As discussed in today's press release, we now consider Ameren to have 4 reportable segments. You can see the 2015 and 2016 comparative earnings per share contributions of these segments graphically at the right where we show Ameren Missouri in green representing all of the operations of Ameren Missouri; Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution in dark blue; Ameren Illinois Natural Gas in light blue; and last, but certainly not least, the Ameren Transmission in orange, which is composed of the FERC-regulated Ameren transmission businesses of Ameren Illinois and ATXI. We believe that analyzing and reporting results in this manner is appropriate given the unique regulatory framework associated with each segment and the manner in which we allocate capital and which to assess performance over time. We hope you find this new segment presentation useful. 
So then diving into the comparative earnings results, let's start with Ameren Transmission where the earnings per share contribution increased from $0.34 in 2015 to $0.48 in 2016. This 41% growth was driven by increased infrastructure investments at both ATXI and Ameren Illinois which both operate under constructive FERC formulaic ratemaking, coupled with higher average earned returns on equity. In 2016, our Transmission segment benefited from a temporarily higher FERC-allowed ROE as a result of the expiration in May of 2016 of the 15-month refund period for the second MISO ROE complaint case. The FERC's order in the first complaint case then lowered the allowed ROE in late September 2016 to 10.82%, including our 50 basis point adder for voluntary participation in MISO. 
Moving to Ameren Illinois Natural Gas. In 2016, we saw the earnings contribution of this segment increased 60%, rising from $0.15 per share to $0.24 per share. This growth was again driven by infrastructure investment as well as an updated allowed return on equity, both of which were reflected in rates that became effective in December of 2015, incorporating a 2016 forward test year. 
Turning to our Illinois Electric Distribution business. 2016 results grew by just 2% from $0.51 in 2015 to $0.52 in 2016. Here, the benefits of infrastructure investment in warmer summer weather were partially offset by the temporary impacts of a lower allowed ROE under formulaic ratemaking of 8.4% compared to 8.64% for the year prior. The 2016 allowed ROE was based on the 2016 average 30-year Treasury yield of 2.6%, down from the 2015 average of 2.84%. The year-over-year earnings comparison was also negatively impacted by the absence in 2016 of certain power usage cost recoveries reflected in 2015 results. 
The earnings contribution from Ameren Missouri, our largest segment, declined from $1.63 in 2015 to $1.47 in 2016. Here, the earnings benefits a very warm summer temperatures and disciplined cost management were not enough to overcome the unfavorable impacts of lower sales to the New Madrid smelter and the unfavorable year-over-year comparative earnings impact of the 2013 to 2015 Missouri energy efficiency plan. In 2016, Ameren Missouri recognized a performance incentive award associated with the energy efficiency results achieved over the 3 years ending in 2015, reflecting the tremendous success of this program for our customers. However, this was lower than energy efficiency program benefits recognized in 2015. The earnings comparison was also unfavorably affected by nuclear refueling and maintenance outage expenses at the Callaway Energy Center in 2016 compared to no such outage in the prior year as well as higher depreciation expense. 
Finally, the Ameren parent and other net cost comparison was positively impacted by the first quarter recognition of tax benefits associated with share-based compensation. Before moving on, let me briefly cover 2016 electric sales growth compared to the prior year. Weather-normalized kilowatt-hour sales to residential and commercial customers were up slightly in both Illinois and Missouri, reflecting underlying growth and the leap day sales benefit partially offset by energy efficiency impacts. Kilowatt-hour sales to Illinois industrial customers in 2016 decreased about 1% primarily due to lower sales to several large low-margin Illinois customers, including those in steelmaking, heavy equipment manufacturing, mining and energy. However, we did see year-over-year growth in sales to industrial customers in the second half of the year after a first half decline. Finally, kilowatt-hour sales to Missouri industrial customers declined about 1/2 of 1%, excluding lower sales to the New Madrid smelter. 
Moving to Page 15 of our presentation. I would now like to transition to a discussion of key drivers impacting our 2017 earnings guidance. As Warner stated, we expect 2017 diluted earnings to be in range of $2.65 to $2.85 per share. On this page and the next, we have listed key earnings drivers of and assumptions behind our 2017 earnings guidance broken down by segment and as compared to 2016 results. Ameren Missouri's earnings are expected to rise in 2017 assuming increased electric service rates consistent with the agreement in principle to settle its pending rate review. The new rates would address the negative earnings impacts of reduced sales levels to the New Madrid smelter, adding an estimated $0.12 per share to the year-over-year earnings comparison. The new rates are also expected to reflect infrastructure investments made for the benefit of customers through December 31, 2016 and changes in various operating expense levels. In 2017, we expect Missouri's results to reflect increased depreciation, transmission and property tax expenses. These increases in expense are expected to continue to be a drag on earned returns particularly during the first half of 2017 prior to the date when rates are adjusted. In addition, a return to normal temperatures would reduce Ameren Missouri's earnings by $0.08 per share compared to last year. Further, Ameren Missouri's electric service earnings will be negatively affected by the absence in 2017 of the previously mentioned energy efficiency performance incentive award that was recognized in 2016. Finally, expenses associated with the Callaway nuclear refueling and maintenance outage, scheduled for the fall of this year, are expected to be comparable to those experienced as a result of the spring outage last year. 
Moving now to our Transmission business. Earnings are expected to rise in 2017, benefiting from additional infrastructure investments made in Ameren Illinois and ATXI under formula ratemaking. However, we expect this benefit to be partially offset by a lower projected weighted average allowed ROE in 2017 compared to last year. As I discussed a few minutes ago, our FERC-allowed ROE was temporarily increased for part of 2016, resulting in average allowed ROE of approximately 11.3% for the full year. In late September of last year, our FERC-allowed ROE has been 10.82%. Our guidance reflects a FERC final order in the second MISO ROE complaint case in the second quarter of this year with an ROE consistent with the ALJ's recommendation. Of course, the timing of this decision will depend on when new commissioners are confirmed and a quorum is created at the FERC. 
Moving now to Page 16 and our Illinois Electric Distribution business. We anticipate increased weather-normalized earnings in 2017 compared with 2016 reflecting additional infrastructure investments made under formula ratemaking. Further, Illinois Electric Distribution earnings incorporate a formula-based allowed ROE of 9.1% using a forecasted 3.3% 2017 average yield for the 30-year treasury bond compared to an allowed ROE of 8.4% in 2016. These positive factors are expected to be mitigated by the absence in 2017 of the benefit of warmer-than-normal 2016 summer temperatures as revenue decoupling becomes effective this year. I would also like to mention that we have provided the earnings sensitivity to changes in the allowed ROE for Illinois Electric Distribution on this page. 
Completing the discussion of our Illinois businesses, natural gas segment earnings are expected to benefit from qualified investments that are included in rates on a timely basis under the state's gas infrastructure rider. I would also like to take a minute to discuss our 2017 electric sales outlook. We expect weather-normalized combined Illinois and Missouri kilowatt-hour sales to residential and commercial customers to be roughly flat compared to last year as underlying growth is expected to be offset by the effects of our energy efficiency programs and the absence of the leap day. Turning to industrial customers, combined Illinois and Missouri kilowatt-hour sales to this group are expected to be up 1% to 2% compared to last year. 
Moving finally to Ameren-wide drivers and assumptions. We expect an effective income tax rate of approximately 38% this year, an increase from last year's rate of 36.7%, reflecting substantially lower expected first quarter 2017 tax benefits associated with share-based compensation as compared to 2016. Of course, this effective tax rate, as well as other elements of our 2017 guidance, assumes no change in federal income tax policy during the year. I will add to the color Warner provided on potential tax legislation in a moment. 
Turning to Page 17. For 2017, we anticipate negative free cash flow of approximately $700 million. On the right side of this page, we provide a breakdown of our $2.2 billion of planned 2017 capital expenditures by business with nearly 2/3 allocated to jurisdictions with modern constructive regulatory frameworks. We expect to fund this year's negative free cash flow and debt maturities with short and long-term borrowings. 
Moving to Page 18 of the presentation. Here we provide an overview of our $10.8 billion of planned capital expenditures for the 2017 through 2021 period. The expected funding sources including substantial income tax deferrals and tax assets for these infrastructure investments are listed on this page. The tax deferrals are driven primarily by our planned capital expenditures including bonus tax depreciation provided in current law. The tax assets include $440 million with the parent company that are not currently earning a return. Given our expected funding sources, we do not expect to issue additional equity over this period. We remain committed to funding our capital expenditures in a manner that maintains solid credit metrics and this is reflected in our capitalization target of around 50% equity. 
Moving now to Page 19. Earlier, Warner discussed our support for thoughtful federal tax reform and some of the key areas of focus for Ameren and the utility industry as a whole. He also mentioned that we believe the debate on tax reform elements is in the early stages and we are far from knowing final tax reform attributes and consequently, the true financial consequences. That said, we know that many of you are attempting to model the potential impacts of known reform considerations. Here, we attempted to provide some key Ameren considerations relative to the pillars of widely discussed tax reform proposals. Overall, I would say we are well positioned to sustain our earnings per share growth rate expectations through 2020. Today, our operations are fully rate regulated and we have relatively little parent company debt after considering that which supports our transmission segment. 
Further, we have strong balance sheet, credit metrics relative to our current credit ratings and we have a solid infrastructure investment pipeline filled with projects that would benefit customers. We do expect that lowering the federal corporate tax rate would cause us to revalue our Ameren parent tax asset balances as well as certain deferred tax balances of our rate-regulated subsidiaries, causing a onetime noncash charge to earnings to be recognized upon such a tax rate reduction becoming law. However, a lower corporate tax rate favorably impacts customer rates and our tax obligations prospectively. 
And while near-term negative cash flow impacts may occur relative to forecasted levels between the time when tax rates are reflected in rates and corporate tax obligations are reduced as well as due to the expected gradual flow-back of excess deferred taxes, we expect that cash flow reductions would be mitigated by increased earnings on additional rate base, emanating from comparatively higher NOL balances and lower deferred tax obligations reflected in rate base. Overall, we currently forecast those net cash flow reductions to be manageable in the context of our overall capitalization and long-term cash flow forecast. And to reiterate, we expect no change to our earnings per share growth outlook based on our modeling of current tax reform proposals. But then again the debate is far from over and uncertainty clearly exists. 
Finally, turning to Page 20, I will summarize. In 2016, we again delivered solid earnings growth and continue to successfully execute our strategy. As Warner stated, as we look ahead, we continue to expect strong earnings per share growth driven by strong rate base growth and disciplined financial management. Further, we expect this growth to compare favorably with the growth of our regulated utility peers. And Ameren shares continue to offer investors an attractive dividend. In total, we have an attractive total shareholder return story that we believe compares very favorably to peers. That compare -- that concludes the prepared remarks. We now invite your questions."

We appreciate your question about our plans to fund our capital expenditures and our maturities this year. As we noted on the slides, we have about $675 million of maturities this year in June. At Ameren Missouri, we've got a $425 million maturity. And then in November, we've got $250 million maturity at Ameren Illinois. And so as we look ahead this year, a few things, we expect that midyear following that maturity at Missouri, we'd likely do a financing there. In late in the year, in November, December after that maturity at Ameren Illinois, we'd also plan to do a financing there. There, I think not only to refinance the maturity but also some of the capital expenditures that we've had through the year in Ameren Illinois. And then of course, as you mentioned, we've been financing the transmission business and the growth there really through the use of parent company debt, long-term and short-term debt. As we move through the year, financing additional infrastructure investment, our short-term debt balances would grow and so it's likely around midyear that we'd execute some sort of a long-term financing, and we'll provide you greater details on our thoughts there as we move through the year but you identified, say, the relevant considerations whether to do that long-term financing at the parent or at the transmission entity down at ATXI. So those are things that we're assessing.

So with regard to the Q4 results compared to the prior year, weather was a positive, in fact, it was about a $0.06 positive versus prior year. But versus our expectations, which revolved around normal weather, weather was a negative, about $0.01. We had sort of a warm year last year including a warm fourth quarter, so it was a bit of a negative compared to expectations for the quarter. Of course, we benefited from continued infrastructure investments. Obviously, that was a benefit in the fourth quarter versus the prior year. We did have a lower effective tax rate in the fourth quarter versus last year. Though, I'll tell you that versus our expectations, it was a little higher than expected, so tax issues or items were a bit of a negative versus our expectations coming into the fourth quarter. And then again, going back to compared to prior years, we had lower benefits from the energy efficiency programs in Missouri. You'll recall that in 2015, as we were coming to the end of that first energy efficiency program, we had high take rates, if you will, on the incentives we were providing to customers and that translated into some benefits being recognized by the company in late 2015 that didn't recur then in 2016. And so those were some of the big things. Then of course, don't forget about the year-over-year impact of the New Madrid smelter load loss which was obviously a negative in 2016 versus '15. So again, compared to prior years, prior year plus on weather, plus on investment returns, plus on the effective tax rate, minus on the energy efficiency impacts and minus in terms of the New Madrid smelter, that's kind of how it all shakes up compared to the prior year. But again, compared to expectations, I would say a little bit lower than our expectations coming into the quarter due to some tax items and weather. So how we shake all that up. Then I think your second question, we'll turn it over to -- back to Michael Moehn."

Today, we announced 2016 earnings of $2.68 per share compared to core earnings of $2.56 per share for 2015. Once again, we delivered another year of solid earnings growth driven by the successful execution of our strategy. Marty will discuss the drivers of our 2016 earnings results in a few minutes. But first, I want to highlight some of the key actions we took to successfully execute our strategy in 2016 for the benefit of our customers and shareholders. 
Starting with our strategy to prudently invest in and operate our utilities in a manner consistent with existing regulatory frameworks. We continue to allocate significant amounts of capital to those businesses that are supported by modern constructive regulatory frameworks for the benefit of our customers. In fact, we invested $2.1 billion in utility infrastructure last year with 2/3, over $1.3 billion, going to projects in the FERC-regulated electric transmission and Illinois-regulated electric and natural gas distribution businesses. A significant portion of the $1.3 billion was invested in the Illinois Rivers project, a new high voltage transmission line, which will span 385 miles across the state of Illinois. This project remains on schedule for completion in 2019, with 4 of its 9 line segments energized, including 2 river crossings and 8 of 10 substations now in service. This strategic allocation of capital and effective project execution, combined with disciplined cost management, meaningfully contributed to the solid financial results I just discussed. 
Turning to Missouri. In order to earn a fair return on our electric business, we filed a rate review request in July with the Missouri Public Service Commission. We were seeking to recover costs related to infrastructure investments made for the benefit of customers and to remove the negative earnings effect of lower sales to the New Madrid smelter. There was a recent development in this rate review, and I will provide an important update in a few minutes. 
Moving down the page, last year, we also continued to work to enhance our regulatory frameworks and advocate for responsible energy and economic policies. I am pleased to report that we made very good progress on this strategic focus area as well. Notably, Ameren Illinois successfully advocated for the recently enacted Future Energy Jobs Act, which improved the already constructive regulatory framework for our electric distribution business in Illinois. This law extends constructive formula ratemaking through 2022, enabling the continuation of our strong infrastructure investment plan to benefit our customers and the state of Illinois. It also meaningfully improved the regulatory framework for energy efficiency programs. The law allows us to capitalize and earn a fair return on our future energy efficiency expenditures, which will enable Ameren Illinois to expand its energy efficiency programs for the benefit of our customers. Further, it provides revenue decoupling, eliminating potential sales margin erosion due to, among other things, energy efficiency. Finally, this law will help maintain and create new jobs in our service territory and it contains strong consumer protections. Simply put, it was a win-win for all stakeholders in Illinois. 
And in Missouri, we continued our extensive efforts to enhance the state's regulatory framework for electric service in order to support investment in a smarter energy grid and create jobs. A great deal of time and effort was spent working with key stakeholders after the 2016 legislative session to discuss this important matter for the state of Missouri. I'll update you on our ongoing efforts in this area a bit later. 
The final element of our strategy calls for creating and capitalizing on opportunities for investment for the benefit of our customers and shareholders. As I just mentioned, the Illinois energy legislation enacted in late 2016 enables expansion of energy efficiency programs and allows Ameren Illinois to capitalize and earn a fair return on those investments. Also, the Missouri Public Service Commission approved 2 solar pilot programs that will provide clean energy choices for our customers and increase investment opportunities for Ameren Missouri, should these pilots prove successful and the programs be expanded. Finally, in September of last year, Ameren Missouri filed a plan with the Missouri PSC for potential incremental infrastructure investments of $1 billion over a 5-year period ending in 2022 that would benefit customers, should these investments be enabled by an enhanced electric regulatory framework. Ameren Missouri also identified additional potential incremental infrastructure investments over a 10-year period that would modernize its energy grid and facilitate the transition to a cleaner, more diverse generation portfolio for the long-term benefit of its customers and the state of Missouri. 
Turning now to Page 5 and earnings guidance. First, I am pleased to inform you that we expect our 2017 earnings per share to be in the range of $2.65 to $2.85 per share. The midpoint of this guidance reflects strong earnings per share growth of approximately 6.5% compared to weather-normalized 2016 results. Marty will provide you more details on this a bit later. Second, we remain on track to deliver strong long-term earnings growth and continue to expect earnings per share to grow at a 5% to 8% compound annual rate from 2016 to 2020 based on the adjusted 2016 earnings per share guidance midpoint of $2.63 we provided a year ago. We plan to deliver these earnings results in the future through the continued execution of our strategy in 2017 and beyond. 
Turning now to Page 6. A key element of our strategy is to continue to advance our plan for investing in our utilities in a manner consistent with existing regulatory frameworks. The strong earnings growth outlook I just discussed is driven by our rate base growth outlook. Today, we are rolling forward our 5-year investment plan and I am pleased to say that we expect to grow rate base at a strong 6% compound annual rate over the 2016 through 2021 period. As you can see on the right side of this page, we continue to allocate greater levels of capital to those jurisdictions with constructive regulatory frameworks that support investment. Our transmission projects are projected to increase FERC-regulated rate base by 13% compounded annually over the 2016 through 2021 period. In addition, our investments in Illinois Electric Distribution and Illinois Natural Gas are expected to result in 9% compound annual rate base growth for each of these businesses for the same period. I would note that energy efficiency investments made under the Illinois Future Energy Jobs Act are incorporated into this outlook. And finally, our Missouri rate base is expected to grow at a slower 2% compound annual rate. Of course, the expected Missouri rate base growth rate would increase from this level if legislation is enacted that sufficiently enhances the state's regulatory framework to support investment. 
Moving now to Page 7. Another key element of our strategy is to achieve a fair and balanced resolution to our pending Missouri electric rate review. I am pleased to report that as a result of extensive collaboration, all the major parties participating in this rate review, the Ameren Missouri, the staff at the Missouri Public Service Commission, the Office of Public Counsel, industrial consumer groups and others, recently reached an agreement in principle on all the issues in this case. As a result, we expect a stipulation and agreement signed by these parties and possibly others to be filed with the Missouri Public Service Commission very soon, with the request that the agreement be approved by the commission. At this point, the agreement in principle is considered confidential. However, I would note that the earnings guidance we have provided today is consistent with these terms. 
Turning to Page 8 of the presentation. Enhancing Missouri's electric regulatory framework remains a key strategic focus because we strongly believe it would bring significant long-term benefits to our customers and the entire state of Missouri. Consistent with the benefits we have seen in Illinois and around the country, modernized policies to support energy infrastructure investments will lead to a more reliable and smarter energy grid, facilitate the transition to a cleaner and more diverse generation portfolio, provide greater tools for customers to manage their future energy usage, position us to meet our customers' rising energy needs and expectations and create significant quality jobs for Missouri. With these benefits in mind, in December 2016, Senate Bill 190, the Missouri Economic Development and Infrastructure Investment Act was filed. This slide outlines the key provisions of the bill. In summary, Senate Bill 190 would implement important regulatory reforms which would drive significant infrastructure investments and result in the benefits I just described. In addition, this legislation contains robust consumer protections including strong oversight by the Missouri Public Service Commission. 
And finally, Senate Bill 190 includes forward-thinking economic development provisions for our larger energy consumers, which in turn would help create good quality jobs. I would note that enactment of this legislation in its current form will support Ameren Missouri's ability to execute on $1 billion of incremental infrastructure investment over 5 years. Consistent with this filing with the Missouri Public Service Commission last fall, we, along with all the other Missouri investor-owned electric utilities, have continued to actively engage in discussions with customers, legislators, state officials and other stakeholders to build support for this important legislation. I am pleased to report that Senate Bill 190 was approved by the Senate Commerce Committee last week by a bipartisan 8 to 1 vote, is now headed to the full Senate for consideration. While good progress is made on Senate Bill 190 to date, we are still very early in the legislative process. Keep in mind that the legislative session ends on May 12. As we move through the session, we will continue our extensive outreach and collaboration with key stakeholders to move Missouri forward on this important energy and economic policy initiative for the long-term benefit of our customers in the entire state of Missouri. 
Turning now to Page 9 of our presentation and a discussion of potential federal corporate income tax reform. I will begin by saying that Ameren supports thoughtful, comprehensive tax reform as we believe that lower corporate tax rates drive economic growth and job creation, benefiting our customers, the communities we serve and other key stakeholders. Recognizing that we are still in the relatively early stages of the tax reform debate, we are focusing our advocacy efforts with some key principles in mind. We want to ensure that tax reform does not negatively impact our key stakeholders, notably our customers as well as appropriately supports our industry's efforts to invest in our nation's critical energy infrastructure in an affordable manner. 
With these principles in mind, this slide highlights key areas of focus for Ameren and our industry. As I noted, it is still early in this debate and there are many moving parts, but we also recognize that many of you are interested in what impact tax reform could have on Ameren. Based on our current assessment of preliminary tax reform proposals, aside from the expected onetime noncash charge to write-down certain of our deferred tax assets, we do not believe this plan would impact our strong earnings growth guidance through 2020. Marty will address some of the underlying assumptions associated with our assessment in a few moments. Of course, I expect there will be several changes to the tax reform proposals between now and the end of the debate. That is why Ameren and many of my colleagues in the industry will remain actively engaged with policymakers and key stakeholders on this important economic policy matter in the months ahead. 
Turning now to Page 10. Here you can see that our strategic and disciplined allocation of capital is also being driven by our view that the energy grid will be increasingly more important and valuable to our customers, the communities we serve and our shareholders. We plan to continue to invest to modernize our electric and gas transmission and distribution operations to make them safer, smarter and more resilient. As well as invest in smart meters and new technologies in order to meet our customers' future energy needs and expectations. Right side of this page shows that our allocation of capital is expected to grow these energy delivery businesses to nearly 3/4 of our rate base by the end of 2021. As a result, our investment in coal- and gas-fired generation is expected to decline to a combined 15% of rate base by year-end 2021. 
We are also advancing our efforts on innovative technologies to increase operating efficiencies, strengthen the energy grid and create innovative energy solutions for our customers. Further, we remain focused on transitioning our generation to a cleaner and more diverse portfolio in a responsible fashion. And this transition will continue beyond 2021 with the schedule retirement of Meramec's coal-fired energy center in 2022. In addition, Ameren Missouri is developing its next 20-year Integrated Resource Plan which is scheduled to be filed with the Missouri PSC in October 2017. In this plan, we will continue to appropriately balance our responsibilities to our customers and communities, the environment and of course, our shareholders. 
Moving to Page 11. We anticipate that the execution of our strategy in 2017 and beyond will not only bring superior value to our customers but also to our shareholders. To reiterate, we continue to expect earnings per share to grow at a 5% to 8% compound annual rate from 2016 to 2020, based on the adjusted 2016 guidance midpoint we provided a year ago. Further, as I also discussed, we project rate base growth of 6% compounded annually from 2016 to 2021. We expect these growth rates to compare favorably with our regulated utility peers. Further, Ameren shares offer investors an attractive dividend. The annualized equivalent rate of $1.76 per share incorporates the October 2016 decision by the Board of Directors to increase the dividend for the third consecutive year, reflecting their continued confidence in the outlook for our businesses and our long-term strategy. And we continue to expect our dividend payout ratio to range between 55% and 70% of annual earnings. Of course, future dividend increases will be based on consideration of, among other things, earnings growth, cash flows and economic and other business conditions. 
To summarize, we believe our strong rate base and earnings growth profile, combined with our solid dividend, currently providing a yield of approximately 3.3% results in an attractive total return opportunity for our shareholders compared to our regulated utility peers. We remain focused on executing our strategy and I remain firmly convinced that doing so will deliver superior value to our shareholders, customers and the communities we serve. Again, thank you all for joining us today and I'll now turn the call over to Marty."
373264,418746227,1134965,"Ameren Corporation, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 16, 2017",2017-02-16,"Earnings Calls","Ameren Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Warner, and good morning, everyone. I'm turning now to Page 13 of our presentation. As Warner mentioned, we reported 2016 earnings of $2.68 per share compared with core earnings of $2.56 per share for the prior year. And as you can see, there w",2204,"Thank you, Warner, and good morning, everyone. I'm turning now to Page 13 of our presentation. As Warner mentioned, we reported 2016 earnings of $2.68 per share compared with core earnings of $2.56 per share for the prior year. And as you can see, there was no difference between GAAP and core results for 2016. 
On Page 14, we highlight factors that drove the $0.12 per share year-over-year increase in 2016 earnings compared to 2015 core results. As discussed in today's press release, we now consider Ameren to have 4 reportable segments. You can see the 2015 and 2016 comparative earnings per share contributions of these segments graphically at the right where we show Ameren Missouri in green representing all of the operations of Ameren Missouri; Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution in dark blue; Ameren Illinois Natural Gas in light blue; and last, but certainly not least, the Ameren Transmission in orange, which is composed of the FERC-regulated Ameren transmission businesses of Ameren Illinois and ATXI. We believe that analyzing and reporting results in this manner is appropriate given the unique regulatory framework associated with each segment and the manner in which we allocate capital and wish to assess performance over time. We hope you find this new segment presentation useful. 
So then diving into the comparative earnings results, let's start with Ameren Transmission where the earnings per share contribution increased from $0.34 in 2015 to $0.48 in 2016. This 41% growth was driven by increased infrastructure investments at both ATXI and Ameren Illinois which both operate under constructive FERC formulaic ratemaking, coupled with higher average earned returns on equity. In 2016, our Transmission segment benefited from a temporarily higher FERC-allowed ROE as a result of the expiration in May of 2016 of the 15-month refund period for the second MISO ROE complaint case. The FERC's order in the first complaint case then lowered the allowed ROE in late September 2016 to 10.82%, including our 50 basis point adder for voluntary participation in MISO. 
Moving to Ameren Illinois Natural Gas. In 2016, we saw the earnings contribution of this segment increased 60%, rising from $0.15 per share to $0.24 per share. This growth was again driven by infrastructure investment as well as an updated allowed return on equity, both of which were reflected in rates that became effective in December of 2015, incorporating a 2016 forward test year. 
Turning to our Illinois Electric Distribution business. 2016 results grew by just 2% from $0.51 in 2015 to $0.52 in 2016. Here, the benefits of infrastructure investment and warmer summer weather were partially offset by the temporary impacts of a lower allowed ROE under formulaic ratemaking of 8.4% compared to 8.64% for the year prior. The 2016 allowed ROE was based on the 2016 average 30-year Treasury yield of 2.6%, down from the 2015 average of 2.84%. The year-over-year earnings comparison was also negatively impacted by the absence in 2016 of certain power usage cost recoveries reflected in 2015 results. 
The earnings contribution from Ameren Missouri, our largest segment, declined from $1.63 in 2015 to $1.47 in 2016. Here, the earnings benefits of very warm summer temperatures and disciplined cost management were not enough to overcome the unfavorable impacts of lower sales to the New Madrid smelter and the unfavorable year-over-year comparative earnings impact of the 2013 to 2015 Missouri energy efficiency plan. In 2016, Ameren Missouri recognized a performance incentive award associated with the energy efficiency results achieved over the 3 years ending in 2015, reflecting the tremendous success of this program for our customers. However, this was lower than energy efficiency program benefits recognized in 2015. The earnings comparison was also unfavorably affected by nuclear refueling and maintenance outage expenses at the Callaway Energy Center in 2016 compared to no such outage in the prior year as well as higher depreciation expense. 
Finally, the Ameren parent and other net cost comparison was positively impacted by the first quarter recognition of tax benefits associated with share-based compensation. Before moving on, let me briefly cover 2016 electric sales growth compared to the prior year. Weather-normalized kilowatt-hour sales to residential and commercial customers were up slightly in both Illinois and Missouri, reflecting underlying growth and the leap day sales benefit partially offset by energy efficiency impacts. Kilowatt-hour sales to Illinois industrial customers in 2016 decreased about 1% primarily due to lower sales to several large low-margin Illinois customers, including those in steelmaking, heavy equipment manufacturing, mining and energy. However, we did see year-over-year growth in sales to industrial customers in the second half of the year after a first half decline. Finally, kilowatt-hour sales to Missouri industrial customers declined about 1/2 of 1%, excluding lower sales to the New Madrid smelter. 
Moving to Page 15 of our presentation. I would now like to transition to a discussion of key drivers impacting our 2017 earnings guidance. As Warner stated, we expect 2017 diluted earnings to be in range of $2.65 to $2.85 per share. On this page and the next, we have listed key earnings drivers of and assumptions behind our 2017 earnings guidance broken down by segment and as compared to 2016 results. Ameren Missouri's earnings are expected to rise in 2017 assuming increased electric service rates consistent with the agreement in principle to settle its pending rate review. The new rates would address the negative earnings impacts of reduced sales levels to the New Madrid smelter, adding an estimated $0.12 per share to the year-over-year earnings comparison. The new rates are also expected to reflect infrastructure investments made for the benefit of customers through December 31, 2016, and changes in various operating expense levels. In 2017, we expect Missouri's results to reflect increased depreciation, transmission and property tax expenses. These increases in expense are expected to continue to be a drag on earned returns particularly during the first half of 2017 prior to the date when rates are adjusted. In addition, a return to normal temperatures would reduce Ameren Missouri's earnings by $0.08 per share compared to last year. Further, Ameren Missouri's electric service earnings will be negatively affected by the absence in 2017 of the previously mentioned energy efficiency performance incentive award that was recognized in 2016. Finally, expenses associated with the Callaway nuclear refueling and maintenance outage, scheduled for the fall of this year, are expected to be comparable to those experienced as a result of the spring outage last year. 
Moving now to our Transmission business. Earnings are expected to rise in 2017, benefiting from additional infrastructure investments made in Ameren Illinois and ATXI under formula ratemaking. However, we expect this benefit to be partially offset by a lower projected weighted average allowed ROE in 2017 compared to last year. As I discussed a few minutes ago, our FERC-allowed ROE was temporarily increased for part of 2016, resulting in average allowed ROE of approximately 11.3% for the full year. Since late September of last year, our FERC-allowed ROE has been 10.82%. Our guidance reflects a FERC final order in the second MISO ROE complaint case in the second quarter of this year with an ROE consistent with the ALJ's recommendation. Of course, the timing of this decision will depend on when new commissioners are confirmed and a quorum is created at the FERC. 
Moving now to Page 16 and our Illinois Electric Distribution business. We anticipate increased weather-normalized earnings in 2017 compared with 2016 reflecting additional infrastructure investments made under formula ratemaking. Further, Illinois Electric Distribution earnings incorporate a formula-based allowed ROE of 9.1% using a forecasted 3.3% 2017 average yield for the 30-year treasury bond compared to an allowed ROE of 8.4% in 2016. These positive factors are expected to be mitigated by the absence in 2017 of the benefit of warmer-than-normal 2016 summer temperatures as revenue decoupling becomes effective this year. I would also like to mention that we have provided the earnings sensitivity to changes in the allowed ROE for Illinois Electric Distribution on this page. 
Completing the discussion of our Illinois businesses, natural gas segment earnings are expected to benefit from qualified investments that are included in rates on a timely basis under the state's gas infrastructure rider. I would also like to take a minute to discuss our 2017 electric sales outlook. We expect weather-normalized combined Illinois and Missouri kilowatt-hour sales to residential and commercial customers to be roughly flat compared to last year as underlying growth is expected to be offset by the effects of our energy efficiency programs and the absence of the leap day. Turning to industrial customers, combined Illinois and Missouri kilowatt-hour sales to this group are expected to be up 1% to 2% compared to last year. 
Moving finally to Ameren-wide drivers and assumptions. We expect an effective income tax rate of approximately 38% this year, an increase from last year's rate of 36.7%, reflecting substantially lower expected first quarter 2017 tax benefits associated with share-based compensation as compared to 2016. Of course, this effective tax rate, as well as other elements of our 2017 guidance, assumes no change in federal income tax policy during the year. I will add to the color Warner provided on potential tax legislation in a moment. 
Turning to Page 17. For 2017, we anticipate negative free cash flow of approximately $700 million. On the right side of this page, we provide a breakdown of our $2.2 billion of planned 2017 capital expenditures by business with nearly 2/3 allocated to jurisdictions with modern constructive regulatory frameworks. We expect to fund this year's negative free cash flow and debt maturities with short and long-term borrowings. 
Moving to Page 18 of the presentation. Here we provide an overview of our $10.8 billion of planned capital expenditures for the 2017 through 2021 period. The expected funding sources including substantial income tax deferrals and tax assets for these infrastructure investments are listed on this page. The tax deferrals are driven primarily by our planned capital expenditures including bonus tax depreciation provided in current law. The tax assets include $440 million with the parent company that are not currently earning a return. Given our expected funding sources, we do not expect to issue additional equity over this period. We remain committed to funding our capital expenditures in a manner that maintains solid credit metrics and this is reflected in our capitalization target of around 50% equity. 
Moving now to Page 19. Earlier, Warner discussed our support for thoughtful federal tax reform and some of the key areas of focus for Ameren and the utility industry as a whole. He also mentioned that we believe the debate on tax reform elements is in the early stages and we are far from knowing final tax reform attributes and consequently, the true financial consequences. That said, we know that many of you are attempting to model the potential impacts of known reform considerations. Here, we attempted to provide some key Ameren considerations relative to the pillars of widely discussed tax reform proposals. Overall, I would say we are well positioned to sustain our earnings per share growth rate expectations through 2020. Today, our operations are fully rate regulated and we have relatively little parent company debt after considering that which supports our transmission segment. 
Further, we have strong balance sheet, credit metrics relative to our current credit ratings and we have a solid infrastructure investment pipeline filled with projects that would benefit customers. We do expect that lowering the federal corporate tax rate would cause us to revalue our Ameren parent tax asset balances as well as certain deferred tax balances of our rate-regulated subsidiaries, causing a onetime noncash charge to earnings to be recognized upon such a tax rate reduction becoming law. However, a lower corporate tax rate favorably impacts customer rates and our tax obligations prospectively. 
And while near-term negative cash flow impacts may occur relative to forecasted levels between the time when tax rates are reflected in rates and corporate tax obligations are reduced as well as due to the expected gradual flow-back of excess deferred taxes, we expect that cash flow reductions would be mitigated by increased earnings on additional rate base, emanating from comparatively higher NOL balances and lower deferred tax obligations reflected in rate base. Overall, we currently forecast those net cash flow reductions to be manageable in the context of our overall capitalization and long-term cash flow forecast. And to reiterate, we expect no change to our earnings per share growth outlook based on our modeling of current tax reform proposals. But then again the debate is far from over and uncertainty clearly exists. 
Finally, turning to Page 20, I will summarize. In 2016, we again delivered solid earnings growth and continue to successfully execute our strategy. As Warner stated, as we look ahead, we continue to expect strong earnings per share growth driven by strong rate base growth and disciplined financial management. Further, we expect this growth to compare favorably with the growth of our regulated utility peers. And Ameren shares continue to offer investors an attractive dividend. In total, we have an attractive total shareholder return story that we believe compares very favorably to peers. That compare -- that concludes the prepared remarks. We now invite your questions."

We'll take a step back and look at our overall capital expenditure and financing plans. Of course, we do have a very strong balance sheet today.

It's something that's actively under consideration. We appreciate your question about our plans to fund our capital expenditures and our maturities this year. As we noted on the slides, we have about $675 million of maturities this year in June",277,"Yes, sure. It's something that's actively under consideration. We appreciate your question about our plans to fund our capital expenditures and our maturities this year. As we noted on the slides, we have about $675 million of maturities this year in June. At Ameren Missouri, we've got a $425 million maturity. And then in November, we've got $250 million maturity at Ameren Illinois. And so as we look ahead this year, a few things, we expect that midyear following that maturity at Missouri, we'd likely do a financing there. In late in the year, in November, December after that maturity at Ameren Illinois, we'd also plan to do a financing there. There, I think not only to refinance the maturity but also some of the capital expenditures that we've had through the year in Ameren Illinois. And then of course, as you mentioned, we've been financing the transmission business and the growth there really through the use of parent company debt, long-term and short-term debt. As we move through the year, financing additional infrastructure investment, our short-term debt balances would grow and so it's likely around midyear that we'd execute some sort of a long-term financing, and we'll provide you greater details on our thoughts there as we move through the year but you identified, say, the relevant considerations whether to do that long-term financing at the parent or at the transmission entity down at ATXI. So those are things that we're assessing. We do, like I said, expect that we will do execute a long-term financing around midyear, but those details are still being thought through and we'll share more with you later in the year."

So with regard to the Q4 results compared to the prior year, weather was a positive, in fact, it was about a $0.06 positive versus prior year. But versus our expectations, which revolved around normal weather, weather was a negative, about $0.01. We had sort of a warm year last year including a warm fourth quarter, so it was a bit of a negative compared to expectations for the quarter. Of course, we benefited from continued infrastructure investments. Obviously, that was a benefit in the fourth quarter versus the prior year. We did have a lower effective tax rate in the fourth quarter versus last year. Though, I'll tell you that versus our expectations, it was a little higher than expected, so tax issues or items were a bit of a negative versus our expectations coming into the fourth quarter. And then again, going back to, compared to prior years, we had lower benefits from the energy efficiency programs in Missouri. You'll recall that in 2015, as we were coming to the end of that first energy efficiency program, we had high take rates, if you will, on the incentives we were providing to customers and that translated into some benefits being recognized by the company in late 2015 that didn't recur then in 2016. And so those were some of the big things. Then of course, don't forget about the year-over-year impact of the New Madrid smelter load loss which was obviously a negative in 2016 versus '15. So again, compared to prior years, prior year plus on weather, plus on investment returns, plus on the effective tax rate, minus on the energy efficiency impacts and minus in terms of the New Madrid smelter, that's kind of how it all shakes up compared to the prior year. But again, compared to expectations, I would say a little bit lower than our expectations coming into the quarter due to some tax items and weather. So how we shake all that up. Then I think your second question, we'll turn it over to -- back to Michael Moehn."

Today, we announced 2016 earnings of $2.68 per share compared to core earnings of $2.56 per share for 2015. Once again, we delivered another year of solid earnings growth driven by the successful execution of our strategy. Marty will discuss the drivers of our 2016 earnings results in a few minutes. But first, I want to highlight some of the key actions we took to successfully execute our strategy in 2016 for the benefit of our customers and shareholders. 
Starting with our strategy to prudently invest in and operate our utilities in a manner consistent with existing regulatory frameworks. We continue to allocate significant amounts of capital to those businesses that are supported by modern constructive regulatory frameworks for the benefit of our customers. In fact, we invested $2.1 billion in utility infrastructure last year with 2/3, over $1.3 billion, going to projects in the FERC-regulated electric transmission and Illinois-regulated electric and natural gas distribution businesses. A significant portion of the $1.3 billion was invested in the Illinois Rivers project, a new high voltage transmission line, which will span 385 miles across the state of Illinois. This project remains on schedule for completion in 2019, with 4 of its 9 line segments energized, including 2 river crossings and 8 of 10 substations now in service. This strategic allocation of capital and effective project execution, combined with disciplined cost management, meaningfully contributed to the solid financial results I just discussed. 
Turning to Missouri. In order to earn a fair return on our electric business, we filed a rate review request in July with the Missouri Public Service Commission. We were seeking to recover costs related to infrastructure investments made for the benefit of customers and to remove the negative earnings effect of lower sales to the New Madrid smelter. There was a recent development in this rate review, and I will provide an important update in a few minutes. 
Moving down the page, last year, we also continued to work to enhance our regulatory frameworks and advocate for responsible energy and economic policies. I am pleased to report that we made very good progress on this strategic focus area as well. Notably, Ameren Illinois successfully advocated for the recently enacted Future Energy Jobs Act, which improved the already constructive regulatory framework for our electric distribution business in Illinois. This law extends constructive formula ratemaking through 2022, enabling the continuation of our strong infrastructure investment plan to benefit our customers and the state of Illinois. It also meaningfully improved the regulatory framework for energy efficiency programs. The law allows us to capitalize and earn a fair return on our future energy efficiency expenditures, which will enable Ameren Illinois to expand its energy efficiency programs for the benefit of our customers. Further, it provides revenue decoupling, eliminating potential sales margin erosion due to, among other things, energy efficiency. Finally, this law will help maintain and create new jobs in our service territory and it contains strong consumer protections. Simply put, it was a win-win for all stakeholders in Illinois. 
And in Missouri, we continued our extensive efforts to enhance the state's regulatory framework for electric service in order to support investment in a smarter energy grid and create jobs. A great deal of time and effort was spent working with key stakeholders after the 2016 legislative session to discuss this important matter for the state of Missouri. I'll update you on our ongoing efforts in this area a bit later. 
The final element of our strategy calls for creating and capitalizing on opportunities for investment for the benefit of our customers and shareholders. As I just mentioned, the Illinois energy legislation enacted in late 2016 enables expansion of energy efficiency programs and allows Ameren Illinois to capitalize and earn a fair return on those investments. Also, the Missouri Public Service Commission approved 2 solar pilot programs that will provide clean energy choices for our customers and increase investment opportunities for Ameren Missouri, should these pilots prove successful and the programs be expanded. Finally, in September of last year, Ameren Missouri filed a plan with the Missouri PSC for potential incremental infrastructure investments of $1 billion over a 5-year period ending in 2022 that would benefit customers, should these investments be enabled by an enhanced electric regulatory framework. Ameren Missouri also identified additional potential incremental infrastructure investments over a 10-year period that would modernize its energy grid and facilitate the transition to a cleaner, more diverse generation portfolio for the long-term benefit of its customers and the state of Missouri. 
Turning now to Page 5 and earnings guidance. First, I am pleased to inform you that we expect our 2017 earnings per share to be in the range of $2.65 to $2.85 per share. The midpoint of this guidance reflects strong earnings per share growth of approximately 6.5% compared to weather-normalized 2016 results. Marty will provide you more details on this a bit later. Second, we remain on track to deliver strong long-term earnings growth and continue to expect earnings per share to grow at a 5% to 8% compound annual rate from 2016 to 2020 based on the adjusted 2016 earnings per share guidance midpoint of $2.63 we provided a year ago. We plan to deliver these earnings results in the future through the continued execution of our strategy in 2017 and beyond. 
Turning now to Page 6. A key element of our strategy is to continue to advance our plan for investing in our utilities in a manner consistent with existing regulatory frameworks. The strong earnings growth outlook I just discussed is driven by our rate base growth outlook. Today, we are rolling forward our 5-year investment plan and I am pleased to say that we expect to grow rate base at a strong 6% compound annual rate over the 2016 through 2021 period. As you can see on the right side of this page, we continue to allocate greater levels of capital to those jurisdictions with constructive regulatory frameworks that support investment. Our transmission projects are projected to increase FERC-regulated rate base by 13% compounded annually over the 2016 through 2021 period. In addition, our investments in Illinois Electric Distribution and Illinois Natural Gas are expected to result in 9% compound annual rate base growth for each of these businesses for the same period. I would note that energy efficiency investments made under the Illinois Future Energy Jobs Act are incorporated into this outlook. And finally, our Missouri rate base is expected to grow at a slower 2% compound annual rate. Of course, the expected Missouri rate base growth rate would increase from this level if legislation is enacted that sufficiently enhances the state's regulatory framework to support investment. 
Moving now to Page 7. Another key element of our strategy is to achieve a fair and balanced resolution to our pending Missouri electric rate review. I am pleased to report that as a result of extensive collaboration, all the major parties participating in this rate review, the Ameren Missouri, the staff at the Missouri Public Service Commission, the Office of Public Counsel, industrial consumer groups and others, recently reached an agreement in principle on all the issues in this case. As a result, we expect a stipulation and agreement signed by these parties and possibly others to be filed with the Missouri Public Service Commission very soon, with the request that the agreement be approved by the commission. At this point, the agreement in principle is considered confidential. However, I would note that the earnings guidance we have provided today is consistent with these terms. 
Turning to Page 8 of the presentation. Enhancing Missouri's electric regulatory framework remains a key strategic focus because we strongly believe it would bring significant long-term benefits to our customers and the entire state of Missouri. Consistent with the benefits we have seen in Illinois and around the country, modernized policies to support energy infrastructure investments will lead to a more reliable and smarter energy grid, facilitate the transition to a cleaner and more diverse generation portfolio, provide greater tools for customers to manage their future energy usage, position us to meet our customers' rising energy needs and expectations and create significant quality jobs for Missouri. With these benefits in mind, in December 2016, Senate Bill 190, the Missouri Economic Development and Infrastructure Investment Act was filed. This slide outlines the key provisions of the bill. In summary, Senate Bill 190 would implement important regulatory reforms which would drive significant infrastructure investments and result in the benefits I just described. In addition, this legislation contains robust consumer protections including strong oversight by the Missouri Public Service Commission. 
And finally, Senate Bill 190 includes forward-thinking economic development provisions for our larger energy consumers, which in turn would help create good quality jobs. I would note that enactment of this legislation in its current form will support Ameren Missouri's ability to execute on $1 billion of incremental infrastructure investment over 5 years. Consistent with this filing with the Missouri Public Service Commission last fall, we, along with all the other Missouri investor-owned electric utilities, have continued to actively engage in discussions with customers, legislators, state officials and other stakeholders to build support for this important legislation. I am pleased to report that Senate Bill 190 was approved by the Senate Commerce Committee last week by a bipartisan 8 to 1 vote, is now headed to the full Senate for consideration. While good progress is made on Senate Bill 190 to date, we are still very early in the legislative process. Keep in mind that the legislative session ends on May 12. As we move through the session, we will continue our extensive outreach and collaboration with key stakeholders to move Missouri forward on this important energy and economic policy initiative for the long-term benefit of our customers in the entire state of Missouri. 
Turning now to Page 9 of our presentation and a discussion of potential federal corporate income tax reform. I will begin by saying that Ameren supports thoughtful, comprehensive tax reform as we believe that lower corporate tax rates drive economic growth and job creation, benefiting our customers, the communities we serve and other key stakeholders. Recognizing that we are still in the relatively early stages of the tax reform debate, we are focusing our advocacy efforts with some key principles in mind. We want to ensure that tax reform does not negatively impact our key stakeholders, notably our customers as well as appropriately supports our industry's efforts to invest in our nation's critical energy infrastructure in an affordable manner. 
With these principles in mind, this slide highlights key areas of focus for Ameren and our industry. As I noted, it is still early in this debate and there are many moving parts, but we also recognize that many of you are interested in what impact tax reform could have on Ameren. Based on our current assessment of preliminary tax reform proposals, aside from the expected onetime noncash charge to write-down certain of our deferred tax assets, we do not believe this plan would impact our strong earnings growth guidance through 2020. Marty will address some of the underlying assumptions associated with our assessment in a few moments. Of course, I expect there will be several changes to the tax reform proposals between now and the end of the debate. That is why Ameren and many of my colleagues in the industry will remain actively engaged with policymakers and key stakeholders on this important economic policy matter in the months ahead. 
Turning now to Page 10. Here you can see that our strategic and disciplined allocation of capital is also being driven by our view that the energy grid will be increasingly more important and valuable to our customers, the communities we serve and our shareholders. We plan to continue to invest to modernize our electric and gas transmission and distribution operations to make them safer, smarter and more resilient. As well as invest in smart meters and new technologies in order to meet our customers' future energy needs and expectations. Right side of this page shows that our allocation of capital is expected to grow these energy delivery businesses to nearly 3/4 of our rate base by the end of 2021. As a result, our investment in coal- and gas-fired generation is expected to decline to a combined 15% of rate base by year-end 2021. 
We are also advancing our efforts on innovative technologies to increase operating efficiencies, strengthen the energy grid and create innovative energy solutions for our customers. Further, we remain focused on transitioning our generation to a cleaner and more diverse portfolio in a responsible fashion. And this transition will continue beyond 2021 with the schedule retirement of Meramec's coal-fired energy center in 2022. In addition, Ameren Missouri is developing its next 20-year Integrated Resource Plan which is scheduled to be filed with the Missouri PSC in October 2017. In this plan, we will continue to appropriately balance our responsibilities to our customers and communities, the environment and of course, our shareholders. 
Moving to Page 11. We anticipate that the execution of our strategy in 2017 and beyond will not only bring superior value to our customers but also to our shareholders. To reiterate, we continue to expect earnings per share to grow at a 5% to 8% compound annual rate from 2016 to 2020, based on the adjusted 2016 guidance midpoint we provided a year ago. Further, as I also discussed, we project rate base growth of 6% compounded annually from 2016 to 2021. We expect these growth rates to compare favorably with our regulated utility peers. Further, Ameren shares offer investors an attractive dividend. The annualized equivalent rate of $1.76 per share incorporates the October 2016 decision by the Board of Directors to increase the dividend for the third consecutive year, reflecting their continued confidence in the outlook for our businesses and our long-term strategy. And we continue to expect our dividend payout ratio to range between 55% and 70% of annual earnings. Of course, future dividend increases will be based on consideration of, among other things, earnings growth, cash flows and economic and other business conditions. 
To summarize, we believe our strong rate base and earnings growth profile, combined with our solid dividend, currently providing a yield of approximately 3.3% results in an attractive total return opportunity for our shareholders compared to our regulated utility peers. We remain focused on executing our strategy and I remain firmly convinced that doing so will deliver superior value to our shareholders, customers and the communities we serve. Again, thank you all for joining us today and I'll now turn the call over to Marty."

I'm turning now to Page 13 of our presentation. As Warner mentioned, we reported 2016 earnings of $2.68 per share compared with core earnings of $2.56 per share for the prior year. And as you can see, there w",2204,"Thank you, Warner, and good morning, everyone. I'm turning now to Page 13 of our presentation. As Warner mentioned, we reported 2016 earnings of $2.68 per share compared with core earnings of $2.56 per share for the prior year. And as you can see, there was no difference between GAAP and core results for 2016. 
On Page 14, we highlight factors that drove the $0.12 per share year-over-year increase in 2016 earnings compared to 2015 core results. As discussed in today's press release, we now consider Ameren to have 4 reportable segments. You can see the 2015 and 2016 comparative earnings per share contributions of these segments graphically at the right where we show Ameren Missouri in green representing all of the operations of Ameren Missouri; Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution in dark blue; Ameren Illinois Natural Gas in light blue; and last, but certainly not least, the Ameren Transmission in orange, which is composed of the FERC-regulated Ameren transmission businesses of Ameren Illinois and ATXI. We believe that analyzing and reporting results in this manner is appropriate given the unique regulatory framework associated with each segment and the manner in which we allocate capital and wish to assess performance over time. We hope you find this new segment presentation useful. 
So then diving into the comparative earnings results, let's start with Ameren Transmission where the earnings per share contribution increased from $0.34 in 2015 to $0.48 in 2016. This 41% growth was driven by increased infrastructure investments at both ATXI and Ameren Illinois which both operate under constructive FERC formulaic ratemaking, coupled with higher average earned returns on equity. In 2016, our Transmission segment benefited from a temporarily higher FERC-allowed ROE as a result of the expiration in May of 2016 of the 15-month refund period for the second MISO ROE complaint case. The FERC's order in the first complaint case then lowered the allowed ROE in late September 2016 to 10.82%, including our 50 basis point adder for voluntary participation in MISO. 
Moving to Ameren Illinois Natural Gas. In 2016, we saw the earnings contribution of this segment increased 60%, rising from $0.15 per share to $0.24 per share. This growth was again driven by infrastructure investment as well as an updated allowed return on equity, both of which were reflected in rates that became effective in December of 2015, incorporating a 2016 forward test year. 
Turning to our Illinois Electric Distribution business. 2016 results grew by just 2% from $0.51 in 2015 to $0.52 in 2016. Here, the benefits of infrastructure investment and warmer summer weather were partially offset by the temporary impacts of a lower allowed ROE under formulaic ratemaking of 8.4% compared to 8.64% for the year prior. The 2016 allowed ROE was based on the 2016 average 30-year Treasury yield of 2.6%, down from the 2015 average of 2.84%. The year-over-year earnings comparison was also negatively impacted by the absence in 2016 of certain power usage cost recoveries reflected in 2015 results. 
The earnings contribution from Ameren Missouri, our largest segment, declined from $1.63 in 2015 to $1.47 in 2016. Here, the earnings benefits of very warm summer temperatures and disciplined cost management were not enough to overcome the unfavorable impacts of lower sales to the New Madrid smelter and the unfavorable year-over-year comparative earnings impact of the 2013 to 2015 Missouri energy efficiency plan. In 2016, Ameren Missouri recognized a performance incentive award associated with the energy efficiency results achieved over the 3 years ending in 2015, reflecting the tremendous success of this program for our customers. However, this was lower than energy efficiency program benefits recognized in 2015. The earnings comparison was also unfavorably affected by nuclear refueling and maintenance outage expenses at the Callaway Energy Center in 2016 compared to no such outage in the prior year as well as higher depreciation expense. 
Finally, the Ameren parent and other net cost comparison was positively impacted by the first quarter recognition of tax benefits associated with share-based compensation. Before moving on, let me briefly cover 2016 electric sales growth compared to the prior year. Weather-normalized kilowatt-hour sales to residential and commercial customers were up slightly in both Illinois and Missouri, reflecting underlying growth and the leap day sales benefit partially offset by energy efficiency impacts. Kilowatt-hour sales to Illinois industrial customers in 2016 decreased about 1% primarily due to lower sales to several large low-margin Illinois customers, including those in steelmaking, heavy equipment manufacturing, mining and energy. However, we did see year-over-year growth in sales to industrial customers in the second half of the year after a first half decline. Finally, kilowatt-hour sales to Missouri industrial customers declined about 1/2 of 1%, excluding lower sales to the New Madrid smelter. 
Moving to Page 15 of our presentation. I would now like to transition to a discussion of key drivers impacting our 2017 earnings guidance. As Warner stated, we expect 2017 diluted earnings to be in range of $2.65 to $2.85 per share. On this page and the next, we have listed key earnings drivers of and assumptions behind our 2017 earnings guidance broken down by segment and as compared to 2016 results. Ameren Missouri's earnings are expected to rise in 2017 assuming increased electric service rates consistent with the agreement in principle to settle its pending rate review. The new rates would address the negative earnings impacts of reduced sales levels to the New Madrid smelter, adding an estimated $0.12 per share to the year-over-year earnings comparison. The new rates are also expected to reflect infrastructure investments made for the benefit of customers through December 31, 2016, and changes in various operating expense levels. In 2017, we expect Missouri's results to reflect increased depreciation, transmission and property tax expenses. These increases in expense are expected to continue to be a drag on earned returns particularly during the first half of 2017 prior to the date when rates are adjusted. In addition, a return to normal temperatures would reduce Ameren Missouri's earnings by $0.08 per share compared to last year. Further, Ameren Missouri's electric service earnings will be negatively affected by the absence in 2017 of the previously mentioned energy efficiency performance incentive award that was recognized in 2016. Finally, expenses associated with the Callaway nuclear refueling and maintenance outage, scheduled for the fall of this year, are expected to be comparable to those experienced as a result of the spring outage last year. 
Moving now to our Transmission business. Earnings are expected to rise in 2017, benefiting from additional infrastructure investments made in Ameren Illinois and ATXI under formula ratemaking. However, we expect this benefit to be partially offset by a lower projected weighted average allowed ROE in 2017 compared to last year. As I discussed a few minutes ago, our FERC-allowed ROE was temporarily increased for part of 2016, resulting in average allowed ROE of approximately 11.3% for the full year. Since late September of last year, our FERC-allowed ROE has been 10.82%. Our guidance reflects a FERC final order in the second MISO ROE complaint case in the second quarter of this year with an ROE consistent with the ALJ's recommendation. Of course, the timing of this decision will depend on when new commissioners are confirmed and a quorum is created at the FERC. 
Moving now to Page 16 and our Illinois Electric Distribution business. We anticipate increased weather-normalized earnings in 2017 compared with 2016 reflecting additional infrastructure investments made under formula ratemaking. Further, Illinois Electric Distribution earnings incorporate a formula-based allowed ROE of 9.1% using a forecasted 3.3% 2017 average yield for the 30-year treasury bond compared to an allowed ROE of 8.4% in 2016. These positive factors are expected to be mitigated by the absence in 2017 of the benefit of warmer-than-normal 2016 summer temperatures as revenue decoupling becomes effective this year. I would also like to mention that we have provided the earnings sensitivity to changes in the allowed ROE for Illinois Electric Distribution on this page. 
Completing the discussion of our Illinois businesses, natural gas segment earnings are expected to benefit from qualified investments that are included in rates on a timely basis under the state's gas infrastructure rider. I would also like to take a minute to discuss our 2017 electric sales outlook. We expect weather-normalized combined Illinois and Missouri kilowatt-hour sales to residential and commercial customers to be roughly flat compared to last year as underlying growth is expected to be offset by the effects of our energy efficiency programs and the absence of the leap day. Turning to industrial customers, combined Illinois and Missouri kilowatt-hour sales to this group are expected to be up 1% to 2% compared to last year. 
Moving finally to Ameren-wide drivers and assumptions. We expect an effective income tax rate of approximately 38% this year, an increase from last year's rate of 36.7%, reflecting substantially lower expected first quarter 2017 tax benefits associated with share-based compensation as compared to 2016. Of course, this effective tax rate, as well as other elements of our 2017 guidance, assumes no change in federal income tax policy during the year. I will add to the color Warner provided on potential tax legislation in a moment. 
Turning to Page 17. For 2017, we anticipate negative free cash flow of approximately $700 million. On the right side of this page, we provide a breakdown of our $2.2 billion of planned 2017 capital expenditures by business with nearly 2/3 allocated to jurisdictions with modern constructive regulatory frameworks. We expect to fund this year's negative free cash flow and debt maturities with short and long-term borrowings. 
Moving to Page 18 of the presentation. Here we provide an overview of our $10.8 billion of planned capital expenditures for the 2017 through 2021 period. The expected funding sources including substantial income tax deferrals and tax assets for these infrastructure investments are listed on this page. The tax deferrals are driven primarily by our planned capital expenditures including bonus tax depreciation provided in current law. The tax assets include $440 million with the parent company that are not currently earning a return. Given our expected funding sources, we do not expect to issue additional equity over this period. We remain committed to funding our capital expenditures in a manner that maintains solid credit metrics and this is reflected in our capitalization target of around 50% equity. 
Moving now to Page 19. Earlier, Warner discussed our support for thoughtful federal tax reform and some of the key areas of focus for Ameren and the utility industry as a whole. He also mentioned that we believe the debate on tax reform elements is in the early stages and we are far from knowing final tax reform attributes and consequently, the true financial consequences. That said, we know that many of you are attempting to model the potential impacts of known reform considerations. Here, we attempted to provide some key Ameren considerations relative to the pillars of widely discussed tax reform proposals. Overall, I would say we are well positioned to sustain our earnings per share growth rate expectations through 2020. Today, our operations are fully rate regulated and we have relatively little parent company debt after considering that which supports our transmission segment. 
Further, we have strong balance sheet, credit metrics relative to our current credit ratings and we have a solid infrastructure investment pipeline filled with projects that would benefit customers. We do expect that lowering the federal corporate tax rate would cause us to revalue our Ameren parent tax asset balances as well as certain deferred tax balances of our rate-regulated subsidiaries, causing a onetime noncash charge to earnings to be recognized upon such a tax rate reduction becoming law. However, a lower corporate tax rate favorably impacts customer rates and our tax obligations prospectively. 
And while near-term negative cash flow impacts may occur relative to forecasted levels between the time when tax rates are reflected in rates and corporate tax obligations are reduced as well as due to the expected gradual flow-back of excess deferred taxes, we expect that cash flow reductions would be mitigated by increased earnings on additional rate base, emanating from comparatively higher NOL balances and lower deferred tax obligations reflected in rate base. Overall, we currently forecast those net cash flow reductions to be manageable in the context of our overall capitalization and long-term cash flow forecast. And to reiterate, we expect no change to our earnings per share growth outlook based on our modeling of current tax reform proposals. But then again the debate is far from over and uncertainty clearly exists. 
Finally, turning to Page 20, I will summarize. In 2016, we again delivered solid earnings growth and continue to successfully execute our strategy. As Warner stated, as we look ahead, we continue to expect strong earnings per share growth driven by strong rate base growth and disciplined financial management. Further, we expect this growth to compare favorably with the growth of our regulated utility peers. And Ameren shares continue to offer investors an attractive dividend. In total, we have an attractive total shareholder return story that we believe compares very favorably to peers. That compare -- that concludes the prepared remarks. We now invite your questions."

We'll take a step back and look at our overall capital expenditure and financing plans. Of course, we do have a very strong balance sheet today.

We appreciate your question about our plans to fund our capital expenditures and our maturities this year. As we noted on the slides, we have about $675 million of maturities this year in June. At Ameren Missouri, we've got a $425 million maturity. And then in November, we've got $250 million maturity at Ameren Illinois. And so as we look ahead this year, a few things, we expect that midyear following that maturity at Missouri, we'd likely do a financing there. In late in the year, in November, December after that maturity at Ameren Illinois, we'd also plan to do a financing there. There, I think not only to refinance the maturity but also some of the capital expenditures that we've had through the year in Ameren Illinois. And then of course, as you mentioned, we've been financing the transmission business and the growth there really through the use of parent company debt, long-term and short-term debt. As we move through the year, financing additional infrastructure investment, our short-term debt balances would grow and so it's likely around midyear that we'd execute some sort of a long-term financing, and we'll provide you greater details on our thoughts there as we move through the year but you identified, say, the relevant considerations whether to do that long-term financing at the parent or at the transmission entity down at ATXI. So those are things that we're assessing. We do, like I said, expect that we will do execute a long-term financing around midyear, but those details are still being thought through and we'll share more with you later in the year."

So with regard to the Q4 results compared to the prior year, weather was a positive, in fact, it was about a $0.06 positive versus prior year. But versus our expectations, which revolved around normal weather, weather was a negative, about $0.01. We had sort of a warm year last year including a warm fourth quarter, so it was a bit of a negative compared to expectations for the quarter. Of course, we benefited from continued infrastructure investments. Obviously, that was a benefit in the fourth quarter versus the prior year. We did have a lower effective tax rate in the fourth quarter versus last year. Though, I'll tell you that versus our expectations, it was a little higher than expected, so tax issues or items were a bit of a negative versus our expectations coming into the fourth quarter. And then again, going back to, compared to prior years, we had lower benefits from the energy efficiency programs in Missouri. You'll recall that in 2015, as we were coming to the end of that first energy efficiency program, we had high take rates, if you will, on the incentives we were providing to customers and that translated into some benefits being recognized by the company in late 2015 that didn't recur then in 2016. And so those were some of the big things. Then of course, don't forget about the year-over-year impact of the New Madrid smelter load loss which was obviously a negative in 2016 versus '15. So again, compared to prior years, prior year plus on weather, plus on investment returns, plus on the effective tax rate, minus on the energy efficiency impacts and minus in terms of the New Madrid smelter, that's kind of how it all shakes up compared to the prior year. But again, compared to expectations, I would say a little bit lower than our expectations coming into the quarter due to some tax items and weather. So how we shake all that up.

Before I provide my business update, I want to first welcome Sean Schukar to our executive leadership. On May 1, Sean took over as President of Ameren Transmission Company upon retirement of Maureen who had an incredible career at Ameren. Sean is a 30-year veteran in this industry and over the last several years, he has worked side-by-side with Maureen and the entire transmission team in developing and executing Ameren's transmission strategy. I'm confident that we will not skip a beat in executing our strategic plan for a transmission business under his leadership. Welcome Sean. No onto my business update. I want to begin by expressing my deep appreciation to our coworkers, our community's first responders, leaders and emergency personnel who have been tirelessly working together to help protect the citizens of Missouri and Illinois from the record floods that we've experienced this week.
Our thoughts and prayers go out to those that have lost loved ones, their homes or businesses during this very trying period of time.
From an operational perspective, our coworkers have continue to work safely and our system has held up well very despite these challenging conditions. However, this unprecedented weather is not over. And so we will continue to be focused on safety in all of our activities and we will continue to work closely with local and state authorities to deliver energy to our customers in a safe and reliable fashion.
Moving now to financial results. Earlier today we announced our first quarter 2017 earnings of $0.42 per share, compared to earnings of $0.43 per share in the first quarter of 2016. Highlighted on this page, our key drivers of these results, which  Marty, will discuss in a few minutes.  I'm also pleased to report that due to a constructive Missouri electric rate settlement and disciplined cost management, we remain on track to deliver within our 2017 earnings guidance range despite a very mild first quarter temperatures.
Turning now to Page 5. Here we reiterate our long-standing and effective strategic plan. We remain focused on executing the strategy and continue to strongly believe it will deliver superior long-term value to both our customers and shareholders. I'd like to highlight some of our year-to-date accomplishments and efforts towards this end. These include our continued strategic allocation of significant amounts of capital our businesses were investments supported by regulatory frameworks that provide fair, predictable and timely cost recovery and also deliver long-term benefits to our customers. This capital allocation is illustrated in the graphic on the right side of this page.
As you can see, we invested more than $300 million or 61% of first quarter capital expenditures in jurisdictions with the support of regulatory frameworks. This included about $135 million of capital for FERC-regulated transmission projects. A significant portion of this capital was invested in our $1.4 billion MISO approved Illinois River's project, a new high voltage transmission line that will span 385 miles across the State of Illinois. This project is about 78% complete with 4 of its 9 line segments including 2 river crossings and with 8 of 10 substations now in service and remaining 2 expected to be in service by the end of this month. The price remains on schedule for completion in 2019.
A second MISO approved project, the $150 million Spoon River transmission line in Northwestern Illinois, will span 44 miles and include 1 new substation. work on this transmission line began in January and the new substation was completed and placed in service in March. This project remains on schedule for completion in 2018.
Moving to our third MISO-approved project, the Mark Twain transmission line in Northeastern Missouri. There been several rated developments. In March, the Missouri Court of Appeals for the Western District gave the certificate of convenience and necessity for the project granted by the Missouri Public Service Commission in April 2016. The court ruled the Missouri PSC in granting a certificate that was conditioned upon ATXI obtaining transmission line rail crossing from the 5 respected counties. We're currently evaluating whether to appeal this ruling to the Missouri Supreme Court. Meanwhile, ATXI continues to pursue it suits filed last October for the sense for the original project route. The decision in these lawsuits is expected in late 2017. While we continue to pursue the construction of Mark Twain transmission line under our original plan, we've listened to feedback from key stakeholders and evaluated other approaches to address their concerns. We held further discussions with community members, landowners, county commissioners and local and state representatives and assessed alternative route options for the project.
I believe these discussions and additional assessments have proven to be fruitful because earlier this week, ATXI announced a proposed alternative route that would use existing transmission line corridors for nearly 90% of the project. This alternative route is not expected to change the estimate $250 million project cost. This route will significantly minimize the impact on landowners, communities and farmland. To accomplished this, ATXI is collaborating with Northeast Missouri Electric Power Cooperative and with the and proposed alternative route.
ATXI will finalize the alternative route after obtaining public input and then request for road crossings from the commissioners in the 5 affected counties. Upon receiving the county, ATXI would then seek Missouri PSC approval. We look forward to continuing to work with key stakeholders and the county commissioners to get this important project for Missouri and the entire Midwest region moving forward power.
The plan in service day for the Mark Twain Project is late 2019.
We're also continue to invest in Ameren Illinois local transmission projects to maintain and enhance reliability, including projects to meet reliability requirements, replace aging infrastructure and modernize the grid.  Our pipeline for these types of projects remains strong and will continue to deliver significant value to our customers and create jobs.
Moving on to other other segments. We also invested about $170 million in Illinois Electric and natural gas distribution infrastructure projects in the first quarter this year. This included investments made under the company's action plan, which was enabled by iem Illinois Energy Infrastructure Modernization Act of 2011. The act was extended through 2022 by the Future Energy Jobs Act. Today, Ameren Illinois electric grid monetization initiatives have resulted overall 17% improvement in reliability and saving customers an estimated $45 million each year. Ameren Illinois has installed 460,000 electric smart meters and 250,000 gas meter modules at customer premises. And this year, we plan to install 300,000 advanced electric meters and upgrade 140,000 gas meter modules as we work to deploy these to all of our 1.2 million electric and 800,000 gas customers in Illinois by the end of 2019. These smart meters and modules provide Ameren Illinois customers with enhanced usage data and access to programs to help them save on their energy bills.
Turning now to Page 6 for Missouri business update. I'm pleased to report that on March 8, the Missouri PSC approved a constructive agreement among all parties in Ameren Missouri's electric rate review. We appreciate the cooperative effort of all parties involved in the case and consider the unanimous agreement a positive, constructive step forward.
Marty will review the key provisions of this agreement in his remarks.
Moving now to a discussion of efforts to modernize the Missouri regulatory framework for electric utility service. As we speak today, Senate Bill 190, the Missouri Economic Development and Infrastructure Act, remains on the Missouri Senate's informal calendar and is available for further debate. This legislation will implement regulatory reforms to modernize existing energy policies that will drive significant investment and enable Ameren Missouri to execute it's $1 billion incremental infrastructure investment plan over the next 5 years.
These investments would result in significant long-term benefits to customers, including providing a more reliable and smarter energy group,facilitating the transition to a cleaner and more diverse generation portfolio, delivering greater tools of customers for managing the energy uses and positioning us to meet customers rising energy needs and expectations. And clearly, these investments will also create thousands of good quality jobs in the state of Missouri. In addition, this legislation has a robust economic developing provisions for large electricity users that will also drive meaningful job creation. Importantly, the legislation has strong consumer protections, including significant Missouri PSC oversight. Informed by extensive outreach, collaboration and input from key stakeholders, including the Missouri PSC and its Senate Interim Committee, this legislation has received unprecedented statewide support, including from major chambers of commerce, individual businesses, labor, suppliers, the agricultural community and major stakeholders. This unprecedented support helped drives strong bipartisan support of SP190 in the legislature.  While much progress have been made in designing forward thinking legislation, this legislation was filibustered by a small group of state senators during debate several years ago. Liability that strong majority of the senate was to see SB190 come to a vote over the last several weeks to spend time in other legislative matters, including the budget. Some of this legislative matters have stalled debate a number of bills including SB190. While we continue to work with key stakeholders to find a constructive path forward, time is short. As the current general assembly session ends next Friday May 12th. As a result, we believe it is unlikely that SB190 will advance during this legislative session. Of course, should SB190 not advance during this legislative session, we will be very disappointed. However, we will not be deterred from advocating for important energy and economic policies the best long-term interest of our customers in the entire state of Missouri. And I do expect that we would leverage the progress we made during this session and support another legislative initiative in the next session.
Turning now to Page 7. In February, we rolled forward our 5-year investment plan which  provides for rate based growth at a strong 6% compound annual rate over the 2016 to 2021 period. As you can see on the right side of this page, we plan to continue to allocate greater levels of capital to those with constructive regulatory frameworks that support investment. Clearly, execution of our 5-year investment plan is not contingent on the legislation in Missouri. Also on February, we confirmed our expectation for earnings per share growth 5% 8% compounded annually from 2016 to 2017 based on the adjusted 2016 guidance midpoint we outlined earlier this year.
We consider both our rate base and earnings growth rates to be attractive compared to those of our regulated utility peers. Further, Ameren shares continue to offer investors a solid dividend and our board has increased the dividend in each of the last 3 years. Of course, future dividend increases will be based on consideration of, among other things, earnings growth, cash flows and economic and other business conditions. To summarize, we believe our strong rate base and earnings growth profile combined with our solid dividend, currently providing a yield of approximately 3.2%, results in an attractive total return opportunity for our shareholders compared to our regulated utility peers.
As a matter of fact, while successfully executing our strategy, we have seen total shareholder return performance of 63% over the last 3 calendar years, beating that industry's performance by utility peers. We remain focused on executing our strategy and I'm fairly convinced that doing so will deliver superior values to our shareholders, customers and the communities we serve.
Again, thank all for joining us today. I will now turn the call over to Marty."

Turning now to Page 9 of our presentation. As Warner mentioned, we reported first quarter 2017 earnings of $0.42 per share compared with earnings of $0.43 per share for the year-ago quarter.On this page, we",1641,"Great. Thanks, Warner. Good morning, everyone. Turning now to Page 9 of our presentation. As Warner mentioned, we reported first quarter 2017 earnings of $0.42 per share compared with earnings of $0.43 per share for the year-ago quarter.
On this page, we highlighted by segment, the key factors that drove the overall $0.01 per share decrease. Starting with Ameren Transmission. The earnings per share contribution from this segment increased from $0.11 per share in the first quarter of 2016 to $0.14 per share in the first quarter of 2017. This growth was driven by increased transmission infrastructure investments at ATXI and Ameren Illinois, which both operate under constructive ratemaking. Next, the Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution segment saw its first quarter year-over-year contribution price from $0.04 to $0.12 per share. This reflected the favorable impact of the 2017 change in the timing of interim period revenue recognition resulting from the recently enacted Future Energy Jobs Act. This act modified the existing formulaic ratemaking by decoupling our distribution revenues from sales volumes. While this change will impact quarterly comparisons, it will not affect full year earnings. First quarter 2017 earnings at Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution also benefited from increased infrastructure investments as well as a higher allowed return on equity under formulaic ratemaking of 9.06% compared to 8.71% for the year-ago quarter. Turning to Ameren Missouri, first quarter year-over-year earnings declined from $0.06 to $0.02 per share. Approximately $0.03 of that decline was due to lower electric sales primarily driven by very mild winter temperatures. As a matter of fact, first quarter 2017 temperatures were the second warmest on record since 1970 based on Heating data in our service territory. The Ameren Missouri comparison was also unfavorably affected by higher depreciation expense which  reduced earnings by $0.02 per share. These unfavorable factors were partially offset by $0.01 per share of lower other operations and maintenance expenses not subject to riders or regulatory tracking mechanisms. This reduction is indicative of our ongoing continuous improvement programs and disciplined cost management. Finally, the Ameren parent and other net cost comparison was unfavorably impacted by the expected, lower first quarter tax benefits associated with share-based compensation was reduced to the earnings comparison by $0.07 per share.
Before moving on, let me briefly cover seasons for the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016. Weather-normalized kilowatt hour sales to Illinois and Missouri residential and commercial customers on a combined basis were flat, reflecting underlying 2017 growth demand growth offsetting by energy efficiency and the absence of the 2016 leap day sales benefits.
Kilowatt hour sales to the Illinois industrial customers in 2017 decreased about 3.5% primarily due to lower sales to a large low margin processor of agricultural products.
Finally, kilowatt hour sales to Missouri industrial customers were flat. Excluding lower sales to the New Madrid smelter, which shut down operations during the first quarter of 2016. I would note that while the level of sales to the smelter reduced earnings by approximately $0.02 per share compared to the level of established in the April 2015 rate order, the year-over-year decline in sales to the smelter did not have a material impact on the earnings per share comparison.
Moving to Page 10 of our presentation, I would now like to discuss 2017 earnings guidance. As Warner stated, we continue to expect 2017 diluted earnings to be in a range of $2.65 to $2.85 per share, despite very mild first quarter temperatures, which reduced earnings by $0.08 per share compared to normal.
The earnings effect of the mild first quarter temperatures is expected to be offset by the early resolution of the Missouri rate review, which I will touch on in a moment, as well as continued disciplined cost management. earnings consideration for the balance of the year are listed on the page. I will not comment on each of these considerations since they are largely self-explanatory and we discussed all with the change in timing of interim period revenue recognition at Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution on our February earnings call. This additional consideration is discussed in a bullet about 2/3 of the way down the speech. As I noted, this change had a favorable impact on first quarter 2017 results. Had this change and the timing of revenue recognition been effective in 2016, it would have increased Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution earnings by approximately $0.08 per share in the first quarter of 2016 by approximately $0.04 per share in the second quarter and by approximately $0.11 per share in the fourth quarter, while decreasing earnings by approximately $0.23 per share in the third quarter with no effect on full year earnings.
These estimated 2016 quarterly earnings changes could be a guide to the expected impact of this time and change on 2017 quarterly results.
Turning to Page 11. In the recently concluded Ameren Missouri electric rate review, on March 8, the Missouri PSC approved the stipulation and agreement that resolved this rate review. As many of you know, this agreement was a black box settlement and therefore the final order does not provide as much specificity as previous orders. To assist in your analysis, this page outlines key takeaways from the stipulation and agreement as compared to Ameren Missouri's most recent prior rate order issued by the Missouri PSC in April 2015.
Effective April 1st, base electric revenues were increased by $92 million annually, 80% of which we expect to realize this year and which  includes removal of the negative effect of lower sales to the New Madrid smelter. Concurrently, net-based energy cost decreased by $54 million annually, excluding cost reductions associated with reduced sales volumes. This updated table of net this energy costs will be the basis used for prospective changes to the fuel adjustment clause rider. In addition, net amortizations and the base level of expenses to regulatory tracking mechanisms were reduced by $26 million annually, which was largely driven by our $21 million reduction in the base level of pension and expenses. The agreement did not specify and allowed ROE, a rate base level, or a common equity ratio. However, the Missouri PSC determined that an implicit ROE in the range of 9.2% to 9.7% is reasonable. This represented the high and low end of the ranges the parties to the case stated were embedded in the agreement. We will use a 9.53% ROE, the level authorized in our April 2015 order, to calculate allowance for funds used during construction, as supported by the Missouri PSC staff in a commission open meeting. And in the absence of the stated ROE in the rate agreement, our goal continues to be earn as close to the April 2015 authorized ROE of 9.53% on Ameren Missouri capital structure as possible.
Finally, the improved agreement provided for continuation of key trackers and riders, including the fuel adjustment crossed.
Moving now to Page 12. I would like to update you on select regulatory matters pending at the Illinois Commerce Commission and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
Turning first to Illinois. Last month Ameren Illinois made its required annual electric distribution rate update filing. Under Illinois formula ratemaking our utility is required to file annual rate updates to systematically adjust cash flows over time for changes and cost of service and to true up any prior period over or underrecovery of such costs. Our filing seeks a $16 million decrease in the annual electric distribution revenue requirement. This net amount includes revenue increases reflecting 2016 recoverable costs expected 2017 infrastructure investments and recovery in 2018 of the 2016 revenue requirement reconciliation. These increases are more than offset by revenue decrease due to recovery by year-end 2017 of previously undercover costs associated with the 2015 revenue requirement reconciliation.
The ICC will review the matter in the months ahead with a decision expected in December of this year and new rates effective only next year. I remind you that each year's Illinois Electric Distribution earnings are a function of that year's ending rate base. The formula determined allowed ROE, which is the annual average of the 30-year U.S. Treasury bond yield for that year plus 580 basis points and the ICC-authorized capital structure with the equity component expected to remain 50% and are not directly determined by that year's rate update filing or the current rates charged to customers.
Finally, complaint case seeking to reduce the base allowed ROE for MISO transmission owners, including Ameren Illinois and ATXI is pending at the FERC. An administrative law judge issued an initial decision in June of last year recommending a 9.7% base ROE. In addition, our Ameren transmission business has been authorized by FERC to add up 50 basis points to MISO's base allowed ROE reflecting voluntary participation in MISO. A final order from the FERC is expected this year. Of course, the timing of this decision will depend in part on when new commissioners are confirmed and a quorum exists at the FERC. In addition, we expect the FERC commissioners may take time to consider the recent ruling of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit, vacating the FERC's order in a New England transmission ROE case, as such ruling may influence its order in the pending MISO case.
Turning to Page 13, I'll summarize. We remain on track to deliver within our 2017 earnings guidance range of $2.65 per share to $2.85 per share, as we continue to successfully execute our strategy. As Warner stated, as we look ahead, we continue to expect strong earnings per share growth driven by strong rate base growth in disciplined financial management and the Ameren shares continue to offer investors an attractive dividend. In total, we believe we have an attractive total shareholder return story compared to our regulated utility peers. That concludes our prepared remarks. We now invite your questions."

So again no direct impact. But, of course, the methodology did underlying the findings of the FERC in the ALG as I mentioned. And as we look ahead, we suspect that once the FERC has a quorum and we look to decide on the second complaint case, they want to take into consideration the court's findings in the first case as they think about how they will rule in the second. And it's hard to predict, but we suspect that it could end up factoring into the timing in terms of the FERC's decision in the second case."

But if you look at Slide 10 you look down the list, one of the other elements of the case is that the net base fuel cost, they are embedded in the rates were lowered. That becomes the base on which any prospective changes in net fuel and purchase power costs are measured. And then, lastly, we saw the lower amortizations or lower base for things that are amortizations that reflected and riders and trackers also reduced by about. So those are the primary impacts.

So when we gave that guidance, we certainly felt like the range of that we gave was appropriate given the multiple things that we were -- we had in front of us there. As we look ahead for the remainder of the year, when you think about the first quarter and if we look ahead, the first quarter we had about negative $0.08 of weather and that was offset, when you think about the first quarter, by this change in the timing of the revenue recognition in Illinois. But the Illinois item is simply a timing item whereas the weather is more permanent, if you will, unless we see some weather variation of the next 9 months. So as we look ahead, the guidance we obviously left that guidance unchanged and as we think about it, we expect that negative impact of the weather to be overcome in part by constructive outcome in the rate case in the timing of the rate increase, but also by the continued financial management and disciplined cost control."

I'll take a shot at it and I'll address both of them in terms of the bigger picture and, sort of, the deja vu comment as well, sort of filibuster. #1 it may feel like deja vu, but I will tell you from my perspective, we're consistently made progress in advancing the discussion on important energy infrastructure legislation that support investment. And I think what we have seen over the last 2 sessions has been not just meaningful progress in terms of stakeholder support, but also legislative support. And so, of course, if it doesn't advance the session, we're going to be disappointed. But from my perspective, what we've done in Missouri legislature working with our utilities across the state is make sure they understand the clear opportunities in terms of what's important to modernize the energy grid, but also opportunities that those investments create jobs. I think this is why you see such strong bipartisan support. This is why you saw senators committee with such a strong vote. Unfortunately, as you rightly point out, we've had some challenges in avoiding the filibuster. And so in terms of the filibuster, there are 2 ways to address the filibuster. One is that -- probably maybe 3. #1 you try to minimize the number of folks that are willing to filibuster and from our perspective, that number has meaningfully decreased from where it was in the past. Secondly, and which you hope to do is try and find a compromise with those folks. But if not, then you need to be given adequate time to try and drive negotiations or something across the finish line. That's not unusual in the Missouri legislature. Filibusters do occur on the bills and frankly ultimately sometimes they get passed, sometimes they don't. But the bottom line is a filibuster doesn't ultimately kill everything that goes on the Missouri legislature.  Last, but not least, there are rules that the senate has available to it. They could debate on the bill. But as we've said before, those rules are used pretty infrequently. But the ways to do address it, first and foremost, we try to do it in a constructive fashion and find good compromise that creates a win-win for everybody. So as we look forward then in the next legislative session, as I said on my comments, we're -- we may be disappointed if that the Senate Bill 190 does not advance The session. We are not going to be tettered because we think it's absolutely critical to continue to advocate for important energy and economic policies. They are in the best long-term interest for our customer and the entire state of Missouri. I think when you look at the work that we've been and the growing body of evidence across the country that these regulatory reforms, but truly making -- or truly trying being customer benefits and creating jobs, those kind of things will continue to put us in a very good position whereby constructive regulatory reform can ultimately pass the state of Missouri. That's my perspective."

Before I provide my business update, I want to first welcome Shawn Schukar to our executive leadership team. On May 1, Shawn took over as President of Ameren Transmission Company upon the retirement of Maureen Borkowski who had an incredible career at Ameren. Shawn is a 30-year veteran of this industry, and over the last several years, he has worked side-by-side with Maureen and the entire transmission team in developing and executing Ameren's transmission strategy. I'm confident that we will not skip a beat in executing our strategic plan for our transmission business under his leadership. Welcome Shawn. Now onto my business update. I want to begin by expressing my deep appreciation to our coworkers, our community's first responders, volunteers, leaders and emergency personnel who have been tirelessly working together to help protect the citizens of Missouri and Illinois from the record floods that we've experienced this week.
Our thoughts and prayers go out to those that have lost loved ones, their homes or businesses during this very trying period of time.
From an operational perspective, our coworkers have continued to work safely and our system has held up well despite these challenging conditions. However, this unprecedented weather is not over. And so we will continue to be focused on safety in all of our activities, and we will continue to work closely with local and state authorities to deliver energy to our customers in a safe and reliable fashion.
Moving now to our financial results. Earlier today, we announced first quarter 2017 earnings of $0.42 per share, compared to earnings of $0.43 per share in the first quarter of 2016. Highlighted on this page are key drivers of these results, which Marty will discuss in a few minutes.  I'm also pleased to report that due to a constructive Missouri electric rate settlement and disciplined cost management, we remain on track to deliver within our 2017 earnings guidance range despite very mild first quarter temperatures.
Turning now to Page 5. Here we reiterate our long-standing and effective strategic plan. We remain focused on executing the strategy and continue to strongly believe it will deliver superior long-term value to both our customers and shareholders. I'd like to highlight some of our year-to-date accomplishments and efforts towards this end. These include our continued strategic allocation of significant amounts of capital to our businesses where investments are supported by regulatory frameworks that provide fair, predictable and timely cost recovery and also deliver long-term benefits to our customers. This capital allocation is illustrated in the graphic on the right side of this page.
As you can see, we invested more than $300 million or 61% of first quarter capital expenditures in jurisdictions with the support of regulatory frameworks. This included about $135 million of capital for FERC-regulated transmission projects. A significant portion of this capital was invested in our $1.4 billion MISO-approved Illinois Rivers project, a new high voltage transmission line that will span 385 miles across the State of Illinois. This project is about 78% complete with 4 of its 9 line segments energized, including 2 river crossings and with 8 of 10 substations now in service and the remaining 2 expected to be in service by the end of this month. The project remains on schedule for completion in 2019.
A second MISO-approved project, the $150 million Spoon River transmission line in Northwestern Illinois, will span 44 miles and include 1 new substation. Foundation work on this transmission line began in January and the new substation was completed and placed in service in March. This project remains on schedule for completion in 2018.
Moving to our third MISO-approved project, the Mark Twain transmission line in Northeastern Missouri, there've been several recent developments. In March, the Missouri Court of Appeals for the Western District vacated the certificate of convenience and necessity for the project granted by the Missouri Public Service Commission in April 2016. The court ruled that the Missouri PSC erred in granting the certificate that was conditioned upon ATXI obtaining assents for  transmission line road crossings from the 5 affected counties. We're currently evaluating whether to appeal this ruling to the Missouri Supreme Court. Meanwhile, ATXI continues to pursue it suits filed last October seeking to obtain a sense for the original project route. A decision in these lawsuits is expected in late 2017. While we continue to pursue the construction of Mark Twain transmission line under our original plan, we've listened to feedback from key stakeholders and evaluated other approaches to address their concerns. We held further discussions with community members, landowners, county commissioners and local and state representatives and assessed alternative route options for the project.
I believe these discussions and additional assessments have proven to be fruitful because earlier this week, ATXI announced a proposed alternative route that would use existing transmission line corridors for nearly 90% of the project. This alternative route is not expected to change the estimated $250 million project cost. This route would significantly minimize the impact to landowners, communities and farmland. To accomplish this, ATXI is collaborating with Northeast Missouri Electric Power Cooperative and with the Ameren Missouri on the proposed alternative route.
ATXI will finalize the alternative route after obtaining public input and then request assents for road crossings from the commissioners in the 5 affected counties. Upon receiving the county assents, ATXI would then seek Missouri PSC approval. We look forward to continuing to work with key stakeholders and the county commissioners to get this important project for Missouri and the entire Midwest region moving forward.
The [indiscernible] service day for the Mark Twain Project is late 2019.
We're also continuing to invest in Ameren Illinois local electric transmission projects to maintain and enhance reliability, including projects to meet reliability requirements, replace aging infrastructure and modernize the grid. Our pipeline for these types of projects remain strong and will continue to deliver significant value to our customers and create jobs.
Moving on to our other segments. We also invested about $170 million in Illinois Electric and Natural Gas Distribution infrastructure projects in the first quarter of this year. These include investments made under the company's modernization action plan, which was enabled by Illinois Energy Infrastructure Modernization Act of 2011. The act was extended through 2022 by the Future Energy Jobs Act. Today, Ameren Illinois electric grid modernization initiatives have resulted in an overall 17% improvement in reliability and are saving customers an estimated $45 million each year. Ameren Illinois has installed 460,000 electric smart meters and 250,000 gas meter modules at customer premises. And this year, we plan to install 300,000 advanced electric meters and upgrade 140,000 gas meter modules as we work to deploy these to all of our 1.2 million electric and 800,000 gas customers in Illinois by the end of 2019. These smart meters and modules provide Ameren Illinois customers with enhanced energy usage data and access to programs that help them save on their energy bills.
Turning now to Page 6 for Missouri business update. I'm pleased to report that on March 8, the Missouri PSC approved a constructive agreement among all parties in Ameren Missouri's electric rate review. We appreciate the cooperative effort of all parties involved in the case and consider the unanimous agreement a positive, constructive step forward.
Marty will review the key provisions of this agreement in his remarks.
Moving now to a discussion of efforts to modernize the Missouri regulatory framework for electric utility service. As we speak today, Senate Bill 190, the Missouri Economic Development and Infrastructure Investment Act, remains on the Missouri Senate's informal calendar and is available for further debate. This legislation will implement regulatory reforms to modernize existing energy policies that would drive significant investment and enable Ameren Missouri to execute it's $1 billion incremental infrastructure investment plan over the next 5 years.
These investments would result in significant long-term benefits to customers, including providing a more reliable and smarter energy grid,facilitating the transition to a cleaner and more diverse generation portfolio, delivering greater tools to customers for managing their energy usage and positioning us to meet customers' rising energy needs and expectations. And clearly, these investments will also create thousands of good quality jobs in the State of Missouri. In addition, this legislation has robust economic development provisions for large electricity users that will also drive meaningful job creation. Importantly, the legislation has strong consumer protections, including significant Missouri PSC oversight. Informed by extensive outreach, collaboration and input from key stakeholders, including the Missouri PSC and its Senate Interim Committee, this legislation has received unprecedented statewide support, including from major chambers of commerce, individual businesses, labor, suppliers, the agricultural community and many other stakeholders. This unprecedented supporters help drive strong bipartisan support of SP190 in the legislature.  While much progress has been made in designing constructive forward-thinking legislation, this legislation was filibustered by a small group of state senators during debate several weeks ago. While I believe that a strong majority of the senate wish to see SB190 come to a vote over the last several weeks, the senate has spent time on other legislative matters, including the budget. Some of these legislative matters have stalled debate on a number of bills, including SB190. While we continue to work with key stakeholders to find a constructive path forward, time is short as the current general assembly session ends next Friday, May 12. As a result, we believe it is unlikely that SB190 will advance during this legislative session. Of course, should SB190 not advance during this legislative session, we will be very disappointed. However, we will not be deterred from advocating for important energy and economic policies that are in the best long-term interest of our customers in the entire State of Missouri. And I do expect that we would leverage the progress we made during this session and support another legislative initiative in the next session.
Turning now to Page 7. In February, we rolled forward our 5-year investment plan, which provides for rate-based growth at a strong 6% compound annual rate over the 2016 to 2021 period. As you can see on the right side of this page, we plan to continue to allocate greater levels of capital to those jurisdictions with constructive regulatory frameworks that support investment. Clearly, execution of our 5-year investment plan is not contingent on the passes of legislation in Missouri. Also in February, we've firmed our expectation for earnings per share growth of 5% to 8% compounded annually from 2016 to 2020 based on the adjusted 2016 guidance midpoint we outlined earlier this year.
We consider both our rate base and earnings growth rates to be attractive compared to those of our regulated utility peers. Further, Ameren shares continue to offer investors a solid dividend and our board has increased the dividend in each of the last 3 years. Of course, future dividend increases will be based on consideration of, among other things, earnings growth, cash flows and economic and other business conditions. To summarize, we believe our strong rate base and earnings growth profile, combined with our solid dividend, currently providing a yield of approximately 3.2%, results in an attractive total return opportunity for our shareholders compared to our regulated utility peers.
As a matter of fact, while successfully executing our strategy, we've seen total shareholder return performance of 63% over the last 3 calendar years, beating industries that measure the performance by utility peers. We remain focused on executing our strategy, and I'm firmly convinced that doing so will deliver superior values to our shareholders, customers and the communities we serve.
Again, thank you all for joining us today, and I'll now turn the call over to Marty."
373264,428576093,1190194,"Ameren Corporation, Q1 2017 Earnings Call, May 04, 2017",2017-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Ameren Corporation","Executives","Great. Thanks, Warner. Good morning, everyone.

As Warner mentioned, we reported first quarter 2017 earnings of $0.42 per share compared with earnings of $0.43 per share for the year-ago quarter.On this page, we",1651,"Great. Thanks, Warner. Good morning, everyone. Turning now to Page 9 of our presentation. As Warner mentioned, we reported first quarter 2017 earnings of $0.42 per share compared with earnings of $0.43 per share for the year-ago quarter.
On this page, we highlight by segment, the key factors that drove the overall $0.01 per share decrease. Starting with Ameren Transmission. The earnings per share contribution from this segment increased from $0.11 per share in the first quarter of 2016 to $0.14 per share in the first quarter of 2017. This growth was driven by increased transmission infrastructure investments at ATXI and Ameren Illinois, which both operate under constructive FERC formulaic ratemaking. Next, the Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution segment saw its first quarter year-over-year contribution rise from $0.04 to $0.12 per share. This reflected the favorable impact of the 2017 change in the timing of interim period revenue recognition resulting from the recently enacted Future Energy Jobs Act. This act modified the existing formulaic ratemaking by decoupling our distribution revenues from sales volumes. While this change will impact quarterly comparisons, it will not affect full year earnings. First quarter 2017 earnings at Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution also benefited from increased infrastructure investments as well as a higher allowed return on equity under formulaic ratemaking of 9.06% compared to 8.71% for the year-ago quarter. Turning to Ameren Missouri, first quarter year-over-year earnings declined from $0.06 to $0.02 per share. Approximately $0.03 of that decline was due to lower electric sales primarily driven by very mild winter temperatures. As a matter of fact, first quarter 2017 temperatures were the second warmest on record since 1970 based on heating degree data in our service territory. The Ameren Missouri comparison was also unfavorably affected by higher depreciation expense, which  reduced earnings by $0.02 per share. These unfavorable factors were partially offset by $0.01 per share of lower other operations and maintenance expenses not subject to riders or regulatory tracking mechanisms. This reduction is indicative of our ongoing continuous improvement programs and disciplined cost management. Finally, the Ameren parent and other net cost comparison was unfavorably impacted by the expected lower first quarter tax benefits associated with share-based compensation, which reduced the earnings comparison by $0.07 per share.
Before moving on, let me briefly cover sales trends for the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016. Weather-normalized kilowatt hour sales to Illinois and Missouri residential and commercial customers on a combined basis were flat, reflecting underlying 2017 growth offset by energy efficiency and the absence of the 2016 leap day sales benefits.
Kilowatt hour sales to the Illinois industrial customers in 2017 decreased about 3.5%, primarily due to lower sales to a large low-margin processor of agricultural products.
Finally, kilowatt hour sales to Missouri industrial customers were flat. Excluding lower sales to the New Madrid smelter, which shut down operations during the first quarter of 2016. I would note that while the level of sales to the smelter reduced earnings by approximately $0.02 per share compared to the level of established in the April 2015 rate order, the year-over-year decline in sales to the smelter did not have a material impact on the earnings per share comparison.
Moving to Page 10 of our presentation, I would now like to discuss 2017 earnings guidance. As Warner stated, we continue to expect 2017 diluted earnings to be in a range of $2.65 to $2.85 per share, despite very mild first quarter temperatures, which reduced earnings by $0.08 per share compared to normal.
The earnings effect of the mild first quarter temperatures is expected to be offset by the early resolution of the Missouri rate review, which I will touch on in a moment as well as continued disciplined cost management. So what earnings considerations for the balance of the year are listed on this page? I will not comment on each of these considerations since they are largely self-explanatory and we discussed all but the change in timing of interim period revenue recognition at Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution on our February earnings call. This additional consideration is discussed in a bullet about 2/3 of the way down this page. As I noted, this change had a favorable impact on first quarter 2017 results. Had this change and the timing of revenue recognition been effective in 2016, it would have increased Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution earnings by approximately $0.08 per share in the first quarter of 2016 by approximately $0.04 per share in the second quarter and by approximately $0.11 per share in the fourth quarter, while decreasing earnings by approximately $0.23 per share in the third quarter with no effect on full year earnings.
These estimated 2016 quarterly earnings changes can be a guide to the expected impact of this timing change on 2017 quarterly results.
Turning to Page 11. In the recently concluded Ameren Missouri electric rate review, on March 8, the Missouri PSC approved a stipulation and agreement that resolved this rate review. As many of you know, this agreement was a black box settlement and therefore the final order does not provide as much specificity as previous orders. To assist in your analysis, this page outlines key takeaways from the stipulation and agreement as compared to Ameren Missouri's most recent prior rate order issued by the Missouri PSC in April 2015.
Effective April 1, base electric revenues were increased by $92 million annually, 80% of which we expect to realize this year and which includes removal of the negative effect of lower sales to the New Madrid smelter. Concurrently, net base energy cost decreased by $54 million annually, excluding cost reductions associated with reduced sales volumes. This updated level of net base energy costs will be the basis used for prospective changes to the fuel adjustment clause rider. In addition, net amortizations and the base level of expenses for regulatory tracking mechanisms were reduced by $26 million annually, which was largely driven by a $21 million reduction in the base level of pension and OPEB expenses. The agreement did not specify and allow ROE, a rate base level, or a common equity ratio. However, the Missouri PSC determined that an implicit ROE in the range of 9.2% to 9.7% is reasonable. This represented the high and low ends of the ranges the parties to the case stated were embedded in the agreement. We will use a 9.53% ROE, the level authorized in our April 2015 order, to calculate allowance for funds used during construction, as supported by the Missouri PSC staff in a commission open meeting. And in the absence of the stated ROE in the rate agreement, our goal continues to be to earn as close to the April 2015 authorized ROE of 9.53% on Ameren Missouri's capital structure as possible.
Finally, the approved agreement provided for continuation of key trackers and riders, including the fuel adjustment clause.
Moving now to Page 12. I would like to update you on select regulatory matters pending at the Illinois Commerce Commission and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
Turning first to Illinois. Last month Ameren Illinois made its required annual electric distribution rate update filing. Under Illinois' formula ratemaking our utility is required to file annual rate updates to systematically adjust cash flows over time for changes and cost of service and to true up any prior period over or under recovery of such costs. Our filing seeks a $16 million decrease in the annual electric distribution revenue requirement. This net amount includes revenue increases reflecting 2016 recoverable costs, expected 2017 infrastructure investments and recovery in 2018 of the 2016 revenue requirement reconciliation. These increases are more than offset by a revenue decrease due to recovery by year-end 2017 of previously unrecovered costs associated with the 2015 revenue requirement reconciliation.
The ICC will review the matter in the months ahead with a decision expected in December of this year and new rates effective early next year. I remind you that each year's Illinois Electric Distribution earnings are a function of that year's ending rate base. The formula determined allowed ROE, which is the annual average of the 30-year U.S. Treasury bond yield for that year plus 580 basis points and the ICC-authorized capital structure with the equity component expected to remain 50% and are not directly determined by that year's rate update filing or the current rates charged to customers.
Finally, a second complaint case seeking to reduce the base allowed ROE for MISO transmission owners, including Ameren Illinois and ATXI is pending at the FERC. An administrative law judge issued an initial decision in June of last year recommending a 9.7% base ROE. In addition, our Ameren transmission business has been authorized by FERC to add up to 50 basis points to MISO's base allowed ROE reflecting voluntary participation in MISO. A final order from the FERC is expected this year. Of course, the timing of this decision will depend in part on when new commissioners are confirmed and a quorum exists at the FERC. In addition, we expect the FERC commissioners may take time to consider the recent ruling of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC circuit vacating the FERC's order in a New England transmission ROE case, as such ruling may influence its order in the pending MISO case.
Turning to Page 13, I will summarize. We remain on track to deliver within our 2017 earnings guidance range of $2.65 per share to $2.85 per share, as we continue to successfully execute our strategy. As Warner stated, as we look ahead, we continue to expect strong earnings per share growth driven by strong rate base growth and disciplined financial management and the Ameren shares continue to offer investors an attractive dividend. In total, we believe we have an attractive total shareholder return story compared to our regulated utility peers. That concludes our prepared remarks. We now invite your questions."

So again no direct impact. But, of course, that -- the methodology did underlie the findings of the FERC in the ALJ as I mentioned.

Obviously, the first element, which is the $92 million overall increase in rates, which was about 3.5% in terms of customer rate increases, is primarily -- the primary driver and I would say this year just because of the timing of our rate structure, which we have higher rates in the summer months, about 80% of that will be realized this year. But if you look at Slide 10, and you look down the list, one of the other elements of the case was that the net base fuel costs that are embedded in the rates were lowered. That becomes the base on which any prospective changes in net fuel and purchase power costs are measured. And then, lastly, we saw lower amortizations -- or lower base for things that are amortizations that reflected riders and trackers also reduced by about $26 million. So those are the primary impacts. We list those in the slides. It's the $92 million rate increase, it's $54 million of reduced net base energy costs and then the $26 million of lower net amortizations. And as you see on Slide 10, we list out some of those components."

Yes when we came out with our guidance for this year, certainly that we had reached a settlement amongst the parties and we believe that the guidance range that we provided accommodated that outcome. Andy, I think as you think about the guidance that we give at the beginning of the year and what we're seeing year-to-date, we've had about $0.08 of negative weather in the first quarter. And as you think, about when we provided you that guidance, which was midway through February certainly we had a sense, that weather was very mild and that there was some negative impacts. We also had a sense of this constructive settlement that have been reached. However, the commission had certainly not yet ruled on it and we really didn't know definitively when the rate increase would go into place. So when we gave that guidance, we certainly felt like the range that we gave was appropriate given the multiple things we were -- we had in front of us there. As we look ahead for the remainder of the year, when you think about the first quarter and as we look ahead, the first quarter we had about negative $0.08 of weather and that was offset, when you think about the first quarter, by this change in the timing of the revenue recognition in Illinois. But the Illinois item is simply a timing item whereas the weather is more permanent, if you will, unless we see some weather variation in the next 9 months. So as we look ahead at the guidance, we obviously left our guidance unchanged, and as we think about it, we expect that negative impact of the weather to be overcome in part by constructive outcome in the rate case and the timing of the rate increase, but also by continued financial management and disciplined cost control."

I'll take a shot at it and I'll address both of them in terms of the bigger picture, sort of the deja vu comment as well as sort of filibuster. Number one, it may feel like deja vu, but I will tell you from my perspective, we've consistently made progress in advancing the discussion on important energy infrastructure legislation that will support investment. And I think what we've seen over the last 2 sessions has been not just meaningful progress in terms of stakeholder support, but also legislative support. And so, of course, if it doesn't advance this session, we're going to be disappointed. But from my perspective, the -- what we've done in the Missouri legislature working with our utilities across the state is, make sure they understand the clear opportunities in terms of what's important to modernize the energy grid, but also those opportunities that those investments will create jobs. I think this is why you see such strong bipartisan support. This is why you saw what we've come out and seen a commerce committee with such a strong vote. Unfortunately, as you rightly point out, we've had some challenges in avoiding the filibuster. And so in terms of the filibuster, there are 2 ways to address the filibuster. One is that -- probably maybe 3. Number one, you try to minimize the number of folks that are willing to filibuster and from our perspective, that number has meaningfully decreased from where it was in the past. Secondly, and what you hope to do is try and find a compromise with those folks. But if not, then you need to be given adequate time to try and drive either negotiations or get something across the finish line. That's not unusual in the Missouri legislature. Filibusters do occur on other bills and frankly ultimately sometimes they get passed, sometimes they don't. But the bottom line is that filibuster doesn't ultimately kill everything that goes on in the Missouri legislature.  Last, but not least, there are rules that the senate has available to it. They could help debate on the bill. But as we've said before, those rules are used pretty infrequently. But there are ways to address it.  First and foremost, we try to do it in a constructive fashion and find good compromise that creates a win-win for everybody. So as we look forward then in to the next legislative session, as I said on my comments, we're -- we may be disappointed if Senate Bill 190 does not advance this session. We're not going to be deterred, because we think it's absolutely critical to continue to advocate for important energy and economic policies. They are in the best long-term interest for our customer in the entire State of Missouri. I think when you look at the work that we've done in the growing body of evidence across the country that these regulatory reforms are truly making -- are truly driving customer benefits and creating jobs, those kind of things will continue to put us in a very good position whereby constructive regulatory reform can ultimately be passed to the State of Missouri. That's my perspective."

Before I provide my business update, I want to first welcome Shawn Schukar to our executive leadership team. On May 1, Shawn took over as President of Ameren Transmission Company upon the retirement of Maureen Borkowski, who had an incredible career at Ameren. Shawn is a 30-year veteran of this industry, and over the last several years he has worked side-by-side with Maureen and the entire transmission team in developing and executing Ameren's transmission strategy. I'm confident that we will not skip a beat in executing our strategic plan for our transmission business under his leadership. Welcome, Shawn. 
Now onto my business update. I want to begin by expressing my deep appreciation to our coworkers, our community's first responders, volunteers, leaders and emergency personnel who have been tirelessly working together to help protect the citizens of Missouri and Illinois from the record floods that we've experienced this week.
Our thoughts and prayers go out to those that have lost loved ones, their homes or businesses during this very trying period of time.
From an operational perspective, our coworkers have continued to work safely and our system has held up well despite these challenging conditions. However, this unprecedented weather is not over. And so we will continue to be focused on safety in all of our activities, and we will continue to work closely with local and state authorities to deliver energy to our customers in a safe and reliable fashion.
Moving now to our financial results. Earlier today, we announced first quarter 2017 earnings of $0.42 per share, compared to earnings of $0.43 per share in the first quarter of 2016. Highlighted on this page are key drivers of these results, which Marty will discuss in a few minutes.  I'm also pleased to report that due to a constructive Missouri electric rate settlement and disciplined cost management, we remain on track to deliver within our 2017 earnings guidance range, despite very mild first quarter temperatures.
Turning now to Page 5. Here, we reiterate our long-standing and effective strategic plan. We remain focused on executing the strategy and continue to strongly believe it will deliver superior long-term value to both our customers and shareholders. I'd like to highlight some of our year-to-date accomplishments and efforts towards this end. These include our continued strategic allocation of significant amounts of capital to our businesses where investments are supported by regulatory frameworks that provide fair, predictable and timely cost recovery and also deliver long-term benefits to our customers. This capital allocation is illustrated in the graphic on the right side of this page.
As you can see, we invested more than $300 million or 61% of first quarter capital expenditures in jurisdictions with the support of regulatory frameworks. This included about $135 million of capital for FERC-regulated transmission projects. A significant portion of this capital was invested in our $1.4 billion MISO-approved Illinois Rivers project, a new high voltage transmission line that will span 385 miles across the State of Illinois. This project is about 78% complete, with 4 of its 9 line segments [ energized ], including 2 river crossings and with 8 of 10 substations now in service and the remaining 2 expected to be in service by the end of this month. The project remains on schedule for completion in 2019.
A second MISO-approved project, the $150 million Spoon River transmission line in Northwestern Illinois, will span 44 miles and include 1 new substation. Foundation work on this transmission line began in January and the new substation was completed and placed in service in March. This project remains on schedule for completion in 2018.
Moving to our third MISO-approved project, the Mark Twain transmission line in Northeastern Missouri, there've been several recent developments. In March, the Missouri Court of Appeals for the Western District vacated the certificate of convenience and necessity for the project granted by the Missouri Public Service Commission in April 2016. The court ruled that the Missouri PSC erred in granting the certificate that was conditioned upon ATXI obtaining [ assents ] for  transmission line road crossings from the 5 affected counties. We are currently evaluating whether to appeal this ruling to the Missouri Supreme Court. 
Meanwhile, ATXI continues to pursue it suits filed last October seeking to obtain assents for the original project route. A decision in these lawsuits is expected in late 2017. While we continue to pursue the construction of Mark Twain transmission line under our original plan, we've listened to feedback from key stakeholders and evaluated other approaches to address their concerns. We held further discussions with community members, landowners, county commissioners and local and state representatives and assessed alternative route options for the project.
I believe these discussions and additional assessments have proven to be fruitful because earlier this week, ATXI announced a proposed alternative route that would use existing transmission line corridors for nearly 90% of the project. This alternative route is not expected to change the estimated $250 million project cost. This route would significantly minimize the impact to landowners, communities and farmland. To accomplish this, ATXI is collaborating with Northeast Missouri Electric Power Cooperative and with the Ameren Missouri on the proposed alternative route.
ATXI will finalize the alternative route after obtaining public input and then request assents for road crossings from the commissioners in the 5 affected counties. Upon receiving the county assents, ATXI will then seek Missouri PSC approval. We look forward to continuing to work with key stakeholders and the county commissioners to get this important project for Missouri and the entire Midwest region moving forward.
The planned in-service day for the Mark Twain Project is late 2019.
We're also continuing to invest in Ameren Illinois' local electric transmission projects to maintain and enhance reliability, including projects to meet reliability requirements, replace aging infrastructure and modernize the grid. Our pipeline for these types of projects remain strong and will continue to deliver significant value to our customers and create jobs.
Moving on to our other segments. We also invested about $170 million in Illinois Electric and Natural Gas Distribution infrastructure projects in the first quarter of this year. These include investments made under the company's modernization action plan, which was enabled by Illinois Energy Infrastructure Modernization Act of 2011. The act was extended through 2022 by the Future Energy Jobs Act. Today, Ameren Illinois' electric grid modernization initiatives have resulted in an overall 17% improvement in reliability and are saving customers an estimated $45 million each year. Ameren Illinois has installed 460,000 electric smart meters and 250,000 gas meter modules at customer premises. And this year, we plan to install 300,000 advanced electric meters and upgrade 140,000 gas meter modules as we work to deploy these to all of our 1.2 million electric and 800,000 gas customers in Illinois by the end of 2019. These smart meters and modules provide Ameren Illinois customers with enhanced energy usage data and access to programs that help them save on their energy bills.
Turning now to Page 6 for Missouri business update. I am pleased to report that on March 8, the Missouri PSC approved a constructive agreement among all parties in Ameren Missouri's electric rate review. We appreciate the cooperative effort of all parties involved in the case and consider the unanimous agreement a positive, constructive step forward.
Marty will review the key provisions of this agreement in his remarks.
Moving now to a discussion of efforts to modernize the Missouri regulatory framework for electric utility service. As we speak today, Senate Bill 190, the Missouri Economic Development and Infrastructure Investment Act, remains on the Missouri Senate's informal calendar and is available for further debate. This legislation would implement regulatory reforms to modernize existing energy policies that would drive significant investment and enable Ameren Missouri to execute it's $1 billion incremental infrastructure investment plan over the next 5 years.
These investments would result in significant long-term benefits to customers, including providing a more reliable and smarter energy grid,facilitating the transition to a cleaner and more diverse generation portfolio, delivering greater tools to customers for managing their energy usage and positioning us to meet customers' rising energy needs and expectations. And clearly, these investments will also create thousands of good quality jobs in the State of Missouri. In addition, this legislation has robust economic development provisions for large electricity users that will also drive meaningful job creation. Importantly, the legislation has strong consumer protections, including significant Missouri PSC oversight. Informed by extensive outreach, collaboration and input from key stakeholders, including the Missouri PSC and a Senate Interim Committee, this legislation has received unprecedented statewide support, including from major chambers of commerce, individual businesses, labor, suppliers, the agricultural community and many other stakeholders. This unprecedented support has helped drive strong bipartisan support of SP190 in the legislature.  While much progress has been made in designing constructive forward-thinking legislation, this legislation was filibustered by a small group of state senators during debate several weeks ago. While I believe that a strong majority of the senate wish to see SB190 come to a vote over the last several weeks, the senate has spent time on other legislative matters, including the budget. Some of these legislative matters have stalled debate on a number of bills, including SB190. While we continue to work with key stakeholders to find a constructive path forward, time is short, as the current general assembly session ends next Friday, May 12. As a result, we believe it is unlikely that SB190 will advance during this legislative session. Of course, should SB190 not advance during this legislative session, we will be very disappointed. However, we will not be deterred from advocating for important energy and economic policies that are in the best long-term interest of our customers and the entire State of Missouri. And I do expect that we would leverage the progress we made during this session and support another legislative initiative in the next session.
Turning now to Page 7. In February, we rolled forward our 5-year investment plan, which provides for rate-based growth at a strong 6% compound annual rate over the 2016 to 2021 period. As you can see on the right side of this page, we plan to continue to allocate greater levels of capital to those jurisdictions with constructive regulatory frameworks that support investment. Clearly, execution of our 5-year investment plan is not contingent on the passes of legislation in Missouri. Also in February, we've firmed our expectation for earnings per share growth of 5% to 8% compounded annually from 2016 through 2020 based on the adjusted 2016 guidance midpoint we outlined earlier this year.
We consider both our rate base and earnings growth rates to be attractive compared to those of our regulated utility peers. Further, Ameren shares continue to offer investors a solid dividend and our board has increased the dividend in each of the last 3 years. Of course, future dividend increases will be based on consideration of, among other things, earnings growth, cash flows and economic and other business conditions. To summarize, we believe our strong rate base and earnings growth profile, combined with our solid dividend, currently providing a yield of approximately 3.2%, results in an attractive total return opportunity for our shareholders compared to our regulated utility peers.
As a matter of fact, by successfully executing our strategy, we've seen total shareholder return performance of 63% over the last 3 calendar years, beating indices that measure the performance by utility peers. We remain focused on executing our strategy, and I'm firmly convinced that doing so will deliver superior values to our shareholders, customers and the communities we serve.
Again, thank you all for joining us today, and I'll now turn the call over to Marty."
373264,428576093,1192507,"Ameren Corporation, Q1 2017 Earnings Call, May 04, 2017",2017-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Ameren Corporation","Executives","Great. Thanks, Warner. Good morning, everyone. Turning now to Page 9 of our presentation. As Warner mentioned, we reported first quarter 2017 earnings of $0.42 per share compared with earnings of $0.43 per share for the year-ago quarter.On this page, we",1650,"Great. Thanks, Warner. Good morning, everyone. Turning now to Page 9 of our presentation. As Warner mentioned, we reported first quarter 2017 earnings of $0.42 per share compared with earnings of $0.43 per share for the year-ago quarter.
On this page, we highlight, by segment, the key factors that drove the overall $0.01 per share decrease. Starting with Ameren Transmission. The earnings per share contribution from this segment increased from $0.11 per share in the first quarter of 2016 to $0.14 per share in the first quarter of 2017. This growth was driven by increased transmission infrastructure investments at ATXI and Ameren Illinois, which both operate under constructive FERC formulaic ratemaking. 
Next, the Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution segment saw its first quarter year-over-year contribution rise from $0.04 to $0.12 per share. This reflected the favorable impact of the 2017 change in the timing of interim period revenue recognition resulting from the recently enacted Future Energy Jobs Act. This act modified the existing formulaic ratemaking by decoupling our distribution revenues from sales volumes. While this change will impact quarterly comparisons, it will not affect full year earnings. First quarter 2017 earnings at Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution also benefited from increased infrastructure investments as well as a higher allowed return on equity under formulaic ratemaking of 9.06% compared to 8.71% for the year-ago quarter. Turning to Ameren Missouri, first quarter year-over-year earnings declined from $0.06 to $0.02 per share. Approximately $0.03 of that decline was due to lower electric sales, primarily driven by very mild winter temperatures. As a matter of fact, first quarter 2017 temperatures were the second warmest on record since 1970, based on heating degree data in our service territory. The Ameren Missouri comparison was also unfavorably affected by higher depreciation expense, which reduced earnings by $0.02 per share. These unfavorable factors were partially offset by $0.01 per share of lower other operations and maintenance expenses not subject to riders or regulatory tracking mechanisms. This reduction is indicative of our ongoing continuous improvement programs and disciplined cost management. Finally, the Ameren parent and other net cost comparison was unfavorably impacted by the expected lower first quarter tax benefits associated with share-based compensation, which reduced the earnings comparison by $0.07 per share.
Before moving on, let me briefly cover sales trends for the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016. Weather-normalized kilowatt hour sales to Illinois and Missouri residential and commercial customers on a combined basis were flat, reflecting underlying 2017 growth offset by energy efficiency and the absence of the 2016 leap day sales benefit.
Kilowatt hour sales to the Illinois industrial customers in 2017 decreased about 3.5%, primarily due to lower sales to a large low-margin processor of agricultural products.
Finally, kilowatt hour sales to Missouri industrial customers were flat. Excluding lower sales to the New Madrid smelter, which shut down operations during the first quarter of 2016. I would note that while the level of sales to the smelter reduced earnings by approximately $0.02 per share compared to the level of established in the April 2015 rate order, the year-over-year decline in sales to the smelter did not have a material impact on the earnings per share comparison.
Moving to Page 10 of our presentation, I would now like to discuss 2017 earnings guidance. As Warner stated, we continued to expect 2017 diluted earnings to be in a range of $2.65 to $2.85 per share, despite very mild first quarter temperatures, which reduced earnings by $0.08 per share compared to normal.
The earnings effect of the mild first quarter temperatures is expected to be offset by the early resolution of the Missouri rate review, which I will touch on in a moment as well as continued disciplined cost management. So what earnings considerations for the balance of the year are listed on this page? I will not comment on each of these considerations since they are largely self-explanatory and we discussed all but the change in timing of interim period revenue recognition at Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution on our February earnings call. This additional consideration is discussed in a bullet about 2/3 of the way down this page. As I noted, this change had a favorable impact on first quarter 2017 results. Had this change and the timing of revenue recognition been effective in 2016, it would have increased Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution earnings by approximately $0.08 per share in the first quarter of 2016 by approximately $0.04 per share in the second quarter and by approximately $0.11 per share in the fourth quarter, while decreasing earnings by approximately $0.23 per share in the third quarter with no effect on full year earnings.
These estimated 2016 quarterly earnings changes can be a guide to the expected impact of this timing change on 2017 quarterly results.
Turning to Page 11. In the recently concluded Ameren Missouri electric rate review, on March 8, the Missouri PSC approved a stipulation and agreement that resolved this rate review. As many of you know, this agreement was a black box settlement and, therefore, the final order does not provide as much specificity as previous orders. To assist in your analysis, this page outlines key takeaways from the stipulation and agreement as compared to Ameren Missouri's most recent prior rate order issued by the Missouri PSC in April 2015.
Effective April 1, base electric revenues were increased by $92 million annually, 80% of which we expect to realize this year and which includes removal of the negative effect of lower sales to the New Madrid smelter. Concurrently, net base energy costs decreased by $54 million annually, excluding cost reductions associated with reduced sales volumes. This updated level of net base energy costs will be the basis used for prospective changes to the fuel adjustment clause rider. In addition, net amortizations and the base level of expenses for regulatory tracking mechanisms were reduced by $26 million annually, which was largely driven by a $21 million reduction in the base level of pension and OPEB expenses. The agreement did not specify an allowed ROE, a rate base level, or a common equity ratio. However, the Missouri PSC determined that an implicit ROE in the range of 9.2% to 9.7% is reasonable. This represented the high and low ends of the ranges the parties to the case stated were embedded in the agreement. We will use a 9.53% ROE, the level authorized in our April 2015 order, to calculate allowance for funds used during construction, as supported by the Missouri PSC staff in a commission open meeting. And in the absence of the stated ROE in the rate agreement, our goal continues to be to earn as close to the April 2015 authorized ROE of 9.53% on Ameren Missouri's capital structure as possible.
Finally, the approved agreement provided for continuation of key trackers and riders, including the fuel adjustment clause.
Moving now to Page 12. I would like to update you on select regulatory matters pending at the Illinois Commerce Commission and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
Turning first to Illinois. Last month, Ameren Illinois made its required annual electric distribution rate update filing. Under Illinois' formula ratemaking, our utility is required to file annual rate updates to systematically adjust cash flows over time for changes in cost of service and to true up any prior period over or under recovery of such costs. Our filing seeks a $16 million decrease in the annual electric distribution revenue requirement. This net amount includes revenue increases reflecting 2016 recoverable costs, expected 2017 infrastructure investments and recovery in 2018 of the 2016 revenue requirement reconciliation. These increases are more than offset by a revenue decrease due to recovery by year-end 2017 of previously unrecovered costs associated with the 2015 revenue requirement reconciliation.
The ICC will review the matter in the months ahead with a decision expected in December of this year and new rates effective early next year. I remind you that each year's Illinois Electric Distribution earnings are a function of that year's ending rate base; the formula determined allowed ROE, which is the annual average of the 30-year U.S. Treasury bond yield for that year plus 580 basis points; and the ICC-authorized capital structure with the equity component expected to remain 50% and are not directly determined by that year's rate update filing or the current rates charged to customers.
Finally, a second complaint case seeking to reduce the base allowed ROE for MISO transmission owners, including Ameren Illinois and ATXI is pending at the FERC. An administrative law judge issued an initial decision in June of last year, recommending a 9.7% base ROE. In addition, our Ameren transmission business has been authorized by FERC to add up to 50 basis points to MISO's base allowed ROE reflecting voluntary participation in MISO. A final order from the FERC is expected this year. Of course, the timing of this decision will depend in part on when new commissioners are confirmed and a quorum exists at the FERC. In addition, we expect the FERC commissioners may take time to consider the recent ruling of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC circuit vacating the FERC's order in a New England transmission ROE case, as such ruling may influence its order in the pending MISO case.
Turning to Page 13, I will summarize. We remain on track to deliver within our 2017 earnings guidance range of $2.65 per share to $2.85 per share, as we continue to successfully execute our strategy. As Warner stated, as we look ahead, we continue to expect strong earnings per share growth driven by strong rate base growth and disciplined financial management, and Ameren shares continue to offer investors an attractive dividend.

So again, no direct impact. But, of course, that -- the methodology did underlie the findings of the FERC in the ALJ as I mentioned. So as we look ahead, we suspect that once the FERC has a quorum and they look to decide on the second complaint case, they'll want to take into consideration the court's findings in the first case as they think about how they'll rule on the second. And it's hard to predict, but we suspect that could end up factoring into the timing in terms of the FERC's decision in the second case."

Obviously, the first element, which is the $92 million overall increase in rates, which was about 3.5% in terms of customer rate increases, is primarily -- the primary driver and I would say this year, just because of the timing of our rate structure, which we have higher rates in the summer months, about 80% of that will be realized this year. But as you look at Slide 10 and you look down the list, one of the other elements of the case was that the net base fuel costs that are embedded in the rates were lowered. That becomes the base on which any prospective changes in net fuel and purchase power costs are measured. And then lastly, we saw lower amortizations -- or lower base for things that are amortizations that are reflected in riders and trackers also reduced by about $26 million. So those are the primary impacts. We list those in the slides.

Yes, when we came out with our guidance for this year, certainly that we had reached a settlement amongst the parties and we believe that the guidance range that we provided accommodated that outcome. Andy, I think as you think about the guidance that we give at the beginning of the year and what we're seeing year-to-date, we've had about $0.08 of negative weather in the first quarter. And as you think about when we provided you that guidance, which was midway through February, certainly we had a sense that weather was very mild and that there was some negative impacts. We also had a sense of this constructive settlement that had been reached. However, the commission had certainly not yet ruled on it and we really didn't know definitively when the rate increase would go into place. So when we gave that guidance, we certainly felt like the range that we gave was appropriate, given the multiple things we were -- we had in front of us there. As we look ahead for the remainder of the year, when you think about the first quarter and as you look ahead, the first quarter we had about negative $0.08 of weather and that was offset, when you think about the first quarter, by this change in the timing of the revenue recognition in Illinois. But the Illinois item is simply a timing item whereas the weather is more permanent, if you will, unless we see some weather variation in the next 9 months. So as we look ahead at the guidance, we obviously left our guidance unchanged, and as we think about it, we expect that negative impact of the weather to be overcome in part by constructive outcome in the rate case and the timing of the rate increase, but also by continued financial management and disciplined cost control."

I'll take a shot at it and I'll address both of them in terms of the bigger picture and sort of the deja vu comment as well as the sort of filibuster. Number one, it may feel like deja vu, but I will tell you from my perspective, we have consistently made progress in advancing the discussion on important energy infrastructure legislation that will support investment. And I think what we have seen over the last 2 sessions has been not just meaningful progress in terms of stakeholder support but also legislative support. And so, of course, if it doesn't advance this session, we are going to be disappointed. But from my perspective, the -- what we've done in the Missouri legislature, working with our utilities across the state, is make sure they understand the clear opportunities in terms of what's important to modernize the energy grid, but also those opportunities that those investments will create jobs. I think this is why you see such strong bipartisan support. This is why you saw the come out and seen a commerce committee with such a strong vote. Unfortunately, as you rightly point out, we've had some challenges in avoiding the filibuster. And so in terms of the filibuster, there are 2 ways to address a filibuster. One is that -- well, probably maybe 3. Number one, you can try to minimize the number of folks that are willing to filibuster, and from our perspective that number has meaningfully decreased from where it was in the past. Secondly, and what you hope to do is try and find a compromise with those folks. But if not, then you need to be given adequate floor time to try and drive either negotiations or get something across the finish line. That's not unusual in the Missouri legislature. Filibusters do occur on other bills and, frankly, ultimately sometimes they get passed, sometimes they don't. But the bottom line is that a filibuster doesn't ultimately kill everything that goes on in the Missouri legislature.  Last but not least, there are rules that the senate has available to it that could help debate on the bill. But as we've said before, those rules are used pretty infrequently. But there are ways to address it.  First and foremost, we try to do it in a constructive fashion and find good compromise that creates a win-win for everybody. So as we look forward then and to the next legislative session, as I said on my comments, we're -- while we may be disappointed if Senate Bill 190 does not advance this session, we're not going to be deterred, because we think it's absolutely critical to continue to advocate for important energy and economic policies that are in the best long-term interest for our customers and the entire State of Missouri. I think when you look at the work that we've done in the growing body of evidence across the country that these regulatory reforms are truly making -- are truly driving customer benefits and creating jobs, those kind of things will continue to put us in a very good position whereby constructive regulatory reform can ultimately be passed to the State of Missouri. That's my perspective."

Before I provide my business update, I want to first welcome Shawn Schukar to our executive leadership team. On May 1, Shawn took over as President of Ameren Transmission Company upon the retirement of Maureen Borkowski, who had an incredible career at Ameren. Shawn is a 30-year veteran of this industry, and over the last several years he has worked side-by-side with Maureen and the entire transmission team in developing and executing Ameren's transmission strategy. I'm confident that we will not skip a beat in executing our strategic plan for our transmission business under his leadership. Welcome, Shawn. 
Now onto my business update. I want to begin by expressing my deep appreciation to our coworkers, our community's first responders, volunteers, leaders and emergency personnel who have been tirelessly working together to help protect the citizens of Missouri and Illinois from the record floods that we've experienced this week.
Our thoughts and prayers go out to those that have lost loved ones, their homes or businesses during this very trying period of time.
From an operational perspective, our coworkers have continued to work safely and our system has held up well despite these challenging conditions. However, this unprecedented weather is not over. And so we will continue to be focused on safety in all of our activities, and we will continue to work closely with local and state authorities to deliver energy to our customers in a safe and reliable fashion.
Moving now to our financial results. Earlier today, we announced first quarter 2017 earnings of $0.42 per share, compared to earnings of $0.43 per share in the first quarter of 2016. Highlighted on this page are key drivers of these results, which Marty will discuss in a few minutes.  I'm also pleased to report that due to a constructive Missouri electric rate settlement and disciplined cost management, we remain on track to deliver within our 2017 earnings guidance range, despite very mild first quarter temperatures.
Turning now to Page 5. Here, we reiterate our long-standing and effective strategic plan. We remain focused on executing the strategy and continue to strongly believe it will deliver superior long-term value to both our customers and shareholders. I'd like to highlight some of our year-to-date accomplishments and efforts towards this end. These include our continued strategic allocation of significant amounts of capital to our businesses where investments are supported by regulatory frameworks that provide fair, predictable and timely cost recovery and also deliver long-term benefits to our customers. This capital allocation is illustrated in the graphic on the right side of this page.
As you can see, we invested more than $300 million or 61% of first quarter capital expenditures in jurisdictions with the support of regulatory frameworks. This included about $135 million of capital for FERC-regulated transmission projects. A significant portion of this capital was invested in our $1.4 billion MISO-approved Illinois Rivers project, a new high voltage transmission line that will span 385 miles across the State of Illinois. This project is about 78% complete, with 4 of its 9 line segments [ energized ], including 2 river crossings and with 8 of 10 substations now in service and the remaining 2 expected to be in service by the end of this month. The project remains on schedule for completion in 2019.
A second MISO-approved project, the $150 million Spoon River transmission line in Northwestern Illinois, will span 44 miles and include 1 new substation. Foundation work on this transmission line began in January and the new substation was completed and placed in service in March. This project remains on schedule for completion in 2018.
Moving to our third MISO-approved project, the Mark Twain transmission line in Northeastern Missouri, there've been several recent developments. In March, the Missouri Court of Appeals for the Western District vacated the certificate of convenience and necessity for the project granted by the Missouri Public Service Commission in April 2016. The court ruled that the Missouri PSC erred in granting the certificate that was conditioned upon ATXI obtaining [ assents ] for  transmission line road crossings from the 5 affected counties. We are currently evaluating whether to appeal this ruling to the Missouri Supreme Court. 
Meanwhile, ATXI continues to pursue it suits filed last October seeking to obtain assents for the original project route. A decision in these lawsuits is expected in late 2017. While we continue to pursue the construction of Mark Twain transmission line under our original plan, we've listened to feedback from key stakeholders and evaluated other approaches to address their concerns. We held further discussions with community members, landowners, county commissioners and local and state representatives and assessed alternative route options for the project.
I believe these discussions and additional assessments have proven to be fruitful because earlier this week, ATXI announced a proposed alternative route that would use existing transmission line corridors for nearly 90% of the project. This alternative route is not expected to change the estimated $250 million project cost. This route would significantly minimize the impact to landowners, communities and farmland. To accomplish this, ATXI is collaborating with Northeast Missouri Electric Power Cooperative and with the Ameren Missouri on the proposed alternative route.
ATXI will finalize the alternative route after obtaining public input and then request assents for road crossings from the commissioners in the 5 affected counties. Upon receiving the county assents, ATXI will then seek Missouri PSC approval. We look forward to continuing to work with key stakeholders and the county commissioners to get this important project for Missouri and the entire Midwest region moving forward.
The planned in-service day for the Mark Twain Project is late 2019.
We're also continuing to invest in Ameren Illinois' local electric transmission projects to maintain and enhance reliability, including projects to meet reliability requirements, replace aging infrastructure and modernize the grid. Our pipeline for these types of projects remain strong and will continue to deliver significant value to our customers and create jobs.
Moving on to our other segments. We also invested about $170 million in Illinois Electric and Natural Gas Distribution infrastructure projects in the first quarter of this year. These include investments made under the company's modernization action plan, which was enabled by Illinois Energy Infrastructure Modernization Act of 2011. The act was extended through 2022 by the Future Energy Jobs Act. Today, Ameren Illinois' electric grid modernization initiatives have resulted in an overall 17% improvement in reliability and are saving customers an estimated $45 million each year. Ameren Illinois has installed 460,000 electric smart meters and 250,000 gas meter modules at customer premises. And this year, we plan to install 300,000 advanced electric meters and upgrade 140,000 gas meter modules as we work to deploy these to all of our 1.2 million electric and 800,000 gas customers in Illinois by the end of 2019. These smart meters and modules provide Ameren Illinois customers with enhanced energy usage data and access to programs that help them save on their energy bills.
Turning now to Page 6 for Missouri business update. I am pleased to report that on March 8, the Missouri PSC approved a constructive agreement among all parties in Ameren Missouri's electric rate review. We appreciate the cooperative effort of all parties involved in the case and consider the unanimous agreement a positive, constructive step forward.
Marty will review the key provisions of this agreement in his remarks.
Moving now to a discussion of efforts to modernize the Missouri regulatory framework for electric utility service. As we speak today, Senate Bill 190, the Missouri Economic Development and Infrastructure Investment Act, remains on the Missouri Senate's informal calendar and is available for further debate. This legislation would implement regulatory reforms to modernize existing energy policies that would drive significant investment and enable Ameren Missouri to execute it's $1 billion incremental infrastructure investment plan over the next 5 years.
These investments would result in significant long-term benefits to customers, including providing a more reliable and smarter energy grid, facilitating the transition to a cleaner and more diverse generation portfolio, delivering greater tools to customers for managing their energy usage and positioning us to meet customers' rising energy needs and expectations. And clearly, these investments will also create thousands of good quality jobs in the State of Missouri. In addition, this legislation has robust economic development provisions for large electricity users that will also drive meaningful job creation. Importantly, the legislation has strong consumer protections, including significant Missouri PSC oversight. Informed by extensive outreach, collaboration and input from key stakeholders, including the Missouri PSC and a Senate Interim Committee, this legislation has received unprecedented statewide support, including from major chambers of commerce, individual businesses, labor, suppliers, the agricultural community and many other stakeholders. This unprecedented support has helped drive strong bipartisan support of SP190 in the legislature.  While much progress has been made in designing constructive forward-thinking legislation, this legislation was filibustered by a small group of state senators during debate several weeks ago. While I believe that a strong majority of the senate wish to see SB190 come to a vote over the last several weeks, the senate has spent time on other legislative matters, including the budget. Some of these legislative matters have stalled debate on a number of bills, including SB190. While we continue to work with key stakeholders to find a constructive path forward, time is short, as the current general assembly session ends next Friday, May 12. As a result, we believe it is unlikely that SB190 will advance during this legislative session. Of course, should SB190 not advance during this legislative session, we will be very disappointed. However, we will not be deterred from advocating for important energy and economic policies that are in the best long-term interest of our customers and the entire State of Missouri. And I do expect that we would leverage the progress we made during this session and support another legislative initiative in the next session.
Turning now to Page 7. In February, we rolled forward our 5-year investment plan, which provides for rate-based growth at a strong 6% compound annual rate over the 2016 to 2021 period. As you can see on the right side of this page, we plan to continue to allocate greater levels of capital to those jurisdictions with constructive regulatory frameworks that support investment. Clearly, execution of our 5-year investment plan is not contingent on the passes of legislation in Missouri. Also in February, we've firmed our expectation for earnings per share growth of 5% to 8% compounded annually from 2016 through 2020 based on the adjusted 2016 guidance midpoint we outlined earlier this year.
We consider both our rate base and earnings growth rates to be attractive compared to those of our regulated utility peers. Further, Ameren shares continue to offer investors a solid dividend and our board has increased the dividend in each of the last 3 years. Of course, future dividend increases will be based on consideration of, among other things, earnings growth, cash flows and economic and other business conditions. To summarize, we believe our strong rate base and earnings growth profile, combined with our solid dividend, currently providing a yield of approximately 3.2%, results in an attractive total return opportunity for our shareholders compared to our regulated utility peers.
As a matter of fact, by successfully executing our strategy, we've seen total shareholder return performance of 63% over the last 3 calendar years, beating indices that measure the performance by utility peers. We remain focused on executing our strategy, and I'm firmly convinced that doing so will deliver superior values to our shareholders, customers and the communities we serve.
Again, thank you all for joining us today, and I'll now turn the call over to Marty."

Turning now to Page 9 of our presentation. As Warner mentioned, we reported first quarter 2017 earnings of $0.42 per share compared with earnings of $0.43 per share for the year-ago quarter.On this page, we",1650,"Great. Thanks, Warner. Good morning, everyone. Turning now to Page 9 of our presentation. As Warner mentioned, we reported first quarter 2017 earnings of $0.42 per share compared with earnings of $0.43 per share for the year-ago quarter.
On this page, we highlight, by segment, the key factors that drove the overall $0.01 per share decrease. Starting with Ameren Transmission. The earnings per share contribution from this segment increased from $0.11 per share in the first quarter of 2016 to $0.14 per share in the first quarter of 2017. This growth was driven by increased transmission infrastructure investments at ATXI and Ameren Illinois, which both operate under constructive FERC formulaic ratemaking. 
Next, the Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution segment saw its first quarter year-over-year contribution rise from $0.04 to $0.12 per share. This reflected the favorable impact of the 2017 change in the timing of interim period revenue recognition resulting from the recently enacted Future Energy Jobs Act. This act modified the existing formulaic ratemaking by decoupling our distribution revenues from sales volumes. While this change will impact quarterly comparisons, it will not affect full year earnings. First quarter 2017 earnings at Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution also benefited from increased infrastructure investments as well as a higher allowed return on equity under formulaic ratemaking of 9.06% compared to 8.71% for the year-ago quarter. Turning to Ameren Missouri, first quarter year-over-year earnings declined from $0.06 to $0.02 per share. Approximately $0.03 of that decline was due to lower electric sales, primarily driven by very mild winter temperatures. As a matter of fact, first quarter 2017 temperatures were the second warmest on record since 1970, based on heating degree data in our service territory. The Ameren Missouri comparison was also unfavorably affected by higher depreciation expense, which reduced earnings by $0.02 per share. These unfavorable factors were partially offset by $0.01 per share of lower other operations and maintenance expenses not subject to riders or regulatory tracking mechanisms. This reduction is indicative of our ongoing continuous improvement programs and disciplined cost management. Finally, the Ameren parent and other net cost comparison was unfavorably impacted by the expected lower first quarter tax benefits associated with share-based compensation, which reduced the earnings comparison by $0.07 per share.
Before moving on, let me briefly cover sales trends for the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016. Weather-normalized kilowatt hour sales to Illinois and Missouri residential and commercial customers on a combined basis were flat, reflecting underlying 2017 growth offset by energy efficiency and the absence of the 2016 leap day sales benefit.
Kilowatt hour sales to the Illinois industrial customers in 2017 decreased about 3.5%, primarily due to lower sales to a large low-margin processor of agricultural products.
Finally, kilowatt hour sales to Missouri industrial customers were flat. Excluding lower sales to the New Madrid smelter, which shut down operations during the first quarter of 2016. I would note that while the level of sales to the smelter reduced earnings by approximately $0.02 per share compared to the level of established in the April 2015 rate order, the year-over-year decline in sales to the smelter did not have a material impact on the earnings per share comparison.
Moving to Page 10 of our presentation, I would now like to discuss 2017 earnings guidance. As Warner stated, we continued to expect 2017 diluted earnings to be in a range of $2.65 to $2.85 per share, despite very mild first quarter temperatures, which reduced earnings by $0.08 per share compared to normal.
The earnings effect of the mild first quarter temperatures is expected to be offset by the early resolution of the Missouri rate review, which I will touch on in a moment as well as continued disciplined cost management. So what earnings considerations for the balance of the year are listed on this page? I will not comment on each of these considerations since they are largely self-explanatory and we discussed all but the change in timing of interim period revenue recognition at Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution on our February earnings call. This additional consideration is discussed in a bullet about 2/3 of the way down this page. As I noted, this change had a favorable impact on first quarter 2017 results. Had this change and the timing of revenue recognition been effective in 2016, it would have increased Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution earnings by approximately $0.08 per share in the first quarter of 2016 by approximately $0.04 per share in the second quarter and by approximately $0.11 per share in the fourth quarter, while decreasing earnings by approximately $0.23 per share in the third quarter with no effect on full year earnings.
These estimated 2016 quarterly earnings changes can be a guide to the expected impact of this timing change on 2017 quarterly results.
Turning to Page 11. In the recently concluded Ameren Missouri electric rate review, on March 8, the Missouri PSC approved a stipulation and agreement that resolved this rate review. As many of you know, this agreement was a black box settlement and, therefore, the final order does not provide as much specificity as previous orders. To assist in your analysis, this page outlines key takeaways from the stipulation and agreement as compared to Ameren Missouri's most recent prior rate order issued by the Missouri PSC in April 2015.
Effective April 1, base electric revenues were increased by $92 million annually, 80% of which we expect to realize this year and which includes removal of the negative effect of lower sales to the New Madrid smelter. Concurrently, net base energy costs decreased by $54 million annually, excluding cost reductions associated with reduced sales volumes. This updated level of net base energy costs will be the basis used for prospective changes to the fuel adjustment clause rider. In addition, net amortizations and the base level of expenses for regulatory tracking mechanisms were reduced by $26 million annually, which was largely driven by a $21 million reduction in the base level of pension and OPEB expenses. The agreement did not specify an allowed ROE, a rate base level, or a common equity ratio. However, the Missouri PSC determined that an implicit ROE in the range of 9.2% to 9.7% is reasonable. This represented the high and low ends of the ranges the parties to the case stated were embedded in the agreement. We will use a 9.53% ROE, the level authorized in our April 2015 order, to calculate allowance for funds used during construction, as supported by the Missouri PSC staff in a commission open meeting. And in the absence of the stated ROE in the rate agreement, our goal continues to be to earn as close to the April 2015 authorized ROE of 9.53% on Ameren Missouri's capital structure as possible.
Finally, the approved agreement provided for continuation of key trackers and riders, including the fuel adjustment clause.
Moving now to Page 12. I would like to update you on select regulatory matters pending at the Illinois Commerce Commission and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
Turning first to Illinois. Last month, Ameren Illinois made its required annual electric distribution rate update filing. Under Illinois' formula ratemaking, our utility is required to file annual rate updates to systematically adjust cash flows over time for changes in cost of service and to true up any prior period over or under recovery of such costs. Our filing seeks a $16 million decrease in the annual electric distribution revenue requirement. This net amount includes revenue increases reflecting 2016 recoverable costs, expected 2017 infrastructure investments and recovery in 2018 of the 2016 revenue requirement reconciliation. These increases are more than offset by a revenue decrease due to recovery by year-end 2017 of previously unrecovered costs associated with the 2015 revenue requirement reconciliation.
The ICC will review the matter in the months ahead with a decision expected in December of this year and new rates effective early next year. I remind you that each year's Illinois Electric Distribution earnings are a function of that year's ending rate base; the formula determined allowed ROE, which is the annual average of the 30-year U.S. Treasury bond yield for that year plus 580 basis points; and the ICC-authorized capital structure with the equity component expected to remain 50% and are not directly determined by that year's rate update filing or the current rates charged to customers.
Finally, a second complaint case seeking to reduce the base allowed ROE for MISO transmission owners, including Ameren Illinois and ATXI is pending at the FERC. An administrative law judge issued an initial decision in June of last year, recommending a 9.7% base ROE. In addition, our Ameren transmission business has been authorized by FERC to add up to 50 basis points to MISO's base allowed ROE reflecting voluntary participation in MISO. A final order from the FERC is expected this year. Of course, the timing of this decision will depend in part on when new commissioners are confirmed and a quorum exists at the FERC. In addition, we expect the FERC commissioners may take time to consider the recent ruling of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC circuit vacating the FERC's order in a New England transmission ROE case, as such ruling may influence its order in the pending MISO case.
Turning to Page 13, I will summarize. We remain on track to deliver within our 2017 earnings guidance range of $2.65 per share to $2.85 per share, as we continue to successfully execute our strategy. As Warner stated, as we look ahead, we continue to expect strong earnings per share growth driven by strong rate base growth and disciplined financial management, and Ameren shares continue to offer investors an attractive dividend. In total, we believe we have an attractive total shareholder return story compared to our regulated utility peers. That concludes our prepared remarks. We now invite your questions."

So again, no direct impact. But, of course, that -- the methodology did underlie the findings of the FERC in the ALJ as I mentioned. So as we look ahead, we suspect that once the FERC has a quorum and they look to decide on the second complaint case, they'll want to take into consideration the court's findings in the first case as they think about how they'll rule on the second. And it's hard to predict, but we suspect that could end up factoring into the timing in terms of the FERC's decision in the second case."

But as you look at Slide 10 and you look down the list, one of the other elements of the case was that the net base fuel costs that are embedded in the rates were lowered. That becomes the base on which any prospective changes in net fuel and purchase power costs are measured.

Andy, I think as you think about the guidance that we give at the beginning of the year and what we're seeing year-to-date, we've had about $0.08 of negative weather in the first quarter. And as you think about when we provided you that guidance, which was midway through February, certainly we had a sense that weather was very mild and that there was some negative impacts. We also had a sense of this constructive settlement that had been reached. However, the commission had certainly not yet ruled on it and we really didn't know definitively when the rate increase would go into place. So when we gave that guidance, we certainly felt like the range that we gave was appropriate, given the multiple things we were -- we had in front of us there. As we look ahead for the remainder of the year, when you think about the first quarter and as you look ahead, the first quarter we had about negative $0.08 of weather and that was offset, when you think about the first quarter, by this change in the timing of the revenue recognition in Illinois. But the Illinois item is simply a timing item whereas the weather is more permanent, if you will, unless we see some weather variation in the next 9 months. So as we look ahead at the guidance, we obviously left our guidance unchanged, and as we think about it, we expect that negative impact of the weather to be overcome in part by constructive outcome in the rate case and the timing of the rate increase, but also by continued financial management and disciplined cost control."

I'll take a shot at it and I'll address both of them in terms of the bigger picture and sort of the deja vu comment as well as the sort of filibuster. Number one, it may feel like deja vu, but I will tell you from my perspective, we have consistently made progress in advancing the discussion on important energy infrastructure legislation that will support investment. And I think what we have seen over the last 2 sessions has been not just meaningful progress in terms of stakeholder support but also legislative support. And so, of course, if it doesn't advance this session, we are going to be disappointed. But from my perspective, the -- what we've done in the Missouri legislature, working with our utilities across the state, is make sure they understand the clear opportunities in terms of what's important to modernize the energy grid, but also those opportunities that those investments will create jobs. I think this is why you see such strong bipartisan support. This is why you saw the come out and seen a commerce committee with such a strong vote. Unfortunately, as you rightly point out, we've had some challenges in avoiding the filibuster. And so in terms of the filibuster, there are 2 ways to address a filibuster. One is that -- well, probably maybe 3. Number one, you can try to minimize the number of folks that are willing to filibuster, and from our perspective that number has meaningfully decreased from where it was in the past. Secondly, and what you hope to do is try and find a compromise with those folks. But if not, then you need to be given adequate floor time to try and drive either negotiations or get something across the finish line. That's not unusual in the Missouri legislature. Filibusters do occur on other bills and, frankly, ultimately sometimes they get passed, sometimes they don't. But the bottom line is that a filibuster doesn't ultimately kill everything that goes on in the Missouri legislature.  Last but not least, there are rules that the senate has available to it that could help debate on the bill. But as we've said before, those rules are used pretty infrequently. But there are ways to address it.  First and foremost, we try to do it in a constructive fashion and find good compromise that creates a win-win for everybody. So as we look forward then and to the next legislative session, as I said on my comments, we're -- while we may be disappointed if Senate Bill 190 does not advance this session, we're not going to be deterred, because we think it's absolutely critical to continue to advocate for important energy and economic policies that are in the best long-term interest for our customers and the entire State of Missouri. I think when you look at the work that we've done in the growing body of evidence across the country that these regulatory reforms are truly making -- are truly driving customer benefits and creating jobs, those kind of things will continue to put us in a very good position whereby constructive regulatory reform can ultimately be passed to the State of Missouri. That's my perspective."

Or at some point do you decide to kind of go the more traditional route and start ramping up the investment there?

Our coworkers have continued to work safely and our system has held up well despite these challenging conditions.
Again, my thanks to all of you.
Moving now to our financial results. Earlier today, we announced strong second quarter 2017 earnings of $0.79 per share compared to earnings of $0.61 per share in the second quarter of 2016. This growth of $0.18 per share was driven by the factors outlined on this page, which Marty will discuss in more detail in a moment. What's particularly satisfying to me is that our strong growth was driven by the solid execution of our strategy across our entire business. I'm also pleased to report that as a result of this execution, we expect to deliver 2017 core earnings within a range of $2.70 to $2.90 per share, a $0.05 improvement over our prior guidance. This updated guidance excludes an expected third quarter noncash estimated charge of $0.06 per share, primarily at the parent company.
This charge is the results of revaluation of deferred taxes due to an increase in the Illinois corporate income tax rate, effective July 1st of this year. Beyond this charge, we expect this tax increased to have no material impact on consolidated earnings perspectively. Marty will also address this matter in more detail in a moment.
Moving to Page 5. Here we reiterate our strategic plan. The year-over-year earnings growth I just mentioned reflects the significant investments we're making to better serve our customers as illustrated on the right side of this page.
We continue to strategically allocate capital to our transmission and distribution businesses where investments are supported by regulatory frameworks that provide fair, predictable and timely cost recovery. This, along with our continued disciplined cost management, supports our goal of earning close to our returns in all of our jurisdictions expected result in long-term earnings growth that is superior to our regulated peers. I would like to discuss some of our year-to-date accomplishments and efforts towards execution of our strategy.
As you can see on the right side of this page, during the first half of this year, we invested more than $640 million, or almost 2/3 of our capital expenditures, in jurisdictions with more constructive regulatory frameworks. This included about $290 million of capital for FERC-regulated transmission projects. Significant portion of this capital was invested in our $1.4 billion MISO-approved Illinois Rivers project, which is now about 90% complete, with line segments energized, including 2 of 3 River crossings and with all 10 substations in service. For the 5 remaining mine segments are in advanced stages of construction, with 2 of those line segments to be completed by the end of this year. And the project remains on schedule for completion in 2019. At our second MISO-approved project, the $150 million Spoon River transmission line in Northwestern Illinois, 85% of foundations are complete. Full installation is now underway and the project remains on schedule for completion in 2019.
Moving to our third MISO-approved project, the Mark Twain transmission line, in Northeastern Missouri there has been several recent developments. As we discussed on our first quarter call, ATXI has proposed an alternative route for the project  that would place more than 90% of the line on existing transmission line corridors. To accomplish this, ATXI has increased agreement in principle with Northeast Missouri Electric Power Cooperative in Missouri to locate the new line on the existing line supply. This alternative route significantly minimizes the impact to land owners, communities and existing farmlands, as been endorsed by various agricultural and economic development groups and is not expected to change the estimated $250 million project cost. In June, ATXI along with Northeast Missouri  Electric Power Cooperative and Ameren Missouri hosted a series of open-house meetings to obtain public input on the proposed alternative route finalize without options. Feedback so far has been positive. We're working to obtain needed County assents for both crossings. in all 5 Counties, ATXI will request a certificate of convenience and necessity for this route for Missouri PSC. We look forward to continuing to work with landowners and County Commissioners to get this important project for Missouri and the entire Midwest region moving forward.
The planned in-service day is late 2019.
We also continue to invest in Ameren Illinois local electrical transmission project  to maintain and enhance reliability, including projects to meet reliability requirements, replacing aging infrastructure and modernize the grid. Our pipeline for these types of projects remain strong and will continue to deliver significant value to our customers and create jobs.
Moving on to other businesses. We invested about $350 million in Illinois Electric and Natural Gas Distribution infrastructure projects during the first half of this year. These investments include natural gas distribution projects that upgrade our gas main infrastructure, and electric distribution projects that have smart grid technology and upgrade substations all to improve the safety and reliability of our system. Through the end of June, Ameren Illinois has installed 516,000 smart electric meters and 278,000 gas meter modules that provide customers with enhanced energy usage data and access to program to help them save on their energy bills.
Ameren Illinois expects to install another 185,000 smart electric meters and 76,000 gas meter modules in the second half of 2017, to deploy these 2 [indiscernible] issues and the rate review. Again, we appreciate the cooperative effort of all parties involved and consider the unanimous agreement a positive constructive step forward.
In addition to successfully executing our rate review, we continue to effectively manage our Missouri operations and earn solid returns. We're doing so by effectively managing our capital projects as well as by keeping a very sharp eye on our operating costs. We're also very focused on enhancing Missouri's regulatory framework. As you know, constructive ratemaking legislation was not passed by the Missouri General Assembly during this year's legislative sessions as a result of filibusters by a small group of state senators. While legislation did not get across the finish line, we did make progress on several fronts, progress we will build upon going forward.
That progress included constructive reports from the Senate Interim Committee and Missouri PSC that supported enhancing the Missouri regulatory framework. Those reports, coupled with growing evidence from around the country that indicates that modern energy policies that support investment in the energy grid are in the long-term best interest of customers and the economy, help grow the strong bipartisan support for legislation.
Looking ahead, we will leverage the meaningful progress we've made over the last several legislative sessions, continue to work collaboratively with key stakeholders and work towards charting a constructive path forward to enhance Missouri's regulatory framework. I also expect that we'll support another legislative initiative in 2018.
Turning to Page 7. As we look to the future, the successful execution on our robust 5-year plan is not only focused on delivering strong results through 2021, is also designed to positioned Ameren for success over the next decade and beyond. We strongly believe that the energy grid will be increasingly more important as we believe that Ameren and our industry will be critical enablers of advancing technologies will bring even greater value to our customers, the communities we serve and our shareholders. Further, we continue to believe it will be appropriate to transition fleet to a cleaner and more diverse portfolio in a responsible fashion.
With this long-term view in mind, we're already making investments that will position us for success. This includes significant investments in smart meters, digital technologies and another infrastructure that will result in a safer and more secure energy grid that will enable us to meet our customers' rising energy needs and expectations. And we're making prudent decisions to close down coal-fire generation resources at the end of their useful lives, including our Meramec Energy Center in 2022, as well as to invest in renewable energy to effectively transition our generation portfolio. Right now, Ameren Missouri is in the process of finalizing it's next 20-year Integrated Resource Plan, which is scheduled to be filed with the Missouri PSC in October of this year.
In this plan, we will continue to appropriately balance our responsibilities to our customers and communities and the environment and of course, our shareholders.
Consistent with this long-term view, by the end of 2021, we expect nearly 75% of our rate base will be invested in transmission and distribution assets, while just 13% of our rate base will consist of coal-fired generation. In addition to making investments with an eye toward the future, we're also actively participating in proceedings before the Illinois Commerce Commission and Missouri PSC that are, among other things, letting appropriate regulatory programs and frameworks to address changes taking place in our industry.
Bottom line is that we are taking steps today across the board to position Ameren for success in 2017, the next 5 years and the next decade and beyond and in also doing continue to deliver superior value for our customers and you, our shareholders.
Turning now to Page 8, to conclude my remarks. In February, we outlined our investment plan that included 6% compound annual rate base growth in 2016 through 2021, reflecting greater levels of capital allocated to those jurisdictions with constructive regulatory frameworks. As we stated previously, this plan is not contingent on passage of Missouri legislation. Also in February, we affirmed our expectation for earnings per share growth of 5% to 8% compounded annually in 2016 to 2020, based on the adjusted 2016 guidance midpoint we outlined earlier last year.
We consider both the rate base and earnings growth rates to be attractive compared to those of our regulated utility peers, and Ameren shares continue to offer investors a solid dividend, which our board has increase in each of the last few years.
Of course, future dividend increases will be based on consideration of, among other things, earnings growth, cash flows and economic and other business conditions. 
To summarize, we believe our strong rate base and earnings growth profile combined with our solid dividend currently providing a yield of approximately 3.1% results in an attractive total return opportunity for shareholders compared to our regulated utility peers. We remain focused on executing our strategy and I'm firmly convinced that doing so will deliver superior value to our shareholders, customers and the communities we serve. Again, thank you all for joining us today. I now turn the call over to Martie."
373264,529971942,1267720,"Ameren Corporation, Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2017",2017-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Ameren Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Warner and good morning, everyone.

On this page, we h",1501,"Thanks, Warner and good morning, everyone. Turning now to Page 10 of our presentation. As Warner mentioned, we reported second quarter 2017 earnings of $0.79 per share, compared with earnings of $0.61 per share for the year-ago quarter. On this page, we highlight by segment the key factors that drove the overall $0.18 per share increase. Starting with Ameren Missouri, second quarter year-over-year earnings increased $0.11 from $0.38 to $0.49 per share. This improvement reflected new electric service rates effective April 1st driven in part by increased infrastructure investments and removal of the negative effect of lower sales to the New Madrid smelter.
The earnings improvement also resulted from the absence of a scheduled Callaway Energy Center nuclear refueling and maintenance outage. The favorable factors were partially offset by lower electric retail sales primarily driven by milder early summer temperatures. Next, Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution's second quarter year-over-year earnings rose from $0.08 to $0.14 per share. This largely reflected the favorable impact of the 2017 change in the timing of interim period revenue recognition resulting from Future Energy Jobs Act. This act modified the existing formulated ratemaking by decoupling our distribution revenues from sales volumes. While this change will impact quarterly comparisons, it will not affect full year earnings. Second quarter 2017 earnings at Ameren Illinois electric distribution also benefited from increased infrastructure investments as well as a higher allowed return on equity under formulaic ratemaking of 8.8% compared to 8.45% for the year-ago quarter.
Turning to Ameren Transmission. Second quarter year-over-year earnings rose from $0.13 to $0.14 per share. This was due to increased transmission infrastructure investments at ATXI and Ameren Illinois, which both operate under constructive FERC formulaic ratemaking, partially offset by a lower average allowed return on equity, which was 10.82% in 2017 compared to an average of 11.4% in the year-ago quarter.
In 2016, our transmission segment benefited from a temporarily higher FERC-allowed ROE as a result of the expiration in May of 2016 of the 15-month refund period for the second MISO ROE complaint case. 
Before moving on, let me briefly cover sales trends for the first half of 2017 compared to the first half of 2016. Weather-normalized sales to Illinois  and Missouri residential and commercial customers on a combined basis were flat, excluding the effects of our Missouri Energy Efficiency Program under MIA. We exclude MIA effects because the program provides rate recovery to ensure that earnings are not affected by reduced electric sales resulting from our energy efficiency efforts. The sales results reflect underlying 2017 growth, offset by the absence of the 2016 leap day sales benefits.
Kilowatt hour sales to Missouri industrial customers increased about 0.5%, excluding MIA effects and sales to the New Madrid smelter, which shut down operations during the first quarter of 2016. Kilowatt hour sales to Illinois industrial customers in 2017 decreased 3%, primarily due to lower sales to a low to a large low margin processor of agricultural products. Recall the changes in electric sales in Illinois, no matter the cause, do not impact our earnings since the Future Energy Jobs Act provided full revenue decoupling beginning this year.
Moving to Page 11 of our presentation. I would now like to discuss our 2017 earnings guidance. Today, we reaffirmed our GAAP guidance at $2.65 to $2.85 per share, which now includes an expected third quarter noncash tax related charge of $0.06 per share, which I will discuss in more detail in a moment. Excluding this charge, we expect to deliver 2017 core earnings within a range of $2.70 to $2.90 per share, a $0.05 per share improvement over our prior guidance range, reflecting solid execution of our strategy, including continued disciplined cost management. This updated guidance assumes normal temperatures for the second half of this year. While July temperatures were much warmer than normal, we don't expect that this impact was significant enough to offset the very mild temperatures experience during the first half of the year, which reduced earnings by approximately $0.07 per share.
Listed on this page are select earnings considerations that will affect the comparability of second half 2017 core earnings to last year's second half results. Some of the larger impacts included change in the timing of interim period revenue recognition at Ameren Illinois' electric distribution business and assumed return to normal temperatures, the fourth quarter Callaway refueling and maintenance outage, the absence of 2016 Ameren Missouri energy efficiency performance incentives, the 2017 Ameren Missouri electric rate review settlement, and increased transmission and electric distribution infrastructure investments at ATXI and Ameren Illinois.
I want to particularly call your attention to the change in timing of interim period revenue recognition in Ameren Illinois, because it is expected to decrease earnings by approximately $0.23 per share in the third quarter of 2017 and increase earnings by approximately $0.11 per share in the fourth quarter of 2017. 
Finally, I would like to discuss the impact on Ameren of the recently enacted increase in Illinoi's corporate income tax rate. Early last month, the Illinois General Assembly approved a budget related legislation that effectively increased the corporate income tax rate to 9.5% from 7.75% as of July first of this year. The tax increase is expected to result in a third quarter 2017 non-core, noncash charge of an estimated $0.06 per share, primarily at the parent company, due to revaluation of deferred taxes. Beyond this charge, we do not expect the tax increase to have a material impact on our consolidated earnings prospectively. The cash is not expected to materially impact earnings of Ameren Illinois' electric distribution or Ameren Illinois' and ATXI's transmission businesses since they operate under a formulaic ratemaking. The tax increase is expected to reduce Ameren Illinois' gas distribution business earnings, but only by approximately $1 million annually until customers rates are reset in the next rate review.
And we plan to file for a gas distribution rate review in Illinois in early 2018 with new customers rates to be effective in early 2019.
Turning now to Page 12 for an update on 2017 long-term debt financings. On June 15, Ameren Missouri issued $400 million of 2.95% senior secured notes due 2027, the proceeds of which were used in connection with repayment at maturity of $425 million of 6.4% senior secured notes. Also, ATXI agreed to privately place $450 million of 3.43% senior unsecured notes due 2050. $150 million of such notes were issued on June 22nd, with the remaining $300 million to be issued on August 31. The proceeds of the ATXI private placement will be used to repay Ameren parent for a portion of ATXI's existing intercompany debt. This is the first time ATXI has issued external debt and we're pleased with this successful low-cost issuance, including the strong investment-grade credit rating to notes received.
Finally, we expect Ameren Illinois to issue long-term debt later this year to repay at maturity $250 million of 6.125% senior secured notes and short-term debt.
Moving now to Page 13 for discussion of select regulatory matters pending at the Illinois  Conference Commission and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. In July, Ameren Illinois updated its required annual electric distribution rate update filing, requesting a $17 million decrease in the annual electric distribution revenue requirement. This is consistent with the ICC staff's filed testimony and other parties did not file revenue requirement testimony. An ICC decision is expected in December of this year with new rates effective early next year. 
Turning to the FERC, 1 complaint case remains that seeks to reduce the base allowed ROE for MISO transmission owners, including Ameren Illinois and ATXI. These businesses are currently earning a 10.82% ROE, including a 50 basis point adder for MISO membership, and will continue to do so pending any change required by the FERC as a result of this case. Our updated guidance assumes this ROE continues through the end of the year. While the U.S. Senate's approval yesterday of 2 new commissioners establishes a quorum at the FERC, it remains uncertain when the commission will rule on the pending complaint case. In addition to facing a significant backlog of other cases, we expect that the FERC commissioners will take time to consider the recent ruling of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit that vacated the FERC's order in a New England transmission ROE case, as this court ruling may influence the FERC's order in the pending MISO ROE complaint case.
Turning to Page 14, I will summarize. We expect to deliver 2017 core earnings within a range of $2.70 to $2.90 per share as we continue to successfully execute our strategy. As Warner stated, as we look ahead, we continue to expect strong earnings per share growth driven by strong rate base growth and disciplined financial management. And Ameren shares continue to offer investors an attractive dividend. In total, we believe we have an attractive total shareholder return story compared to our regulated utility peers.
That concludes our prepared remarks. We now invite your questions."

Can you talk a little bit about whether you see that as a significant opportunity either via owning wind plants and rate base, or in the need for incremental transmission in Missouri to be able to connect to the west where there's lots of wind resource? And can you talk about what you need from a regulatory standpoint, either ratemaking or approval-wise, to actually make that happen, if that's one of the decisions you make going forward?"

Couple of comments. #1, we're in the process. We look at transmission but we also look at generation. And we've been consistent in saying that we're going to transition our generation portfolio to a more diverse cleaner portfolio, but we will do it in a responsible fashion. A little bit later this year, we're going to update our integrated resource plan. And that will highlight some of those opportunities we may have in the renewable energy space just with regard to our own generation. And as we know, we have renewable energy standard in the State of Missouri. And as a result of that, as renewable energy costs for new generation comes time, that's something do want to look carefully at. Of course, to make renewable energy work, you need to make sure, that you have a transmission system that's robust enough to support all of that. And at the end of the day, we have certainly made more investments in the transmission space in Illinois and in MISO we've done some. We have Mark Twain project that we're going to hopefully continue to move forward with and get across the finish line. As you continue to see greater levels of renewable generation in MISO, in the broader footprint, we do see that there could be some other opportunities for incrementally transmission that could be done. Whether  it's done on a multivalue project basis, which would have to go through MISO or potentially, of course, something that we would do under the state regulatory framework in Missouri. And so I wouldn't say that we certainly rule that out. We see that as an opportunity. So I'm looking at Shawn Schukar. Shawn in terms of how you look at the space especially in MISO and other things. We do see incremental transmission opportunities not just to support generation, but even just to deal with and to liability projects and those types of things."

It's always one of working with key stakeholders educating on their needs. It's always one of ensuring they understand the real value to modernizing the energy grid. Now if you look at first we been able to do in Illinois, that's really the formula that we worked over there. It's making sure understood the value and once you understand the value, you deliver on those projects and it's clear what we have seen in Illinois, and what we've seen frankly, across the country is that modern energy policies that support investment in a modernized grid apparently brings real value to customers, it keeps rates still affordable, but it creates thousands of jobs. That's been a formula that works across the country. And we can say it's about clearly in Illinois. So that same message is resonating in the state of Missouri. That's why we have such strong bipartisan support. That's why the collaborative effort that we've been working on continue to gather even more stakeholders to support it. So really is the just are doing on the ground to work on with the collaborating with key stakeholders.

We could own wind generation. Both of those are viable options. And in terms of that, that question, I mean there is a couple of ways that it could happen. Prospectively, one, as you mentioned to the extent that the all-in costs of those renewables was below the dispatch cost of our existing generation. Of course, one of the reasons why maybe the penetration hasn't been as great here is maybe other places is that in the dispatch costs of our existing generation is pretty low. And that's real benefit for our customers. However, the cost of renewables continues to come down and we watch those economics very closely. As Warner mentioned in his answer to Michael earlier, as part of the Integrated Resource Plan, we also looked at compliance with Missouri Renewable Energy Standard. That standard actually requires us to purchase or generate 15% of our native sales from renewables by 2021 subject to a 1% annual limit on rates. And a really that's been a limited historically, in terms of introducing even more renewables into the portfolio in our 2014 IRP we had about 130 megawatts of wind coming in by 2021. So as Warner mentioned in his talking points, we're working on an update to that Integrated Resource Plan. And in answer to your question, we are both looking at the economics of renewables as compared to the dispatch cost of our existing generation. But also looking at in terms of compliance with that renewable energy standard within the limits of that 1% impact on rates. So those are the 2 ways that really, as we look ahead, there is the opportunity to bring even further renewables into our portfolio."

Before I begin my business update, I first want to express my deep appreciation to our customers who experienced outages over the last several weeks due to some severe storms. I am grateful for your patience and the support of our coworkers who are working hard to restore your service in very hot and humid weather conditions. 
Of course, I also want to express my appreciation to our coworkers who have been tirelessly working through these difficult conditions for our Missouri and Illinois customers. Our coworkers have continued to work safely and our system has held up well despite these challenging conditions.  
Again, my thanks to all of you.
Moving now to our financial results. Earlier today, we announced strong second quarter 2017 earnings of $0.79 per share compared to earnings of $0.61 per share in the second quarter of 2016. This growth of $0.18 per share was driven by the factors outlined on this page, which Marty will discuss in more detail in a moment. 
What is particularly satisfying to me is that our strong growth was driven by the solid execution of our strategy across our entire business. I'm also pleased to report that as a result of this execution, we expect to deliver 2017 core earnings within a range of $2.70 to $2.90 per share, a $0.05 improvement over our prior guidance. 
This updated guidance excludes an expected third quarter noncash estimated charge of $0.06 per share, primarily at the parent company. This charge is the results of revaluation of deferred taxes due to an increase in the Illinois corporate income tax rate effective July 1st of this year. Beyond this charge, we expect this tax increase to have no material impact on consolidated earnings prospectively. Marty will also address this matter in more detail in a moment.
Moving to Page 5. Here, we reiterate our strategic plan. The year-over-year earnings growth I just mentioned reflects the significant investments we are making to better serve our customers, as illustrated on the right side of this page.
We continue to strategically allocate capital to our transmission and distribution businesses, where investments are supported by regulatory frameworks that provide fair, predictable and timely cost recovery. This, along with our continued disciplined cost management that supports our goal of earning close to our allowed returns in all of our jurisdictions, is expected to result in long-term earnings growth that is superior to our regulated peers. 
I would like to discuss some of our year-to-date accomplishments and efforts towards execution of our strategy. As you can see on the right side of this page, during the first half of this year, we invested more than $640 million, or almost 2/3 of our capital expenditures, in jurisdictions with more constructive regulatory frameworks. This included about $290 million of capital for FERC-regulated transmission projects. 
A significant portion of this capital was invested in our $1.4 billion MISO-approved Illinois Rivers project, which is now about 90% complete, with 4 of its 9 line segments energized, including 2 of 3 river crossings, and with all 10 substations in service. 4 of the 5 remaining line segments are in the advanced stages of construction, with 2 of those line segments to be completed by the end of this year. And the project remains on schedule for completion in 2019. 
At our second MISO-approved project, the $150 million Spoon River transmission line in Northwestern Illinois, 85% of pole foundations are complete. Pole installation is now underway and the project remains on schedule for completion in 2019.
Moving to our third MISO-approved project, the Mark Twain transmission line in Northeastern Missouri, there have been several recent developments. As we discussed on our first quarter call, ATXI has proposed an alternative route for the project that would place more than 90% of the line on existing transmission line corridors. 
To accomplish this, ATXI has reached agreements in principle with Northeast Missouri Electric Power Cooperative and Ameren Missouri to locate the new line on the existing rights of way. This alternative route significantly minimizes the impact to land owners, communities and existing farmland and has been endorsed by various agricultural and economic development groups and is not expected to change the estimated $250 million project cost. 
In June, ATXI, along with Northeast Missouri Electric Power Cooperative and Ameren Missouri, hosted a series of open-house meetings to obtain public input on the proposed alternative route to help finalize route options. Feedback so far has been positive, and we are working to obtain needed County assents for road crossings. Upon receiving all 5 County assents, ATXI will request a certificate of convenience and necessity for this route from the Missouri PSC. We look forward to continuing to work with landowners and the County Commissioners to get this important project for Missouri and the entire Midwest region moving forward. The planned in-service date is late 2019.
We also continue to invest in Ameren Illinois local electrical transmission projects to maintain and enhance reliability, including projects to meet reliability requirements, replacing aging infrastructure and modernize the grid. Our pipeline for these types of projects remain strong and will continue to deliver significant value to our customers and create jobs.
Moving on to other businesses. We invested about $350 million in Illinois Electric and Natural Gas Distribution infrastructure projects during the first half of this year. These investments include natural gas distribution projects that upgrade our gas main infrastructure and electric distribution projects that add smart grid technology and upgrade substations, all to improve the safety and reliability of our system. 
Through the end of June, Ameren Illinois has installed 516,000 smart electric meters and 278,000 gas meter modules that provide customers with enhanced energy usage data and access to program to help them save on their energy bills.
Ameren Illinois expects to install another 185,000 smart electric meters and 76,000 gas meter modules in the second half of 2017 as it works to deploy these to all of its 1.2 million electric and 800,000 gas customers by the end of 2019. 
Turning now to Page 6 for our Missouri business update. As we discussed on our first quarter earnings call, new electric rates went into effect on April 1 of this year as a result of a unanimous agreement resolving all the issues in the rate review. Again, we appreciate the cooperative effort of all parties involved and consider unanimous agreement a positive, constructive step forward.
In addition to successfully executing our rate review, we continue to effectively manage our Missouri operations and earn solid returns. We are doing so by effectively managing our capital projects as well as by keeping a very sharp eye on our operating costs. We're also very focused on enhancing Missouri's regulatory framework. As you know, constructive ratemaking and legislation was not passed by the Missouri General Assembly during this year's legislative sessions as a result of filibusters by a small group of state senators. While legislation did not get across the finish line, we did make progress on several fronts, progress we will build upon going forward.
That progress included constructive reports from the Senate Interim Committee and Missouri PSC that supported enhancing the Missouri regulatory framework. Those reports, coupled with growing evidence from around the country that indicates that modern energy policies that support investment in the energy grid are in the long-term best interest of customers and the economy, help grow the strong bipartisan support for legislation.
Looking ahead, we will leverage the meaningful progress we have made over the last several legislative sessions, continue to work collaboratively with key stakeholders and work towards charting a constructive path forward to enhance Missouri's regulatory framework. I also expect that we will support another legislative initiative in 2018.
Turning to Page 7. As we look to the future, the successful execution of our robust 5-year plan is not only focused on delivering strong results through 2021, it is also designed to positioned Ameren for success over the next decade and beyond. We strongly believe that the energy grid will be increasingly more important as we believe that Ameren and our industry will be critical enablers of advancing technologies that will bring even greater value to our customers, the communities we serve and our shareholders. Further, we continue to believe it will be appropriate to transition our generation fleet to a cleaner, more diverse portfolio in a responsible fashion.
With this long-term view in mind, we are already making investments that will position us for success. These include significant investments in smart meters, digital technologies and another infrastructure that will result in a safer and more secure energy grid that will enable us to meet our customers' rising energy needs and expectations. 
And we are making prudent decisions to close down coal-fired generation resources at the end of their useful lives, including our Meramec Energy Center in 2022, as well as to invest in renewable energy to effectively transition our generation portfolio. 
Right now, Ameren Missouri is in the process of finalizing it's next 20-year Integrated Resource Plan, which is scheduled to be filed with the Missouri PSC in October of this year. In this plan, we will continue to appropriately balance our responsibilities to our customers and communities, the environment and, of course, our shareholders.
Consistent with this long-term view, by the end of 2021, we expect that nearly 75% of our rate base will be invested in transmission and distribution assets, while just 13% of our rate base will consist of coal-fired generation. In addition to making investments with an eye toward the future, we are also actively participating in proceedings before the Illinois Commerce Commission and Missouri PSC that are, among other things, vetting appropriate regulatory programs and frameworks to address changes taking place in our industry.
The bottom line is that we are taking steps today across the board to position Ameren for success in 2017, the next 5 years and the next decade and beyond, and in so doing, continue to deliver superior value to our customers and you, our shareholders.
Turning now to Page 8 to conclude my remarks. In February, we outlined our investment plan that included 6% compound annual rate base growth in 2016 through 2021, reflecting greater levels of capital allocated to those jurisdictions with constructive regulatory frameworks. As we stated previously, this plan is not contingent on passage of Missouri legislation. Also in February, we affirmed our expectation for earnings per share growth of 5% to 8% compounded annually from 2016 to 2020, based on the adjusted 2016 guidance midpoint we outlined early last year.
We consider both our rate base and earnings growth rates to be attractive compared to those of our regulated utility peers, and Ameren shares continue to offer investors a solid dividend, which our board has increased in each of the last few years. Of course, future dividend increases will be based on consideration of, among other things, earnings growth, cash flows and economic and other business conditions. 
To summarize, we believe our strong rate base and earnings growth profile, combined with our solid dividend currently providing a yield of approximately 3.1%, results in an attractive total return opportunity for shareholders compared to our regulated utility peers. We remain focused on executing our strategy and I am firmly convinced that doing so will deliver superior value to our shareholders, customers and the communities we serve. 
Again, thank you all for joining us today. I'll now turn the call over to Marty."
373264,529971942,1268366,"Ameren Corporation, Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2017",2017-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Ameren Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Warner, and good morning, everyone. Turning now to Page 10 of our presentation. As Warner mentioned, we reported second quarter 2017 earnings of $0.79 per share compared with earnings of $0.61 per share for the year-ago quarter. On this page, we h",1506,"Thanks, Warner, and good morning, everyone. Turning now to Page 10 of our presentation. As Warner mentioned, we reported second quarter 2017 earnings of $0.79 per share compared with earnings of $0.61 per share for the year-ago quarter. On this page, we highlight by segment the key factors that drove the overall $0.18 per share increase. 
Starting with Ameren Missouri. Second quarter year-over-year earnings increased $0.11, from $0.38 to $0.49 per share. This improvement reflected new electric service rates effective April 1st, driven in part by increased infrastructure investments and removal of the negative effect of lower sales to the New Madrid smelter. The earnings improvement also resulted from the absence of a scheduled Callaway Energy Center nuclear refueling and maintenance outage. The favorable factors were partially offset by lower electric retail sales, primarily driven by milder early summer temperatures. 
Next, Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution's second quarter year-over-year earnings rose from $0.08 to $0.14 per share. This largely reflected the favorable impact of the 2017 change in the timing of interim period revenue recognition resulting from the Future Energy Jobs Act. This act modified the existing formulaic ratemaking by decoupling our distribution revenues from sales volumes. While this change will impact quarterly comparisons, it will not affect full year earnings. 
Second quarter 2017 earnings at Ameren Illinois electric distribution also benefited from increased infrastructure investments as well as a higher allowed return on equity under formulaic ratemaking of 8.8% compared to 8.45% for the year-ago quarter.
Turning to Ameren Transmission. Second quarter year-over-year earnings rose from $0.13 to $0.14 per share. This was due to increased transmission infrastructure investments at ATXI and Ameren Illinois, which both operate under constructive FERC formulaic ratemaking, partially offset by a lower average allowed return on equity, which was 10.82% in 2017 compared to an average of 11.4% in the year-ago quarter.
In 2016, our transmission segment benefited from a temporarily higher FERC-allowed ROE as a result of the expiration in May of 2016 of the 15-month refund period for the second MISO ROE complaint case. 
Before moving on, let me briefly cover sales trends for the first half of 2017 compared to the first half of 2016. Weather-normalized kilowatt hour sales to Illinois and Missouri residential and commercial customers on a combined basis were flat, excluding the effects of our Missouri Energy Efficiency Program under MIA. We exclude MIA effects because the program provides rate recovery to ensure that earnings are not affected by reduced electric sales resulting from our energy efficiency efforts. The sales results reflect underlying 2017 growth, offset by the absence of the 2016 leap day sales benefits.
Kilowatt hour sales to Missouri industrial customers increased about 0.5%, excluding MIA effects and sales to the New Madrid smelter, which shut down operations during the first quarter of 2016. Kilowatt hour sales to Illinois industrial customers in 2017 decreased 3%, primarily due to lower sales to a low -- to a large, low-margin processor of agricultural products. Recall the changes in electric sales in Illinois, no matter the cause, do not impact our earnings since the Future Energy Job Act provided full revenue decoupling beginning this year.
Moving to Page 11 of our presentation. I would now like to discuss our 2017 earnings guidance. Today, we reaffirmed our GAAP guidance at $2.65 to $2.85 per share, which now includes an expected third quarter noncash tax-related charge of $0.06 per share, which I will discuss in more detail in a moment. Excluding this charge, we expect to deliver 2017 core earnings within a range of $2.70 to $2.90 per share, a $0.05 per share improvement over our prior guidance range, reflecting solid execution of our strategy, including continued disciplined cost management. 
This updated guidance assumes normal temperatures for the second half of this year. While July temperatures were much warmer than normal, we don't expect that this impact was significant enough to offset the very mild temperatures experienced during the first half of the year, which reduced earnings by approximately $0.07 per share.
Listed on this page are select earnings considerations that will affect the comparability of second half 2017 core earnings to last year's second half results. Some of the larger impacts include a change in the timing of interim period revenue recognition at Ameren Illinois' electric distribution business and assumed return to normal temperatures, the fourth quarter Callaway refueling and maintenance outage, the absence of 2016 Ameren Missouri energy efficiency performance incentives, the 2017 Ameren Missouri electric rate review settlement and increased transmission and electric distribution infrastructure investments at ATXI and Ameren Illinois.
I want to particularly call your attention to the change in timing of interim period revenue recognition in Ameren Illinois because it is expected to decrease earnings by approximately $0.23 per share in the third quarter of 2017 and increase earnings by approximately $0.11 per share in the fourth quarter of 2017. 
Finally, I would like to discuss the impact on Ameren of the recently enacted increase in Illinois' corporate income tax rate. Early last month, the Illinois General Assembly approved a budget-related legislation that effectively increased the corporate income tax rate to 9.5% from 7.75% as of July 1st of this year. The tax increase is expected to result in a third quarter 2017 non-core, noncash charge of an estimated $0.06 per share, primarily at the parent company, due to revaluation of deferred taxes. Beyond this charge, we do not expect the tax increase to have a material impact on our consolidated earnings prospectively. 
The tax increase is not expected to materially impact earnings of Ameren Illinois' electric distribution or Ameren Illinois' and ATXI's transmission businesses since they operate under formulaic ratemaking. 
The tax increase is expected to reduce Ameren Illinois' gas distribution business earnings, but only by approximately $1 million annually until customer rates are reset in the next rate review. And we plan to file for a gas distribution rate review in Illinois in early 2018 with new customer rates to be effective in early 2019.
Turning now to Page 12 for an update on 2017 long-term debt financings. On June 15, Ameren Missouri issued $400 million of 2.95% senior secured notes due 2027, the proceeds of which were used in connection with the repayment at maturity of $425 million of 6.4% senior secured notes. 
Also, ATXI agreed to privately place $450 million of 3.43% senior unsecured notes due 2050. $150 million of such notes were issued on June 22nd, with the remaining $300 million to be issued on August 31. The proceeds of the ATXI private placement will be used to repay Ameren parent for a portion of ATXI's existing intercompany debt. This is the first time ATXI has issued external debt, and we are pleased with this successful low-cost issuance, including the strong investment-grade credit rating to notes received.
Finally, we expect Ameren Illinois to issue long-term debt later this year to repay, at maturity, $250 million of 6.125% senior secured notes and short-term debt.
Moving now to Page 13 for a discussion of select regulatory matters pending at the Illinois Commerce Commission and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. In July, Ameren Illinois updated its required annual electric distribution rate update filing, requesting a $17 million decrease in the annual electric distribution revenue requirement. This is consistent with the ICC staff's filed testimony, and other parties did not file revenue requirement testimony. An ICC decision is expected in December of this year, with new rates effective early next year. 
Turning to the FERC, 1 complaint case remains that seeks to reduce the base allowed ROE for MISO transmission owners, including Ameren Illinois and ATXI. These businesses are currently earning a 10.82% ROE, including a 50 basis point adder for MISO membership, and will continue to do so pending any change required by the FERC as a result of this case. Our updated guidance assumes this ROE continues through the end of the year. 
While the U.S. Senate's approval yesterday of 2 new commissioners reestablishes a quorum at the FERC, it remains uncertain when the commission will rule on the pending complaint case. In addition to facing a significant backlog of other cases, we expect that the FERC commissioners will take time to consider the recent ruling of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit that vacated the FERC's order in a New England transmission ROE case, as this court ruling may influence the FERC's order in the pending MISO ROE complaint case.
Turning to Page 14, I will summarize. We expect to deliver 2017 core earnings within a range of $2.70 to $2.90 per share as we continue to successfully execute our strategy. As Warner stated, as we look ahead, we continue to expect strong earnings per share growth driven by strong rate base growth and disciplined financial management. And Ameren shares continue to offer investors an attractive dividend. In total, we believe we have an attractive total shareholder return story compared to our regulated utility peers.
That concludes our prepared remarks. We now invite your questions."

Can you talk a little bit about whether you see that as a significant opportunity either via owning wind plants and rate base, or in the need for incremental transmission in Missouri to be able to connect to the west, where there's lots of great wind resource? And can you talk about what do you need from a regulatory standpoint, either ratemaking or approval-wise, to actually make that happen, if that's one of the decisions you make going forward."

Number one, we're in the process. We look at transmission, but we also look at generation. And we've been consistent in saying that we're going to transition our generation portfolio to a more diverse, cleaner portfolio, but we're doing it in a responsible fashion. A little bit later this year, we are going to update our integrated resource plan. And that will highlight some of those opportunities we may have in the renewable energy space just with regard to our own generation. And as we know, we have a renewable energy standard in the State of Missouri. And as a result of that, as renewable energy costs for new generation comes down, that's something we're going to look carefully at. Of course, to make renewable energy work, you need to make sure that you have a transmission system that's robust enough to support all of that. And at the end of the day, we have certainly made more investments in the transmission space in Illinois. And then in MISO, we've done some. We have Mark Twain project that we're going to hopefully continue to move forward with and get across the finish line. So as you continue to see greater levels of renewable generation in MISO, in the broader footprint, we do see that there could be some other opportunities for incremental transmission that could be done. Whether it's done on a multi-value project basis, which would have to go through MISO, or potentially, of course, something that we would do under the state regulatory framework in Missouri. And so I wouldn't say that we certainly rule that out. We see that as an opportunity. So I'm looking at Shawn Schukar. And Shawn, in terms of how you look at this space, especially in MISO and other things. We do see incremental transmission opportunities not just to support generation, but even just to deal with and to support new reliability projects and those types of things."

It's always one of working with key stakeholders to educate them on the needs. And it's always one of ensuring they understand the real value to modernizing the energy grid. Now if you look at what we've been able to do in Illinois, that's really the formula that we've worked over there, is making sure everyone understood the value. And then once you have them understand the value, you deliver on those projects. And it's clear what we've seen in Illinois and what we've seen, frankly, across the country, is that modern energy policies that support investment in a modernized grid not only brings real value to customers, it keeps rates still affordable, but it creates thousands of jobs. That's been a formula that's worked across the country, and we can see it's about clearly in Illinois. So that same message is resonating in the state of Missouri. It's why we have such strong bipartisan support. That's why the collaborative effort that we've been working on continue to gather even more stakeholders to support it.

We could own wind generation. Both of those are viable options. And in terms of that question, I mean, there's a couple of ways that it could happen prospectively. One, as you mentioned, is to the extent that the all-in cost of those renewables was below the dispatch cost of our existing generation. Of course, one of the reasons why maybe the penetration hasn't been as great here as maybe other places is that the dispatch costs of our existing generation is pretty low and it's a real benefit for our customers. However, the cost of renewables continues to come down and we watch those economics very closely. As Warner mentioned in his answer to Michael earlier, as part of the Integrated Resource Plan, we also look at compliance with the Missouri Renewable Energy Standard. That standard actually requires us to purchase or generate 15% of our native sales from renewables by 2021, subject though to a 1% annual limit on rates. And really, that's been a limiter historically in terms of introducing even more renewables into the portfolio. In our 2014 IRP we had about 130 megawatts of wind coming in by 2021. So as Warner mentioned in his talking points, we're working on an update to that Integrated Resource Plan. And in answer to your question, we're both looking at the economics of renewables as compared to the dispatch cost of our existing generation, but also looking at in terms of compliance with that renewable energy standard within the limits of that 1% impact on rates. So those are the 2 ways that really, as we look ahead, there's the opportunity to bring even further renewables into our portfolio."

Before I begin my business update, I first want to express my deep appreciation to our customers who experienced outages over the last several weeks due to some severe storms. I am grateful for your patience and the support of our coworkers who are working hard to restore your service in very hot and humid weather conditions. 
Of course, I also wanted to express my appreciation to our coworkers who have been tirelessly working through these difficult conditions for our Missouri and Illinois customers. Our coworkers have continued to work safely and our system has held up well despite these challenging conditions.  
Again, my thanks to all of you.
Moving now to our financial results. Earlier today, we announced strong second quarter 2017 earnings of $0.79 per share compared to earnings of $0.61 per share in the second quarter of 2016. This growth of $0.18 per share was driven by the factors outlined on this page, which Marty will discuss in more detail in a moment. 
What is particularly satisfying to me is that our strong growth was driven by the solid execution of our strategy across our entire business. I'm also pleased to report that as a result of this execution, we expect to deliver 2017 core earnings within a range of $2.70 to $2.90 per share, a $0.05 improvement over our prior guidance. 
This updated guidance excludes an expected third quarter noncash estimated charge of $0.06 per share, primarily at the parent company. This charge is the results of revaluation of deferred taxes due to an increase in the Illinois corporate income tax rate effective July 1st of this year. Beyond this charge, we expect this tax increase to have no material impact on consolidated earnings prospectively. Marty will also address this matter in more detail in a moment.
Moving to Page 5. Here, we reiterate our strategic plan. The year-over-year earnings growth I just mentioned reflects the significant investments we are making to better serve our customers, as illustrated on the right side of this page.
We continue to strategically allocate capital to our transmission and distribution businesses, where investments are supported by regulatory frameworks that provide fair, predictable and timely cost recovery. This, along with our continued disciplined cost management that supports our goal of earning close to our allowed returns in all of our jurisdictions, is expected to result in long-term earnings growth that is superior to our regulated peers. 
I would like to discuss some of our year-to-date accomplishments and efforts towards execution of our strategy. As you can see on the right side of this page, during the first half of this year, we invested more than $640 million, or almost 2/3 of our capital expenditures, in jurisdictions with more constructive regulatory frameworks. This included about $290 million of capital for FERC-regulated transmission projects. 
A significant portion of this capital was invested in our $1.4 billion MISO-approved Illinois Rivers project, which is now about 90% complete, with 4 of its 9 line segments energized, including 2 of 3 river crossings, and with all 10 substations in service. Four of the 5 remaining line segments are in the advanced stages of construction, with 2 of those line segments to be completed by the end of this year. And the project remains on schedule for completion in 2019. 
At our second MISO-approved project, the $150 million Spoon River transmission line in Northwestern Illinois, 85% of pole foundations are complete. Pole installation is now underway and the project remains on schedule for completion in 2019.
Moving to our third MISO-approved project, the Mark Twain transmission line in Northeastern Missouri, there have been several recent developments. As we discussed on our first quarter call, ATXI has proposed an alternative route for the project that would place more than 90% of the line on existing transmission line corridors. 
To accomplish this, ATXI has reached agreements in principle with Northeast Missouri Electric Power Cooperative and Ameren Missouri to locate the new line on the existing rights of way. This alternative route significantly minimizes the impact to land owners, communities and existing farmland and has been endorsed by various agricultural and economic development groups and is not expected to change the estimated $250 million project cost. 
In June, ATXI, along with Northeast Missouri Electric Power Cooperative and Ameren Missouri, hosted a series of open-house meetings to obtain public input on the proposed alternative route to help finalize route options. Feedback so far has been positive, and we are working to obtain needed County assents for road crossings. Upon receiving all 5 County assents, ATXI will request a certificate of [ convenience ] and necessity for this route from the Missouri PSC. We look forward to continuing to work with landowners and the County Commissioners to get this important project for Missouri and the entire Midwest region moving forward. The planned in-service date is late 2019.
We also continue to invest in Ameren Illinois local electrical transmission projects to maintain and enhance reliability, including projects to meet reliability requirements, replacing aging infrastructure and modernize the grid. Our pipeline for these types of projects remains strong and will continue to deliver significant value to our customers and create jobs.
Moving on to our other businesses. We invested about $350 million in Illinois Electric and Natural Gas Distribution infrastructure projects during the first half of this year. These investments include natural gas distribution projects that upgrade our gas main infrastructure and electric distribution projects that add smart grid technology and upgrade substations, all to improve the safety and reliability of our system. 
Through the end of June, Ameren Illinois has installed 516,000 smart electric meters and 278,000 gas meter modules that provide customers with enhanced energy usage data and access to programs to help them save on their energy bills.
Ameren Illinois expects to install another 185,000 smart electric meters and 76,000 gas meter modules in the second half of 2017 as it works to deploy these to all of its 1.2 million electric and 800,000 gas customers by the end of 2019. 
Turning now to Page 6 for our Missouri business update. As we discussed on our first quarter earnings call, new electric rates went into effect on April 1 of this year as a result of a unanimous agreement resolving all the issues in the rate review. Again, we appreciate the cooperative effort of all parties involved and consider unanimous agreement a positive, constructive step forward.
In addition to successfully executing our rate review, we continue to effectively manage our Missouri operations and earn solid returns. We are doing so by effectively managing our capital projects as well as by keeping a very sharp eye on our operating costs. We're also very focused on enhancing Missouri's regulatory framework. As you know, constructive ratemaking and legislation was not passed by the Missouri General Assembly during this year's legislative sessions as a result of filibusters by a small group of state senators. While legislation did not get across the finish line, we did make progress on several fronts, progress we will build upon going forward.
That progress included constructive reports from the Senate Interim Committee and Missouri PSC that supported enhancing the Missouri regulatory framework. Those reports, coupled with growing evidence from around the country that indicates that modern energy policies that support investment in the energy grid are in the long-term best interest of customers and the economy, help grow the strong bipartisan support for legislation.
Looking ahead, we will leverage the meaningful progress we have made over the last several legislative sessions, continue to work collaboratively with key stakeholders and work towards charting a constructive path forward to enhance Missouri's regulatory framework. I also expect that we will support another legislative initiative in 2018.
Turning to Page 7. As we look to the future, the successful execution of our robust 5-year plan is not only focused on delivering strong results through 2021, it is also designed to positioned Ameren for success over the next decade and beyond. We strongly believe that the energy grid will be increasingly more important as we believe that Ameren and our industry will be critical enablers of advancing technologies that will bring even greater value to our customers, the communities we serve and our shareholders. Further, we continue to believe it will be appropriate to transition our generation fleet to a cleaner, more diverse portfolio in a responsible fashion.
With this long-term view in mind, we are already making investments that will position us for success. These include significant investments in smart meters, digital technologies and another infrastructure that will result in a safer and more secure energy grid that will enable us to meet our customers' rising energy needs and expectations. 
And we are making prudent decisions to close down coal-fired generation resources at the end of their useful lives, including our Meramec Energy Center in 2022, as well as to invest in renewable energy to effectively transition our generation portfolio. 
Right now, Ameren Missouri is in the process of finalizing it's next 20-year Integrated Resource Plan, which is scheduled to be filed with the Missouri PSC in October of this year. In this plan, we will continue to appropriately balance our responsibilities to our customers and communities, the environment and, of course, our shareholders.
Consistent with this long-term view, by the end of 2021, we expect that nearly 75% of our rate base will be invested in transmission and distribution assets, while just 13% of our rate base will consist of coal-fired generation. In addition to making investments with an eye toward the future, we are also actively participating in proceedings before the Illinois Commerce Commission and Missouri PSC that are, among other things, vetting appropriate regulatory programs and frameworks to address changes taking place in our industry.
The bottom line is that we are taking steps today across the board to position Ameren for success in 2017, the next 5 years and the next decade and beyond, and in so doing, continue to deliver superior value to our customers and you, our shareholders.
Turning now to Page 8 to conclude my remarks. In February, we outlined our investment plan that included 6% compound annual rate base growth in 2016 through 2021, reflecting greater levels of capital allocated to those jurisdictions with constructive regulatory frameworks. As we stated previously, this plan is not contingent on passage of Missouri legislation. Also in February, we affirmed our expectation for earnings per share growth of 5% to 8% compounded annually from 2016 to 2020, based on the adjusted 2016 guidance midpoint we outlined early last year.
We consider both our rate base and earnings growth rates to be attractive compared to those of our regulated utility peers, and Ameren shares continued to offer investors a solid dividend, which our board has increased in each of the last few years. Of course, future dividend increases will be based on consideration of, among other things, earnings growth, cash flows and economic and other business conditions. 
To summarize, we believe our strong rate base and earnings growth profile, combined with our solid dividend currently providing a yield of approximately 3.1%, results in an attractive total return opportunity for shareholders compared to our regulated utility peers. We remain focused on executing our strategy and I am firmly convinced that doing so will deliver superior value to our shareholders, customers and the communities we serve. 
Again, thank you all for joining us today. I'll now turn the call over to Marty."
373264,529971942,1268857,"Ameren Corporation, Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2017",2017-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Ameren Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Warner, and good morning, everyone. Turning now to Page 10 of our presentation. As Warner mentioned, we reported second quarter 2017 earnings of $0.79 per share compared with earnings of $0.61 per share for the year-ago quarter. On this page, we h",1506,"Thanks, Warner, and good morning, everyone. Turning now to Page 10 of our presentation. As Warner mentioned, we reported second quarter 2017 earnings of $0.79 per share compared with earnings of $0.61 per share for the year-ago quarter. On this page, we highlight by segment the key factors that drove the overall $0.18 per share increase. 
Starting with Ameren Missouri. Second quarter year-over-year earnings increased $0.11, from $0.38 to $0.49 per share. This improvement reflected new electric service rates effective April 1st, driven in part by increased infrastructure investments and removal of the negative effect of lower sales to the New Madrid smelter. The earnings improvement also resulted from the absence of a scheduled Callaway Energy Center nuclear refueling and maintenance outage. The favorable factors were partially offset by lower electric retail sales, primarily driven by milder early summer temperatures. 
Next, Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution's second quarter year-over-year earnings rose from $0.08 to $0.14 per share. This largely reflected the favorable impact of the 2017 change in the timing of interim period revenue recognition resulting from the Future Energy Jobs Act. This act modified the existing formulaic ratemaking by decoupling our distribution revenues from sales volumes. While this change will impact quarterly comparisons, it will not affect full year earnings. 
Second quarter 2017 earnings at Ameren Illinois electric distribution also benefited from increased infrastructure investments as well as a higher allowed return on equity under formulaic ratemaking of 8.8% compared to 8.45% for the year-ago quarter.
Turning to Ameren Transmission. Second quarter year-over-year earnings rose from $0.13 to $0.14 per share. This was due to increased transmission infrastructure investments at ATXI and Ameren Illinois, which both operate under constructive FERC formulaic ratemaking, partially offset by a lower average allowed return on equity, which was 10.82% in 2017 compared to an average of 11.4% in the year-ago quarter.
In 2016, our transmission segment benefited from a temporarily higher FERC-allowed ROE as a result of the expiration in May of 2016 of the 15-month refund period for the second MISO ROE complaint case. 
Before moving on, let me briefly cover sales trends for the first half of 2017 compared to the first half of 2016. Weather-normalized kilowatt hour sales to Illinois and Missouri residential and commercial customers on a combined basis were flat, excluding the effects of our Missouri Energy Efficiency Program under MIA. We exclude MIA effects because the program provides rate recovery to ensure that earnings are not affected by reduced electric sales resulting from our energy efficiency efforts. The sales results reflect underlying 2017 growth, offset by the absence of the 2016 leap day sales benefit.
Kilowatt hour sales to Missouri industrial customers increased about 0.5%, excluding MIA effects and sales to the New Madrid smelter, which shut down operations during the first quarter of 2016. Kilowatt hour sales to Illinois industrial customers in 2017 decreased 3%, primarily due to lower sales to a low -- to a large, low-margin processor of agricultural products. Recall the changes in electric sales in Illinois, no matter the cause, do not impact our earnings since the Future Energy Job Act provided full revenue decoupling beginning this year.
Moving to Page 11 of our presentation. I would now like to discuss our 2017 earnings guidance. Today, we reaffirmed our GAAP guidance at $2.65 to $2.85 per share, which now includes an expected third quarter noncash tax-related charge of $0.06 per share, which I will discuss in more detail in a moment. Excluding this charge, we expect to deliver 2017 core earnings within a range of $2.70 to $2.90 per share, a $0.05 per share improvement over our prior guidance range, reflecting solid execution of our strategy, including continued disciplined cost management. 
This updated guidance assumes normal temperatures for the second half of this year. While July temperatures were much warmer than normal, we don't expect that this impact was significant enough to offset the very mild temperatures experienced during the first half of the year, which reduced earnings by approximately $0.07 per share.
Listed on this page are select earnings considerations that will affect the comparability of second half 2017 core earnings to last year's second half results. Some of the larger impacts include a change in the timing of interim period revenue recognition at Ameren Illinois' electric distribution business and assumed return to normal temperatures, the fourth quarter Callaway refueling and maintenance outage, the absence of 2016 Ameren Missouri energy efficiency performance incentives, the 2017 Ameren Missouri electric rate review settlement and increased transmission and electric distribution infrastructure investments at ATXI and Ameren Illinois.
I want to particularly call your attention to the change in timing of interim period revenue recognition in Ameren Illinois because it is expected to decrease earnings by approximately $0.23 per share in the third quarter of 2017 and increase earnings by approximately $0.11 per share in the fourth quarter of 2017. 
Finally, I would like to discuss the impact on Ameren of the recently enacted increase in Illinois' corporate income tax rate. Early last month, the Illinois General Assembly approved a budget-related legislation that effectively increased the corporate income tax rate to 9.5% from 7.75% as of July 1st of this year. The tax increase is expected to result in a third quarter 2017 non-core, noncash charge of an estimated $0.06 per share, primarily at the parent company, due to revaluation of deferred taxes. Beyond this charge, we do not expect the tax increase to have a material impact on our consolidated earnings prospectively. 
The tax increase is not expected to materially impact earnings of Ameren Illinois' electric distribution or Ameren Illinois' and ATXI's transmission businesses since they operate under formulaic ratemaking. 
The tax increase is expected to reduce Ameren Illinois' gas distribution business earnings, but only by approximately $1 million annually until customer rates are reset in the next rate review. And we plan to file for a gas distribution rate review in Illinois in early 2018 with new customer rates to be effective in early 2019.
Turning now to Page 12 for an update on 2017 long-term debt financings. On June 15, Ameren Missouri issued $400 million of 2.95% senior secured notes due 2027, the proceeds of which were used in connection with the repayment at maturity of $425 million of 6.4% senior secured notes. 
Also, ATXI agreed to privately place $450 million of 3.43% senior unsecured notes due 2050. $150 million of such notes were issued on June 22nd, with the remaining $300 million to be issued on August 31. The proceeds of the ATXI private placement will be used to repay Ameren parent for a portion of ATXI's existing intercompany debt. This is the first time ATXI has issued external debt, and we are pleased with this successful low-cost issuance, including the strong investment-grade credit rating to notes received.
Finally, we expect Ameren Illinois to issue long-term debt later this year to repay, at maturity, $250 million of 6.125% senior secured notes and short-term debt.
Moving now to Page 13 for a discussion of select regulatory matters pending at the Illinois Commerce Commission and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. In July, Ameren Illinois updated its required annual electric distribution rate update filings, requesting a $17 million decrease in the annual electric distribution revenue requirement. This is consistent with the ICC staff's filed testimony, and other parties did not file revenue requirement testimony. An ICC decision is expected in December of this year, with new rates effective early next year. 
Turning to the FERC, 1 complaint case remains that seeks to reduce the base allowed ROE for MISO transmission owners, including Ameren Illinois and ATXI. These businesses are currently earning a 10.82% ROE, including a 50 basis point adder for MISO membership, and will continue to do so pending any change required by the FERC as a result of this case. Our updated guidance assumes this ROE continues through the end of the year. 
While the U.S. Senate's approval yesterday of 2 new commissioners reestablishes a quorum at the FERC, it remains uncertain when the commission will rule on the pending complaint case. In addition to facing a significant backlog of other cases, we expect that the FERC commissioners will take time to consider the recent ruling of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit that vacated the FERC's order in a New England transmission ROE case, as this court ruling may influence the FERC's order in the pending MISO ROE complaint case.
Turning to Page 14, I will summarize. We expect to deliver 2017 core earnings within a range of $2.70 to $2.90 per share as we continue to successfully execute our strategy. As Warner stated, as we look ahead, we continue to expect strong earnings per share growth driven by strong rate base growth and disciplined financial management. And Ameren shares continue to offer investors an attractive dividend. In total, we believe we have an attractive total shareholder return story compared to our regulated utility peers.
That concludes our prepared remarks. We now invite your questions."

Can you talk a little bit about whether you see that as a significant opportunity either via owning wind plants and rate base, or in the need for incremental transmission in Missouri to be able to connect to the west, where there's lots of great wind resource? And can you talk about what do you need from a regulatory standpoint, either ratemaking or approval-wise, to actually make that happen, if that's one of the decisions you make going forward."

Number one, we're in the process. We look at transmission, but we also look at generation. And we've been consistent in saying that we're going to transition our generation portfolio to a more diverse, cleaner portfolio, but we're doing it in a responsible fashion. A little bit later this year, we are going to update our integrated resource plan. And that will highlight some of those opportunities we may have in the renewable energy space just with regard to our own generation. And as we know, we have a renewable energy standard in the State of Missouri. And as a result of that, as renewable energy costs for new generation comes down, that's something we're going to look carefully at. Of course, to make renewable energy work, you need to make sure that you have a transmission system that's robust enough to support all of that. And at the end of the day, we have certainly made more investments in the transmission space in Illinois. And then in MISO, we've done some. We have Mark Twain project that we're going to hopefully continue to move forward with and get across the finish line. So as you continue to see greater levels of renewable generation in MISO, in the broader footprint, we do see that there could be some opportunities for incremental transmission that could be done. Whether it's done on a multi-value project basis, which would have to go through MISO, or potentially, of course, something that we would do under the state regulatory framework in Missouri. And so I wouldn't say that we certainly rule that out. We see that as an opportunity. So I'm looking at Shawn Schukar. And Shawn, in terms of how you look at this space, especially in MISO and other things. We do see incremental transmission opportunities not just to support generation, but even just to deal with and to support [ new ] reliability projects and those types of things."

It's always one of working with key stakeholders to educate them on the needs. And it's always one of ensuring they understand the real value to modernizing the energy grid. Now if you look at what we've been able to do in Illinois, that's really the formula that we've worked over there, is making sure everyone understood the value. And then once you have them understand the value, you deliver on those projects. And it's clear what we've seen in Illinois and what we've seen, frankly, across the country, is that modern energy policies that support investment in a modernized grid not only brings real value to customers, it keeps rates still affordable, but it creates thousands of jobs. That's been a formula that's worked across the country, and we can see it's worked clearly in Illinois. So that same message is resonating in the state of Missouri. It's why we have such strong bipartisan support. That's why the collaborative effort that we've been working on continue to gather even more stakeholders to support it. So it really is one of just doing the work on the ground, to work on -- with -- collaborating with key stakeholders. And being mindful that the approach that we've been taking is very consistent with our -- Governor Greitens has said that, look, regulatory  reform is an important part of his platform to become governor as well as creating good-paying jobs.

We could own wind generation. Both of those are viable options. And in terms of that question, I mean, there's a couple of ways that it could happen prospectively. One, as you mentioned, is to the extent that the all-in cost of those renewables was below the dispatch cost of our existing generation. Of course, one of the reasons why maybe the penetration hasn't been as great here as maybe other places is that the dispatch costs of our existing generation is pretty low and it's a real benefit for our customers. However, the cost of renewables continues to come down and we watch those economics very closely. As Warner mentioned in his answer to Michael earlier, as part of the Integrated Resource Plan, we also look at compliance with the Missouri Renewable Energy Standard. That standard actually requires us to purchase or generate 15% of our native sales from renewables by 2021, subject though to a 1% annual limit on rates. And really, that's been a limiter historically in terms of introducing even more renewables into the portfolio. In our 2014 IRP we had about 130 megawatts of wind coming in by 2021. So as Warner mentioned in his talking points, we're working on an update to that Integrated Resource Plan. And in answer to your question, we're both looking at the economics of renewables as compared to the dispatch cost of our existing generation, but also looking at in terms of compliance with that renewable energy standard within the limits of that 1% impact on rates. So those are the 2 ways that really, as we look ahead, there's the opportunity to bring even further renewables into our portfolio."

Before I begin my business update, I first want to express my deep appreciation to our customers who experienced outages over the last several weeks due to some severe storms. I am grateful for your patience and the support of our coworkers who are working hard to restore your service in very hot and humid weather conditions. 
Of course, I also wanted to express my appreciation to our coworkers who have been tirelessly working through these difficult conditions for our Missouri and Illinois customers. Our coworkers have continued to work safely and our system has held up well despite these challenging conditions.  
Again, my thanks to all of you.
Moving now to our financial results. Earlier today, we announced strong second quarter 2017 earnings of $0.79 per share compared to earnings of $0.61 per share in the second quarter of 2016. This growth of $0.18 per share was driven by the factors outlined on this page, which Marty will discuss in more detail in a moment. 
What is particularly satisfying to me is that our strong growth was driven by the solid execution of our strategy across our entire business. I'm also pleased to report that as a result of this execution, we expect to deliver 2017 core earnings within a range of $2.70 to $2.90 per share, a $0.05 improvement over our prior guidance. 
This updated guidance excludes an expected third quarter noncash estimated charge of $0.06 per share, primarily at the parent company. This charge is the results of revaluation of deferred taxes due to an increase in the Illinois corporate income tax rate effective July 1st of this year. Beyond this charge, we expect this tax increase to have no material impact on consolidated earnings prospectively. Marty will also address this matter in more detail in a moment.
Moving to Page 5. Here, we reiterate our strategic plan. The year-over-year earnings growth I just mentioned reflects the significant investments we are making to better serve our customers, as illustrated on the right side of this page.
We continue to strategically allocate capital to our transmission and distribution businesses, where investments are supported by regulatory frameworks that provide fair, predictable and timely cost recovery. This, along with our continued disciplined cost management that supports our goal of earning close to our allowed returns in all of our jurisdictions, is expected to result in long-term earnings growth that is superior to our regulated peers. 
I would like to discuss some of our year-to-date accomplishments and efforts towards execution of our strategy. As you can see on the right side of this page, during the first half of this year, we invested more than $640 million, or almost 2/3 of our capital expenditures, in jurisdictions with more constructive regulatory frameworks. This included about $290 million of capital for FERC-regulated transmission projects. 
A significant portion of this capital was invested in our $1.4 billion MISO-approved Illinois Rivers project, which is now about 90% complete, with 4 of its 9 line segments energized, including 2 of 3 river crossings, and with all 10 substations in service. Four of the 5 remaining line segments are in the advanced stages of construction, with 2 of those line segments to be completed by the end of this year. And the project remains on schedule for completion in 2019. 
At our second MISO-approved project, the $150 million Spoon River transmission line in Northwestern Illinois, 85% of pole foundations are complete. Pole installation is now underway and the project remains on schedule for completion in 2019.
Moving to our third MISO-approved project, the Mark Twain transmission line in Northeastern Missouri, there have been several recent developments. As we discussed on our first quarter call, ATXI has proposed an alternative route for the project that would place more than 90% of the line on existing transmission line corridors. 
To accomplish this, ATXI has reached agreements in principle with Northeast Missouri Electric Power Cooperative and Ameren Missouri to locate the new line on the existing rights of way. This alternative route significantly minimizes the impact to land owners, communities and existing farmland and has been endorsed by various agricultural and economic development groups and is not expected to change the estimated $250 million project cost. 
In June, ATXI, along with Northeast Missouri Electric Power Cooperative and Ameren Missouri, hosted a series of open-house meetings to obtain public input on the proposed alternative route to help finalize route options. Feedback so far has been positive, and we are working to obtain needed County assents for road crossings. Upon receiving all 5 County assents, ATXI will request a certificate of [ convenience ] and necessity for this route from the Missouri PSC. We look forward to continuing to work with landowners and the County Commissioners to get this important project for Missouri and the entire Midwest region moving forward. The planned in-service date is late 2019.
We also continue to invest in Ameren Illinois local electrical transmission projects to maintain and enhance reliability, including projects to meet reliability requirements, replacing aging infrastructure and modernize the grid. Our pipeline for these types of projects remains strong and will continue to deliver significant value to our customers and create jobs.
Moving on to our other businesses. We invested about $350 million in Illinois Electric and Natural Gas Distribution infrastructure projects during the first half of this year. These investments include natural gas distribution projects that upgrade our gas main infrastructure and electric distribution projects that add smart grid technology and upgrade substations, all to improve the safety and reliability of our system. 
Through the end of June, Ameren Illinois has installed 516,000 smart electric meters and 278,000 gas meter modules that provide customers with enhanced energy usage data and access to programs to help them save on their energy bills.
Ameren Illinois expects to install another 185,000 smart electric meters and 76,000 gas meter modules in the second half of 2017 as it works to deploy these to all of its 1.2 million electric and 800,000 gas customers by the end of 2019. 
Turning now to Page 6 for our Missouri business update. As we discussed on our first quarter earnings call, new electric rates went into effect on April 1 of this year as a result of a unanimous agreement resolving all the issues in the rate review. Again, we appreciate the cooperative effort of all parties involved and consider unanimous agreement a positive, constructive step forward.
In addition to successfully executing our rate review, we continue to effectively manage our Missouri operations and earn solid returns. We are doing so by effectively managing our capital projects as well as by keeping a very sharp eye on our operating costs. We're also very focused on enhancing Missouri's regulatory framework. As you know, constructive ratemaking and legislation was not passed by the Missouri General Assembly during this year's legislative sessions as a result of filibusters by a small group of state senators. While legislation did not get across the finish line, we did make progress on several fronts, progress we will build upon going forward.
That progress included constructive reports from the Senate Interim Committee and Missouri PSC that supported enhancing the Missouri regulatory framework. Those reports, coupled with growing evidence from around the country that indicates that modern energy policies that support investment in the energy grid are in the long-term best interest of customers and the economy, help grow the strong bipartisan support for legislation.
Looking ahead, we will leverage the meaningful progress we have made over the last several legislative sessions, continue to work collaboratively with key stakeholders and work towards charting a constructive path forward to enhance Missouri's regulatory framework. I also expect that we will support another legislative initiative in 2018.
Turning to Page 7. As we look to the future, the successful execution of our robust 5-year plan is not only focused on delivering strong results through 2021, it is also designed to positioned Ameren for success over the next decade and beyond. We strongly believe that the energy grid will be increasingly more important as we believe that Ameren and our industry will be critical enablers of advancing technologies that will bring even greater value to our customers, the communities we serve and our shareholders. Further, we continue to believe it will be appropriate to transition our generation fleet to a cleaner, more diverse portfolio in a responsible fashion.
With this long-term view in mind, we are already making investments that will position us for success. These include significant investments in smart meters, digital technologies and another infrastructure that will result in a safer and more secure energy grid that will enable us to meet our customers' rising energy needs and expectations. 
And we are making prudent decisions to close down coal-fired generation resources at the end of their useful lives, including our Meramec Energy Center in 2022, as well as to invest in renewable energy to effectively transition our generation portfolio. 
Right now, Ameren Missouri is in the process of finalizing its next 20-year Integrated Resource Plan, which is scheduled to be filed with the Missouri PSC in October of this year. In this plan, we will continue to appropriately balance our responsibilities to our customers and communities, the environment and, of course, our shareholders.
Consistent with this long-term view, by the end of 2021, we expect that nearly 75% of our rate base will be invested in transmission and distribution assets, while just 13% of our rate base will consist of coal-fired generation. In addition to making investments with an eye toward the future, we are also actively participating in proceedings before the Illinois Commerce Commission and Missouri PSC that are, among other things, vetting appropriate regulatory programs and frameworks to address changes taking place in our industry.
The bottom line is that we are taking steps today across the board to position Ameren for success in 2017, the next 5 years and the next decade and beyond, and in so doing, continue to deliver superior value to our customers and you, our shareholders.
Turning now to Page 8 to conclude my remarks. In February, we outlined our investment plan that included 6% compound annual rate base growth in 2016 through 2021, reflecting greater levels of capital allocated to those jurisdictions with constructive regulatory frameworks. As we stated previously, this plan is not contingent on passage of Missouri legislation. Also in February, we affirmed our expectation for earnings per share growth of 5% to 8% compounded annually from 2016 to 2020, based on the adjusted 2016 guidance midpoint we outlined early last year.
We consider both our rate base and earnings growth rates to be attractive compared to those of our regulated utility peers, and Ameren shares continued to offer investors a solid dividend, which our board has increased in each of the last few years. Of course, future dividend increases will be based on consideration of, among other things, earnings growth, cash flows and economic and other business conditions. 
To summarize, we believe our strong rate base and earnings growth profile, combined with our solid dividend currently providing a yield of approximately 3.1%, results in an attractive total return opportunity for shareholders compared to our regulated utility peers. We remain focused on executing our strategy and I am firmly convinced that doing so will deliver superior value to our shareholders, customers and the communities we serve. 
Again, thank you all for joining us today. I'll now turn the call over to Marty."
373264,529971942,1270799,"Ameren Corporation, Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2017",2017-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Ameren Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Warner, and good morning, everyone. Turning now to Page 10 of our presentation. As Warner mentioned, we reported second quarter 2017 earnings of $0.79 per share compared with earnings of $0.61 per share for the year-ago quarter. On this page, we h",1506,"Thanks, Warner, and good morning, everyone. Turning now to Page 10 of our presentation. As Warner mentioned, we reported second quarter 2017 earnings of $0.79 per share compared with earnings of $0.61 per share for the year-ago quarter. On this page, we highlight by segment the key factors that drove the overall $0.18 per share increase. 
Starting with Ameren Missouri. Second quarter year-over-year earnings increased $0.11, from $0.38 to $0.49 per share. This improvement reflected new electric service rates effective April 1st, driven in part by increased infrastructure investments and removal of the negative effect of lower sales to the New Madrid smelter. The earnings improvement also resulted from the absence of a scheduled Callaway Energy Center nuclear refueling and maintenance outage. The favorable factors were partially offset by lower electric retail sales, primarily driven by milder early summer temperatures. 
Next, Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution's second quarter year-over-year earnings rose from $0.08 to $0.14 per share. This largely reflected the favorable impact of the 2017 change in the timing of interim period revenue recognition resulting from the Future Energy Jobs Act. This act modified the existing formulaic ratemaking by decoupling our distribution revenues from sales volumes. While this change will impact quarterly comparisons, it will not affect full year earnings. 
Second quarter 2017 earnings at Ameren Illinois electric distribution also benefited from increased infrastructure investments as well as a higher allowed return on equity under formulaic ratemaking of 8.8% compared to 8.45% for the year-ago quarter.
Turning to Ameren Transmission. Second quarter year-over-year earnings rose from $0.13 to $0.14 per share. This was due to increased transmission infrastructure investments at ATXI and Ameren Illinois, which both operate under constructive FERC formulaic ratemaking, partially offset by a lower average allowed return on equity, which was 10.82% in 2017 compared to an average of 11.4% in the year-ago quarter.
In 2016, our transmission segment benefited from a temporarily higher FERC-allowed ROE as a result of the expiration in May of 2016 of the 15-month refund period for the second MISO ROE complaint case. 
Before moving on, let me briefly cover sales trends for the first half of 2017 compared to the first half of 2016. Weather-normalized kilowatt hour sales to Illinois and Missouri residential and commercial customers on a combined basis were flat, excluding the effects of our Missouri Energy Efficiency Program under MIA. We exclude MIA effects because the program provides rate recovery to ensure that earnings are not affected by reduced electric sales resulting from our energy efficiency efforts. The sales results reflect underlying 2017 growth, offset by the absence of the 2016 leap day sales benefit.
Kilowatt hour sales to Missouri industrial customers increased about 0.5%, excluding MIA effects and sales to the New Madrid smelter, which shut down operations during the first quarter of 2016. Kilowatt hour sales to Illinois industrial customers in 2017 decreased 3%, primarily due to lower sales to a low -- to a large, low-margin processor of agricultural products. Recall the changes in electric sales in Illinois, no matter the cause, do not impact our earnings since the Future Energy Job Act provided full revenue decoupling beginning this year.
Moving to Page 11 of our presentation. I would now like to discuss our 2017 earnings guidance. Today, we reaffirmed our GAAP guidance at $2.65 to $2.85 per share, which now includes an expected third quarter noncash tax-related charge of $0.06 per share, which I will discuss in more detail in a moment. Excluding this charge, we expect to deliver 2017 core earnings within a range of $2.70 to $2.90 per share, a $0.05 per share improvement over our prior guidance range, reflecting solid execution of our strategy, including continued disciplined cost management. 
This updated guidance assumes normal temperatures for the second half of this year. While July temperatures were much warmer than normal, we don't expect that this impact was significant enough to offset the very mild temperatures experienced during the first half of the year, which reduced earnings by approximately $0.07 per share.
Listed on this page are select earnings considerations that will affect the comparability of second half 2017 core earnings to last year's second half results. Some of the larger impacts include a change in the timing of interim period revenue recognition at Ameren Illinois' electric distribution business and assumed return to normal temperatures, the fourth quarter Callaway refueling and maintenance outage, the absence of 2016 Ameren Missouri energy efficiency performance incentives, the 2017 Ameren Missouri electric rate review settlement and increased transmission and electric distribution infrastructure investments at ATXI and Ameren Illinois.
I want to particularly call your attention to the change in timing of interim period revenue recognition in Ameren Illinois because it is expected to decrease earnings by approximately $0.23 per share in the third quarter of 2017 and increase earnings by approximately $0.11 per share in the fourth quarter of 2017. 
Finally, I would like to discuss the impact on Ameren of the recently enacted increase in Illinois' corporate income tax rate. Early last month, the Illinois General Assembly approved a budget-related legislation that effectively increased the corporate income tax rate to 9.5% from 7.75% as of July 1st of this year. The tax increase is expected to result in a third quarter 2017 non-core, noncash charge of an estimated $0.06 per share, primarily at the parent company, due to revaluation of deferred taxes. Beyond this charge, we do not expect the tax increase to have a material impact on our consolidated earnings prospectively. 
The tax increase is not expected to materially impact earnings of Ameren Illinois' electric distribution or Ameren Illinois' and ATXI's transmission businesses since they operate under formulaic ratemaking. 
The tax increase is expected to reduce Ameren Illinois' gas distribution business earnings, but only by approximately $1 million annually until customer rates are reset in the next rate review. And we plan to file for a gas distribution rate review in Illinois in early 2018 with new customer rates to be effective in early 2019.
Turning now to Page 12 for an update on 2017 long-term debt financings. On June 15, Ameren Missouri issued $400 million of 2.95% senior secured notes due 2027, the proceeds of which were used in connection with the repayment at maturity of $425 million of 6.4% senior secured notes. 
Also, ATXI agreed to privately place $450 million of 3.43% senior unsecured notes due 2050. $150 million of such notes were issued on June 22nd, with the remaining $300 million to be issued on August 31. The proceeds of the ATXI private placement will be used to repay Ameren parent for a portion of ATXI's existing intercompany debt. This is the first time ATXI has issued external debt, and we are pleased with this successful low-cost issuance, including the strong investment-grade credit rating to notes received.
Finally, we expect Ameren Illinois to issue long-term debt later this year to repay, at maturity, $250 million of 6.125% senior secured notes and short-term debt.
Moving now to Page 13 for a discussion of select regulatory matters pending at the Illinois Commerce Commission and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. In July, Ameren Illinois updated its required annual electric distribution rate update filings, requesting a $17 million decrease in the annual electric distribution revenue requirement. This is consistent with the ICC staff's filed testimony, and other parties did not file revenue requirement testimony. An ICC decision is expected in December of this year, with new rates effective early next year. 
Turning to the FERC, 1 complaint case remains that seeks to reduce the base allowed ROE for MISO transmission owners, including Ameren Illinois and ATXI. These businesses are currently earning a 10.82% ROE, including a 50 basis point adder for MISO membership, and will continue to do so pending any change required by the FERC as a result of this case. Our updated guidance assumes this ROE continues through the end of the year. 
While the U.S. Senate's approval yesterday of 2 new commissioners reestablishes a quorum at the FERC, it remains uncertain when the commission will rule on the pending complaint case. In addition to facing a significant backlog of other cases, we expect that the FERC commissioners will take time to consider the recent ruling of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit that vacated the FERC's order in a New England transmission ROE case, as this court ruling may influence the FERC's order in the pending MISO ROE complaint case.
Turning to Page 14, I will summarize. We expect to deliver 2017 core earnings within a range of $2.70 to $2.90 per share as we continue to successfully execute our strategy. As Warner stated, as we look ahead, we continue to expect strong earnings per share growth driven by strong rate base growth and disciplined financial management. And Ameren shares continue to offer investors an attractive dividend. In total, we believe we have an attractive total shareholder return story compared to our regulated utility peers.
That concludes our prepared remarks. We now invite your questions."

I mean, as we look at this year, we've upped our guidance for our core earnings, the midpoint is $2.80. And as we think about going into next year, any kind of long-term guidance we give, yes, the foundation would be whatever the core earnings were for the prior year. So that would be -- that very well may be the $2.80 going forward."

Number one, we're in the process. We look at transmission, but we also look at generation. And we've been consistent in saying that we're going to transition our generation portfolio to a more diverse, cleaner portfolio, but we're doing it in a responsible fashion. A little bit later this year, we are going to update our integrated resource plan. And that will highlight some of those opportunities we may have in the renewable energy space just with regard to our own generation. And as we know, we have a renewable energy standard in the State of Missouri. And as a result of that, as renewable energy costs for new generation comes down, that's something we're going to look carefully at. Of course, to make renewable energy work, you need to make sure that you have a transmission system that's robust enough to support all of that. And at the end of the day, we have certainly made more investments in the transmission space in Illinois. And then in MISO, we've done some. We have Mark Twain project that we're going to hopefully continue to move forward with and get across the finish line. So as you continue to see greater levels of renewable generation in MISO, in the broader footprint, we do see that there could be some opportunities for incremental transmission that could be done. Whether it's done on a multi-value project basis, which would have to go through MISO, or potentially, of course, something that we would do under the state regulatory framework in Missouri. And so I wouldn't say that we certainly rule that out. We see that as an opportunity. So I'm looking at Shawn Schukar. And Shawn, in terms of how you look at this space, especially in MISO and other things. We do see incremental transmission opportunities not just to support generation, but even just to deal with and to support [ new ] reliability projects and those types of things."

And then once you have them understand the value, you deliver on those projects. And it's clear what we've seen in Illinois and what we've seen, frankly, across the country, is that modern energy policies that support investment in a modernized grid not only brings real value to customers, it keeps rates still affordable, but it creates thousands of jobs. That's been a formula that's worked across the country, and we can see it's worked clearly in Illinois. So that same message is resonating in the state of Missouri. It's why we have such strong bipartisan support. That's why the collaborative effort that we've been working on continue to gather even more stakeholders to support it.

We could own wind generation. Both of those are viable options. And in terms of that question, I mean, there's a couple of ways that it could happen prospectively. One, as you mentioned, is to the extent that the all-in cost of those renewables was below the dispatch cost of our existing generation. Of course, one of the reasons why maybe the penetration hasn't been as great here as maybe other places is that the dispatch costs of our existing generation is pretty low and it's a real benefit for our customers. However, the cost of renewables continues to come down and we watch those economics very closely. As Warner mentioned in his answer to Michael earlier, as part of the Integrated Resource Plan, we also look at compliance with the Missouri Renewable Energy Standard. That standard actually requires us to purchase or generate 15% of our native sales from renewables by 2021, subject though to a 1% annual limit on rates. And really, that's been a limiter historically in terms of introducing even more renewables into the portfolio. In our 2014 IRP we had about 130 megawatts of wind coming in by 2021. So as Warner mentioned in his talking points, we're working on an update to that Integrated Resource Plan. And in answer to your question, we're both looking at the economics of renewables as compared to the dispatch cost of our existing generation, but also looking at in terms of compliance with that renewable energy standard within the limits of that 1% impact on rates. So those are the 2 ways that really, as we look ahead, there's the opportunity to bring even further renewables into our portfolio."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Before I begin my business update, I first want to express my deep appreciation to our coworkers and contractors who volunteered to leave their families worked tirelessly in very challenging conditions to restore power for those who experienced outages due to hurricanes impacting Texas and Florida. I'm particularly thankful that all of our coworkers return home safely. The restoration efforts for hurricanes Harvey and Irma were just another example of incredible teamwork and commitment to our customers that are so often displayed by our industry. Further, Ameren and our industry, stand ready to support Puerto Rico in its hurricane restoration efforts. Our thoughts and prayers remain with those families who lost loved ones, their homes that were otherwise impacted by these devastating storms. 
Moving to our financial results, later today we announced third quarter 2017 quarter earnings, $1.24 per share, compared to $1.52 per share earned in the third quarter of 2016. This year-over-year decline of $0.28 per share which largely driven by a $0.24 per share change and the timing of Ameren period revenue ignition at Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution, a matter which we highlighted earlier this year. This $0.24 timing-related decline in third quarter earnings will have no effect on full year earnings due to increases in revenue recognition in the first, second and fourth quarters this year compared to last. Marty will discuss this and other factors driving the quarterly results in more detail in a moment. 
I'm also pleased to report that we remained on track to redeliver strong core earnings results in 2017. This morning, we announced that we narrowed our 2017 core earnings guidance to a range of $2.73 to $2.87 per share. 
Moving to Page 5. Here, we reiterate our strategic plan, which we have been executing very well over the last several years. We remain focused on operating our businesses safely while strategically allocating capital and continuing to exercise disciplined cost management. We expect this strategic capital allocation, along with disciplined cost management, that supports our goal of earnings close in of our jurisdictions to result in solid long-term earnings growth. I'm happy to report that in 2017, we have been successful executing these key strategic actions across all of our businesses. 
As you can see on the right side of this page, during the first 9 months of this year, we invested nearly 1
[Audio Gap]
in the transition and distribution businesses, where investments are supported by regulatory frameworks that provide fair, predictable and timely cost recovery. Since our second quarter call, we achieved a couple of key milestones on the 100-mile Mark Twain Transmission line in Northeastern Missouri. To begin, ATXI has proposed alternative route for this project, which is nearly 100% colocated on existing rights-of-way as received all 5 required County license for road crossings. This was an important, that required extensive collaboration with many key stakeholders. As a result of achieving this important milestone, in mid-September, ATXI requested a certificate of convenience and necessity for the Mark Twain alternative route from the Missouri Public Service Commission, and we expect to receive a commission order in the first half of next year. There has been no change to the estimated $250 million project costs and the planned service state remains late 2019. 
Turning now on Page 6. We also continue to invest in Ameren Illinois Electric and Natural Gas Distribution Infrastructure projects. To the end of September, Ameren Illinois had installed 560,000 smart electric meters and 290,000 gas meter modules that provide customers with enhanced energy usage data and access the programs to help them save on their energy bills. We are working to deploy these meters to all of our 1.2 million electric and 800,000 gas customers in Illinois by the end of 2019. Additional investments include natural gas distribution projects that upgrade our gas main infrastructure. Our electric distribution projects that add smart grid technology and upgrade substations, all to improve the safety and reliability of our systems. 
Moving in Ameren Missouri. As you know, earlier this year, we achieved you constructive settlement in our electric rate grid view which favorably impacted our third quarter results. From an operational perspective, the Callaway Energy Center, again, scheduled refueling and maintenance outage in early October after completing a breaker record run of 514 consecutive days, the second longest run in Callaway's history. The outage is progressing safety, on-schedule and on-budget. 
Shifting now on the legislative efforts in Missouri, we remain very focused on enhancing Missouri's regulatory framework to better support investment and in its energy infrastructure. The growing body of investment from across the country clearly shows that these modernized energy policies deliver significant long-term benefits to customers. Those benefits include a more reliable and smarter energy grid, a more secured grid to address potential cyber attacks and greater tools for customers to manage their energy usage. 
During the 2017 legislative session, we presented a thoughtful and robust energy infrastructure plan that included an incremental $1 billion in investment over 5 years, and up to $4 billion over 10 years. Of course, these investments will also create thousands of good quality jobs in the state of Missouri. The proposed legislation also included other strong economic development provisions and consumer protections to keep our already low electric rates affordable and competitive in the future. These factors have resulted in strong bipartisan support in the legislature to modernize Missouri's regulatory framework. As a result, we are leveraging the meaningful progress we've made over the last several legislative sessions and continue to work collaboratively with key stakeholders to chart a constructive path forward for our customers and the state of Missouri. And as we noted earlier this year, we expect to support a legislative initiative in 2018 to modernize Missouri's regulatory framework for electric utilities. Legislation can be filed as early as December 1, but the 2018 session is officially beginning January 3 next year. 
Turning to page 7, in Missouri's Integrated Resource Plan. In late September, Ameren Missouri Avenue IRP with Missouri PSC, which it does every 3 years. This document details our assessment of the electric energy needs for customers for the next 20 years and puts forward our preferred resource plan for meeting those needs. Our 2017 IRP is consistent with our objective to transition [Audio Gap] complete to a cleaner, more diverse energy portfolio in a responsible fashion. Further, the IRP outlines a significant step change in a renewable energy portfolio due to the advancement of technologies and improved economics. Importantly, the IRP is consistent with the requirements of Missouri's renewable energies standard, which requires Ameren Missouri to source at least [ 15% ] retail customer sales from renewable energy resources by 2021, subject to a 1% average annual limit on customer rate impacts. Our preferred plan calls for the addition of at least 700 megawatts of wind generation by 2020 and 100 megawatts of solar generation by 2027. After careful assessment, we believe it is in our customers' long-term best interest for Ameren Missouri to own these new wind resources, which represents a potential investment of approximately $1 billion. We have been working on this important undertaking for many months, though we still have more work in front of us to successfully execute our preferred plan. We're still completing due diligence on certain matters and are in negotiations with several developers, which will ultimately determine the source, location and cost for these projects. We also recognize that the comprehensive tax reform proposal released yesterday, included revisions to the current production tax credit rules for wind generation. We expect that the proposed changes to the PTC rules will be the subject of much discussion by policymakers and key stakeholders over the next several weeks. Though it remains uncertain whether these potential modifications to the PTC rules will become law as well as tax reform in general, we will, of course, assess the potential implications of these changes on our plan, if any. 
Ownership will also require Ameren Missouri to secure certificates of need from the Missouri PSC for each location as well as regional transmission organization interconnection agreements. We are excited about the customer and environmental benefits as well as the potential significant investment and growth opportunities outlined in our preferred plan. As you know, we are very strategic when it comes to managing and finding a capital plan in order to deliver long-term benefits for our customers and shareholders. As a result, we will carefully assess our prospective infrastructure investment plans in the context of this potential $1 billion wind investment. Our current infrastructure investment plan does not include any expenditures for renewable energy. We will also carefully consider the best long-term potency plan for this potential investment. Of course, we remain committed to maintaining strong equity ratios and credit metrics at our utilities and on a consolidated basis. We will also assess the best approach to recover the cost of and return on these potential investments within the Missouri's regulatory framework. One tool was a cost recovery mechanism, it is already included in the Missouri renewable energy standard. It is a writer mechanism that is specifically designed to address the revenue requirement impacts resulted from complying with the renewable energy standard. The use of this writer mechanism would require approval by the Missouri PLC. It's premature to go into more detail on all these matters at this time, however, we plan to provide further updates to you during our year-end conference call in February 2018. 
Before I move up to the subject, I would also note that Ameren Missouri has established CO2 emission reduction goals from generation fleet by 35% by 2030, 50% by 2040 and 80% by 2050. 
In summary, our Integrated Resource Plan is a forward-thinking plan that is a win-win-win for our customers, the environment and our shareholders. Rest assured, we're very focused on executing this important opportunity for all of our stakeholders. 
Turning now to Page 8, in the current 5-year plan. In February, we outlined our investment plan that included $10.8 billion of regulated infrastructure investment as well as a 6% compound annual rate-based growth from 2016 through 2021, reflecting greater levels of capital allocated to those jurisdictions with more constructive regulatory frameworks. To be clear, this plan does not include the potential $1 billion investment in wind generation outlined in Missouri's IRP that I just discussed. It also does not include potential additional investments, $1 billion over 5 years, and up to $4 billion over 10 years that could be enabled by constructive Missouri legislation. As we look to the future, the successful execution of our robust 5-year plan is not only focused on delivering strong results through 2021, this is also designed to position Ameren for success over the next decade and beyond. With this long-term view in mind, we are already making significant investments in our Illinois electric and gas utilities that will position us for success, including those in smart meters, digital technologies and other infrastructure due to supportive regulatory frameworks. And, as we have mentioned, we've identified similar significant Missouri grid modernization investments, we would undertake with improvement in the Missouri regulatory framework. The bottom line is that we are taking steps today across the board to position Ameren for success in the next decade and beyond and we believe we have a strong, high-quality and sustainable pipeline of investment opportunities that would benefit customers, the communities we serve, and shareholders. 
Turning now to Page 9 to conclude my remarks. In February, we affirmed our expectation for earnings per share growth of 5% to 8% compounded annually from 2016 to 2020 based on the adjusted 2016 guidance midpoint, we outlined earlier last year. This was driven by robust 6% compound annual rate-based growth from 2016 to 2021. We consider both our rate base and earnings growth outlooks to be attractive compared to our regulated utility peers. Ameren also continues to offer investors a solid dividend. Last month, Ameren's boards of Directors expressed its confidence on our long-term growth plan by increasing the dividend by 4%. Of course, future dividend decisions will be driven by earnings growth, cash flows and other business conditions. 
To summarize, we believe our strong rate base and earnings growth profile, combined with our solid dividend, currently providing a yield of approximately 3% results in an attractive total return opportunity for shareholders compared to our regulated utility peers. We remain focused on executing our strategy, and I am firmly convinced that the recent will deliver superior value to our shareholders, customers and the communities that we serve. Again, thank you all for joining us today, and I'll now turn the call over to Marty. Marty?"

Turning now to Page 11 of our presentation. Today, we reported third quarter 2017 GAAP earnings of $1.18 per share compared to GAAP earnings of $1.52 per share for the year-ago quarter. Excluding the third quarte",1846,"Thanks, Warren and good morning, everyone. Turning now to Page 11 of our presentation. Today, we reported third quarter 2017 GAAP earnings of $1.18 per share compared to GAAP earnings of $1.52 per share for the year-ago quarter. Excluding the third quarter 2017 non-core noncash charge of $0.06 per share at the parent company for the reevaluation of deferred taxes, Ameren report third quarter core earnings of $1.24 per share. This charge was the result of an increase in Illinois' corporate income tax rate to 9.5%, from 7.75% effective July 1 of this year. Beyond this charge, we did not expect the tax increase to have a material prospective impact on consolidated earnings. 
Finally, as you can see on this page, there was no difference between GAAP and core results for last year's third quarter. 
Turning now to Page 12. On this page, we highlight by segment the key factors that drove the overall $0.28 per share decrease in core earnings. Starting with Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution, third quarter year-over-year earnings decreased to $0.26 per share, driven by a $0.24 per share change in the timing of the interim period revenue recognition resulting from the Future Energy Jobs Act. This act modified the existing formulaic ratemaking by decoupling our distribution revenues from sales volumes. While this change is impacting quarterly comparisons, it will not affect full year earnings. The effects of decoupling also eliminated weather impacts in 2017. As a result, comparable earnings were down $0.02 per share as 2016 results benefited from warmer-than-normal summer temperatures. Finally, Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution third quarter 2017 earnings benefited from increased infrastructure investments as well as a higher allowed return on equity under formulaic ratemaking of 8.7% compared to 8.3% for the year-ago quarter. Next, Ameren Missouri third quarter year-over-year earnings decreased $0.02 per share, reflecting lower electric retail sales, primarily driven by milder summer temperatures. The absence of the 2016 performance incentive award for the 2013 to 2015 energy efficiency plan and higher depreciation expenses. These, and other factors, will mostly offset by new electric service rates effective April 1, which increased earnings of $0.15 per share. The new rates were driven in part by increased infrastructure investments and removal of the negative effect of lower sales to the New Madrid smelter. 
Turning to Ameren Transmission, third quarter year-on-year earnings were comparable. The positive impact of the increased transmission infrastructure investments at ATXI and Ameren Illinois, which both operate under constructive formulaic ratemaking, were offset by a lower average allowed return on equity of 10.8% in 2017 compared to an average of approximately 12.3% in the year-ago quarter. In 2016, our transmission segment benefited from a temporarily higher FERC-related ROE as a result of the exploration of May 2016 of the 15-month refund period for the second MISO ROE complaint case. This temporary benefit ended in September 2016 when the FERC-adjusted MISOs base ROE to its current level. Before moving on, let me briefly cover electric sales trends for Ameren Missouri at Ameren Illinois distribution for the first 9 months of 2017 compared to the first 9 months of 2016. Weather normalized kilowatt-hour sales to Missouri residential and the combined basis were flat, excluding the effect of our Missouri energy efficiency plan under media. We exclude MIA effects because the plan provides a great recovery to ensure that earnings are not affected by reduced electric sales, resulting from a energy efficiency efforts. These sales results were reflect underlying 2017 growth offset by the absence of the 2016 leap day sales benefit. Kilowatt-hour sales to Missouri Industrial customers were also flat, excluding sales to the New Madrid smelter, which shut down operations during the first quarter of 2016. Weather normalized kilowatt-hour sales to Illinois Residential and Commercial customers on a combined basis decreased 1%, primarily driven by energy efficiency, while kilowatt-hour sales to Illinois industrial customers decreased 4%, primarily due to lower sales to a large low margin processor of agricultural products. 
Recall the changes in electric sales in Illinois, no matter the cost, do not impact our earnings since the Future Energy Jobs Act provided full revenue decoupling beginning this year. 
Moving to page 13 of our presentation, I would now like to discuss our 2017 earnings guidance. Today, we narrowed our GAAP guidance range to $2.67 to $2.81 per share, which includes the third quarter noncash tax-related charge of $0.06 per share, which I discussed earlier. Excluding this charge, we expect to lever 2017 core earnings within a range of $2.73 to $2.87 per share, reflecting continued solid execution of our strategy, including continued disciplined cost management. This guidance assumes normal temperatures for the last 3 months of this year. 
Moving to the balance of the year, we list on this page select considerations that will affect the comparability of fourth quarter 2017 core earnings to last year's fourth quarter results. Some of the larger impacts, included change the timing of interim period revenue recognition at Ameren Illinois' Electric Distribution business, the fourth quarter Calloway refueling and maintenance outage, and the 2017 Missouri Electric Rate review settlement. 
Before moving on, I would like to mention that we expect Ameren Illinois to issue long-term debt for the end of the year to repay $250 million of maturing 6.125% senior secured notes and refinance short-term debt. 
Moving now to Page 14, for discussion of select regulatory matters pending at the Illinois Commerce Commission and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Ameren Illinois is supporting a $17 million decrease in the annual electric distribution revenue requirement and its required annual electric distribution rate update filing, consistent with the ICC staff's filed testimony. An ICC decision is expected in December of this year with new rates effective next year. Turning to the FERC, the second complaint case that seeks to reduce the base about ROE for MISO transmission owners, including Ameren Illinois and ATXI, remains spending. This FERC regulated businesses are currently earning a 10.82% ROE, which includes a 50 basis point adder to MISO membership, and they will continue to do so pending the outcome of this case. While a quorum has been reestablished at the FERC, it remains uncertain when the commission will rule. In addition, in September, the MISO transmission owners, including Ameren Illinois and ATXI filed a motion to dismiss the second complaint case maintaining that the current base ROE of 10.32% ordered by FERC in the first complaint case has not been shown to be unjust and unreasonable. Further, the MISO transmission owners believe the second complaint should be dismissed because the approach used by the complainants to argue that the ROE was unjust and unreasonable was rejected by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC circuit in the New England case. The FERC is under no deadline to issue an order on the motion to dismiss. 
Facing a significant backlog of other cases, we expect that the FERC commissioners will take time to consider the court ruling on the New England case as well as the MISO transmission owners result motions, as both may influence the FERC's order in the pending second MISO ROE complaint case. 
Turning now to Page 15 of our presentation, in potential federal income tax reform. Ameren supports thoughtful, comprehensive tax reform because we believe that lower corporate tax rates will drive economic growth and job creation, benefiting our customers, the communities we serve and other key stakeholders. We will continue to advocate for tax reform that would benefit stakeholders and that appropriately supports our industry's efforts to invest in our nation's critical energy infrastructure in an affordable manner. Earlier this year, on our February earnings conference call, we shared with you our perspectives on potential financial considerations and impacts associated with tax reform elements under consideration at that time. As you know, yesterday, Republican leaders in the U.S. House of Representatives released a new comprehensive income tax reform proposal. Ameren, along with our industry colleagues, is still in the process of reviewing this proposal. While the debate on tax reform took another step forward yesterday, the timing and elements of tax reform, if ultimately successful, remain uncertain. We will remain actively engaged with our industry colleagues in this important policy matter in the weeks ahead. That said, regardless of whatever federal income tax law changes may be made, it's important to remember that our operations are fully rate-regulated. We have limited parent company debt and we have a robust pipeline of high-quality investment opportunities that can deliver strong, long-term benefits for customers and shareholders. 
Turning to Page 16. We plan to provide 2018 earnings guidance when we release fourth quarter results in February of next year. However, using our 2017 guidance as a reference point, we have listed on this page select items to consider as you think about our earnings outlook for the next year. Beginning with the first item listed: earnings from our FERC-regulated earnings transmission activities are expected to benefit from additional investments in Ameren Illinois and ATXI projects made under forward-looking formulaic ratemaking. Ameren Transmission earnings would, of course, be affected by any change to the current allowed ROE for 10.82%. For Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution Service, earnings are expected to benefit in 2018 compared to 2017 from additional infrastructure investments made under Illinois' formulaic ratemaking. The allowed ROE will be, of course, the average 2018 30-year treasury yield plus 5.8%. In addition, the Ameren Illinois' gas distribution earnings are expected to benefit from qualified investments that are included in rates on a timely basis under the state's gas infrastructure writer. For Missouri, the 2018 earnings comparison is expected to be favorably affected in the first quarter of next year by increased Missouri Electric Service rates that took effect April 1 of 2017. In addition, we expect the absence of expenses associated with our fourth quarter 2017 Callaway nuclear refueling and maintenance outage to benefit 2018 earnings by approximately $0.08 per share compared to 2017. The next scheduled Callaway refueling and maintenance outages is in the spring of 2019. 
Further, a return to normal weather in 2018 would increase Ameren Missouri earnings by approximately $0.06 per share compared to 2017 results to date, assuming normal weather in the last quarter of this year and we expect lower interest expense, driven by the refinancing of debt in 2017 and 2018 to favorably impact 2018 results. 
Finally, we expect Ameren Missouri's 2018 results to also reflect regulatory lag associated with increased depreciation, transmission and property tax expenses. 
Turning to Page 17, I will summarize. We expect to deliver 2017 core earnings within a range of $2.73 to $2.87 per share as we continue to successfully execute our strategy. As Warner stated, as we look ahead, we continue to expect strong earnings per share growth, driven by strong rate-based growth and discipline financial management. And Ameren shares continue to offer investors an attractive yield based on our recently increased dividend. In total, we believe we offer investors an attractive total return story compared to our regulated utility peers. That concludes our prepared remarks, and we now invite your questions."

Just, overall, we talked about for Missouri, weather normalized, kilowatt-hour sales for residential and commercial were about flat, excluding the impact of our energy efficiency programs, we've seen little bit of growth there offset by we have the leap day benefit last year, so overall, flat there. Also in the industrial class in Missouri is pretty flat as well. Over in the Illinois area, the weather normalized, kilowatt-hour sales for residential and commercial is actually down about 1%. As you know, we increased the energy efficiency efforts this year and I think that's being reflected in those lower sales. And then in Illinois Industrial was down about 4%. As we noted on the call, it certainly important to remember that in our Illinois Service territory, we're fully decoupled today, based on the passage of the law of last December where we're all increased our energy efficiency effort, we also had decoupling associated with that. So those sales declines are not affecting that bottom line results."

About 0.5% in residential and almost 1% in commercial, so we're seeing a little bit of growth there. And we look at the economies, of course, as you know this morning, I think nationally, the unemployment number came out of 4.1%. We've been staying a little actually south of that, a little better than that in Missouri, unemployment at 4% and, who knows, maybe a little bit less given the announcement today that nationally it moved down. And Illinois, unfortunately, has been a little higher, closer to 5%. But overall I would say the unemployment, it's followed national trends and I would say over all the economies in both states are fairly stable."

If you look at on Slide 16, I think that you'll see that we gave a number of important drivers to think about as you think about 2018. And probably, we're not going to go much beyond that.

But I think we've given you some really good specificity to hook into. Obviously we've got this increased investment in Ameren transmission, the rate base is clearly expected to go up next year from $2.5 billion to $2.9 billion next year. Andy, if you know a little uncertainty around the ROE will be next year, right now, we're earning 10.8 and then we'll see when the FERC rules of this with an complaint case and how they rule. And we've got higher rate base expected next year at Ameren Illinois Electric, which is subject to formulaic ratemaking. The 30-year treasuries did rise over the course of this year, we'll see what happens over the next year. Gas distribution business, while we don't have a rate case next year, we do get to formulaicly adjust rates based on a writer there, I shouldn't say formulaicly, we get to adjust rates based on the writer there for infrastructure investments, 50% of our CapEx qualifies for this adjustment, so that's a boost. And then we do get a little carryover next year from a rate increase that went into effect in Missouri this year in April, so we'll pick up first quarter benefit next year which we quantified on Slide 16. Just note Callaway refueling outage is next year, that's, of course, $0.08. We've had some negative weather this year, we've ghad about a $0.06 headwind from weather this year. We -- if we erase that next year and go through normal that's around $0.06 pickup. And then, as you mentioned there's some other things, pluses and minuses we expect lower interest. We talked about that on the last call, if any refinancing that we did this year provide about a $15 million annual tailwind as it relates to earnings. Paul Ridzon asked earlier about some refinancings next year. I think the exact amount for next year is something like $380 million of Missouri refinancings. I didn't provide what we expect to be the coupon on the new debt but with respect to the coupon from the debt, we're replacing, it's, in on one case, 5.1%, another case, 6% so we'll be refinancing that or whatever the prevailing rates are at the time. And then as you noted, there are always some headwinds that would be associated with some depreciation and would expect transmission and property tax headwinds as well. So we provided, I think, a pretty comprehensive list of major earnings drivers for 2018."

As Warner said in his prepared remarks, thinking about the credit metrics, credit ratings as a parent company, at the holding company is to consolidated equity ratios, the cash flow metrics and how best to position, I would say these incremental investments too for regulatory recovery and make those additive to shareholder value. So we'll take all of those factors into consideration at that think about the best path forward for financing those. Clearly, as I think you mentioned in the -- in your question, given the $10.8 billion current infrastructure investment plan that we've laid out earlier this year, given the strength of our balance sheet and credit metrics, we didn't expect to need any equity as it related to financing that plan."

As we said on the call, we've made filings to suggest that, that second complaint case should be dismissed for the reasons we discussed on the call and it's uncertain when the FERC, even though they've got a quorum now, we'll rule on the second complaint case. So until that time that they do rule, and until such time as they would tell us to change the ROE, we'll continue to book to a 10.8.

This year-over-year decline of $0.28 per share was largely driven by a $0.24 per share change and the timing of interim period revenue ignition at Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution, a matter which we highlighted earlier this year. This $0.24 timing-related decline in third quarter earnings will have no effect on full year earnings due to increases in revenue recognition in the first, second and fourth quarters this year compared to last. Marty will discuss this and other factors driving the quarterly results in more detail in a moment. 
I'm also pleased to report that we remain on track to redeliver strong core earnings results in 2017. This morning, we announced that we narrowed our 2017 core earnings guidance to a range of $2.73 to $2.87 per share. 
Moving to Page 5. Here, we reiterate our strategic plan, which we have been executing very well over the last several years. We remain focused on operating our businesses safely while strategically allocating capital and continuing to exercise disciplined cost management. We expect this strategic capital allocation, along with disciplined cost management that supports our goal of earnings close to our allowed returns in all of our jurisdictions to result in solid long-term earnings growth. I'm happy to report that in 2017, we have been successfully executing these key strategic actions across all of our businesses. 
As you can see on the right side of this page, during the first 9 months of this year, we invested nearly $1 billion, or 2/3 of total capital expenditures, in our transmission and distribution businesses, where investments are supported by regulatory frameworks that provide fair, predictable and timely cost recovery. 
Since our second quarter call, we achieved a couple of key milestones on the 100-mile Mark Twain transmission line in northeastern Missouri. To begin, ATXI's proposed alternative route for this project, which is nearly 100% colocated on existing rights-of-way, has received all 5 required county ascends for road crossings. This was an important accomplishment that required extensive collaboration with many key stakeholders. As a result of achieving this important milestone, in mid-September, ATXI requested a certificate of convenience and necessity for the Mark Twain alternative route from the Missouri Public Service Commission, and we expect to receive a commission order in the first half of next year. There has been no change to the estimated $250 million project cost, and the planned and service date remains late 2019. 
Turning now to Page 6. We also continued to invest in Ameren Illinois Electric and Natural Gas Distribution infrastructure projects. Through the end of September, Ameren Illinois had installed 560,000 smart electric meters and 290,000 gas meter modules that provide customers with enhanced energy usage data and access to programs to help them save on their energy bills. We are working to deploy these meters to all of our 1.2 million electric and 800,000 gas customers in Illinois by the end of 2019. Additional investments include natural gas distribution projects that upgrade our gas main infrastructure, and electric distribution projects that add smart grid technology and upgrade substations, all to improve the safety and reliability of our system.
Moving to Ameren Missouri. As you know, earlier this year, we achieved a constructive settlement in our electric rate view which favorably impacted our third quarter results. From an operational perspective, the Callaway Energy Center began its scheduled refueling and maintenance outage in early October after completing a breaker-to-breaker run of 514 consecutive days, the second longest run in Callaway's history. The outage is progressing safety, on schedule and on budget. 
Shifting now to our legislative efforts in Missouri, we remain very focused on enhancing Missouri's regulatory framework to better support investment and its energy infrastructure. The growing body of evidence from across the country clearly shows that these modernized energy policies deliver significant long-term benefits to customers. Those benefits include a more reliable and smarter energy grid, a more secured grid to address potential cyber attacks and greater tools for customers to manage their energy usage. 
During the 2017 legislative session, we presented a thoughtful and robust energy infrastructure plan that included an incremental $1 billion in investment over 5 years, and up to $4 billion over 10 years. Of course, these investments will also create thousands of good-quality jobs in the state of Missouri. The proposed legislation also included other strong economic development provisions and consumer protections to keep our already low electric rates affordable and competitive in the future. These factors have resulted in strong bipartisan support in the legislature to modernize Missouri's regulatory framework. As a result, we are leveraging the meaningful progress we have made over the last several legislative sessions and continue to work collaboratively with key stakeholders to chart a constructive path forward for our customers and the state of Missouri. And as we noted earlier this year, we expect to support a legislative initiative in 2018 to modernize Missouri's regulatory framework for electric utilities. Legislation can be filed as early as December 1, with the 2018 session officially beginning January 3 next year. 
Turning to Page 7, in Missouri's Integrated Resource Plan. In late September, Ameren Missouri filed a new IRP with Missouri PSC, which it does every 3 years. This document details our assessment of the electric energy needs of our customers for the next 20 years and puts forward our preferred resource plan for meeting those needs. The 2017 IRP is consistent with our objective to transition our generation fleet to a cleaner, more diverse energy portfolio in a responsible fashion. Further, the IRP outlines a significant step change in our renewable energy portfolio due to the advancement of technologies and improved economics. Importantly, the IRP is consistent with the requirements of Missouri's renewable energy standard, which requires Ameren Missouri to source at least 15% of retail customer sales for renewable energy resources by 2021, subject to a 1% average annual limit on customer rate impacts. Our preferred plan calls for the addition of at least 700 megawatts of wind generation by 2020 and 100 megawatts of solar generation by 2027. After careful assessment, we believe it is in our customers' long-term best interest for Ameren Missouri to own these new wind resources, which represents a potential investment of approximately $1 billion. We have been working on this important undertaking for many months, but we still have more work in front of us to successfully execute our preferred plan. We're still completing due diligence on certain matters and are in negotiations with several developers, which will ultimately determine the source, location and cost for these projects. We also recognize that the comprehensive tax reform proposal released yesterday, included revisions to the current production tax credit rules for wind generation. We expect that the proposed changes to the PTC rules will be the subject of much discussion by policymakers and key stakeholders over the next several weeks. While it remains uncertain whether these potential modifications to the PTC rules will become law as well as tax reform in general, we will, of course, assess the potential implications of these changes on our plan, if any. 
Ownership will also require Ameren Missouri to secure certificates of need from the Missouri PSC for each location as well as regional transmission organization interconnection agreements. We are excited about the customer and environmental benefits as well as the potential significant investment and growth opportunities outlined in our preferred plan. As you know, we are very strategic when it comes to managing and financing our capital plan in order to deliver long-term benefits for our customers and shareholders. As a result, we will carefully assess our prospective infrastructure investment plans in the context of this potential $1 billion wind investment. Our current infrastructure investment plan does not include any expenditures for renewable energy. 
We will also carefully consider the best long-term financing plan for this potential investment. Of course, we remain committed to maintaining strong equity ratios and credit metrics at our utilities and on a consolidated basis. We will also assess the best approach to recover the cost of and return on these potential investments in the Missouri's regulatory framework. One tool is a cost recovery mechanism that is already included in the Missouri renewable energy standard. It is a writer mechanism that is specifically designed to address the revenue requirement impacts resulting from complying with renewable energy standard. The use of this writer mechanism would require approval by the Missouri PSC. It's premature to go into more detail on all of these matters at this time. However, we plan to provide further updates to you during our year-end conference call in February 2018. 
Before I move up to the subject, I would also note that Ameren Missouri has established CO2 emission reduction goals from its generation fleet by 35% by 2030, 50% by 2040 and 80% by 2050. 
In summary, our Integrated Resource Plan is a forward-thinking plan that is a win-win-win for our customers, the environment and our shareholders. Rest assured, we are very focused on executing this important opportunity for all of our stakeholders. 
Turning now to Page 8 in the current 5-year plan. In February, we outlined our investment plan that included $10.8 billion of regulated infrastructure investment as well as 6% compound annual rate-based growth from 2016 through 2021, reflecting greater levels of capital allocated to those jurisdictions with more constructive regulatory frameworks. To be clear, this plan does not include the potential $1 billion investment in wind generation outlined in Missouri's IRP that I just discussed. It also does not include potential additional investments, $1 billion over 5 years, and up to $4 billion over 10 years that could be enabled by constructive Missouri legislation. As we look to the future, the successful execution of our robust 5-year plan is not only focused on delivering strong results through 2021, this is also designed to position Ameren for success over the next decade and beyond. With this long-term view in mind, we are already making significant investments in our Illinois electric and gas utilities that will position us for success, including those in smart meters, digital technologies and other infrastructure due to supportive regulatory frameworks. And as we have mentioned, we have identified similar significant Missouri grid modernization investments we would undertake with improvement in the Missouri regulatory framework. The bottom line is that we are taking steps today across the board to position Ameren for success in the next decade and beyond, and we believe we have a strong, high-quality and sustainable pipeline of investment opportunities that would benefit customers, communities we serve and shareholders. 
Turning now to Page 9 to conclude my remarks. In February, we affirmed our expectation for earnings per share growth of 5% to 8% compounded annually from 2016 to 2020 based on the adjusted 2016 guidance midpoint we outlined early last year. This was driven by robust 6% compound annual rate-based growth from 2016 through 2021. We consider both our rate base and earnings growth outlooks to be attractive compared to our regulated utility peers. 
Ameren also continues to offer investors a solid dividend. Last month, Ameren's Board of Directors expressed its confidence on our long-term growth plan by increasing the dividend by 4%. Of course, future dividend decisions will be driven by earnings growth, cash flows and other business conditions. 
To summarize, we believe our strong rate base and earnings growth profile, combined with our solid dividend currently providing a yield of approximately 3%, results in an attractive total return opportunity for shareholders compared to our regulated utility peers. We remain focused on executing our strategy, and I am firmly convinced that doing so will deliver superior value to our shareholders, customers and the communities we serve. 
Again, thank you all for joining us today, and I'll now turn the call over to Marty. Marty?"
373264,539607899,1332741,"Ameren Corporation, Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2017",2017-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Ameren Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Warner, and good morning, everyone.  Turning now to Page 11 of our presentation. Today, we reported third quarter 2017 GAAP earnings of $1.18 per share compared to GAAP earnings of $1.52 per share for the year-ago quarter. Excluding the third qu",1848,"Thanks, Warner, and good morning, everyone.  Turning now to Page 11 of our presentation. 
Today, we reported third quarter 2017 GAAP earnings of $1.18 per share compared to GAAP earnings of $1.52 per share for the year-ago quarter. Excluding the third quarter 2017 noncore, noncash charge of $0.06 per share at the parent company for the reevaluation of deferred taxes, Ameren reported third quarter core earnings of $1.24 per share. This charge was the result of an increase in Illinois' corporate income tax rate to 9.5% from 7.75% effective July 1 of this year. Beyond this charge, we did not expect the tax increase to have a material prospective impact on consolidated earnings. 
Finally, as you can see on this page, there was no difference between GAAP and core results for last year's third quarter. 
Turning now to Page 12. 
On this page, we highlight by segment the key factors that drove the overall $0.28 per share decrease in core earnings. Starting with Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution, third quarter year-over-year earnings decreased $0.26 per share, driven by a $0.24 per share change in the timing of the interim period revenue recognition resulting from the Future Energy Jobs Act. This act modified the existing formulaic ratemaking by decoupling our distribution revenues from sales volumes. While this change is impacting quarterly comparisons, it will not affect full year earnings. The effects of decoupling also eliminated weather impacts in 2017. As a result, comparable earnings were down $0.02 per share as 2016 results benefited from warmer-than-normal summer temperatures. Finally, Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution third quarter 2017 earnings benefited from increased infrastructure investments as well as the higher allowed return on equity under formulaic ratemaking of 8.7% compared to 8.3% for the year-ago quarter. 
Next, Ameren Missouri third quarter year-over-year earnings decreased $0.02 per share, reflecting lower electric retail sales, primarily driven by milder summer temperatures, the absence of the 2016 performance incentive award for the 2013 to 2015 energy efficiency plan and higher depreciation expenses. These and other factors were mostly offset by new electric service rates effective April 1, which increased earnings $0.15 per share. The new rates were driven in part by increased infrastructure investments and removal of the negative effect of lower sales to the New Madrid smelter. 
Turning to Ameren Transmission, third quarter year-on-year earnings were comparable. The positive impact of increased transmission infrastructure investments at ATXI and Ameren Illinois, which both operate under constructive formulaic ratemaking, were offset by a lower average allowed return on equity of 10.8% in 2017 compared to an average of approximately 12.3% in the year-ago quarter. In 2016, our transmission segment benefited from a temporarily higher FERC-allowed ROE as a result of the expiration in May 2016 of the 15-month refund period for the second MISO ROE complaint case. This temporary benefit ended in September 2016 when the FERC-adjusted MISOs base ROE to its current level. 
Before moving on, let me briefly cover electric sales trends for Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois distribution for the first 9 months of 2017 compared to the first 9 months of 2016. Weather normalized kilowatt-hour sales to Missouri residential and commercial customers on a combined basis were flat, excluding the effects of our Missouri energy efficiency plan under MIA. We exclude MIA effects because the plan provides rate recovery to ensure that earnings are not affected by reduced electric sales, resulting from our energy efficiency efforts. These sales results reflect underlying 2017 growth offset by the absence of the 2016 leap day sales benefit. Kilowatt-hour sales to Missouri Industrial customers were also flat, excluding sales to the New Madrid smelter, which shut down operations during the first quarter of 2016. Weather normalized kilowatt-hour sales to Illinois Residential and Commercial customers on a combined basis decreased 1%, primarily driven by energy efficiency, while kilowatt-hour sales to Illinois industrial customers decreased 4%, primarily due to lower sales to a large, low margin processor of agricultural products. 
Recall the changes in electric sales in Illinois, no matter the cost, do not impact our earnings since the Future Energy Jobs Act provided full revenue decoupling beginning this year. 
Moving to Page 13 of our presentation, I would now like to discuss our 2017 earnings guidance. Today, we narrowed our GAAP guidance range to $2.67 to $2.81 per share, which includes the third quarter noncash tax-related charge of $0.06 per share, which I discussed earlier. Excluding this charge, we expect to deliver 2017 core earnings within a range of $2.73 to $2.87 per share, reflecting continued solid execution of our strategy, including continued disciplined cost management. This guidance assumes normal temperatures for the last 3 months of this year. 
Moving to the balance of the year, we list on this page select considerations that will affect the comparability of fourth quarter 2017 core earnings to last year's fourth quarter results. Some of the larger impacts include a change in the timing of interim period revenue recognition at Ameren Illinois' Electric Distribution business, the fourth quarter Callaway refueling and maintenance outage, and the 2017 Missouri Electric rate review settlement. 
Before moving on, I would like to mention that we expect Ameren Illinois to issue long-term debt before the end of the year to repay $250 million of maturing 6.125% senior secured notes and refinance short-term debt. 
Moving now to Page 14 for a discussion of select regulatory matters pending at the Illinois Commerce Commission and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. 
Ameren Illinois is supporting a $17 million decrease in the annual electric distribution revenue requirement in its required annual electric distribution rate update filing, consistent with the ICC staff's filed testimony. An ICC decision is expected in December of this year with new rates effective early next year. 
Turning to the FERC, the second complaint case that seeks to reduce the base allowed ROE for MISO transmission owners, including Ameren Illinois and ATXI, remains pending. These FERC-regulated businesses are currently earning a 10.82% ROE, which includes a 50 basis point adder for MISO membership, and they will continue to do so pending the outcome of this case. While a quorum has been reestablished at the FERC, it remains uncertain when the commission will rule. In addition, in September, the MISO transmission owners, including Ameren Illinois and ATXI, filed a motion to dismiss the second complaint case maintaining that the current base ROE of 10.32% ordered by FERC in the first complaint case has not been shown to be unjust and unreasonable. Further, the MISO transmission owners believe the second complaint should be dismissed because the approach used by the complainants to argue that the ROE was unjust and unreasonable was rejected by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC circuit in the New England case. The FERC is under no deadline to issue an order on the motion to dismiss. 
Facing a significant backlog of other cases, we expect that the FERC commissioners will take time to consider the court ruling in the New England case as well as the MISO transmission owners recent motion as both may influence the FERC's order in the pending second MISO ROE complaint case. 
Turning now to Page 15 of our presentation, in potential federal income tax reform. Ameren supports thoughtful, comprehensive tax reform because we believe that lower corporate tax rates would drive economic growth and job creation, benefiting our customers, the communities we serve and other key stakeholders. We will continue to advocate for tax reform that would benefit stakeholders and that appropriately supports our industry's efforts to invest in our nation's critical energy infrastructure in an affordable manner. Earlier this year on our February earnings conference call, we shared with you our perspectives on potential financial considerations and impacts associated with tax reform elements under consideration at that time. As you know, yesterday, Republican leaders in the U.S. House of Representatives released a new comprehensive income tax reform proposal. Ameren, along with our industry colleagues, is still in the process of reviewing this proposal. While the debate on tax reform took another step forward yesterday, the timing and elements of tax reform, if ultimately successful, remain uncertain. We will remain actively engaged with our industry colleagues on this important policy matter in the weeks ahead. 
That said, regardless of whatever federal income tax law changes may be made, it is important to remember that our operations are fully rate-regulated, we have limited parent company debt and we have a robust pipeline of high-quality investment opportunities that can deliver strong, long-term benefits for our customers and shareholders. 
Turning to Page 16. We plan to provide 2018 earnings guidance when we release fourth quarter results in February of next year. However, using our 2017 guidance as a reference point, we have listed on this page select items to consider as you think about our earnings outlook for next year. Beginning with the first item listed: Earnings from our FERC-regulated electric earnings transmission activities are expected to benefit from additional investments in Ameren Illinois and ATXI projects made under forward-looking formulaic ratemaking. Ameren Transmission earnings would, of course, be affected by any change to the current allowed ROE of 10.82%. For Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution Service, earnings are expected to benefit in 2018 compared to 2017 from additional infrastructure investments made under Illinois' formulaic ratemaking. The allowed ROE will be, of course, the average 2018 30-year treasury yield plus 5.8%. In addition, Ameren Illinois' gas distribution earnings are expected to benefit from qualified investments that are included in rates on a timely basis under the state's gas infrastructure writer. For Missouri, the 2018 earnings comparison is expected to be favorably affected in the first quarter of next year by increased Missouri Electric Service rates that took effect April 1 of 2017. In addition, we expect the absence of expenses associated with our fourth quarter 2017 Callaway nuclear refueling and maintenance outage to benefit 2018 earnings by approximately $0.08 per share compared to 2017. The next scheduled Callaway refueling and maintenance outage is in the spring of 2019. 
Further, a return to normal weather in 2018 would increase Ameren Missouri earnings by approximately $0.06 per share compared to 2017 results to date, assuming normal weather in the last quarter of this year and we expect lower interest expense driven by the refinancing of debt in 2017 and 2018 to favorably impact 2018 results. 
Finally, we expect Ameren Missouri's 2018 results to also reflect regulatory lag associated with increased depreciation, transmission and property tax expenses. 
Turning to Page 17, I will summarize. We expect to deliver 2017 core earnings within a range of $2.73 to $2.87 per share as we continue to successfully execute our strategy. As Warner stated, as we look ahead, we continue to expect strong earnings per share growth, driven by strong rate-based growth and disciplined financial management. And Ameren's shares continue to offer investors an attractive yield based on our recently increased dividend. 
In total, we believe we offer investors an attractive total return story compared to our regulated utility peers. That concludes our prepared remarks, and we now invite your questions."

Also industrial class in Missouri is pretty flat as well. Over in the Illinois area, the weather normalized kilowatt-hour sales for residential and commercial is actually down about 1%. As you know, we increased the energy efficiency efforts this year, and I think that's being reflected in those lower sales. And then Illinois Industrial was down about 4%. As we noted on the call, it's certainly important to remember that in our Illinois service territory, we're fully decoupled today, based on the passage of the law of last December where we all increased our energy efficiency effort, we also had decoupling associated with that. So those sales declines are not affecting the bottom line results."

We've been staying a little actually south of that, a little better than that in Missouri; unemployment at 4%, and who knows, maybe a little bit less given the announcement today that, nationally, it moved down. And Illinois, unfortunately, has been a little higher, closer to 5%.

But I think we've given you some really good specificity to hook into. Obviously, we've got this increased investment in Ameren Transmission, the rate base is clearly expected to go up next year from $2.5 billion to $2.9 billion next year, Andy. As you know a little uncertainty around what the ROE will be next year. Right now, we're earning 10.8 and we'll see when the FERC rules on the second complaint case and how they rule. And we've got higher rate base expected next year at Ameren Illinois Electric, which is subject to formulaic ratemaking. The 30-year treasuries did rise over the course of this year. We'll see what happens over next year. Gas distribution business. While we don't have a rate case next year, we do get to formulaicly adjust rates based on a writer there. I shouldn't say formulaicly, but we get to adjust rates based on a writer there for infrastructure investments. About 50% of our CapEx qualifies for those adjustments, so that's a boost. And then we do get a little carryover next year from the rate increase that went into effect in Missouri this year in April. So we'll pick up a first quarter benefit next year, which we've quantified on Slide 16. There's no Callaway refueling outage next year. That's, of course, $0.08. We've had some negative weather this year. We've had about a $0.06 headwind from weather this year. We -- if we erase that next year and go to normal, that's another $0.06 pickup. And then as you mentioned, there's some other things, pluses and minuses. We expect lower interest. We talked about that on the last call. Refinancings that we did this year provide about a $15 million annual tailwind as it relates to earnings. Paul Ridzon asked earlier about some refinancings next year. I think the exact amount for next year is something like $380 million of Missouri refinancings. I didn't provide what we expect to be the coupon on the new debt but with respect to the coupons on the debt we're replacing, it's, in on one case, 5.1%, in another case, 6%. So we'll be refinancing that at whatever the prevailing rates are at the time. And then as you noted, there are always some headwinds that would be associated with some depreciation and would expect transmission and property tax headwinds as well. So we've provided, I think, a pretty comprehensive list of major earnings drivers for 2018."

I think that's it's not a clear bright line that I'd tell you, Kevin. I mean, I think what we'll do with whether we have additional CapEx due to the Integrated Resource Plan or we have an additional CapEx due to other legislative efforts or other factors, we'll take a look -- we'll step back and we'll take a look at the overall infrastructure investment plan. We'll take -- we'll step back and we'll take a look at the overall cash flows associated with the business and then assess the best way forward to finance that. As Warner said in his prepared remarks, thinking about the credit metrics, credit ratings at the parent company, at the holding company, the consolidated equity ratios, the cash flow metrics and how best to position, I would say, these incremental investments, too, for regulatory recovery and make those additive to shareholder value. So we'll take all of those factors into consideration and then think about the best path forward for financing those. Clearly, as I think you mentioned in the -- in your question, given the $10.8 billion current infrastructure investment plan that we've laid out earlier this year, given the strength of our balance sheet and credit metrics, we didn't expect to need any equity as it related to financing that plan."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. 
Before I begin my business update, I first want to express my deep appreciation to our coworkers and contractors who volunteered to leave their families to work tirelessly in very challenging conditions to restore power for those who experienced outages due to hurricanes impacting Texas and Florida. I'm particularly thankful that all of our coworkers returned home safely. The restoration efforts for hurricanes Harvey and Irma were just another example of the incredible teamwork and commitment to our customers that is so often displayed by our industry. Further, Ameren and our industry stand ready to support Puerto Rico in its hurricane restoration efforts. Our thoughts and prayers remain with those families who lost loved ones, their homes or were otherwise impacted by these devastating storms. 
Moving to our financial results, earlier today we announced third quarter 2017 core earnings of $1.24 per share compared to $1.52 per share earned in the third quarter of 2016. This year-over-year decline of $0.28 per share was largely driven by a $0.24 per share change and the timing of interim period revenue recognition at Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution, a matter which we highlighted earlier this year. This $0.24 timing-related decline in third quarter earnings will have no effect on full year earnings due to increases in revenue recognition in the first, second and fourth quarters this year compared to last. Marty will discuss this and other factors driving the quarterly results in more detail in a moment. 
I am also pleased to report that we remain on track to deliver strong core earnings results in 2017. This morning, we announced that we narrowed our 2017 core earnings guidance to a range of $2.73 to $2.87 per share. 
Moving to Page 5. Here, we reiterate our strategic plan, which we have been executing very well over the last several years. We remain focused on operating our businesses safely while strategically allocating capital and continuing to exercise disciplined cost management. We expect this strategic capital allocation, along with disciplined cost management that supports our goal of earning close to our allowed returns in all of our jurisdictions to result in solid long-term earnings growth. I am happy to report that in 2017, we have been successfully executing these key strategic actions across all of our businesses. 
As you can see on the right side of this page, during the first 9 months of this year, we invested nearly $1 billion, or 2/3 of total capital expenditures, in our transmission and distribution businesses, where investments are supported by regulatory frameworks that provide fair, predictable and timely cost recovery. 
Since our second quarter call, we achieved a couple of key milestones in the 100-mile Mark Twain transmission line in northeastern Missouri. To begin, ATXI's proposed alternative route for this project, which is nearly 100% colocated on existing rights-of-way, has received all 5 required county assents for road crossings. This was an important accomplishment that required extensive collaboration with many key stakeholders. As a result of achieving this important milestone, in mid-September, ATXI requested a certificate of convenience and necessity for the Mark Twain alternative route from the Missouri Public Service Commission, and we expect to receive a commission order in the first half of next year. There has been no change to the estimated $250 million project cost, and the planned in-service date remains late 2019. 
Turning now to Page 6. We also continued to invest in Ameren Illinois Electric and Natural Gas Distribution infrastructure projects. Through the end of September, Ameren Illinois had installed 560,000 smart electric meters and 290,000 gas meter modules that provide customers with enhanced energy usage data and access to programs to help them save on their energy bills. We are working to deploy these meters to all of our 1.2 million electric and 800,000 gas customers in Illinois by the end of 2019. Additional investments include natural gas distribution projects that upgrade our gas main infrastructure, and electric distribution projects that add smart grid technology and upgrade substations, all to improve the safety and reliability of our system.
Moving to Ameren Missouri. As you know, earlier this year, we achieved a constructive settlement in our electric rate view, which favorably impacted our third quarter results. From an operational perspective, the Callaway Energy Center began its scheduled refueling and maintenance outage in early October after completing a breaker-to-breaker run of 514 consecutive days, the second longest run in Callaway's history. The outage is progressing safety, on schedule and on budget. 
Shifting now to our legislative efforts in Missouri, we remain very focused on enhancing Missouri's regulatory framework to better support investment and its energy infrastructure. The growing body of evidence from across the country clearly shows that these modernized energy policies deliver significant long-term benefits to customers. Those benefits include a more reliable and smarter energy grid, a more secured grid to address potential cyber attacks and greater tools for customers to manage their energy usage. 
During the 2017 legislative session, we presented a thoughtful and robust energy infrastructure plan that included an incremental $1 billion in investment over 5 years and up to $4 billion over 10 years. Of course, these investments will also create thousands of good-quality jobs in the state of Missouri. The proposed legislation also included other strong economic development provisions and consumer protections to keep our already low electric rates affordable and competitive in the future. These factors have resulted in strong bipartisan support in the legislature to modernize Missouri's regulatory framework. As a result, we are leveraging the meaningful progress we have made over the last several legislative sessions and continue to work collaboratively with key stakeholders to chart a constructive path forward for our customers and the state of Missouri. And as we noted earlier this year, we expect to support a legislative initiative in 2018 to modernize Missouri's regulatory framework for electric utilities. Legislation can be filed as early as December 1, with the 2018 session officially beginning January 3 next year. 
Turning to Page 7 and Missouri's Integrated Resource Plan. In late September, Ameren Missouri filed a new IRP with the Missouri PSC, which it does every 3 years. This document details our assessment of the electric energy needs of our customers for the next 20 years and puts forward our preferred resource plan for meeting those needs. The 2017 IRP is consistent with our objective to transition our generation fleet to a cleaner, more diverse energy portfolio in a responsible fashion. Further, the IRP outlines a significant step change in our renewable energy portfolio due to the advancement of technologies and improved economics. Importantly, the IRP is consistent with the requirements of Missouri's renewable energy standard, which requires Ameren Missouri to source at least 15% of retail customer sales from renewable energy resources by 2021, subject to a 1% average annual limit on customer rate impacts. Our preferred plan calls for the addition of at least 700 megawatts of wind generation by 2020 and 100 megawatts of solar generation by 2027. After careful assessment, we believe it is in our customers' long-term best interest for Ameren Missouri to own these new wind resources, which represents a potential investment of approximately $1 billion. We have been working on this important undertaking for many months, but we still have more work in front of us to successfully execute our preferred plan. We are still completing due diligence on certain matters and are in negotiations with several developers, which will ultimately determine the source, location and cost for these projects. We also recognize that the comprehensive tax reform proposal, released yesterday, included revisions to the current production tax credit rules for wind generation. We expect that the proposed changes to the PTC rules will be the subject of much discussion by policymakers and key stakeholders over the next several weeks. While it remains uncertain whether these potential modifications to the PTC rules will become law as well as tax reform in general, we will, of course, assess the potential implications of these changes on our plan, if any. 
Ownership will also require Ameren Missouri to secure certificates of need from the Missouri PSC for each location as well as regional transmission organization interconnection agreements. We are excited about the customer and environmental benefits as well as the potential significant investment and growth opportunities outlined in our preferred plan. As you know, we are very strategic when it comes to managing and financing our capital plan in order to deliver long-term benefits for our customers and shareholders. As a result, we will carefully assess our prospective infrastructure investment plans in the context of this potential $1 billion wind investment. Our current infrastructure investment plan does not include any expenditures for renewable energy. 
We will also carefully consider the best long-term financing plan for this potential investment. Of course, we remain committed to maintaining strong equity ratios and credit metrics at our utilities and on a consolidated basis. We will also assess the best approach to recover the cost of and return on these potential investments under Missouri's regulatory framework. One tool is a cost recovery mechanism that is already included in the Missouri renewable energy standard. It is a rider mechanism that is specifically designed to address the revenue requirement impacts resulting from complying with the renewable energy standard. The use of this rider mechanism would require approval by the Missouri PSC. It is premature to go into more detail on all of these matters at this time. However, we plan to provide further updates to you during our year-end conference call in February 2018. 
Before I move off this subject, I would also note that Ameren Missouri has established CO2 emission reduction goals from its generation fleet of 35% by 2030, 50% by 2040 and 80% by 2050. 
In summary, our Integrated Resource Plan is a forward-thinking plan that is a win-win-win for customers, the environment and our shareholders. Rest assured, we are very focused on executing this important opportunity for all of our stakeholders. 
Turning now to Page 8 and the current 5-year plan. In February, we outlined our investment plan that included $10.8 billion of regulated infrastructure investment as well as 6% compound annual rate-based growth from 2016 through 2021, reflecting greater levels of capital allocated to those jurisdictions with more constructive regulatory frameworks. To be clear, this plan does not include the potential $1 billion investment in wind generation outlined in Missouri's IRP that I just discussed. It also does not include potential additional investments, $1 billion over 5 years and up to $4 billion over 10 years, that could be enabled by constructive Missouri legislation. As we look to the future, the successful execution of our robust 5-year plan is not only focused on delivering strong results through 2021, it is also designed to position Ameren for success over the next decade and beyond. With this long-term view in mind, we are already making significant investments in our Illinois electric and gas utilities that will position us for success, including those in smart meters, digital technologies and other infrastructure due to supportive regulatory frameworks. And as we have mentioned, we have identified similar significant Missouri grid modernization investments we would undertake with improvement in the Missouri regulatory framework. The bottom line is that we are taking steps today across the board to position Ameren for success in the next decade and beyond, and we believe we have a strong, high-quality and sustainable pipeline of investment opportunities that would benefit customers, communities we serve and shareholders. 
Turning now to Page 9 to conclude my remarks. In February, we affirmed our expectation for earnings per share growth of 5% to 8% compounded annually from 2016 to 2020 based on the adjusted 2016 guidance midpoint we outlined early last year. This was driven by robust 6% compound annual rate-based growth from 2016 through 2021. We consider both our rate base and earnings growth outlooks to be attractive compared to our regulated utility peers. 
Ameren also continues to offer investors a solid dividend. Last month, Ameren's Board of Directors expressed its confidence in our long-term growth plan by increasing the dividend by 4%. Of course, future dividend decisions will be driven by earnings growth, cash flows and other business conditions. 
To summarize, we believe our strong rate base and earnings growth profile, combined with our solid dividend, currently providing a yield of approximately 3%, results in an attractive total return opportunity for shareholders compared to our regulated utility peers. We remain focused on executing our strategy, and I am firmly convinced that doing so will deliver superior value to our shareholders, customers and the communities we serve. 
Again, thank you all for joining us today, and I'll now turn the call over to Marty. Marty?"

Excluding a third quar",1847,"Thanks, Warner, and good morning, everyone.  Turning now to Page 11 of our presentation. 
Today, we reported third quarter 2017 GAAP earnings of $1.18 per share compared to GAAP earnings of $1.52 per share for the year-ago quarter. Excluding a third quarter 2017 noncore, noncash charge of $0.06 per share at the parent company for the reevaluation of deferred taxes, Ameren reported third quarter core earnings of $1.24 per share. This charge was the result of an increase in Illinois' corporate income tax rate to 9.5% from 7.75% effective July 1 of this year. Beyond this charge, we do not expect the tax increase to have a material prospective impact on consolidated earnings. 
Finally, as you can see on this page, there was no difference between GAAP and core results for last year's third quarter. 
Turning now to Page 12. 
On this page, we highlight by segment the key factors that drove the overall $0.28 per share decrease in core earnings. Starting with Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution, third quarter year-over-year earnings decreased $0.26 per share, driven by a $0.24 per share change in the timing of interim period revenue recognition resulting from the Future Energy Jobs Act. This act modified the existing formulaic ratemaking by decoupling our distribution revenues from sales volumes. While this change is impacting quarterly comparisons, it will not affect full year earnings. The effects of decoupling also eliminated weather impacts in 2017. As a result, comparable earnings were down $0.02 per share as 2016 results benefited from warmer-than-normal summer temperatures. Finally, Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution third quarter 2017 earnings benefited from increased infrastructure investments as well as a higher allowed return on equity under formulaic ratemaking of 8.7% compared to 8.3% for the year-ago quarter. 
Next, Ameren Missouri third quarter year-over-year earnings decreased $0.02 per share, reflecting lower electric retail sales, primarily driven by milder summer temperatures, the absence of the 2016 performance incentive award for the 2013 to 2015 energy efficiency plan and higher depreciation expenses. These and other factors were mostly offset by new electric service rates effective April 1, which increased earnings $0.15 per share. The new rates were driven in part by increased infrastructure investments and removal of the negative effect of lower sales to the New Madrid smelter. 
Turning to Ameren Transmission, third quarter year-on-year earnings were comparable. The positive impact of increased transmission infrastructure investments at ATXI and Ameren Illinois, which both operate under constructive formulaic ratemaking, were offset by a lower average allowed return on equity of 10.8% in 2017 compared to an average of approximately 12.3% in the year-ago quarter. In 2016, our transmission segment benefited from a temporarily higher FERC-allowed ROE as a result of the expiration in May 2016 of the 15-month refund period for the second MISO ROE complaint case. This temporary benefit ended in September 2016 when the FERC adjusted MISOs base ROE to its current level. 
Before moving on, let me briefly cover electric sales trends for Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois distribution for the first 9 months of 2017 compared to the first 9 months of 2016. Weather normalized kilowatt-hour sales to Missouri residential and commercial customers on a combined basis were flat, excluding the effects of our Missouri energy efficiency plan under MIA. We exclude MIA effects because the plan provides rate recovery to ensure that earnings are not affected by reduced electric sales, resulting from our energy efficiency efforts. These sales results reflect underlying 2017 growth, offset by the absence of the 2016 leap day sales benefit. Kilowatt-hour sales to Missouri Industrial customers were also flat, excluding sales to the New Madrid smelter, which shut down operations during the first quarter of 2016. Weather normalized kilowatt-hour sales to Illinois residential and commercial customers on a combined basis decreased 1%, primarily driven by energy efficiency, while kilowatt-hour sales to Illinois industrial customers decreased 4%, primarily due to lower sales to a large, low margin processor of agricultural products. 
Recall the changes in electric sales in Illinois, no matter the cause, do not impact our earnings since the Future Energy Jobs Act provided full revenue decoupling beginning this year. 
Moving to Page 13 of our presentation. I would now like to discuss our 2017 earnings guidance. Today, we narrowed our GAAP guidance range to $2.67 to $2.81 per share, which includes the third quarter noncash tax-related charge of $0.06 per share, which I discussed earlier. Excluding this charge, we expect to deliver 2017 core earnings within a range of $2.73 to $2.87 per share, reflecting continued solid execution of our strategy, including continued disciplined cost management. This guidance assumes normal temperatures for the last 3 months of this year. 
Moving to the balance of the year, we list on this page select considerations that will affect the comparability of fourth quarter 2017 core earnings to last year's fourth quarter results. Some of the larger impacts include a change in the timing of interim period revenue recognition at Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution business, the fourth quarter Callaway refueling and maintenance outage and the 2017 Missouri Electric rate review settlement. 
Before moving on, I would like to mention that we expect Ameren Illinois to issue long-term debt before the end of the year to repay $250 million of maturing 6.125% senior secured notes and refinance short-term debt. 
Moving now to Page 14 for a discussion of select regulatory matters pending at the Illinois Commerce Commission and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. 
Ameren Illinois is supporting a $17 million decrease in the annual electric distribution revenue requirement in its required annual electric distribution rate update filing, consistent with the ICC staff's filed testimony. An ICC decision is expected in December of this year, with new rates effective early next year. 
Turning to the FERC, the second complaint case that seeks to reduce the base allowed ROE for MISO transmission owners, including Ameren Illinois and ATXI, remains pending. These FERC-regulated businesses are currently earning a 10.82% ROE, which includes a 50 basis point adder for MISO membership, and they will continue to do so pending the outcome of this case. While a quorum has been reestablished at the FERC, it remains uncertain when the commission will rule. In addition, in September, the MISO transmission owners, including Ameren Illinois and ATXI, filed a motion to dismiss the second complaint case maintaining that the current base ROE of 10.32% ordered by FERC in the first complaint case has not been shown to be unjust and unreasonable. Further, the MISO transmission owners believe the second complaint should be dismissed because the approach used by the complainants to argue that the ROE was unjust and unreasonable was rejected by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit in the New England case. The FERC is under no deadline to issue an order on the motion to dismiss. 
Facing a significant backlog of other cases, we expect that the FERC commissioners will take time to consider the court ruling in the New England case as well as the MISO transmission owners recent motion, as both may influence the FERC's order in the pending second MISO ROE complaint case. 
Turning now to Page 15 of our presentation and potential federal income tax reform. Ameren supports thoughtful, comprehensive tax reform, because we believe that lower corporate tax rates would drive economic growth and job creation, benefiting our customers, the communities we serve and other key stakeholders. We will continue to advocate for tax reform that would benefit stakeholders and that appropriately supports our industry's efforts to invest in our nation's critical energy infrastructure in an affordable manner. Earlier this year on our February earnings conference call, we shared with you our perspectives on potential financial considerations and impacts associated with tax reform elements under consideration at that time. As you know, yesterday, Republican leaders in the U.S. House of Representatives released a new comprehensive income tax reform proposal. Ameren, along with our industry colleagues, is still in the process of reviewing this proposal. While the debate on tax reform took another step forward yesterday, the timing and elements of tax reform, if ultimately successful, remain uncertain. We will remain actively engaged with our industry colleagues on this important policy matter in the weeks ahead. 
That said, regardless of whatever federal income tax law changes may be made, it is important to remember that our operations are fully rate-regulated, we have limited parent company debt and we have a robust pipeline of high-quality investment opportunities that can deliver strong, long-term benefits for our customers and shareholders. 
Turning to Page 16. We plan to provide 2018 earnings guidance when we release fourth quarter results in February of next year. However, using our 2017 guidance as a reference point, we have listed on this page select items to consider as you think about our earnings outlook for next year. Beginning with the first item listed: Earnings from our FERC-regulated electric earnings transmission activities are expected to benefit from additional investments in Ameren Illinois and ATXI projects made under forward-looking formulaic ratemaking. Ameren Transmission earnings would, of course, be affected by any change to the current allowed ROE of 10.82%. For Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution Service, earnings are expected to benefit in 2018 compared to 2017 from additional infrastructure investments made under Illinois formulaic ratemaking. The allowed ROE will be, of course, the average 2018 30-year treasury yield plus 5.8%. In addition, Ameren Illinois' gas distribution earnings are expected to benefit from qualified investments that are included in rates on a timely basis under the state's gas infrastructure rider. For Missouri, the 2018 earnings comparison is expected to be favorably affected in the first quarter of next year by increased Missouri Electric Service rates that took effect April 1 of 2017. In addition, we expect the absence of expenses associated with our fourth quarter 2017 Callaway nuclear refueling and maintenance outage to benefit 2018 earnings by approximately $0.08 per share compared to 2017. The next scheduled Callaway refueling and maintenance outage is in the spring of 2019. 
Further, a return to normal weather in 2018 would increase Ameren Missouri earnings by approximately $0.06 per share compared to 2017 results to date, assuming normal weather in the last quarter of this year, and we expect lower interest expense driven by the refinancing of debt in 2017 and 2018 to favorably impact 2018 results. 
Finally, we expect Ameren Missouri's 2018 results to also reflect regulatory lag associated with increased depreciation, transmission and property tax expenses. 
Turning to Page 17, I will summarize. We expect to deliver 2017 core earnings within a range of $2.73 to $2.87 per share as we continue to successfully execute our strategy. As Warner stated, as we look ahead, we continue to expect strong earnings per share growth, driven by strong rate-based growth and disciplined financial management. And Ameren's shares continue to offer investors an attractive yield based on our recently increased dividend. 
In total, we believe we offer investors an attractive total return story compared to our regulated utility peers. That concludes our prepared remarks. We now invite your questions."

Excluding the impacts of our energy efficiency programs, we've seen a little bit of growth there, offset by, as you know, we had the leap day benefit last year. So overall, flat there. Also in industrial class in Missouri, it was pretty flat as well. Over in the Illinois area, the weather normalized kilowatt-hour sales for residential and commercial was actually down about 1%. As you know, we increased the energy efficiency efforts this year, and I think that's being reflected in those lower sales. And then Illinois Industrial was down about 4%. As we noted on the call, it's certainly important to remember that in our Illinois service territory, we're fully decoupled today, based on the passage of the law of last December, where we increased our energy efficiency effort, but we also had decoupling associated with that. So those sales declines are not affecting the bottom line results."

So we're seeing a little bit of growth there. And we look at the economies -- of course, as you know this morning, I think nationally, the unemployment number came out at 4.1%. We've been staying a little actually south of that, a little better than that in Missouri; unemployment at 4% and, who knows, maybe a little bit less given the announcement today that, nationally, it moved down. And Illinois, unfortunately, has been a little higher, closer to 5%. So -- but overall, I would say the unemployment has followed national trends, and I would say overall, the economies in both states are fairly stable."

But we're still assessing that ourselves. And so the only thing, as I said during our talking points is that we understand the real benefits to customers, the environment and shareholders as a result of this plan, so we're very focused on it. And so we're going to work very hard to get our arms around this potential proposal as well as looking at the existing law within the state of Missouri and also being mindful that it is our desire to transition our generation portfolio to a cleaner, more diverse portfolio in a responsible fashion. All those things come together, and we expect then, as things move on, to be able to give a more comprehensive update on all of these things, certainly, in February, when we come and have our year-end conference call and give you a more forward-looking outlook for the next 5 years."

So if you look at on Slide 16, I think that you'll see that we gave a number of important drivers to think about as you think about 2018 and probably aren't going to go much beyond that.

But I think we've given you some really good specificity to hook into. Obviously, we've got this increased investment in Ameren Transmission, the rate base is clearly expected to go up next year from $2.5 billion to $2.9 billion next year. Andy, as you know, a little uncertainty around what the ROE will be next year. Right now, we're earning 10.8%, and we'll see when the FERC rules on the second complaint case and how they rule. We've got higher rate base expected next year at Ameren Illinois Electric, which is subject to formulaic ratemaking. The 30-year treasuries did rise over the course of this year. We'll see what happens over next year. Gas distribution business. While we don't have a rate case next year, we do get to formulaically adjust rates based on a rider there. I shouldn't say formulaically, but we get to adjust rates based on a rider there for infrastructure investments. About 50% of our CapEx qualifies for those adjustments, so that's a boost. And then we do get a little carryover next year from the rate increase that went into effect in Missouri this year in April. So we'll pick up a first quarter benefit next year, which we've quantified on Slide 16. There's no Callaway refueling outage next year. That's, of course, $0.08. We've had some negative weather this year. We've had about a $0.06 headwind from weather this year. We -- if we erase that next year and go to normal, that's another $0.06 pickup. And then as you mentioned, there's some other things, pluses and minuses. We expect lower interest. We talked about that on the last call. Refinancings that we did this year provide about a $15 million annual tailwind as it relates to earnings. Paul Ridzon asked earlier about some refinancings next year. I think the exact amount for next year is something like $380 million of Missouri refinancings. I didn't provide what we expect to be the coupon on the new debt, but with respect to the coupons on the debt we're replacing, it's, in one case, 5.1%, in another case, 6%. So we'll be refinancing that at whatever the prevailing rates are at the time. And then as you noted, there are always some headwinds that would be associated with some depreciation and would expect transmission and property tax headwinds as well. So we've provided, I think, a pretty comprehensive list of major earnings drivers for 2018."

We'll take -- we'll step back and we'll take a look at the overall cash flows associated with the business and then assess the best way forward to finance that. As Warner said in his prepared remarks, thinking about the credit metrics, credit ratings at the parent company, at the holding companies, the consolidated equity ratios, the cash flow metrics and how best to position, I would say, these incremental investments, too, for regulatory recovery and make those additive to shareholder value. So we'll take all of those factors into consideration and then think about the best path forward for financing those. Clearly, as I think you mentioned in the -- in your question, given the $10.8 billion current infrastructure investment plan that we've laid out earlier this year, given the strength of our balance sheet and credit metrics, we didn't expect to need any equity as it related to financing that plan."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. 
Before I begin my business update, I first want to express my deep appreciation to our coworkers and contractors who volunteered to leave their families to work tirelessly in very challenging conditions to restore power for those who experienced outages due to hurricanes impacting Texas and Florida. I'm particularly thankful that all of our coworkers returned home safely. The restoration efforts for hurricanes Harvey and Irma were just another example of the incredible teamwork and commitment to our customers that is so often displayed by our industry. Further, Ameren and our industry stand ready to support Puerto Rico in its hurricane restoration efforts. Our thoughts and prayers remain with those families who lost loved ones, their homes or were otherwise impacted by these devastating storms. 
Moving to our financial results, earlier today we announced third quarter 2017 core earnings of $1.24 per share compared to $1.52 per share earned in the third quarter of 2016. This year-over-year decline of $0.28 per share was largely driven by a $0.24 per share change and the timing of interim period revenue recognition at Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution, a matter which we highlighted earlier this year. This $0.24 timing-related decline in third quarter earnings will have no effect on full year earnings due to increases in revenue recognition in the first, second and fourth quarters this year compared to last. Marty will discuss this and other factors driving the quarterly results in more detail in a moment. 
I am also pleased to report that we remain on track to deliver strong core earnings results in 2017. This morning, we announced that we narrowed our 2017 core earnings guidance to a range of $2.73 to $2.87 per share. 
Moving to Page 5. Here, we reiterate our strategic plan, which we have been executing very well over the last several years. We remain focused on operating our businesses safely while strategically allocating capital and continuing to exercise disciplined cost management. We expect this strategic capital allocation, along with disciplined cost management that supports our goal of earning close to our allowed returns in all of our jurisdictions to result in solid long-term earnings growth. I am happy to report that in 2017, we have been successfully executing these key strategic actions across all of our businesses. 
As you can see on the right side of this page, during the first 9 months of this year, we invested nearly $1 billion, or 2/3 of total capital expenditures, in our transmission and distribution businesses, where investments are supported by regulatory frameworks that provide fair, predictable and timely cost recovery. 
Since our second quarter call, we achieved a couple of key milestones in the 100-mile Mark Twain transmission line in northeastern Missouri. To begin, ATXI's proposed alternative route for this project, which is nearly 100% colocated on existing rights-of-way, has received all 5 required county assents for road crossings. This was an important accomplishment that required extensive collaboration with many key stakeholders. As a result of achieving this important milestone, in mid-September, ATXI requested a certificate of convenience and necessity for the Mark Twain alternative route from the Missouri Public Service Commission, and we expect to receive a commission order in the first half of next year. There has been no change to the estimated $250 million project cost, and the planned in-service date remains late 2019. 
Turning now to Page 6. We also continued to invest in Ameren Illinois Electric and Natural Gas Distribution infrastructure projects. Through the end of September, Ameren Illinois had installed 560,000 smart electric meters and 290,000 gas meter modules that provide customers with enhanced energy usage data and access to programs to help them save on their energy bills. We are working to deploy these meters to all of our 1.2 million electric and 800,000 gas customers in Illinois by the end of 2019. Additional investments include natural gas distribution projects that upgrade our gas main infrastructure, and electric distribution projects that add smart grid technology and upgrade substations, all to improve the safety and reliability of our system.
Moving to Ameren Missouri. As you know, earlier this year, we achieved a constructive settlement in our electric rate view, which favorably impacted our third quarter results. From an operational perspective, the Callaway Energy Center began its scheduled refueling and maintenance outage in early October after completing a breaker-to-breaker run of 514 consecutive days, the second longest run in Callaway's history. The outage is progressing safety, on schedule and on budget. 
Shifting now to our legislative efforts in Missouri, we remain very focused on enhancing Missouri's regulatory framework to better support investment and its energy infrastructure. The growing body of evidence from across the country clearly shows that these modernized energy policies deliver significant long-term benefits to customers. Those benefits include a more reliable and smarter energy grid, a more secured grid to address potential cyber attacks and greater tools for customers to manage their energy usage. 
During the 2017 legislative session, we presented a thoughtful and robust energy infrastructure plan that included an incremental $1 billion in investment over 5 years and up to $4 billion over 10 years. Of course, these investments will also create thousands of good-quality jobs in the state of Missouri. The proposed legislation also included other strong economic development provisions and consumer protections to keep our already low electric rates affordable and competitive in the future. These factors have resulted in strong bipartisan support in the legislature to modernize Missouri's regulatory framework. As a result, we are leveraging the meaningful progress we have made over the last several legislative sessions and continue to work collaboratively with key stakeholders to chart a constructive path forward for our customers and the state of Missouri. And as we noted earlier this year, we expect to support a legislative initiative in 2018 to modernize Missouri's regulatory framework for electric utilities. Legislation can be filed as early as December 1, with the 2018 session officially beginning January 3 next year. 
Turning to Page 7 and Missouri's Integrated Resource Plan. In late September, Ameren Missouri filed a new IRP with the Missouri PSC, which it does every 3 years. This document details our assessment of the electric energy needs of our customers for the next 20 years and puts forward our preferred resource plan for meeting those needs. The 2017 IRP is consistent with our objective to transition our generation fleet to a cleaner, more diverse energy portfolio in a responsible fashion. Further, the IRP outlines a significant step change in our renewable energy portfolio due to the advancement of technologies and improved economics. Importantly, the IRP is consistent with the requirements of Missouri's renewable energy standard, which requires Ameren Missouri to source at least 15% of retail customer sales from renewable energy resources by 2021, subject to a 1% average annual limit on customer rate impacts. Our preferred plan calls for the addition of at least 700 megawatts of wind generation by 2020 and 100 megawatts of solar generation by 2027. After careful assessment, we believe it is in our customers' long-term best interest for Ameren Missouri to own these new wind resources, which represents a potential investment of approximately $1 billion. We have been working on this important undertaking for many months, but we still have more work in front of us to successfully execute our preferred plan. We are still completing due diligence on certain matters and are in negotiations with several developers, which will ultimately determine the source, location and cost for these projects. We also recognize that the comprehensive tax reform proposal, released yesterday, included revisions to the current production tax credit rules for wind generation. We expect that the proposed changes to the PTC rules will be the subject of much discussion by policymakers and key stakeholders over the next several weeks. While it remains uncertain whether these potential modifications to the PTC rules will become law as well as tax reform in general, we will, of course, assess the potential implications of these changes on our plan, if any. 
Ownership will also require Ameren Missouri to secure certificates of need from the Missouri PSC for each location as well as regional transmission organization interconnection agreements. We are excited about the customer and environmental benefits as well as the potential significant investment and growth opportunities outlined in our preferred plan. As you know, we are very strategic when it comes to managing and financing our capital plan in order to deliver long-term benefits for our customers and shareholders. As a result, we will carefully assess our prospective infrastructure investment plans in the context of this potential $1 billion wind investment. Our current infrastructure investment plan does not include any expenditures for renewable energy. 
We will also carefully consider the best long-term financing plan for this potential investment. Of course, we remain committed to maintaining strong equity ratios and credit metrics at our utilities and on a consolidated basis. We will also assess the best approach to recover the cost of and return on these potential investments under Missouri's regulatory framework. One tool is a cost recovery mechanism that is already included in the Missouri renewable energy standard. It is a rider mechanism that is specifically designed to address the revenue requirement impacts resulting from complying with the renewable energy standard. The use of this rider mechanism would require approval by the Missouri PSC. It is premature to go into more detail on all of these matters at this time. However, we plan to provide further updates to you during our year-end conference call in February 2018. 
Before I move off this subject, I would also note that Ameren Missouri has established CO2 emission reduction goals from its generation fleet of 35% by 2030, 50% by 2040 and 80% by 2050. 
In summary, our Integrated Resource Plan is a forward-thinking plan that is a win-win-win for customers, the environment and our shareholders. Rest assured, we are very focused on executing this important opportunity for all of our stakeholders. 
Turning now to Page 8 and the current 5-year plan. In February, we outlined our investment plan that included $10.8 billion of regulated infrastructure investment as well as 6% compound annual rate-based growth from 2016 through 2021, reflecting greater levels of capital allocated to those jurisdictions with more constructive regulatory frameworks. To be clear, this plan does not include the potential $1 billion investment in wind generation outlined in Missouri's IRP that I just discussed. It also does not include potential additional investments, $1 billion over 5 years and up to $4 billion over 10 years, that could be enabled by constructive Missouri legislation. As we look to the future, the successful execution of our robust 5-year plan is not only focused on delivering strong results through 2021, it is also designed to position Ameren for success over the next decade and beyond. With this long-term view in mind, we are already making significant investments in our Illinois electric and gas utilities that will position us for success, including those in smart meters, digital technologies and other infrastructure due to supportive regulatory frameworks. And as we have mentioned, we have identified similar significant Missouri grid modernization investments we would undertake with improvement in the Missouri regulatory framework. The bottom line is that we are taking steps today across the board to position Ameren for success in the next decade and beyond, and we believe we have a strong, high-quality and sustainable pipeline of investment opportunities that would benefit customers, communities we serve and shareholders. 
Turning now to Page 9 to conclude my remarks. In February, we affirmed our expectation for earnings per share growth of 5% to 8% compounded annually from 2016 to 2020 based on the adjusted 2016 guidance midpoint we outlined early last year. This was driven by robust 6% compound annual rate-based growth from 2016 through 2021. We consider both our rate base and earnings growth outlooks to be attractive compared to our regulated utility peers. 
Ameren also continues to offer investors a solid dividend. Last month, Ameren's Board of Directors expressed its confidence in our long-term growth plan by increasing the dividend by 4%. Of course, future dividend decisions will be driven by earnings growth, cash flows and other business conditions. 
To summarize, we believe our strong rate base and earnings growth profile, combined with our solid dividend, currently providing a yield of approximately 3%, results in an attractive total return opportunity for shareholders compared to our regulated utility peers. We remain focused on executing our strategy, and I am firmly convinced that doing so will deliver superior value to our shareholders, customers and the communities we serve. 
Again, thank you all for joining us today, and I'll now turn the call over to Marty. Marty?"

Excluding a third quart",1847,"Thanks, Warner, and good morning, everyone. Turning now to Page 11 of our presentation. 
Today, we reported third quarter 2017 GAAP earnings of $1.18 per share compared to GAAP earnings of $1.52 per share for the year-ago quarter. Excluding a third quarter 2017 noncore, noncash charge of $0.06 per share at the parent company for the reevaluation of deferred taxes, Ameren reported third quarter core earnings of $1.24 per share. This charge was the result of an increase in Illinois' corporate income tax rate to 9.5% from 7.75% effective July 1 of this year. Beyond this charge, we do not expect the tax increase to have a material prospective impact on consolidated earnings. 
Finally, as you can see on this page, there was no difference between GAAP and core results for last year's third quarter. 
Turning now to Page 12. 
On this page, we highlight by segment the key factors that drove the overall $0.28 per share decrease in core earnings. Starting with Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution, third quarter year-over-year earnings decreased $0.26 per share, driven by a $0.24 per share change in the timing of interim period revenue recognition resulting from the Future Energy Jobs Act. This act modified the existing formulaic ratemaking by decoupling our distribution revenues from sales volumes. While this change is impacting quarterly comparisons, it will not affect full year earnings. The effects of decoupling also eliminated weather impacts in 2017. As a result, comparable earnings were down $0.02 per share as 2016 results benefited from warmer-than-normal summer temperatures. Finally, Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution third quarter 2017 earnings benefited from increased infrastructure investments as well as a higher allowed return on equity under formulaic ratemaking of 8.7% compared to 8.3% for the year-ago quarter. 
Next, Ameren Missouri third quarter year-over-year earnings decreased $0.02 per share, reflecting lower electric retail sales, primarily driven by milder summer temperatures, the absence of the 2016 performance incentive award for the 2013 to 2015 energy efficiency plan and higher depreciation expenses. These and other factors were mostly offset by new electric service rates effective April 1, which increased earnings $0.15 per share. The new rates were driven in part by increased infrastructure investments and removal of the negative effect of lower sales to the New Madrid smelter. 
Turning to Ameren Transmission, third quarter year-on-year earnings were comparable. The positive impact of increased transmission infrastructure investments at ATXI and Ameren Illinois, which both operate under constructive formulaic ratemaking, were offset by a lower average allowed return on equity of 10.8% in 2017 compared to an average of approximately 12.3% in the year-ago quarter. In 2016, our transmission segment benefited from a temporarily higher FERC-allowed ROE as a result of the expiration in May 2016 of the 15-month refund period for the second MISO ROE complaint case. This temporary benefit ended in September 2016 when the FERC adjusted MISOs base ROE to its current level. 
Before moving on, let me briefly cover electric sales trends for Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois distribution for the first 9 months of 2017 compared to the first 9 months of 2016. Weather normalized kilowatt-hour sales to Missouri residential and commercial customers on a combined basis were flat, excluding the effects of our Missouri energy efficiency plan under MIA. We exclude MIA effects because the plan provides rate recovery to ensure that earnings are not affected by reduced electric sales, resulting from our energy efficiency efforts. These sales results reflect underlying 2017 growth, offset by the absence of the 2016 leap day sales benefit. Kilowatt-hour sales to Missouri Industrial customers were also flat, excluding sales to the New Madrid smelter, which shut down operations during the first quarter of 2016. Weather normalized kilowatt-hour sales to Illinois residential and commercial customers on a combined basis decreased 1%, primarily driven by energy efficiency, while kilowatt-hour sales to Illinois industrial customers decreased 4%, primarily due to lower sales to a large, low margin processor of agricultural products. 
Recall the changes in electric sales in Illinois, no matter the cause, do not impact our earnings since the Future Energy Jobs Act provided full revenue decoupling beginning this year. 
Moving to Page 13 of our presentation. I would now like to discuss our 2017 earnings guidance. Today, we narrowed our GAAP guidance range to $2.67 to $2.81 per share, which includes the third quarter noncash tax-related charge of $0.06 per share, which I discussed earlier. Excluding this charge, we expect to deliver 2017 core earnings within a range of $2.73 to $2.87 per share, reflecting continued solid execution of our strategy, including continued disciplined cost management. This guidance assumes normal temperatures for the last 3 months of this year. 
Moving to the balance of the year, we list on this page select considerations that will affect the comparability of fourth quarter 2017 core earnings to last year's fourth quarter results. Some of the larger impacts include a change in the timing of interim period revenue recognition at Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution business, the fourth quarter Callaway refueling and maintenance outage and the 2017 Missouri Electric rate review settlement. 
Before moving on, I would like to mention that we expect Ameren Illinois to issue long-term debt before the end of the year to repay $250 million of maturing 6.125% senior secured notes and refinance short-term debt. 
Moving now to Page 14 for a discussion of select regulatory matters pending at the Illinois Commerce Commission and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. 
Ameren Illinois is supporting a $17 million decrease in the annual electric distribution revenue requirement in its required annual electric distribution rate update filing, consistent with the ICC staff's filed testimony. An ICC decision is expected in December of this year, with new rates effective early next year. 
Turning to the FERC, the second complaint case that seeks to reduce the base allowed ROE for MISO transmission owners, including Ameren Illinois and ATXI, remains pending. These FERC-regulated businesses are currently earning a 10.82% ROE, which includes a 50 basis point adder for MISO membership, and they will continue to do so pending the outcome of this case. While a quorum has been reestablished at the FERC, it remains uncertain when the commission will rule. In addition, in September, the MISO transmission owners, including Ameren Illinois and ATXI, filed a motion to dismiss the second complaint case maintaining that the current base ROE of 10.32% ordered by FERC in the first complaint case has not been shown to be unjust and unreasonable. Further, the MISO transmission owners believe the second complaint should be dismissed because the approach used by the complainants to argue that the ROE was unjust and unreasonable was rejected by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit in the New England case. The FERC is under no deadline to issue an order on the motion to dismiss. 
Facing a significant backlog of other cases, we expect that the FERC commissioners will take time to consider the court ruling in the New England case as well as the MISO transmission owners' recent motion, as both may influence the FERC's order in the pending second MISO ROE complaint case. 
Turning now to Page 15 of our presentation and potential federal income tax reform. Ameren supports thoughtful, comprehensive tax reform, because we believe that lower corporate tax rates would drive economic growth and job creation, benefiting our customers, the communities we serve and other key stakeholders. We will continue to advocate for tax reform that would benefit stakeholders and that appropriately supports our industry's efforts to invest in our nation's critical energy infrastructure in an affordable manner. Earlier this year on our February earnings conference call, we shared with you our perspectives on potential financial considerations and impacts associated with tax reform elements under consideration at that time. As you know, yesterday, Republican leaders in the U.S. House of Representatives released a new comprehensive income tax reform proposal. Ameren, along with our industry colleagues, is still in the process of reviewing this proposal. While the debate on tax reform took another step forward yesterday, the timing and elements of tax reform, if ultimately successful, remain uncertain. We will remain actively engaged with our industry colleagues on this important policy matter in the weeks ahead. 
That said, regardless of whatever federal income tax law changes may be made, it is important to remember that our operations are fully rate-regulated, we have limited parent company debt and we have a robust pipeline of high-quality investment opportunities that can deliver strong, long-term benefits for our customers and shareholders. 
Turning to Page 16. We plan to provide 2018 earnings guidance when we release fourth quarter results in February of next year. However, using our 2017 guidance as a reference point, we have listed on this page select items to consider as you think about our earnings outlook for next year. Beginning with the first item listed: Earnings from our FERC-regulated electric earnings transmission activities are expected to benefit from additional investments in Ameren Illinois and ATXI projects made under forward-looking formulaic ratemaking. Ameren Transmission earnings would, of course, be affected by any change to the current allowed ROE of 10.82%. For Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution Service, earnings are expected to benefit in 2018 compared to 2017 from additional infrastructure investments made under Illinois formulaic ratemaking. The allowed ROE will be, of course, the average 2018 30-year treasury yield plus 5.8%. In addition, Ameren Illinois' gas distribution earnings are expected to benefit from qualified investments that are included in rates on a timely basis under the state's gas infrastructure rider. For Missouri, the 2018 earnings comparison is expected to be favorably affected in the first quarter of next year by increased Missouri Electric Service rates that took effect April 1 of 2017. In addition, we expect the absence of expenses associated with our fourth quarter 2017 Callaway nuclear refueling and maintenance outage to benefit 2018 earnings by approximately $0.08 per share compared to 2017. The next scheduled Callaway refueling and maintenance outage is in the spring of 2019. 
Further, a return to normal weather in 2018 would increase Ameren Missouri earnings by approximately $0.06 per share compared to 2017 results to date, assuming normal weather in the last quarter of this year, and we expect lower interest expense driven by the refinancing of debt in 2017 and 2018 to favorably impact 2018 results. 
Finally, we expect Ameren Missouri's 2018 results to also reflect regulatory lag associated with increased depreciation, transmission and property tax expenses. 
Turning to Page 17, I will summarize. We expect to deliver 2017 core earnings within a range of $2.73 to $2.87 per share as we continue to successfully execute our strategy. As Warner stated, as we look ahead, we continue to expect strong earnings per share growth, driven by strong rate-based growth and disciplined financial management. And Ameren's shares continue to offer investors an attractive yield based on our recently increased dividend. 
In total, we believe we offer investors an attractive total return story compared to our regulated utility peers. That concludes our prepared remarks. We now invite your questions."

Excluding the impacts of our energy efficiency programs, we've seen a little bit of growth there, offset by, as you know, we had the leap day benefit last year. So overall, flat there. Also in industrial class in Missouri, it was pretty flat as well. Over in the Illinois area, the weather normalized kilowatt-hour sales for residential and commercial was actually down about 1%. As you know, we increased the energy efficiency efforts this year, and I think that's being reflected in those lower sales. And then Illinois Industrial was down about 4%. As we noted on the call, it's certainly important to remember that in our Illinois service territory, we're fully decoupled today, based on the passage of the law of last December, where we increased our energy efficiency effort, but we also had decoupling associated with that. So those sales declines are not affecting the bottom line results."

We've been staying a little actually south of that, a little better than that in Missouri; unemployment at 4% and, who knows, maybe a little bit less given the announcement today that, nationally, it moved down. And Illinois, unfortunately, has been a little higher, closer to 5%. So -- but overall, I would say the unemployment has followed national trends, and I would say overall, the economies in both states are fairly stable."

And those both have concluded. I would say, in general, they were pretty positive and supportive of what we're trying to do in varying degrees. But overall, supported the idea of modernizing the grid, the benefits for customers and the need for some regulatory reform in the state of Missouri to make that happen."

But I think we've given you some really good specificity to hook into. Obviously, we've got this increased investment in Ameren Transmission, the rate base is clearly expected to go up next year from $2.5 billion to $2.9 billion next year. Andy, as you know, a little uncertainty around what the ROE will be next year. Right now, we're earning 10.8%, and we'll see when the FERC rules on the second complaint case and how they rule. We've got higher rate base expected next year at Ameren Illinois Electric, which is subject to formulaic ratemaking. The 30-year treasuries did rise over the course of this year. We'll see what happens over next year. Gas distribution business. While we don't have a rate case next year, we do get to formulaically adjust rates based on a rider there. I shouldn't say formulaically, but we get to adjust rates based on a rider there for infrastructure investments. About 50% of our CapEx qualifies for those adjustments, so that's a boost. And then we do get a little carryover next year from the rate increase that went into effect in Missouri this year in April. So we'll pick up a first quarter benefit next year, which we've quantified on Slide 16. There's no Callaway refueling outage next year. That's, of course, $0.08. We've had some negative weather this year. We've had about a $0.06 headwind from weather this year. We -- if we erase that next year and go to normal, that's another $0.06 pickup. And then as you mentioned, there's some other things, pluses and minuses. We expect lower interest. We talked about that on the last call. Refinancings that we did this year provide about a $15 million annual tailwind as it relates to earnings. Paul Ridzon asked earlier about some refinancings next year. I think the exact amount for next year is something like $380 million of Missouri refinancings. I didn't provide what we expect to be the coupon on the new debt, but with respect to the coupons on the debt we're replacing, it's, in one case, 5.1%, in another case, 6%. So we'll be refinancing that at whatever the prevailing rates are at the time. And then as you noted, there are always some headwinds that would be associated with some depreciation and would expect transmission and property tax headwinds as well. So we've provided, I think, a pretty comprehensive list of major earnings drivers for 2018."

I think that's it's not probably a clear bright line that I'd tell you, Kevin. I mean, I think what we'll do with, whether we have additional CapEx due to the Integrated Resource Plan or we have additional CapEx due to other legislative efforts or other factors, we'll take a look -- we'll step back, and we'll take a look at the overall infrastructure investment plan. We'll take -- we'll step back and we'll take a look at the overall cash flows associated with the business and then assess the best way forward to finance that. As Warner said in his prepared remarks, thinking about the credit metrics, credit ratings at the parent company, at the holding companies, the consolidated equity ratios, the cash flow metrics and how best to position, I would say, these incremental investments, too, for regulatory recovery and make those additive to shareholder value. So we'll take all of those factors into consideration and then think about the best path forward for financing those. Clearly, as I think you mentioned in the -- in your question, given the $10.8 billion current infrastructure investment plan that we've laid out earlier this year, given the strength of our balance sheet and credit metrics, we didn't expect to need any equity as it related to financing that plan."

So as you know, there's the second complaint case that's outstanding. The ALJ, in that particular case, had ruled that we should perhaps move down from a 10.8% overall ROE, which includes the 50 basis point adder down to 10.2% with the 50 basis point adder. As we said on the call, we've made filings to suggest that, that second complaint case should be dismissed for the reasons we discussed on the call, and it's uncertain when the FERC, even though they've got a quorum now, will rule on the second complaint case. So until that time that they do rule and until such time as they would tell us to change the ROE, we will continue to book to a 10.8%. I would mention that for about a 15-month period after the second complaint case was filed, we did accrue a reserve of about $40 million for the potential that the ROE would be lowered to 10.2% in that we would need to refund that money. So we got that reserve set up, to the extent that the FERC would rule consistent with the ALJ. But as I've mentioned, again, it's uncertain what the FERC will do, actually, at this point in time."
